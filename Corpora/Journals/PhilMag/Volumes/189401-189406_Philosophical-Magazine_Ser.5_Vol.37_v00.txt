 I. Note on tlie Generalizations of Van der Waals regarding
    " Corresponding'' Temperatures, Pressures, and Volumes.
    By Sydney Young, B.Sc, F.R.S., Professor of Chemistry,
    University College, Bristol*.
 IN a paper read before the Physical Society in November
       1891, and published under the above title in the Philo
 sophical Magazine for February 1892 (xxxiii. p. 153), the
 absolute temperatures and the molecular volumes (as liquid
and saturated vapour) of eleven compounds were compared with
 those of fluorbenzene at a series of corresponding pressures.
    It was pointed out, however (p. 155), that a better mode
 of procedure in many respects would have been to give the
temperatures, pressures, and volumes of each of the twelve
substances in terms of its critical constants ; but as the
critical volumes of several of the compounds had not been
directly determined, and as none of them were known with
accuracy, the method had to be abandoned.
   Since then it has been shown by M. Mathias that the
critical densities— and therefore the volumes—may be deter
mined with great accuracy by the method of Cailletet aud

2    "Corresponding" Temperatures, Pressures, and Volumes.
Mathias, and as the values calculated by M. Mathias differed
very slightly from those obtained independently by the same
method by myself, I accepted these values as correct (Phil.
Mag. Dec. 1892). It appears, however, that there were
a few small errors in the calculations, and I have tberefore
 adopted my own values in the tables that follow. The new
critical molecular volumes and those previously accepted as
 correct are given below ; it will be seen that the alterations
are very small.

    The vapour-pressures, molecular volumes, and critical
 constants of ten esters [methyl formate, acetate, propionate,
 butyrate, and isobutyrate ; ethyl formate, acetate, and pro
 pionate ; propyl formate and acetate] have recently been
 determined by Mr. G. L. Thomas and myself, and the abso
 lute temperatures, pressures, and volumes of each substance
 have been given in terms of its critical constants (Trans.
 Chem. Soc. Ixiii. p. 1191).
    In order to allow of a comparison being made, pressures
 " corresponding " with the previous ones (with a few omis
 sions) were taken, and I now propose to give the absolute
 temperatures and volumes of the substances previously studied
 in terms of their critical constants. As the data for the
 esters are published in full in the Trans. Chem. Soc, it is
 unnecessary to reproduce them here, and it will be sufficient
to give the extreme values for the ten esters in each case.

6          Prof. Sydney Young on 11 Corresponding"
    It was pointed out in the earlier paper on this subject
 (Phil. Mag. xxxiii. p. 172) that the compounds investigated
might be arranged in groups, and th» k confirmed by the
method of comparison now adopted. The twenty-two com
pounds appear to fall into four chief groups :—
      I. Benzene and its halogen derivatives, carbon tetra
           chloride, stannic chloride, ether.
     II. The three alcohols (methyl alcohol differing, however,
           considerably from the others).
   III. Acetic acid.
    IV. The ten esters.
    Ratios of Absolute Temperatures at Corresponding Pressures
 to Absolute Critical Temperatures.—The ratios for the com
pounds in groups I. are the lowest ; those for the esters are
mostly higher; acetic acid comes next in order; whilst the
values for the alcohols are much higher than for any of the
other substances.
    In the first group the differences are not great, but the
ratios for benzene and carbon ¦tetrachloride are below, and
those for stannic chloride and ether at low pressures are
somewhat above the average. The influence of molecular
weight and constitution on the ratios for the esters is fully
discussed in the paper by Mr. Thomas and myself (Trans.
Chem. Soc. Ixiii. p. 1252), and it will be sufficient here to
mention that there is a marked rise as the molecular weight
increases. This is not the case, however, with the ratios of
the volumes of liquid or of saturated vapour to the critical
volumes. All the ratios appear to depend to some extent on
the constitution of the esters.
   Ratios of Volumes of Liquid at Corresponding Pressures to
Critical Volumes.—The differences in this case are small ; in
general the ratios for acetic acid are the highest, and those
tor the esters the lowest. At the lowest pressures the values
for the alcohols are higher than for the esters, but at high
pressures they are lower than for any of the other substances,
and this is especially the case with methyl alcohol.
   Ratios of Volumes of Saturated Vapour at Corresponding
Pressures to Critical Volumes. — The grouping of the com
pounds is well seen in this case, the differences being naturally
most marked at low pressures. Acetic acid stands quite
alone with the lowest ratios, whilst the alcohols, and especially
methyl alcohol, have much higher ratios than the other
compounds. Of the remaining substances the esters have
higher values than the members of the first group.
   There is little doubt that the low ratios for acetic acid are
due to the existence of complex molecules in the saturated

             Temperatures, Pressures, and Volumes.              7
vapour at low temperatures. The densities of the saturated
vapours of the alcohols, on the other hand, are normal at low
temperatures, and complex molecules cannot, therefore, be
present; but there is considerable evidence of their existence
in the liquid state.
   Ramsay and Shields (Phil. Trans. 184 a. p. 647 ; Trans.
Chem. Soc. Ixiii. p. 1089) have recently studied the surface-
energy of a large number of compounds, and have described
a method by which the molecular complexity of liquids may
be ascertained. They show that most of the liquids investi
gated have the same molecular weight in the liquid as in the
gaseous state, but that there is greater molecular complexity
in the liquid state in the case of the fatty acids and
alcohols. As regards homologous compounds—both acids and
alcohols—the complexity diminishes with rise of molecular
weight, and as regards individual compounds it diminishes
with rise of temperature; in order of complexity methyl
alcohol comes next to acetic acid.
   These conclusions, based on totally different considerations,
agree perfectly with those suggested in this paper and in the
previous one on the same subject.
   An explanation of the relatively high molecular volumes of
the saturated vapour of the alcohols at low temperatures
would be afforded by the assumption that complex molecules
exist to some extent at the critical points, an assumption
which is supported by the high critical densities.
   It has been shown (Phil. Mag. Nov. 1890, p. 423) that if
the generalizations of Van der Waals were strictly true, the
following relation should be true for all substances :—
                        v_V_T £
                       v'~Y'~TX p'
where v and v' are the molecular volumes of saturated vapour,
V and V those of liquid, and T and T the boiling-points on
the absolute scale of temperature of any two substances at
corresponding pressures p and p'. This relation should hold
good at the critical point, or
                         PV
                         -ijr= constant,
where P, V, and T are the critical pressure, the critical
molecular volume, and the absolute critical temperature of any
substance. As the critical volumes are now known, it is possible
to test this relation at the critical points of the various com-
                           PV

     Here, again, the grouping of the compounds is well
marked : acetic acid has by far the lowest value of -ss- (and
the highest density ratio) ; the alcohols come next in order,
the values for methyl alcohol standing about midway between
those for the other alcohols and acetic acid ; tbe esters
agree well together, the values of PV being in every case
lower than for the members of the first group.
II. On the Separation of Three Liquids by Fractional Dis
     tillation. By Professor F. R. Barrell, M.A., B.Se.,
     G. L. Thomas, B.Sc, and Professor Sydney Young,
    D.Sc., F.R.S., University College, Bristol*.
IT is well known that the separation by fractional distillation
        of two substances which are miscible in all proportions
and which do not—like propyl alcohol and w ater or formic
acid and water—form mixtures of constant boiling-point, is
usually a simple matter if there is a considerable difference
in their boiling-points. The facility with which the sepa
ration can be effected depends, in fact, chiefly on this
difference.
    » Communicated by the Physical Society : read November 10, 1893.

   Separation of Three Liquids by Fractional Distillation.                   9
   When, however, we have to deal with a mixture of three
substances, the difficulty is greatly enhanced, and if the
hoiling-points are not far apart it may be almost, if not quite
impossible to separate any quantity of the middle substance
in a state of purity by the ordinary methods of fractional
distillation.
    The variation in the composition of the distillate from a
mixture of two substances, the boiling-point of which rises con
stantly during the distillation, has been carefully investigated
by F. D. Brown (Trans. Chem. Soc. 1879, p. 550 ; 1880, pp. 49
& 304 ; 1881, p. 517)*; and his results may be briefly stated
as follows :—Calling the relative weights of the two liquids
at any instant in the still Wj and W2, the relative weights at
the same moment in the vapour (and therefore in the distil
late at this instant coming over from the mixture Wj + Wg)
 Xi and #1, and the vapour-pressures of the pure substances at
 the boiling-point of the mixture, Pj and P2, the composition
of the instantaneous distillate is given approximately by the
equation
                               ^_Wi P,

                                                            p
but by substituting a constant, c, for the ratio -p- , thus
                                 .?2~c'\vy
a still better result is obtained.
   • For an account of the experimental work and of the theoretical
 conclusions relating to the distillation of pairs of liquid that are (a) non-
miscible, (6) miscible within limits, (c) miscible in all proportions, the
article by one of us on " Distillation " in Thorpe's ' Dictionary of Applied
Chemistry ' mav be consulted. Pairs of liquids belonging to the first and
second classes "boil at a lower temperature than even the more volatile
component when distilled alone, and no separation can be effected by
fractional distillation. Among those in the third class there are some
from which only one of the two substances can be so separated ; in each
case of this kind there is a particular mixture (the composition of which
varies to some extent with the pressure) which distils at a constant tem
perature without change of composition, and it is this mixture that would
be separated by fractional distillation from that one of the pure substances
which is present in excess. In some cases—such as propyl alcohol and
water—the mixture of constant boiling-point and composition boils at a
lower temperature than either of the liquids when distilled alone; in
other cases—for example, formic acid and water—this mixture has a
higher boiling-point than either component.
   It is only when the boiling-point of every possible mixture lies between
those of the components that both liquids can be separated by fractional
distillation ; it is only to such cases that Brown's law is applicable, and,
in the case of three liquids, it is only such mixtures that are considered
in this paper.

10         Messrs. Barrell, Thomas, and Young on the
               p would, of course, vary to some extent during
   The ratio ^j
the distillation ; the value of the constant, c, does not differ
                                           p
greatly from the mean value of the ratio p .
                                             !.
   This equation of Brown's may be written in the form
                                 =c
                             dt)
where f= residue of liquid A at any instant,
   ,1 v=           »          B         ,,
   Taking L and M as the weights of A and B originally
present, and L + M = l, we obtain by integration
             ^{C+(i-%rw(i-*r'(i-.!/r,
where iy=quantity of the more volatile liquid A in unit weight
of the distillate coming over at tho instant when x is the
quantity of liquid distilled.
   By means of this equation we may trace the changes of
composition that take place in the course of a distillation,
and the variation in the composition of the distillate may be
represented graphically.
   To take a very simple case, let us suppose that c = 2, and
that L=M = i
                               Fisr. 1.
    In the diagram (fig. 1) the amounts of distillate that have

   Separation of Three Liquids by Fractional Distillation.     11
been collected are represented as abscissa?, and the relative
quantities of the two liquids A and B in the distillate at any
moment as ordinates.
   It will be seen that the composition of the distillate alters
slowly at first, then more and more rapidly, also that while
the first portion of the distillate contains a considerable
amount of the less volatile substance B, the last portion is
very nearly free from the lower-boiling component A. These
points are fully confirmed by experiment.
   By fractionating a few times in the ordinary way, collect
ing the distillates in six or eight fractions, we shall have a
very large excess of A in the first fraction, and of B in the
last.
   Suppose now that we have two of these fractions, one con
taining A and B in the ratio of 9 : 1, and the other in the
            Fig. 2.                                  Fig. 3.
ratio of 1 : 9, and that we distil these fractions separately and
completely ; the results will then be represented by figs. 2
and 3.
   In making use of this formula it is assumed that no con
densation (and therefore no fractionation) goes on in the
still-head, but that the vapour reaches the condenser in the
same state as when first evolved from the liquid in the still.
It is obvious that by using a long still-head or a dephlegmator
a more rapid separation would be effected.
   In any case it is evident that after a sufficient number of
fractionations, the first portion of the distillate from the first

12         Messrs. Barrell, Thomas, and Young on the
fraction will be free from B, while the residue from the last
fraction will be free from A.
   Suppose now that our mixture contains a third substance,
C, the boiling-point of which is higher than that of B.
   It may be conjectured that in the progress of the distilla
tion, the composition of the distillate at any instant will be
analogous to that determined experimentally by Brown in the
case of two liquids : namely, " the proportion of the three
substances in the vapour forming the instantaneous distillate
is the same as that of the weights of the three substances in
the residue in the still, each weight being multiplied by a
suitable constant which is roughly proportional to the vapour-
pressure of the corresponding liquid.'
   With this assumption it is easy, as in the case of two liquids,
to calculate curves representing graphically the progress of
the distillation.
   Let f, v, f = weights of the three liquids in the still at
                        any instant ;
      dij, dv, rff = weights of the three substances in the
                        instantaneous distillate.

which is richest in B, the middle liquid, the amount of B
rises merely from '39, its initial value, to ahout "45, its value
for the fifth which is collected just after the first half ("5 to
¦7). It is curious that in each of these distillations B rises to

  16         Messrs. Barrell, Thomas, and Young on the
  practically the same maximum value, viz. "45, the effect of
  the varying richness of the frnctions in regard to B being
  merely to widen out or contract the B curve.
     III. a a, III. 8" cd," lll.ee represent the distillation of
 those fractions of II. which are richest in A, B, and C
  respectively, and give some indication of the processes going
  on at the important stages of the third fractionation. In
 these A rises from '7 to *82, B from -45 to -5, C from -9 to
  "98. Here we notice that, owing to the small amount of C
 present in III. aa (whose original composition is A '696,
  B *239, and C "065), B attains a higher maximum ("525) than
  it does ('496) in III. Scd, which is far richer in B originally
  [A -182, B -44, C -378].
     P represents a distillation at an advanced stage of the
 fractionations—of a fraction rich in B. Its initial composi
 tion is A -02, B -9H, C -02. B is only advanced from -96 to
 •97 at the most favourable part of the curve, and is nowhere
 very free from C ; this points to the difficulty of obtaining B
 in a pure state by the ordinary method of fractionation.
     The calculations for III. 8 cd are appended as a specimen of
 the system employed (see table opposite): with the aid of the
 slide-rule they are very quickly effected.
     Apart from the consideration of the above hypothesis and
 formulae, it is clear that after five or six fractional distillations,
 carried out in the ordinary manner (but with a larger number
of fractions than when only two substances are present), the
first fraction will contain a large excess of A, a little of B,
but very little, if any, of C ; the middle fraction will con
tain an excess of B with moderate quantities of both A
and C ; the last fraction will consist almost entirely of C, the
quantity of A, if present at all, being much smaller than that
of B.
    Now let us suppose that these fractions are distilled sepa
rately and completely. The first portion of the distillate
from the first fraction will consist of A in a nearly pure state,
and, even if it contains a little of B, will be free from C. Of
the middle fraction the middle portion (or probably a rather
later one) will be purest, but will contain a little of both A
and C. The purest part of the last fraction will be the last
portion (the residue in the still) and will be quite free from
A though it may contain a little of B.
    By proceeding with the fractionation in the usual manner
we could obtain A and C in a pure state by separating each
time the first small portion of the first distillate and the
residue from the last distillate ; but we should have to carry
the fractionation a very great deal farther before we could
obtain B in a state of purity. We should, in fact, have to

18         Messrs. Barrell, Thomas, and Young on the
reduce the quantitities of A and C in this fraction until they
both disappeared from the middle portion of the distillate,
and an idea of the difficulty of attaining such a result may be
gathered from the diagram P.
    With substances whose boiling-points are not very far
apart the rise of temperature during such a distillation would
be almost imperceptible, and in the fractionation it would be
necessary to collect a large number of fractions above and
below the true boiling-point of B with very small tempera
ture-ranges. It would be necessary also to read the tempera
ture with extreme care, and to make very accurate corrections
 for changes of the barometer (which would be impossible
 unless the vapour-pressures of the substance had previously
been determined).
    It has been pointed out, however, that after the mixture
has been fractionated a few times, the first portion of the
first distillate is free from C, while the residue from the last
distillate is free from A. If, therefore, after the fifth or sixth
fractionation we remove these first and last portions each
time, we shall gradually accumulate two quantities of liquid,
one (the first portions) containing only A and B, the other
 (the residues) only B and C, and these may be separately
fractionated in the ordinary way.
    It is to be noticed also that as a quantity of liquid is
removed each time, the total amount to be distilled, and
therefore the time required for the distillation, gradually
diminishes.
    In arranging the fractions—as regards temperature—it is
advisable, if the true boiling-points of the liquids are known,
to take these temperatures and also the middle temperatures
between the boiling-points of A and B and of B and C as
definite points, and to arrange the fractions as far as possible
symmetrically about these points. There will thus be frac
tions of small and diminishing temperature-range above and
below the boiling-point of B—and at the boiling-points of A
and C after a few fractionations and until these substances
are to a large extent eliminated —and fractions of large and
increasing temperature-range above and below the two middle
temperatures.
    As tho preliminary fractionation proceeds, more and more
of A and C will be eliminated, so that after a time the boiling-
point of the first portion of the lowest fraction will gradually
rise, while that of the residue from the last fraction will
gradually fall until either A or C disappear, or, if we proceed
still further, until we have nothing but B left. Much time

    Separation of Three Liquids by Fractional Distillation.             19
may therefore be saved if, instead of adding all the first
portions of the lowest fractions together (and the same remark
applies to the residues from the last fractions), we collect
them in six or more different quantities. The final fractiona
tions will then be in a forward state when the preliminary
one is completed.
    We shall in this manner obtain two quantities of B, one by
the final fractionation of the first portions of the distillates
from the lowest fractions of the preliminary fractionations,
the other by that of the residues from the preliminary frac
tionations, and we can test the purity of the substance by
comparing the boiling-points and the specific gravities of the
two samples so obtained.
    In order to test the value of this method, a mixture of
200 cub. cent, of methyl acetate (B.P. 57-1), 250 cub. cent,
of ethyl acetate (B.P. 77-15), and 200 cub. cent, of propyl
acetate * (B.P. 101*55) was distilled from a flask provided
with a still-head one metre in length. The distillate was
collected in four approximately equal fractions, numbered 5,
8, 11, and 14 under F in the table (I.) below. The observed
temperatures (reduced to 760 millim.), the range of tem
perature for each fraction {At), the weight of each fraction
(Aw), and the ratio of the weight to the temperature-range
( ~t- I are also given in the tables.       The second fractionation
(II.) was carried out in the following manner : —the first frac
tion from I. (No. 5, B. P. 630>8 to 71a3) was distilled and
the distillate collected in a separate receiver (No. 4) until the
temperature rose to 630-8 t, when receiver No. 5 was substi
tuted for it and the distillation continued until the tempera
ture rose to 71o,0. The gas was then turned out, and the
second fraction from I. (No. 8, B. P. 71°-3 to 77°"8) added to
the residue in the flask. Heat was again applied and the
   * The esters had previously heen purified with great care, and were
distilled separately from phosphorus pentoxide immediately before being
mixed. Special precautions were also taken to avoid absorption of
moisture during the fractionations. The methods of preparation and
purification and proofs of the purity of the eaters are fully described in
the Trans. Chem. Soc. lxiii. p. 1194.
   t The actual temperature was 63°-5, the barometric pressure being
                               dp
751-1 millim. ; the value of -£ at the boiling-point is 27 millim. per
degree for methyl acetate, 25 millim. for ethyl acetate, and 23 millim-
for propyl acetate. All the temperatures are corrected to 760 millim.
by means of these constants.

   Separation of Three Liquids by Fractional Distillation.       25
distillate collected in receiver No. 5 until the temperature
again rose to 71o,0, when it was replaced by receiver No. 8,
and the distillation was continued until the temperature rose
to 77°-l. The third fraction from I. (No. 11, B.P. 77°-8 to
890,2) was then added to the residue in the flask, and the
distillate collected in No. 8 until the temperature again rose
to 770-l, when No. 11 was put in its place. When the tem
perature had risen to 84°-4 a new receiver, No. 13, was sub
stituted for No. 11, and the distillation was continued until
the thermometer registered 910,7. The last fraction from I.
 (No. 14, B.P. above 89°' 2) was then added to the residue in
the flask and the distillate collected in No. 13 until the tem
perature rose again to 91G,7, after which fractions were col
lected in No. 14 from 91°'7 to 98% and No. 15 from 98°-4
to 101°'5, when the distillation was stopped, and the residue
poured into receiver No. 17.
    The third fractionation (III.) was carried out in a similar
 manner, a new fraction No. 3 being collected at the beginning.
 As the temperature rose to 101o,55, the true B.P. of propyl
 acetate, before the end of the last distillation, the residue in
 the flask consisted of this substance in a nearly pure state, and
 it was therefore collected in a separate flask Z, and was not re
 distilled during the preliminary fractionations. The residues
 from the subsequent fractionations up to the tenth were col
 lected in Z, but after this, as a large amount of propyl acetate
 had been removed, the temperature did not reach 101°'55,
 and the residue from the eleventh fractionation (B. P. above
  101o,45) was collected in a new flask, Y.
    At the end of the twelfth fractionation the temperature
 rose only to 101o,15, and the residue was therefore placed in
 a third flask, X, and subsequently the residues were collected
 in W, V, &c, to Q, as shown in the tables.
    It was not until the fifth fractionation that the first fraction
 began to boil at 570,1, the B.P. of methyl acetate, and it
  was not thought advisable to separate the first portion of the
 first distillate until the eighth fractionation. This portion and
 also the corresponding ones up to the twentieth fractionation
 were collected together in flask A, after which the first
 portions were collected in B, C, D, and E.
    The ratios         give an indication of the purity of the
 various distillates, for with a pure substance, since A<=0,
      = » , while with a very impure substance there is a rapid

26    Separation of Three Liquids by Fractional Distillation.
rise of temperature during distillation, and — is conse
quently small.
   It will be seen that the ratio for the highest fraction rises
rapidly, being 197 in the third fractionation and rising to 340
in the sixth, after which it diminishes again owing to removal
of propyl acetate in the residues. The value for the lowest
fraction increases much more slowly, reaching a maximum of
204 in the thirteenth fractionation, and afterwards diminishing
owing to removal of methyl acetate.
   The presence of the middle substance, ethyl acetate, is not
clearly shown until the fourth fractionation, when the value of
     for the sixth distillate (No. 9) is higher than for those
above and below it ; but the gradual accumulation of the
ethyl acetatein the middle fractions in subsequent fractionations
is clearly shown by the rise in the values of        for fractions
8 and 11, and after the tenth fractionation in fractions 9
and 10. The range of temperature for fractions 9 and 10 was
gradually diminished from 0o,2 each in the eleventh fractiona
tion until no rise could be detected ; there was indeed no
perceptible rise of temperature during the collection of No. 1 1
in the twenty-second and twenty-third fractionations. It was
therefore certain that after the twenty-sixth fractionation the
tenth fraction was free from propyl acetate, and that the
remaining fractions Nos. 5 to 10 contained only methyl and
ethyl acetates.
   The preliminary series of fractionations was therefore
completed, no fraction now containing more than two sub
stances.
   The progress of tho separation is well seen by mapping
the temperatures against the total weight of distillate
collected. The curves I. to XI I. represent the first twelve frac
tionations, the weight of distillate being given in each case
as percentages. The dotted lines at the extremities of the
later curves represont the methyl and propyl acetates re
moved in the first portions of the first distillates and in the
residues.
   The presence of the middle substance is clearly indicated in
the fourth curve, but not in the earlier ones.

   The total weight was 490*8, so that 86 grams had been lost
by evaporation and through adherence to the flasks and to the
 funnel through which the liquid was poured into the still.
   The final separation of the esters was carried out in the
 following manner :—
    Ethyl Acetate (1).—The fractions 5 to 10 consisted of ethyl
acetate with some methyl acetate. The final fractionations
in this case were a continuation of the preliminary ones and
 were carried out in the same manner. No. 10 was almost if
 not quite pure ethyl acetate, and was only distilled once more;
 the first portion was collected in No. 9, and the residue was
 taken as pure. In the remaining six fractionations the resi
 due, after the distillation of No. 9, was each time taken as
 pure, and the total amount of ethyl acetate thus obtained was
 56' 1 grams.
    Ethyl Acetate (2).—The flasks Q to U contained ethyl
 acetate with some propyl acetate. In the six fractionations,
 which were carried out in the usual way, the first portion of
 the distillate from Q was each time taken as pure, the small
 residue in the still being rejected. The weight of pure ethyl
 acetate obtained from this series was 62*7, and the total
weight was therefore 118*8 grains, or about 53 per cent, of
that originally taken.
    Methyl Acetate.—The flasks A to E contained methyl acetate
with some ethyl acetate. Although special care had been
taken to prevent absorption of moisture, it was found that a

 little water was present : in two fractionations, therefore,
 phosphorus pentoxide was placed in the distillation-bulb,
 which was heated by a water-bath. After the first frac
 tionation the first portion of the distillate from the first frac
 tion was taken as pure, the small residue in the still being
 each time rejected. There were altogether nine fractionations,
 and the amount of pure methyl acetate obtained was 88 grams,
 or about 48 per cent, of that taken. (The loss of this ester
 by evaporation would be greater than that of either of the
 other two.)
    Propyl Acetate.—The flasks V to Z contained propyl acetate
 with some ethyl acetate. It was found that the first two
 residues were slightly acid, owing to hydrolysis of the esters
 by the trace of water present. These two residues were
 therefore collected separately and were shaken with a strong
 solution of potassium carbonate ; the ester was then washed
 with water, dried with phosphorus pentoxide, and again dis
 tilled. Five fractionations were found sufficient to purify the
 propyl acetate, the residues being each time taken as pure
 (except the first two, which were treated as described) . The
 total weight of pure propyl acetate was 126*8 grams, or 72 per
 cent, of that taken. (The loss by evaporation would be
 smallest in this case.)
    The esters were then distilled from phosphorus pentoxide,
and their specific gravities at 0° determined by Sprengel's
method as modified by Perkin. The completeness of the
separation was proved by the close agreement of the results
with those obtained before mixing, as well as b}- the identity
 of the boiling-points with those previously determined.

     Apart from the comparison of the specific gravity of the
  ethyl acetate before mixing and after fractionation, a proof
  of the purity of this substance is afforded by the agreement
  between the specific gravities of the two samples, since, if the

 acetate.

     (Second Part.) Transformations of Energy by Shearing
     Stress. By M. Carey Lea*.
  OF the relations which exist between two forms of energy,
          mechanical and chemical, very little, if anything, is
 known. In the second volume of his Lehrbuch Ostwald
  remarks that as to these relations " almost nothing " is
 known f.
     There are certain familiar cases in which mechanical
 energy may seem at first sight to be converted into chemical
 energy. The fulminates, iodimide, and other substances ex
 plode by shock. But it is hardly necessary to remark that
 all such reactions are exothermic, and need an external im
 pulse only to start them—if this impulse were not needed
 such compounds could not exist at all. Were such reactions
 taken as true transformations of energy, an absence of due
 relation between cause and effect would be involved ; for
 the shock that suffices to explode a grain of fulminate will
 equally explode a ton, and the faint spark that will explode a
 grain of gunpowder will also explode a magazine.
     Present opinion holds undoubtedly that no true transfor
 mation of mechanical into chemical energy is known. Most
 text-books do not consider the question at all. But Dr.
 Horstmann, in the volume of theoretical chemistry which
 forms part of the last German edition of Graham-Otto's
 1 Chemistry/ discusses the matter. His views are so much to
the point that I shall translate a few sentences, putting in
 italics the statements to which I would specially refer.
     " We must consequently admit that through a rough me
chanical attack the molecular structure of certain chemical
compounds can be disrupted and destroyed. This will cer
tainly be possible only for compounds in whose molecules the
arrangement of the atoms does not correspond to a stable

    t " Anderseits ist von dem Verhaltniss zwischen mechanischer und
chemischer Energie fast nichts bekunnt." A few lines below this remark
is repeated with emphasis. Lehrbuch, 2nd German ed. vol. ii. p. 12.

32               Mr. M. Carey Lea on Endothermic
equilibrium, and in which, therefore, the chemical energies
themselves are already striving to form simpler and more
stable compounds out of the constituents of the existing sub
stance. For it cannot be admitted that actual chemical changes
can be brought about by a mechanical impulse '' (1. c. p. 350).
   In another chapter he says with equal distinctness :—
   " By mechanical means alone no reaction against the force of
chemical energy can be brought about. By a shock or blow
the molecular structure of chemical compounds can indeed be
so far loosened that free play is given to chemical forces ;
but against these forces we cannot by mechanical means separate
the atoms nor combine them in a definite way " (p. 594).
   These expressions of a distinguished chemist will suf
ficiently indicate what has been up to the present time the
opinion of chemists as to the possibility of transforming
mechanical energy into chemical.
   In the first part of this paper I believe I have been able to
show in a qualitative way the production of true endothermic
reactions by mechanical force. In the present part I hope
to show an increased number of such reactions, and in one
case to exhibit actual quantitative results, at least so far as
to obtain the product of the transformation in weighable
quantities.
   In the first part decompositions were described that were
brought about by simple pressure. Compounds formed by
exothermic reactions, and therefore requiring expenditure of
energy to break them up, were decomposed. The investiga
tion might probably have been made to include a still larger
range of substances. But it was found that the efficiency of
pressure was so enormously increased by the addition of
shearing motion, that decompositions requiring a force of
hundreds of thousands of pounds with pressure alone could
bo effected by the mere strength of the hand when shearing-
stress was used.          More than this, decompositions which
enormous pressures failed to effect readily took place under
the action of shearing-stress *.
  * It would not have been difficult to obtain much greater pressures
than those described in the first part of this paper. This could be effected
by means of the differential screw. I had planned for a screw with threads
of 40 turns in 10 inches and 39£ turns in 10 inches respectively. The
mechanical efficiency of such a screw is that of one having 320 turns to
the inch, if such a thing were practicable, at the same time that a
thoroughly strong construction can be obtained. The massive steel nut
to advance £ of an inch would require 40 full turns of this screw.
   This arrangement compares as follows with that previously employed.
In it to cause the vise-jaws to approach by 1 inch required that the point
of the lever at which the force was applied should pass through a space

                                      I.
   It was mentioned in a previous paper on the decomposition
of the silver haloids by mechanical force that when silver
chloride was sharply ground for some time in a mortar, both
the pestle and mortar became covered witli a deep purple
varnish of silver photochloride, thus indicating a partial re
duction to subchloride. It has since proved that there is no
more effectual method than this of applying shearing-stress,
and that in this way a number of quite stable chemical com
pounds formed by exothermic reactions can be broken up.
The mortar and pestle should be very solid and of unglazed
porcelain. With metal there would be danger of action
between the metal and the substance, and with agate mortars
sufficient force cannot well be applied. In many cases success
depends on the exertion of great pressure on the pestle. It
is also absolutely essential that the quantity of material acted
upon should be small. When a larger quantity is employed
the particles slip or roll over each other and thus escape the
action of the stress. It is no doubt for this reason that the
very remarkable results which can be obtained in this way
have hitherto escaped attention.
   A small quantity, a few decigrams, of the substance having
been placed in the mortar, the first thing is to spread it* in a
thin uniform coat over the bottom and part of the sides. The
 pestle is then to be rotated with the utmost force that can be
 exerted.
    Sodium Chloraurate.—The salts of gold are particularly
 well adapted to this examination, as the reduction is complete
and the gold appears in the metallic state so that it can be
 weighed and the exact amount of reduction can be fixed. It
of 1134 feet : this relation, 1 inch to 113-1 feet or 1 : 1357-2, gives the
measure of the efficiency of the instrument.
   With the double screw, on the other hand, to cause the nut to advance
£ of an inch, the end of the lever (2 feet long) must pass through a space
of 500 feet, or in the proportion of 1 inch to over § of a mile. The circum
ference described by the lever being approximately 12^ feet, and the screw
requiring 40 turns to advance the nut | of an inchj we get the proportion
of 1 inch to 4000 feet, or 1 to 48,000, which is the measure of the
efficiency of such an instrument. Therefore, supposing two men to pull
 on the end of the lever each with a pull of 100 lb., the pressure exerted
 on the nut (disregarding loss by friction) would be 9,600,000 lb., which
could be doubled by using a 4-foot lever.
   Such a combination is quite practicable, the only real difficulty being to
 obtain sufficient solidity of construction to resist strain. I had made
 drawings for this instrument, but gave it up in consequence of observing
 the enormously greater efficiency of shearing-stress as a means of trans
 forming mechanical into chemical energy.

 34              Mr. M. Carey Lea on Endotliermic
 will be seen by (3) below that it may amount to as much as
over 4 per cent, of the gold present.
    (1) Two or three decigrams of chloraurate with a moderate
trituration left 1*8 milligram of metallic gold. Under the
action of the pestle the yellow colour of the salt gradually
deepened to an olive shade. When water was poured on, the
undecomposod salt dissolved, leaving the gold as a delicate
purple powder. The colour of the gold being purple instead
of the more usual brown shade explains the olive colour just
 mentioned, yellow and purple combining to form olive.
    (2) Half a gram of the salt was taken. This specimen was
more neutral than the preceding, aud was therefore more
easily reduced. Half an hour's trituration had for effect the
reduction of 9*2 milligrams of gold.
    (3) A similar treatment of the same quantity of chloraurate
resulted in the separation of 10*5 milligrams of gold.
    These may seem at first somewhat small proportions. But
it is to be recollected that the force is necessarily applied at
a disadvantge, and that the equivalent in work of chemical
affinity is always very large. In the present case the figures
are as follows :—Thomsen found as the heat-equivalent for
the combination of gold with chlorine to form auric chloride
28"8 great calories. Taking the atomic weight of gold as
 197, we find that one gram of gold in forming auric chloride
disengages 115*7 small calories or water-gram-degrees, whose
equivalent, taking Rowland's determination, is 49,288*2
gram-metres, corresponding to 4*83 X 109 ergs or 483 joules.
    The small quantity of gold reduced in (3), 10"5 milligrams,
would by conversion to auric chloride generate 1*215 water-
gram-degrees of heat whose equivalent in work is 518 gram-
metres. As heat is a degraded form of energy, such an actual
transformation without loss to a higher form would be im
possible. It is more correct to say, therefore, that the
amount of energy which would raise 518 grains to the height
of one metre can be transformed into the same amount of
heat, 1*215 water-gram-degrees, as is evolved by 10*5 milli
grams of gold by conversion into auric chloride. Conse
quently this work, 518 gram-metres, represents the amount
of mechanical energy transformed into chemical energy in
operation (3)*.
    It does not appear that in effecting these reactions and the
   * The amount of energy required would, in fact, slightly exceed this,
as the thermochemical equivalent of formation of solium chloraurate
would slightly exceed that of auric chloride. For this chloraurate I do
not find a determination, but preferred to use this salt in the operation
as being both more stable and more neutral than auric chloride.

               JJecompositions obtained by Pressure.         35
others which remain to be described, mechanical energy-
undergoes an intermediate conversion into heat. Rapid
movements are not needed ; what is required is strong pres
sure with movement, but this need not be rapid. Nor does
the mortar or the pestle become sensibly warm. The opera
tion does not need to be continuous, but may bo broken up
with any number of intervals. But a decisive conclusion can
be drawn from those cases in which decompositions are
effected in this way that cannot be produced by heat. For
example, in the next instance to be mentioned there is a
partial reduction of corrosive sublimate to calomel. By heat,
corrosive sublimate sublimes unaltered, and the same is true of
merenrous chloride. The three silver haloids fuse unchanged
at a red heat. The same conclusion can be drawn from
other reactions.
   These results were obtained in an atmosphere absolutely
free from dust, so that the reducing action of this substance
was completely excluded.
   Mercuric C/doride.—A specimen which, after lightly pow
dering, did not darken in the least with ammonia, was
triturated in the manner just described with several intervals,
in all for 15 minutes. It then became grey in a very striking
way when moistened with ammonia.
   This is a very interesting reaction. In the first part of
this paper it was mentioned that mercuric chloride could be
subjected to a pressure of about 70,000 atmospheres absolutely
without change. It appears, however, that a pressure
amounting to less than a hundred pounds causes decomposi
tion when combined with movement, showing the enormously
greater efficiency of shearing-stress as compared with simple
pressure. Not only this but, as just mentioned, shearing-
stress produces decompositions which heat is not competent
to effect.
   Mercurous Chloride.— When calomel was sharply tritu
rated in a mortar, it first became yellow and then blackened
without difficulty.
   Turpeth Mineral, 3HgO,S03.—Reduces rather slowly.
   Mercuric Oxycldoride, 2HgO, Hg013, obtained'by precipi
tating corrosive sublimate by potash acid carbonate, exhibited
the following reaction. Its brownish-purple colour by light
grinding became lighter, and then when strong force was
used it blackened with remarkable ease.
   Mercuric Iodide shows a trace of blackening.
   Mercuric Oxide.—This substance yields much more readily
to trituration than to simple pressure. Especially on the sides
of the mortar it was quite blackened. The layer of material
must be quite thin, otherwise little effect is produced,

 36             Mr. M. Carey Lea on Endothermic
    Platinic Chloride.—Gradually darkened in a very marked
 way, finally becoming blackish.
    Ammonium Platinichloride gave same result.
    Silver Tartrate.—When spread in a very thin skin over
 the mortar, each sharp stroke of the pestle left a black line
 behind it. This is a strong contrast with the complete resist
 ance of this substance to simple pressure.
    Silver Carbonate.—Action similar.
    Silver Citrate.—Blackens very easily.
    Silver Oxalate.—At least as easily.
    Silver Arsenate.—Nearly as easily.
    Silver Sulphite.—Effect visible in five minutes and gradu
 ally increasing. Very well marked.
    Silver Salicylate.—No other silver salt appears to be so
easily reducible as this. Every sharp stroke of the pestle
leaves a brown mark behind it.
    Silver Orthophosphate.—Affected easily. After the phos
phate has been a good deal reduced, the unchanged part may
be dissolved out with ammonia. The black residue after
washing readily dissolves in dilute nitric acid, and the solution
gives a white cloud with hydrochloric acid.
   Potassium Ferridcyanide.—A crystal of the pure salt
sharply ground in a mortar becomes in portions brown and
in others blue. The quantity used must, as indeed in all of
the above cases, be small, one or two decigrams. If a little
distilled water be added an insoluble blue powder is left be
hind, and the solution formed strikes a blue colour when
added to one of ferric alum. This indicates that the decom
position is twofold. The experiment is quite a striking one,
and the result is easily obtained.
                               II.
   This form of mechanical force, shearing-stress, may be
applied to effect endothermic change in other ways. A very
simple, and at the same time very efficient, method is that of
pressure with a glass rod. Pure strong paper is to be imbued
with a solution of the substance, if it is soluble, or if not, it is
to be made into a paste with water and then applied with a
brush. This paper is to be then very thoroughly dried, and
is to be laid upon a piece of plate glass. Characters are to
be marked on it with the end 01 a glass rod that has been
rounded by heat, using as much pressure as is possible with
out tearing the paper.
   More than twenty years ago I was able to show that marks
made in this way on sensitive photograph-films could be de
veloped, as an invisible image had been impressed. That,

              Decompositions obtained by Pressure.           37
however, is a somewhat different matter from actual and
visible decomposition following each stroke of the rod, a
result which may be obtained with various salts of gold,
mercury, silver, and other metals.
   Potassium Ferridcyanide.—Pure paper was imbued with a
dilute solution of this salt. After thorough drying it was
laid on a glass plate, and marks were made with a glass rod
in the manner just described. These marks were immediately
visible, and when the paper was plunged into dilute solution
of ferric ammonia alum or of ferric chloride they became dark
blue. It is probable that the decomposition here effected was
twofold (see above).—The nitroprussides appear to be much
more stable than the ferridcyanides. When sodium nitro-
prusside paper was treated with pressure followed by appro
priate reagents, no indications of decomposition were obtained.
   Auric Chloride.—Paper imbued with a solution of auric
chloride and marked in the manner described was thoroughly
soaked in water to remove, as far as possible, the rest of the
gold salt. The marks were very distinct and gradually
gained with time. Colour dark purplish grey.
   Platinic Chloride.—After drying and marking, the paper
was thoroughly soaked in water and dried. The marks were
very distinct, of a yellow colour.
   Ammonium Platinichloride.—Marks very visible. Con
tinued to slowly deepen, and in a few weeks were almost
black.
   Silver Carbonate. — The traces of the rod were brown.
When the paper was placed in ammonia the carbonate dis
solved, but the marks resisted the action of the ammonia and
remained.
   Silver Phosphate.—Action very similar to the preceding.
   Silver Arsenate.—Similar action.
    Silver Tartrate and Oxalate.—These salts gave analogous
results to the preceding, but not so well marked. The car
 bonate, phosphate, and arsenate show this reaction best, and
 about equally well. What is rather curious is that silver
 chloride does not exhibit a visible action.
    Mercuric Oxide.—Paper imbued with a saturated solution
 of mercuric nitrate
 and dried shows this reaction very distinctly. Mercuric
 oxide appears to be quite sensitive to light.
     Turpeth Mineral. —Mercuric sulphate was dissolved in
 water with the aid of sulphuric acid. Paper was soaked in
 the solution, allowed to become nearly dry, and then washed.
 This paper showed the reaction very moderately, but the
 marks were brought out more strongly by immersion in
 ammonia.

38      K. 1). Kraevitch on an Approximate Laxc of the
   Ferine Alum (Ammonia).—Paper imbued with solution of
this salt, dried and marked, wp.s immersed in solution of
potassium ferridcyanide. The marks came out blue, showing
that the ferric salt bad undergone partial reduction.
   It is easily conceivable that the action of shearing-stress
should be enormously greater than that of simple pressure.
For it seems probable that pressure can only cause decom
position when the resulting product is more dense, has a
greater specific mass, than the original substance. With
shearing-stress the case is altogether different. All matter is
in a state of vibration, and it is easily conceivable that the
forcible friction of a hard substance may increase vibration
in somewhat the same way as does a bow drawn over a
stretched cord. Both the elasticity and the tension of the
atoms themselves are vastly greater than those of any
stretched cord, so that the increased vibration may easily be
sufficient to shatter the molecule.
   The transformation of light, heat, and electricity into
mechanical energy, as well as the converse transformations,
are extremely familiar. That mechanical energy may be
transformed into chemical energy is proved by the results
described in these papers. The converse transformation, that
of chemism into work, is in an industrial point of view by far
the greatest chemical problem now awaiting solution. But it
is by no means certain that such a transformation is practi
cally possible. At least it seems probable that the improve
ment in our method of obtaining work from the chemism of
carbon may be in the direction of substituting electricity for
heat as the intermediary.
IV. On an Approximate Law of the Variation in the
   Pressure of Saturated Vapours. By the late K. D. Krae-
   VITCH*.
THE dependence between the pressure of a vapour in a
       state of saturation and the temperature is probably ex
pressed by an exceedingly complex function, which, notwith
standing the endeavours of many renowned physicists, has
not yet been determined. Even the interpolation (empirical)
formula?, with the exception of Biot's formula, cannot be
regarded as satisfactory. The cause of failure is to be found
in the endeavour to attain the dependence sought for in all
its exactitude, which is probably excessively difficult (if not

of saturation depends, not only on the temperature, but also
on a number of other circumstances: on the properties of
the liquid (coefficient of expansion, latent heat of vaporization,
specific heat, &c), and of the vapour (coefficient of expansion,
specific heat, molecular weight, &c). In the present stage of
science it would be well to search for even an approximate
dependence between vapour-pressure and other thermal quan
tities, and there is no necessity to limit this dependence to a
function of temperature ; and it might be deemed a consider
able scientific success were an expression found for the pressure
of a vapour in a state of saturation, in dependence upon any
thermal quantity whatever. The finding of such a dependence
is naturally easier than that of a precise function, and one, espe
cially, of temperature only *. Such approximate inexact laws
and formula? would serve as guiding clues for further re
searches and for the discovery of more exact laws.
   In this paper it is my object to show that the pressure of a
vapour is in a somewhat simple, although only approximate,
dependence upon other observable quantities ; or, in other
words, if certain quantities are known, corresponding to a
definite temperature, having a special significance, then it is
possible to calculate with sufficient accuracy the vapour-
pressure for temperatures near to it, and approximately also
for temperatures far removed.
    1. Let us imagine a kilogramme of a liquid at a tempera
ture of vaporization t under a pressure p, and let us convert
it by two methods into vapour saturating a space, at a tem
perature t + dt and under a pressure p + dp, and calculate
each time the increase of internal energy in the material.
    (a) Let us increase the pressure p on the liquid by dp\ and
heat it to the new boiling-point t + dt, corresponding to the
new pressure. The internal energy of the substance will then
increase by cdt, where c is an amount of heat which is slightly
less than the specific heat of the liquid. In the case of a small
external pressure we can neglect this difference, because the
coefficient of expansion and specific volume of the liquid, upon
which the amount of heat consumed in external work depends,
are exceedingly small. This difference only becomes significant
   * I have written more fully on the importance of researches of this
kind in my papers, " Remarks on Van der Waals' Formula " (Journal of
the Russian Piiysico-Chemical Society, vol. xix.), "On the Dependence
of the Latent Heat of Vaporization upon other Factors " (Idem, xxi.),
and in the Sepertorium der Physik (vol. xxvi. p. 589).
   t The internal energy of a liquid then decreases, but so slightly that
we do not take it into consideration.

for abnormally high pressures, or when the coefficient of expan
sion of the liquid becomes great. On the liquid attaining the
temperature t + dt under the pressure p + dp, let us convert it
into saturated vapour at the same temperature and pressure.
If p denote the internal (potential) latent heat of vaporization
for the temperature t, we find that the internal energy of the
liquid increases by p + dp on its conversion into vapour at a
temperature t + dt. Thus, if a kilogramme of a substance in
a liquid state, having a temperature t and subjected to a pres
sure p, be converted into saturated vapour at a temperature
t + dt and under a pressure p + dp, then the energy of the
substance increases by
                           cdt + p + dp,
   (b) Let us bring the given liquid, which is under a pressure
p and at a temperature t, wholly into the state of saturated
vapour at the same pressure and temperature. The internal
energy of the substance is increased by p. Let us heat the
vapour by dt without altering the volume v. By this means
the internal energy is further increased by kdt, where k is a
quantity equal to the specific heat of the vapour at constant
volume. The vapour will now be in a superheated state. Let
us increase the pressure p, under winch it occurs, by dp
without changing its temperature t+dt ; the vapour then
passes into a state of saturation. Moreover, if it follows the
laws of Boyle and Gay-Lussac, the internal energy of the
vapour will not change on compression. If, on the contrary,
it does not follow these laws, then the internal energy will
decrease by some quantity S, because as a rule the internal
energy of substances is decreased by contraction. Hence,
in order to convert a kilogramme of a liquid at t and p into
vapour at t + dt and p + dp, it is necessary (not counting
external action) to augment the internal energy of the liquid by
                           p + kdt — S.
And as both expressions represent one and the same thing,
therefore
                    cdt + p + dp = p + kdt — S,
whence
                     dp=-(e-k)dt-8*.
   If it be allowed that a saturated vapour is, at a certain
pressure, subject to the laws of Boyle and Gay-Lussac,
then S = 0, because the energy of a perfect gas is not
dependent upon the pressure. This is the fundamental pro
position of the present paper ; and it is not an arbitrary one,

but is, on the contrary, proved by calculations and theoretical
considerations given below. Under such a state of the vapour
we obtain from the preceding equation,
                           dp=-{c-k)dt                                  (1)
    If v denote the specific volume of the vapour in a state of
saturation, and if it be supposed that the vapour at this volume
and corresponding pressure p and temperature t has the pro
perties of a perfect gas, i. e. is subject to the laws of Boyle
and Gay-Lussac, we shall have
                               pt>=DT*;
where T = 273-Mand D is, as is known, a special quantity
for every substance when the latter occurs in the state of a
perfect gas. The amount of heat required by the vapour in
this state for the completion of external work in raising its
temperature by 1° is equal to AD, where A denotes the
thermal equivalent of work. Moreover, if cx be the specific
heat of the vapour at constant pressure, we have
                              £ = Cl-AD                                 (c)
    If r denote the latent heat of vaporization and w the specific
volume of the liquid, then, as is known,
                           p = r — Ap(v—iv).
    Under small pressures w is exceedingly small compared
with v; therefore it may be said without any perceptible error
that
                              p{v— ic) = DT,
and consequently
                              p = r- ADT,

    The equations (1), (c), and (p) lead to the following,
                   dr— ADdt=—(c-Ci + AD)dt,
 whence it follows that
                           dr=~(e—c1)dt                                 (2)
   • This equation is not exact. D. T. Mendel<5eff showed that near a
 certain pressure, proper to every gas, the latter is subject to Boyle's
 law ; beyond this pressure pv varies with p. The pressure at which pv is
 constant should fall with a rise of temperature. Let us imagine a satu
 rated vapour and allow it to expand freely at a constant temperature ¦
 then, according to Mendeleefi's law, the vapour will attain such a state of
 rarefaction that it will fully satisfy the equation pv = a constant, and
 will therefore possess the properties of a perfect gas. It is possible to
 imagine such an instance, that a vapour will follow Boyle's law even
 in a state of saturation. Thus the proposition, that a vapour in a
 state of saturation follows Boyle's and Gay-Lussac's laws near n certain
 temperature, is in harmony with other well-known phenomena.

   The French chemist Bertrand* obtained the same equation,
but he avows its inapplicability to bquids. Indeed, according
to Regnaultf, for water

whence
                       dr= -0-695 it.
On the other hand, taking c=l and Ci = 0-4805$, we find
                         dr= -0-5195 dt,
which differs considerably from the above. The same dis
agreement is observed for other liquids. Moreover, for the
majority of liquids r is expressed by a trinomial function, and
hence the increment of r is not proportional to the increment
of temperature, as it should be according to equation (2).
But the discordance is completely removed if equation (2)
be not referred to vapour at any temperature, but only at
that temperature when the vapour is entirely subject to the
laws of Boj'le and Gay-Lussac. It has been said above that
such a temperature does actually exist for aqueous and the
majority of investigated vapours, and therefore equation
(2) is quite applicable for this and its adjacent temperatures.
   Let us take the known equation
                        A(r— w)p ^T=rp.
   Inasmuch as when a vapour nearly approaches the state of
a perfect gas (v— w)p may be taken as equal to DT, therefore
it follows from the preceding equation that

If it be supposed that c and Cj are constants and do not
depend upon the temperature, then equation (2) may be

   J. Bertrand, by assuming that a vapour has the properties
of a perfect gas at any temperature, obtained the formula *

in which a, @, and y are arbitrary constants, whose arbi
trariness this savant took advantage of in order to bring the
pressures calculated from this formula in closest agreement with
the results of observation, or, more truly speaking, with those
calculated by means of interpolation-form uke from observed
pressures. The expression previously found by A. Dupre tor
vapour-pressures can be put into the same form.
   This investigator, instead of making my assumption as to
the constancy of c— c1( took Regnault's empirical formula
                               r=a—bt,
and assumed it to be true for all vapours.       Then, from equa

                           . tk dt   a — bt
whence it is easy to obtain a formula of the form (6).
   Equation (5) also does not essentially differ from (6).
Indeed it can be transformed thus :

The difference between the equations (5) and (6) is that the
former does not contain any arbitrary magnitudes, as we
shall prove subsequently ; while equation (6) contains three
arbitrary magnitudes, which Messrs. Bertrand and Duprd*
endeavour to so choose for each vapour individually that the
formula may best accord with the results of experiment.
Hence equation (6) is an empirical one, while equation (5)
should be regarded as one based upon theory. In order to
convince ourselves of this, let us consider the magnitudes
which enter into the second portion of equation (5). The
specific heats c and cx of substances in a liquid and vaporous
state can be determined with more or less accuracy by expe
riment. A is the thermal coefficient of work, we take it as
equal to —= ; D is a constant quantity for every substance
           425
when it occurs as a perfect gas. It is not difficult to prove
that
                             AD=425P'

                                  = P;
 P is the molecular weight of the vapour. The magnitudes
T0 r0, and p0 correspond to that state of a vapour when it
 is entirely subject to the laws of Boyle and Gay-Lussac.
 If we have the means of determining the temperature
 which corresponds to this state of a vapour, then T0, and
 consequently r0 and p0, become perfectly definite quantities.
 I shall afterwards give two methods, controlling each other,
 by means of which it is possible to find such a temperature
 for any substance if only it exists, and if there be a sufficient
 number of observations on the vapour-pressure of the substance.
 Thus equation (5) contains no arbitrary magnitudes ; and in
 this it differs from all the formulae which have been found by
     » TfiSorie Micanique de la Chaleur par Athanase Duprt. 1869.

         Variation in the Pressure of Saturated Vapours*     45
various savants for the pressure of vapours in a state of satu
ration.
   It must be remembered, however, that equation (5) gives
only an approximate value for the vapour-pressure, except
for the temperatures T0 and those adjacent to it, when
there can be no difference between the results of calculation
and experiment; but at temperatures far removed from T0
the difference may be very considerable. Recollecting the
assumptions and inexactitudes which were allowed in de
ducing the equation (5), we must acknowledge it to be
perfectly applicable: (1) when the vapour, saturating its
space, subjects itself to Boyle's and Gay-Lussac's laws, or
varies very slightly from them ; (2) if c—C\ does not vary
with the temperature ; (3) if the coefficient of expansion
of the liquid be exceedingly small, and the pressure under
which it occurs be not abnormally high ; and (4) if the
volume (w) of the liquid be so small compared with the
volume (y) of the vapour formed from it that w may be
taken as equal to zero. The first three conditions may be
allowed within certain limits of temperature, but the fourth
can never be observed with any degree of great accuracy ; in
the case of small pressures w can be neglected without essen
tial error, but with great pressures this is not allowable. The
difference between the results of theory and experiment in
creases in proportion to the divergence from the above
conditions, and in the end they frequently differ entirely.
   When the dependence of the pressure of a vapour upon
any magnitude whatever is discovered, then it is easy to
express the specific volume of a vapour by means of the
same magnitude. The equation
                              pe=DT
serves for this purpose. Let us also take

following :—

    This equation serves only in the case when the fraction
T— T
—f=—2 is small, and when, consequently, the temperature T is
not too far removed from T0 ; the results given by it will be
particularly near to those of experiment if c— Ci be small. I
have applied this equation to bisulphide of carbon [12]* in
order to form an idea of its accuracy, and found that the
simplified equation (5') and the complete equation (5) give
similar, or very nearly similar, results.
   Experiments have shown that the difference c—cx is ex
ceedingly small, compared to the heat of vaporization, for
all investigated substances. Therefore the first member of
the equation may be neglected, and we shall have

 the better does formula (r) agree with the results of experi

 there was one, namely ethyl bromide [14], for which c—Ci

theoretical basis ; this explains its accordance with the results
of experiments.
   The same formula may be deduced upon other bases.
According to Southern and (Brighton's law, the inaccuracy
of which was, however, proved by ltegnault's experiments,
the heat of vaporization does not depend upon the pressure on
the surface of a liquid remaining constant at all temperatures.
If this law were true, then instead of equation (4) we should
have the less accurate one
                               r=r0.
Then equation (4') would be converted into the following:—
                         dp
                         dt _ r0 1
                         7~ad'tj'
whence by integration we obtain equation (r).
   Thus Southern's inaccurate law and equation (r) proceed
 from one and the same supposition, that c—cl is negligible
compared with r. This is sufficiently near the truth, and
may be regarded as the very first approximation.
   From the preceding we have the right to conclude that
Roche's formula, although roughly, still presents a law of
nature. All the other empirical formula? —Young's, Arago's,
Dulong's, Tredgold's, Cariolis', and others, and among them
Biot's—have no theoretical basis, and with the exception of
the latter do not satisfy the results of experiments. It is true
that Biot's formula gives vapour-pressures very nearly ap
proaching those found by experiment ; but this is not due to
its representing in itself the nature of a vapour, but because
of the large number (five) of arbitrary coefficients, or, in
geometrical language, because the curve expressed by Biot's
formula has a large number (five) of points common to the
curve of the actual vapour-pressures in a state of saturation.

pressure of a vapour, and would only fully express these
variations if the above conditions were strictly observed*.
   The temperature of the first point of inflexion is very high.
For water, for instance f,
                R = 5106-2 + 5-2948x343= 6922-3;
The highest temperature of steam attained by Regnault was
only 230°. So also it is easy to find that for sulphuric ether
the first inflexion of the curve corresponds to 743°-2, for
benzene 886°-7, sulphur 1279°.
    With the majority of the substances I calculated for, x is a
positive quantity, but it is sometimes negative and may be equal
to zero ; R was always positive. If x < 0, when its absolute
magnitude > 1, then it is easy to prove, from the above-
mentioned equations (p), (jjj, and (p2), that as T varies
from zero to infinity, the curve diverges continuously from
the axis of abscissae, and always turns its convexity towards
this axis, without giving any special points.
    We may add that it would be absurd to deduce any
properties of a vapour from the properties of the curves and
   * My paper " On Van der Waals' Formula " (Russian Physico-Chemical
Society, vol. xix.) proves that for all substances the second differential
coefficient      where p is a function of » and t, is greater than zero, and
that it is only for perfect gases that ^S- =0. This may seem a contra
diction to the above, because the value of        for the curve (5) is either
less or equal to zero. In reality there is no contradiction at all. To be
concise, I will only observe that the curve expressed by equation (p)
presents the variation of the vapour-pressure under certain conditions
and within certain limits ; in the given instance it only applies for that
portion of the curve which lies between the origin of coordinates and the
first point of inflexion, and then the condition that      > 0 is fulfilled.
   t In order to calculate R and T, it is necessary to know x aid Tj ; the
mode ofdetermining these quantities is given below. For water r = 62948,
T0=343? [6].

50      K. D. Kraevitch on an Approximate Law of the
equation (5) we have just considered, because they do not
refer to actual vapours but only to imaginary ones such as do
not really exist.
   4. I will now pass to the applications of equation (5) and
to proving that its theoretical bases are confirmed by experi
ment. The fundamental proposition upon which equation (5)
is based is that at a certain temperature a vapour in a state
of saturation has the properties of a perfect gas. Above and
below this temperature it diverges from these properties, but
for the present investigation it does not matter in wbich
direction. It follows from the calculations given below that
such a temperature does actually exist for the majority of
substances yet experimented upon, and which are liquids at
the ordinary temperature and pressure. The vapours of
other liquids are not subject to the laws of Boyle and
 Gay-Lussac within the limits of the observations made by us.
Without fresh observations it is impossible to say if these
vapours are able to exist in the state of a perfect gas outside
the temperatures observed. Equation (5) is naturally as yet
inapplicable to such vapours. Our theory should not be
applied to gases which are able to take the form of liquid only
under very high pressures, because the volume of the resultant
liquid would then be somewhat considerable compared with
the volume of the gas and could not, therefore, be taken as
zero, as our theory demands.
   5. Suppose that in equation (5)
                     c — c, _     r0_ _
                      AD "^ AD ~y'
we shall have
        log£- = -[log|-m^],+ (^_i-)my. . (7)
If x and y be regarded as arbitrary constants, then they might
 be determined, if any vapour-pressures p, »0, and p1 were
 known corresponding to temperatures Tlt T0, and T'. If,
moreover, vapours in a state of saturation followed Boyle's
and Gay-Lussac's laws, and if in general the propositions
which served for the deduction of equations (5) or (7)
were unimpeachable and perfectly accurate, then the pair of
unknown quantities x and y would be the same whatever
were the temperatures T„ T0, and T, and their corresponding
tensions pu p0, and p'. In reality just the contrary occurs.
Every three observations, taken at random, give in general
different magnitudes for x and y, so that not unfrequently

          Variation in the Pressure of Saturated Vapours,                 51
 there is no similarity between two pairs of these magni
 tudes. And so it should be, because equation (5) can only
 be applied with the observation of certain conditions, which
 generally speaking are not fulfilled. Nevertheless, it is possible
 with nearly all liquids to find a temperature T0 which has
 such properties that the magnitudes x and y are approximately
 the same whatever three temperatures are taken, if only they
 are adjacent to T0 and to each other. We will now turn our
 attention to determining this temperature. I have discovered
 two methods, which are here given, and for the sake of clear
 ness applied to aqueous vapour.
    6. Let us take three adjacent temperatures, T1; T0, and T',
 differing for instance by 5°, so that T'— T0=T0— 1\ = 5, and
 calculate the values of x and y. Then let us calculate their
 values for three other temperatures as near as possible to the
 first ; and then for three more temperatures, and so on ; and
 thus combine a more or less considerable number of observa
 tions. We thus obtain values for x and y which are different,
 but with the majority of substances experimented upon (i. e.
 for which there are tables of vapour-pressures, in a state of
 saturation, x, varying uninterruptedly with the corresponding
 temperatures) give a maximum or minimum value. If the
 mean (intermediate) of the temperatures T0 be laid along the
 axis of abscissae, and x along the axis of ordinates, then a curve
 is obtained with a maximum or minimum. There are, how
 ever, vapours for which the curve of x's continuously recedes
 from or approaches the axis of abscissas with a rise of tem
 perature ; the path of the curve indicates where the maximum
 or minimum lies, beyond the greatest or least of the tempera
 tures observed.
    The value of c—Ci varies very inconsiderably within small
limits of temperature; therefore, the magnitude x should
remain constant, whatever combination of temperatures be
taken, at temperatures near to that at which the vapour has
the properties of a perfect gas, and when in general the above
theory stands good ; and this is only possible when x has a
value near to its maximum or minimum*, because a con
siderable variation in T then produces an inconsiderable
variation in x. Hence the desired temperature T0 is that at
which x has a maximum or minimum value. We may here
remark that at this time y varies with the temperature, as is
seen from equation (4) ; or, more accurately, the increment
of y is equal to x multiplied by the increment of temperature.
   * I do not consider the case when the curve has an inflexion whose
direction is parallel to the axis of abscissae, because I have not met with
such an instance in my investigations upon vapours.

52       K. D. Kraevitch on an Approximate Law of the
If x has no maximum or minimum, then the vapour does not
possess the properties of a perfect gas at any temperature,
within the limits of observation, and the theory is not applic
able to it. Then y does not vary proportionally to the tem
perature.
   To calculate the values of x and y it is sufficient to have two
equations and three observed tensions corresponding to three
temperatures. For the sake of simplicity let us take equi
distant temperatures :¦»—
                       T-T0=T0-T1=A.
We shall thus have two equations of the first degree with two
unknown quantities : —
       -('»4:—V,>+(T;-i:h-^
               T,       T'-TA        /1      1 \       , p>
       "(log^ -«.                    (^-^=108^.
 On solving them we obtain
           Tjog|-riog|

                (T>g§-TMog,£).A
 To obtain x to a sufficient degree of accuracy, the three
 temperatures for which this value is calculated must be taken
 as near as possible to one another, because the direction of
 the curve of x's can only be looked upon as parallel to the
 axis of abscissa?, near the maximum and minimum, for an
 inconsiderable distance. Moreover, this requires exceedingly
 careful observations of the vapour-pressures, as otherwise the
 series of values of x present such irregularities as to prevent
 the possibility of distinguishing the maximum or minimum of
 this quantity. These irregularities become less perceptible as
 the difference of temperature increases and the order of the
 variation of the x'a becomes clearer ; but in this case, accord
 ing to what has been said above, the maximum or minimum
 value of x and the corresponding temperature may prove

          Variation in the Pressure of Saturated Vapours.                53
 insufficiently accurate. Let us apply equation (8) to aqueous
 vapour and take, at random, temperatures 40°, 45°, and 50°.
 If we take the temperature of absolute zero as —273°, then
 these temperatures counted from the absolute zero will be
 313°, 318°, and 323°, and the corresponding pressures
 calculated by Broch* according to Regnaultfs observations,
 54-8651 millim., 713619 millim., and 91-9780 millim. On
 substituting these figures in equation (8) we find
                              xu=. 3-9542.
In this, and in all further calculations, x refers to the inter
mediate temperature, and we now mark xu by the number
45. In a like manner we find for temperatures 45°, 50°, and
55°,
                              ^50=4-3293.
Below is a table in which the upper line contains the inter
mediate temperatures (t) and the lower the corresponding
values of x :—
  <        45°      50°     55°      60°     65°     70°    75°      80°
  x       3-9542 4-3293 46800 5-0031 5-2109 5-2948 51997 3-8844
In this series of figures the greatest value of x is 5-2948,
corresponding to 70° ; x diminishes with a rise and fall of
temperature, at 15° it is 2-0640 and at 125° 3-4263. Hence
it is evident that near 70° aqueous vapour follows the laws of
Boyle and Gay-Lussac ; t. e. satisfies the equation
                                pv=VT.
If in the equation
                                 AD      x
we replace x and AD by their values, we have
       c-Cl=x . AD= 5-2948 . | =5-2948 . ^ =0-58831.
The specific heat c as determined by various experimenters
shows a great diversity. According to Regnault c at 70°
equals 1-0072, while according to Hendrichsen it is 1-0419.
The value of cx was determined by Regnault for temperatures
above 100°, at 70° it is probably less. Thus, according to
Regnault c—cx = 0-5167, and according to Hendrichsen it is
0*5614. The latter more nearly approximates to that found
    * Pht/sikalisch-chemische Tabellen von Landolt und Bornstetn, § 18.

 54      K. D. Kraevitch on an Approximate Law of the
 above, 0*58831, and would be still nearer if a smaller figure
were taken instead of 0*4805.
    On making the requisite substitutions in equation (9) we
find that
                             #=5106-2,
whence
                 r0=y. AD =5106-2. ^=567-36.
 According to Eegnault's well-known formula we find that
 the latent heat of vaporization at 70°,
                             r70= 557*6.
The difference between the values of r0 and r70 is less than
2 per cent. The accordance between the results of theory
and experiment must be regarded as fully satisfactory if we
take into consideration the imperfect observation of the
requisite conditions and especially the inexactitude of the ex
perimental determinations of the amount of heat. If instead
of 70° we take a temperature which is considerably higher or
lower, then the results are less accordant ; thus at 125° we find
542-8 for the latent heat according to equation (9), while,
according to Regnault, rm = 519-6. The value of c—Ci will
then be 0*3807, which diverges still more from the results of
experiment.
    7. We will now consider the second mode of calculating
»¦„ and c—cx. It follows from equation (3) that
                               AD.rp^
                           r=           -                     (10)
                                    /'
This equation gives the possibility of calculating the heat
of vaporization if it be assumed that the vapour follows
the laws of Boyle and Gay-Lussac, and that in general the
above enunciated theory contains no inexactitudes. But in
order to make this calculation it is necessary to know the
first differential coefficients of pressure -fr, the determination
of which, however, presents considerable difficulty. If this
quantity, at T and p, be taken as equal to the difference be
tween p and the pressure answering to the temperature
T — A, divided (i.e. the difference) by A, then we find that
•jjis too small, while if we take the temperature T + A it is
too great.     Generally the arithmetical mean of these two

         Variation in the Pressure of Saturated Vapours.         55
values is taken, but still it is far from being the true value,
and the difference is greater the more rapidly p varies. In
order to lessen the error it is necessary to make use of more
or less complex interpolation formulae. Let
                          p=a + a1T + aaV,
where a, alf Oj are arbitrary constants which may be calculated
from three observations. Hence
this equation only leads to the above method, which, as we saw,
was not sufficiently accurate. In order to attain a greater
degree of accuracy, let us take the more complex formula
                   p=a + a1T+a3T2 + a3T;                        (T)
the four arbitrary constants are determined from four ob
servations. Hence we have
                       dp _
                           = a1 + 2a3T + 3a3T3.
                       dt
Let the vapour-pressures corresponding to the temperatures
T1? T„ Tfc and T4 be pu p3, p3, and p4 ; we will denote the
differential coefficients corresponding to these pressures thus :—
                       dpi    dpi_   dpj   dp*
                        dt'    dt'    dty   dt'
We will assume that tables of vapour-pressures are formed for
equal intervals of temperature, so that
                    T4-T,=T,-T,=T,-T1=A.
On substituting the pressures pu p3, p3, and p4 with their
corresponding temperatures in equation (T), we obtain four
equations, from which, after a very easy transmutation, we find

 from the third ofthe equations ( 1 1) ; and, lastly, (4) the differential

                                                           at
 figures forming a table follow some definite law, then the values
 of the differential coefficient, although determined by different
 methods, should be similar and differ only in the inevitable
 errors of observation ; or, more strictly speaking, of calcu
 lation, because all tables of vapour-pressures are found by
 means of interpolation formula;. If the differences are great
 it shows that in one figure, at least, there is a misprint or
 error exceeding the possible one. Tho tables of vapour-
 pressures which I investigated nearly always gave four very
                             3
 nearly similar values of -~        Considerable discordances en
  abled me to discover misprints or errors in the tables. I may
  here remark that irregularities in the values of x, calculated
  by the first method, also sometimes revealed an error in
 observation.
     In all the calculations the results of which are given below, I
  did not calculate the differential coefficient four times, but only
  twice by J means of the formulae -~    at and ~3  at , and took the
  arithmetical mean of the results.
     Knowing how to find the differential coefficient                 it is
  possible to calculate the heat of vaporization r for each tem
  perature according to equation (10). Let us endeavour to
  determine the temperature with whose uniform rise or fall
  the value of r also uniformly varies, so that if the tempera

           Variation in the Pressure of Saturated Vapours.       57
ture varies constantly by A, then r varies by one and the
same quantity (c— c^A by equation (2). This temperature
will evidently be that same T0 which was found by the first
method. It should, however, be remarked that (c— c^A is
exceedingly small compared to r ; therefore, in order to ob
tain results approaching those of experiment, it is necessary
to have very exact tables, accurate to tenths, and with small
pressures to even hundredths of a millimetre. But it is
more than difficult to calculate to such a degree of accuracy,
and therefore it is best to employ the first method for deter
mining T0 and to employ the second method as a control.
    We will apply the second method to aqueous vapour.
Broch has recalculated Regnault's observations on aqueous
vapour to four points of decimals. I take from them 9
 pressures for 9 temperatures : for the above determined 70°
and four above and below it, and I calculate ^ by means
of the second and third of equations (11). The results are
 given in the following table; the temperature t in the first
 column, the pressure p in the second, and the differential co
 efficient      in the third.

 I calculate this quantity for 60°, regarding it as             (11)
  according to the data for temperatures 50°, 55°, 60°, and 65°.
  The figure 6'9247 is obtained. I calculate the same quantity
  after formula         by means of the pressures corresponding to

 58       K. D. Kraevitch on an Approximate Law of the
 the temperatures 55°, 60°, 65°, and 70°. I find 6-9207. The
 arithmetical mean of these two results is 6*9227 ; the last
 two figures may contain an error. I take the differential
coefficient Tj-for 60° as equal to 6*923, where an error may he
suspected in the last figure ; the result thus obtained is placed
in the third column opposite to 60°. In exactly the same way
I calculated the differential coefficient ¦£- for 65°, regarding it
as -j2-?and as -f-2 5 in the first instance I obtained 8*4044, and
     at           at
in the second 8*4002*; the mean 8*402 is placed in the table
 opposite 65°. The other differential coefficients for tempera
 tures 70°, 75°, and 80° were determined in the same manner ;
 each of them is the arithmetical mean of two figures.
    By placing the resultant values of the differential coefficient
 in equation (10), I calculated the heat of vaporization for
five temperatures t ; these results are placed in the second line.
    t       60°           65°          70°          75°            80°

    The figure 567*36 was found for the heat of vaporization at
70° according to the first method ; it may be considered as
coinciding with that now found by another method, 567*13.
From the tables it is seen that the heat of vaporization falls
with a rise of temperature. The third line gives the difference
between the two adjacent values of r. These differences are
near to each other, but are not equal, as would be expected ;
but on following out the calculation it is easily seen that the
second decimals in the heat of vaporization, and hence also
those figures in the differences, may contain errors depending
upon errors in the pressures. The fourth line of the table con
tains c—Ci; these values are obtained by dividing the differences
(figures in the third line) by 5. They and their arithmetical
mean, 0*578, may be said, taking into consideration the pos
sible errors, not to differ from that found above by more

    In this table the temperatures 65°, 70°, and 75° are omitted,
because at these temperatures there can be no difference be
 tween the results of calculation and observation, as they
 appertain to points through which both curves pass ; that is,
both the curve expressed by equation (7) and that representing
 the actual variation of the vapour-pressure. The curves, which
 almost accord between the common points, diverge as they
 become more remote from them, but in their general properties
 they diverge very slowly, as is indeed seen from the table.
 Such temperatures as 40°, 60°, and 80°, for which the pressures
 are calculated after equation (7) and determined by obser
 vation, may be considered as equal. At higher and lower
   * The meaning of the figures in the 4th and 6th columns will be
 explained presently.

 60      K. D. Kraevitch on an Approximate Law of the
 temperatures the divergence increases, especially on the side
 of a rise in temperature. This signifies that aqueous vapour
 in a state of saturation follows Boyle's and Gay-Lussac's
 laws near 70°, and diverges from these laws at a certain
 distance from 70°. Other causes still further increase the
 divergence. Thus c—cx should remain constant according
 to our assumption, instead of which both specific heats,
 especially c, vary with the temperature. The volume of water
 (io) is taken as equal to zero, which in reality is never the
case. These facts have their significance, especially for high
pressures, because with water c at low temperatures varies
very little, and the volume of liquid (m>) is then minute com
pared to the volume of vapour (i>) . For this reason, probably,
the theory and experiments agree better for low pressures
than for high.
    8. The determination of x and y from experimental data
may lead to the idea that these quantities are arbitrary, and
that therefore formula (5) or, which is the same, (7), can be
 numbered among empirical formula?. Such a conclusion
would, however, not be right ; x and y have each a perfectly
definite physical value, and calculated by the above methods
prove, at least y does, in the case of water and of other
liquids subsequently considered by me, to be near those
values given by experiment. If there be not an entire
agreement, it may bo ascribed to the insufficient accuracy
of the methods by means of which the heat of vaporization
and specific heats are determined, while the calculation of
these quantities, or, which is the same, of x and y, depends
according to our theory upon the vapour-pressures, which
may be measured with incomparably greater accuracy. This
even affords the possibility, although for one temperature T0
only, of obtaining these quantities for substances which have
not been investigated in this aspect. The inexactitude of
x and y determined by experiments from the quantities c — Cj
and r, moreover, proceeds from the fact that we do not know
accurately the values of A, D, and the temperature of absolute
zero. We may add that if, instead of the calculated values
of c—Cj and r, we take those which are given by experiment,
then the tensions calculated after equation (5) approximate
to those given by observation, although not so closely as the
same values determined by the above mentioned methods.
Thus, although the quantities x and y are calculated like
arbitrary constants in empirical formulae, they are not arbi
trary, because they have a definite physical meaning and
approximate to those values which are given by experiment,
and can even be replaced by the latter in equation (7). It

           Variation in the Pressure of Saturated Vapours.      61
has already been explained that T0 is also 'not arbitrary,
because this number has a physical significance, and r0 and
p0, being dependent upon T0, are therefore also not arbitrary.
     Thus, as was said above (§ 1), formula (5) does not contain
any arbitrary quantities.
     9. I foresee the possibility of yet another objection. Let
 us imagine two curves of a different nature, and, by the aid
 of differential coefficients, bring three points of one curve
 into coincidence with three points of the other curve ; and
 let us, moreover, assume that these common points approach
 each other for an infinitely small, or at least exceedingly
 small, distance. According to the common property of
 curves, they diverge very gradually as they pass from the
 three common points, and only diverge to a great extent at
 a very remote distance from the common points. From
 this it might be concluded that the fact of the curve (7) and
 the curve of the actual vapour-pressures being near each
  other about the common points, and even at a considerable
 distance from them, does not prove the truth of the above
 theory. Such a view would be unfounded. In order to
  prove this, let us take any formula with three arbitrary
  coefficients, for instance the parabolic formula
                          p = a + a1r£ + a3T,                   (5J
  and assort the constants a, ax, and a3 in such a manner that
  the formula would satisfy temperatures 65°, 70°, and 75° ;
  i. e. so that the curve expressed by formula (5i) would pass
  through three points lying on the curve (5) and on the curve
  of the actual vapour-pressures. It is then seen that
           a=18513-75, ai:=116-7576, rt3=O185020.
  The vapour-pressures calculated according to formula (5^ are
  given in the 5th column of the preceding table. We see that
  even at temperatures near 70°, for example at 40° and 100°,
  the figures in this column differ considerably from those of
  observation, and at remote temperatures, for instance 20° and
  220°, there is not the slightest analogy. Thus formula (5j)
  has nothing in common with that function which expresses
  the dependence of a vapour in a state of saturation on the
  temperature.
      The properties of Roche's formula (§ 2) are different; having
  a theoretical basis, it somewhat closely satisfies the results of
   observation. A formula analogous to it may, as we saw, be
   obtained from the equation

                        log m = 3-46471.
   In Regnault's formula* these figures have another value,
because he gives his formula a different aspect, somewhat
diverging from theory :
                                    (+20
and he endeavours to assort such values for a, a, and m as
would best satisfy the results of observation.
   Equation (52) contains no arbitrary coefficients ; it passes
through three points common to curve (5), whose abscissas
are 338°, 343 , and 348°. The pressures calculated from
this formula are given in the 4th column of the preceding
table. Although they agree less with the results of experi
ment than the figures in the 3rd column, nevertheless it is clear
Roche's formula roughly and approximately expresses a law
of nature.

c— c1=0,08485 *. The difference between these two values
is considerable, but a closer agreement is not to be expected,
for with the existing caloriinetric methods the specific heats
of liquids, and especially of their vapours, may contain great
errors, so that it is doubtful whether they would impose
confidence if they were near to each other—to the difference
of their c— cx : if, for example, the second figures (i.e. the
hundredth parts) of c and cx contained errors, then in the
difference c— cx the error would be in the first figure, and
consequently the figure found by subtracting ct from c would
have no scientific value. Errors in the third figures have,
although a less, still a great influence on the accuracy of
 c—Ci- Therefore it is better to determine cx by means of x
 than by the usual caloriinetric method. Taking c = 0*56451
 and c — C!=0-07513, we find that c, = 0-48938; this value
 deserves greater confidence than 047966, found by Eeg-
 nault from experiment.

    Although there is not an entire coincidence in the results
 of calculation and observation, still one cannot but acknow
 ledge that the figures are very similar.

     In this instance x has not a maximum value, as it has with
water and ether, but a minimum, whose exact position it is
 unfortunately difficult to determine, probably owing to errors
 (misprints ?) in the pressures. It may be said that the mini
 mum lies between 80° and 90° ; we will take 85°, and will
 consider the minimum of x as the arithmetical mean of its
three values for temperatures 80°, 85°, and 90°, that is as
 2-5152. Hence
                    c-c1=2-5152x % =-064492.
     According to Wiedemann Ci = 0*3325, and Eegnault gives
 e=0*43602, hence c— Cj = " 1035 2 ; the disagreement between
the above results is explained by the uncertainty of the
 calorimetric measurements. If, however, we assume that
the error in c is small, and take (* — <¦, = "064492 as found
by the 1st method, then we obtain Ci = 0*37153, which is
 slightly greater than that determined by Wiedemann. To
calculate y, 1 made three replacements, in equation (9),

peratures 80°, 85°, and 90°, and obtained three figures whose
mean was taken as the desired value of y. It appeared that

   The minimum value of x lies between 80° and 90°. But
as the values of x at these temperatures are nearly equal, it
is best to take their arithmetical mean and to take the cor
responding temperature as 85°. We then have
                               ^=2-5289,

    The value now found for x is near to that given above,
and the values obtained for y by both methods can be con
sidered as perfectly equal. The pressures calculated from
 these new values of x and y are given in the fourth column

 Eegnault c, =0-15956 ; hence c-c^O-09575. The latter
 figure is more than twice that found above—the difference
 is very considerable ; nevertheless there can be no serious
 objection to such a discordance, for it has only to be
 admifted that there is an aggregate error of 0"05 in the
 specific heats, and the figures found for c—Ci will both closely
 agree. Conversely, calculating cx from c and x we find that
 ^=0-21266 instead of 0-15956.

enter into the calculation of the amount of heat required to
raise the temperature of the Hquid from 0° to 85°, because

    The values of c—Ci proved to be not quite similar to each
other, or to the figure found by the 1st method, probably
because the vapour-pressures, taken at rather low tempera
tures, are small and the errors they contain have a great
influence on the calculation. The value of r0, 52*063,
however, is similar to the former value.

    14. 1st Method.
    In the case of ethylene bromide the calculations presented
freat irregularities, with which it was exceedingly difficult to
  eal. By means of numerous attempts and recalculations, I
 came to the conclusion that x has a minimum value of nearly
 zero, at 95°. The pressure at this point is equal to 245-51.
 Below this temperature, the errors contained in the vapour-
 pressures are probably considerable compared to the true

             Variation in the Pressure of Saturated Vapours.                          71
  pressures, because the latter are small; owing to this the
  values obtained for x are irregular. But above 95° x in
  creases regularly. If x=0 then c = cx ; unfortunately there
  are no direct experimental data for C\. From equation (9),
                                       tf= 4606-8,
  whence
                            ro=4606-8 XjJg=49-008.
     According to Berthelot the heat of vaporization of ethylene
  bromide, under the atmospheric pressure, is equal to 43'78.

     The results obtained by this method also present a certain

   Although there is an irregularity in this series of a-'s, still
it is evident that x has a minimum value between 60° and 70° ;
I take 65°, and the arithmetical mean of three values of x
answering to the temperatures 60°, 65°, and 70°. In this
manner I find
                                   *=2-2227,
whence
                        c-c1=2-2227 x ^=0-076645.
    According to Regnault c= 0*5580 and cx= 0*4125 ;
hence                            c— ^=0*1455.
    Determining cx from c and x we find that cx= 0-4814, and
the difference between this value and that given by experi
ment, 0-4125, may be referred to errors in the calorimetric
observations.
    According to equation (9),
                                  y= 3690-37;

    Here it is quite clear that the minimum lies between 60°
and 70°, and nearer to the latter temperature ; I take the
minimum as the arithmetical mean of 2*3514 and 2*2777,

    The value of x gradually rises from a lower to a higher
temperature. However, on examining the curve of x a it
may be remarked that, notwithstanding its irregularity, it
strives to attain a maximum, which lies about 150° or slightly
higher. We assume that 150° corresponds to the maximum
value of x, i. e. to 8-6754. Acting thus, we cannot naturally
expect to obtain exact results. We shall have
                       c-c1=8-6754x-j| =0-3772.

of sulphur is 362*0. To render these data comparable they
must be brought to one temperature. Being unable to do
this accurately, we will calculate it approximately by sub
tracting the product of 0-15817 x (550-316) from 362,

   22. Mercury belongs to the small number of substances for
which the maximum or minimum of x has a negative value.
In this case c — Ci must inevitably be < 0. Up to now, with
all the substances investigated, it has been found that c > Cj.
There is, however, no reason for affirming that this aspect of
inequality is necessary ; at least, in the mechanical theory of
heat there is no indication one way or another. It is possible
to imagine a substance which would at certain temperatures
have a greater specific heat in a liquid than a gaseous state.
The inequality c<cy induces the conclusion that the heat of
vaporization increases with a rise of temperature when the
vapour follows Boyle's and Gay-Lussac's laws. As a rule a
 converse phenomenon is observed, i. e. there is a decrease.
 Only ethyl alcohol, according to Regnault's experiments,
 offers a remarkable exception ; the heat of vaporization in
 creases as the temperature rises from 0° to 20°, and then
 follows the general law, i. e. it decreases. If x had a maximum
 or minimum value between 0° and 20°, then the inequality

    Although these figures present irregularities, still the mini
 mum, without doubt, occurs between 280° and 300°. It may
 be said that the minimum value of x is equal to the arith
 metical mean of its three values corresponding to temperatures
 280°, 29Q°, and 300°, namely 4-9262, and lies opposite 290°.
 Hence
               c_Cl = -4-9262 x           = -0-049262.
    According to Kupffer, c = 0-0335 ; c: has not been measured,
 but, on the basis of what has been said above,
                 d = 0-0335 + 0-049262 = 0-0828.

    23. The vapour-pressures of the acids C„H2n02, formic,
 acetic, propionic, butyric, and isovaleric, were measured by
 Landolt, but unfortunately with considerable errors. Thus,
 in the case of propionic acid, he gives a vapour-pressure 389" 0
 for 120° and 650'2 for 135°, both of which figures are, without
 doubt, wrong. It is scarcely possible to deal with these

         Variation in the Pressure of Saturated Vapours.      83
mistakes and correct the errors, rough as they may be, pro
ceeding perhaps from misprints and mistakes in interpolation.
It is exceedingly remarkable that with the majority of acids
x has a negative value. Whether c—c^ is negative depends
upon x being so when it attains a maximum or minimum
value. Acetic acid apparently offers less error, and I here
insert my endeavours to bring our theory into agreement with
Landolt's data for this acid.
                       Acetic Acid, C2H403.
   1st Method.
   In order to shorten the calculations, I calculated the nu
merator of equation (8). Its different values are placed in
the second line of the following table ; the first line contains
the corresponding temperatures:—
       t           50°     55°     60°   65°   70°    75°
       x          0225 0-405 0-417 0 329 0 206 0-303
       t           80° 85° 90° 95° 100° 105° 110°
       x          0-428 0-203 0-405 0 132 0 325 0106 0-309
    On dividing these figures by the denominator of equation (8),
 which is always negative, we find that all the x's are also
 negative, x increases with a rise of temperature above 110°
 and a fall below 50°, hence its maximum value lies between
 these temperatures ; but it is impossible to indicate the exact
 corresponding temperature, owing to the disorder of the
 figures. I take 80°, because in the preceding table the maxi
 mum quantity lies opposite it. To determine as accurately
 as possible the minimum of x, it is necessary to divide the
 figures of the second line by the corresponding numerators
 and to take the arithmetical mean of the thirteen figures so
 obtained. As the latter are too irregular it is impossible to
 expect a great accuracy from the mean result ; 1 therefore
 changed this method for another, which, although less accu
 rate, is simpler, counting that this would not render the
 calculations less exact. I took the arithmetical mean of the
 figures of the second line of the preceding table and divided
 the number so obtained, 0-2848, by the numerator of equa
 tion (8) taken for the temperature 80°. I found
                            x= -9-2657,
 whence                                2
                c-Cl= - 9-2657 x ,4- = -0-30886.
    According to Regnault, c=0'4599 (between 10° and 15°);
 cx is unknown. From these data we find
                            Cl = 0-7688.

    I calculated y for three temperatures, 75°, 80°, and 85°,
taking the value of x the same in each case — 9-2657, and
took the mean of the results. I found
                       # = 4205-3,
                      r0 = 4205*3 x ^=140*2.
    According to Berthelot, the heat of vaporization under the
ordinary pressure (175°?) is 120*1.

    Each -r- is the arithmetical mean of two figures which do
           dt
not agree very well together owing to the errors contained in
the pressures. Thus the differential coefficient for the pressure
244*1 calculated as ^ from pressures 170*6, 204*3, 244*1,
and 290*6 proved equal to 8*61 1 ; and that calculated after the
formula ^ from pressures 204*3, 244*1, 290*6, and 345*2
equalled 8*583. Hence in the mean 8-597 an error may he
suspected in the two last ciphers ; which error should also
enter into the figure expressing the heat of vaporization.

considerably. This indicates, as has been already said, the
insufficient accuracy of the observations on the vapour-pressure
of acetic acid.

 satisfactory, I repeated them at intervals of 10°.

    There is still an irregularity, hut the position of the minimum
is clearer, it is equal to 12-005 and lies opposite 60°. Hence
                              c-Cl = 0-4002.
We then find
                        y = 4022-2 ; r0 = 130-7.
I calculated the vapour-pressures of acetic acid from the new
values of x and y, and placed them in the fourth column of
the preceding table.
    24. There are some liquids to which our theory cannot be
applied, at least at present, owing to the insufficiency of ob
servations on their vapour-pressures in a state of saturation.
Among these are :—
       C.H.I, PC1„ BC1„ SiCl4, CNC12, C2H4C12, and C10H16.
With the first five liquids x increases with a rise of tempera
ture, but with the last two x decreases. If the curve of x's
be constructed, it is easy to observe that it strives to attain a
maximum or minimum, and with the first six liquids it prob
ably does so not far beyond the highest temperature at which
observations were made. In the case of turpentine this
temperature lies far beyond the temperatures observed.
    25. I have, as far as 1 know, reviewed all the liquids whose
vapour-pressures have been well determined ; there remain
the liquids produced by the liquefaction of gases under high
pressures. Our Iheory should not, however, be applied to
them, chiefly because the volume of the liquid presents a

86        K. D. Kraevitch on an Approximate Law of the
considerable magnitude compared to that of the gas in a
state of saturation. The application of this theory to such
liquids is, however, interesting, because it enables us to cal
culate their heat of vaporization, the determination of which
by experiment is very difficult. For this reason I allowed
mysolf to apply the theory to certain gases, although it was
impossible to expect reliable results. It appeared that the
existing experimental data on liquefied gases in a state of
saturation were exceedingly rough, and did not permit making
any even approximately exact conclusions. Besides which
 certain gases give a constant increase of rate of decrease on
the value of x with a rise of temperature. Only sulphuretted
 hydrogen (H2S) gave the possibility of obtaining x and y,
 although oniy very approximative^. I here give the results
 only, without the calculations. The temperature of the maxi
mum was 65°.
                         x = 3-3987, y = 2015-3,
                   c-c, = 0-2000, »•„= 120-3.
 I calculated the vapour-pressure of sulphuretted hydrogen in a
 state of saturation, at various temperatures, from these data.

    26. The second mode of determining the value of x and the
latent heat of vaporization requires an exact knowledge of
the differential coefficient of the pressure {^^-         This quantity
may, as was shown above, be calculated from four different
formula} (11) : I only determined two values in each instance.
If the latter were equal, within the limits of logarithmic
errors, then the results of observation might be relied upon :
in the reverse case the data for the pressures contained errors,
made by the composers of the tables, in their calculations of
the interpolation formula), or else due to misprints. The

          Variation in the Pressure of Saturated Vapours.      87
 unreliability of the data may also be remarked in calculating
 x after the first method ; it evinces itself in the irregularity
 of the resultant values. But it is somewhat difficult to deter
 mine the extent and locality of the errors : to do this it is
 necessary to compose a table of the differences of different
 series of data for the pressures ; if there are errors, irregu
 larities then appear in the second or third of the differences.
 Such are, for example, the vapour-pressure of ether at 40°,
 907-04 (Regnault, vol. xxvi. p. 393) ; of bisulphide of carbon
 at 95°, 2966-34 (p. 402) ; of propionic acid at 120°, 389-0, and
 at 135°, 650-2 (Landolt's Tables, p. 55). All these data are
 erroneous, but I have not been able to determine the extent
 of the error. The vapour-pressure of methyl alcohol at 80c,
 given as 123^*47 (Regnault, vol. xxvi. p. 460), should be
 1235-47. The vapour-pressure of acetone at 50°, 602-86
 (p. 472), should be 60S-86; of mercury at 380° (p. 521),
 1139-65 should be 1136-65 ; at 260° it should be 96"^ and
not 96-73. The value 5072-43 at 480° is also very doubtful.
In Landolt's Tables (p. 57) the vapour-pressure of benzene,
given as 5683-03 should be 578#-03. This misprint is, how
ever, mentioned by Regnault, but is inserted in his tables
without correction. Lastly, in Regnault's tables (vol. xxi.)
of the vapour-pressure of steam, there are several errors which
have been reprinted without correction in many works.
    Conclusion. —The pressure of a vapour in a state of satura
tion is expressed by equation (5). The values of c—cx and of
r0 may be taken from experimental data, but are better calcu
lated, looking upon them as arbitrary constants, from tables
of vapour-pressures, because the latter can be determined from
experiment with far greater accuracy than the former. How
ever, the values obtained for r0 by either method differ but
slightly, with the exception of those cases when considerable
errors may be suspected in the values of the vapour-pressures
or r0 determined by calorimetric measurements. The values
obtained for c—Ci differ far more. This is due, as has been
already explained, to the fact that even slight errors in c and
ca produce an immense effect upon the value of c — C\. If we
carefully follow out Regnault's method for measuring c1} we
inevitably come to the conclusion that the specific heat of a
vapour may contain a very large error, because it is calculated
from the difference between two quantities of heat which are
exceedingly great compared to the magnitude of their differ
ence. Consequently, the error in c— Ci may be so great that

88       K. D. Kraevitch on an Approximate Law of the
it is impossible, in my opinion, to make any true conclusion
from the magnitude of c—cv
    If the temperature T0 be determined with sufficient accuracy,
then both methods used for calculating it give one and the
same result, just as they do for r0 and c—C\. If, on the con
trary, we purposely take an incorrect, but more or less likely
value for T0, then it gives dissimilar results. This shows that
 the above enunciated theory has a firm basis and gives a right
 to hope that the values found for r0 and c — cx deserve greater
 confidence than those given by calorimetric methods.
    It would be very important in relation to the confirmation
 of our proposed theory to prove experimentally or theoretically
 the truth of its fundamental proposition—that vapours in a
 state of saturation subject themselves to Boyle's and Gay-
 Lussac's laws. The only existing means of doing this,
 namely the formula
                                  1 r
                                  A Tdp
                                      dt
 cannot, however, be made use of, because the quantity r cannot
 be considered as determined with sufficient accuracy by ex
 periment. Besides which this quantity has been measured at
 different pressures for only a very few liquids ; in the case of a
 very few of which is it possible to calculate to owing to the
 coefficients of expansion being unknown at high pressures.
 I applied the preceding formula to aqueous vapour, and made
 use of Zeuner's Tables, in which the value of A(v— w)p is
 given for various temperatures : I added Aicp corresponding
 to the same temperatures, and divided the sum by AT. The
 figures thus obtained present the expression
 which, with a small variation of temperature (20°— 40°) on
 either side of T0, should not vary within the limits of experi
 mental errors. Unfortunately, the figures so obtained were
 so irregular that it was impossible to come to any rational
 conclusion from them.
    At temperatures remote from T0 the results given by equa
 tion (5) sometimes differ from the data given in tables.
 From this it should in no way be concluded that the bases
 of this formula are false. It only indicates that the vapour
 under consideration diverges on one side or another from the
laws of Boyle and Gay-Lussac at temperatures remote from
T0. Some vapours preserve the properties of a perfect gas

for large amplitude of temperature, others do not. Among
the former are, sulphur (390° to 570°), sulphide of carbon
(-20° to 130°), water (-30° to 100°) benzene (40° to 170°),
ether (0° to 110°) and others, while the latter include carbon
tetrachloride, ethene bromide, methyl alcohol, and others.

Note on Prof. Kraevitch's Paper. By Prof. Geo. Fras.
                           FitzGerald.
    It may be worth while pointing out in connexion with this
paper that the author seems to attribute too much importance
to the fact that his two methods of calculating the specific and
latent heats agree. His second method consists in calculating
the latent heat of vaporization r from the thermodynamic
formula
                        r=A(v-w)T.^,
and then using this value in his own formula
                       r=r0-(c-Cl)(T-T0).
His first method consists in substituting r out of the second
of these equations in the first and then integrating through
the small range of temperature T to T0. In both cases, for
reasons he gives he assumes that the vapour obeys Boyle's
and Dalton's laws, and that c—c^ is constant throughout the
ranges of temperature employed. This he does explicitly in
his first method, but these assumptions are equally necessary
for his second method, for the first of these equations, as
used by him, is modified by an assumption of the validity of
Boyle's and Dalton's laws, and the second is explicitly derived
from a differential equation by assuming c— Cj constant within
the limits of integration, and these limits are mostly the same
as those he subsequently employs to obtain the equation he uses
 in bis first method. Hence the two methods are not indepen
 dent, and the fact that they do not lead to exactly equal
 numerical results is largely due to the difficulty he takes so
much trouble to surmount of calculating         at the tempera
 ture required. There are in addition several arithmetical
 mistakes which would require laborious calculations to correct,
 as some of them may be mistakes in the elaborate calculations
 which are not given fully in the paper.

                Note by Prof. William Ramsay.
    This paper reached my hands from Professor Mendeleeff
 with the request that it should be published in the Philo
 sophical Magazine. Professor FitzGerald has had the kindness
 to see it through the press, and has made some alterations
 which were necessary from thermodynamical considerations.
 It is unfortunate that Professor Kraevitch has made use of
 data in verifying his equations which are, to say the least,
 not the best attainable. But the main fact, that he has devised
 a rational formula which makes possible the calculation of
 vapour-pressures, by means of data derived from other physical
 constants, is of great importance.
V. Tlw Action of Electromagnetic Radiations on Films con
    taining Metallic Powders. By Professor G. M. Minchin,
   M.A*
AT the last Edinburgh meeting of the British Association
        attention was directed by Dr. Dawson Turner to a dis
 covery made by M. E. Branly, as to the effect produced on a
glass tube filled with copper filings through the extremities of
which tube are inserted two wires which dip into the filings
(without, of course, touching each other inside the tube). The
filings form, apparently, a continuous column of metal, the
tube when held up to the light being opaque. Supporting
the tube in a horizontal, or any other, position, and connect
ing its terminal wires with a galvanometer and a voltaic cell
in a continuous circuit, the chances are that no current what
ever will be indicated by the galvanometer. If such a current
happens to exist, a very slight tap given to the tube or to its
support will destroy the conductivity of the column of filings,
and no current passes. Another such tap will cause the
column to conduct, and so on.
   At first sight it seems strange that such a metallic column
should bo a non-conductor ; but, of course, when we see the
result we can admit that the contact between every particle
and its neighbours is of the microphonic kind, and thus that
the whole column may be an extremely bad conductor.
   The identity of the state of affairs in the tube with that in
a microphone may be perceived by inserting a telephone in
the circuit, and then we shall find that slight mechanical dis
turbances communicated to the column of filings will be

        Radiations on Films containing Metallic Powders.       91
 accompanied by the rumbling noises which are heard in a
 telephonic circuit which contains a microphone.
    Now the most striking peculiarity of such a column is that,
 while it is in the non-conducting state, if a spark is allowed
 to pass anywhere in its neighbourhood between the knobs of
 a Leyden jar or the poles of an induction-coil, the wraves sent
 out from the spark at once render the column a conductor.
    This experiment was reproduced at the meeting of the
 Physical Society on October 27 by Mr. Croft, and it at once
 struck me as bearing a strong resemblance to the effects
 produced by electromagnetic waves on photoelectric impul
 sion-cells. These cells I have already fully described (seo
 ' Philosophical Magazine,' March 1891) ; and in addition to
 what I showed with regard to them, I may here add that the
 effects of the sparks of an induction-coil on an impulsion-cell
 were observed when the cell (enclosed in a dark box) was
 over 140 feet distant from the coil and from everything
 connected with it. Moreover, it wras found that, in most
 cases, the power of electromagnetic radiations to change
 the state of the cell from one of insensitiveness to one of
 sensitiveness to light depends on the length of the electro
 magnetic waves ; for, by adding capacity (by means of Leyden
jars) to the sparking circuit, the waves ceased to affect the
 cell, and, on removing this capacity, their ability to effect
 the change was restored.
    I have always held that this action of the cell is due to a
rearrangement of the molecules on the sensitized surface of
the plate in the cell by the electrical disturbances produced
in the wires connected with its poles, these disturbances being
due to the radiations emanating from the sparking circuit ;
and I found that by completely enclosing the cell, together
with its terminal wires, in a metal box, the ability of the
radiations to act on the cell was destroyed.
    After having seen the experiment shown by Mr. Croft, I
filled several glass tubes with the filings of copper, tin, zinc,
bismuth, antimony, &c, and found M. Branly's result in
every case. It seems to me that if the filings are extremely
fine (powders, in fact) the result is much more difficult to
obtain. Powders used in this way are very great insulators,
and they must be strongly pressed together by the corks
which close the glass tubes in order to conduct ; but then it
becomes difficult to alter their conductivity by mechanical
disturbances. On the other hand, a tube filled with very
coarse iron filings was found to conduct under all circum
stances ; so that, apparently, the filings must be neither voiy
fine nor very coarse.

92       Prof. Minchin on the Action of Electromagnetic
    As in the case of the impulsion-cells, the effect of the
electromagnetic disturbances is cut off by completely en
closing the tubes and their-terminal wires in a metal box. If
the terminal -wires are allowed to project outside the box—
whether thoy are connected with the battery and galvano
meter or not—the tubes are affected, which clearly shows
that the result is duo to the electrical disturbances set up in
the leading wires of the tube.
    In order to establish a closer connexion with the impulsion-
cells, it seemed to me that films containing metallic particles
almost in mathematical contact, but yet free to undergo very
minute displacements of rotation, should replace the tubes of
filings. Accordingly, 1 have formed such films by im
bedding fine metallic powders in layers of gelatine and of
collodion. The powders which I employ in these films are
very much finer than the filings which I have used in the
glass tubes.
    The media, or bases, in which these powders are embedded
are (so far as I have gone) gelatine and collodion.
    To form a gelatine film proceed thus :—Pour a very thin
layer of dissolved gelatine over a glass or ebonite plate ; let
this layer get almost quite dry ; if it gets quite dry, hold it
over a beaker of boiling water until it absorbs a sufficient
quantity of steam to render it very slightly plastic : take a
test-tube with fine metallic powder immersed in alcohol ;
shake this up well, and rapidly pour some of it over the
gelatine surface, securing, to all appearance, both continuity
and uniformity of the metallic layer. The alcohol soon
evaporates, leaving the metallic layer embedded in the gela
 tine, but not wholly sunk below it.
    In the case of a collodion film, the metallic powder is shaken
up in a test-tube and then rapidly poured over a glass plate.
After some time the film dries and peels off the plate. The
surface of the film which was in contact with the glass is
the metallic surface sought ; the other surface of the film
probably contains no metallic particles, and is simply a con
tinuous surface of dry collodion which is an absolute non
conductor.
    If the layer of gelatine above described is too thick, it will
probably happen that its upper surface (that remote from the
glass or ebonite plate) docs not contain metallic particles, and
 is a non-conductor. In this case, if the film is peeled off the
 plate there remains on the plate a metallic surface which will
 answer our purpose.
    Such a film may now replace the tube of filings in
 M. Branly's experiment.

        Radiations on Films containing Metallic Powders.        93
   Let ABCD represent the film, L a battery of one or two
voltaic cells, G a galvanometer, and K a key which can be
connected with the film by means of the wires s, w, the
former clamped to the film at a point P, while the latter ends
in a stout platinum piece the end of which is a round knob
 touching the film at a movable point Q.
    Now it is found that when the contacts are all made no
 current passes, and we have to begin by making the platinum
 knob touch the film very close to P—perhaps £ millim.
 from P. Still no current passes, even when a spark of an
 induction-coil is allowed to pass a few feet from the film.
 But by touching either of the wires s, w with an electrified
 body (that which I commonly use is a common gas-lighting
 electrical machine), the resistance of the film and the contacts
 P, Q is overcome, and a strong current is shown by the
 galvanometer. We can now gradually increase the distance
 between P and Q each time that Q is removed from P, the
 wire s or w being touched by the electrified body ; and by
 these successive steps the whole of the film is finally rendered
 conducting.
    The special characteristic of such a film which I wish to
 point out is this : if, while the film is conducting, the current
 is stopped by breaking the contact at Q, the film will be
 found to be a non-conductor if the contact is almost instantly
 re-made at the same point Q ; while, if the contact is broken
 anywhere else in the circuit, as at K, and then re-made, the
 film will still be found to conduct.
    Again, if when the film has been rendered a conductor, the
 circuit is broken at K, and left broken for (apparently) any
 length of time, and then re-made, the film will be found to
  be still a conductor.
    The breaking of the contact at Q is instantly fatal to the
 conductivity of the film, if the film is not many days old ;
 but, after some days, it will be found that on breaking the
 contact at Q and then re-making it, the film remains a con
 ductor, unless we delay the re-making of the contact for half

a minute or so. Doubtless this is due to the fact that, as the
film gets more hard and less plastic, the metallic particles
find it more difficult to move, by rotation or otherwise, in
their environment.
    Finally, these films are very much less sensitive to me
chanical disturbances given to their supports than the tubes
of filings. They do not appear to be susceptible to the action
of heat ; but in many instances their conductivity was de
stroyed by breathing upon them, or by allowing a stream of
steam to strike their surfaces, the conductivity being always
restored by the electromagnetic radiations. The more rapid
vibrations of light have not produced any effect so far as my
observations have gone.
    The prime cause of the action is to be sought in the elec
trical surgings produced in the leads s and w ; but it is clear
that the state of affairs at the places P, Q of contact of the
film with the electrodes is a most important matter.
    It seems clear, therefore, that the sensitized surface in an
impulsion-cell has a close analogue in a slightly plastic film
filled with almost mathematical completeness by fine metallic
particles.
VI. On the Sudden Acquisition of Conducting-Power by a
    Series of Discrete Metallic Particles. By Prof. Oliver
    J. Lodge *.
THE recent experiments of Mr. Croft and Prof. Minchin
        remind me of an observation I frequently made when
engaged with the syntonic arrangement of Leyden-jar circuits,
or sympathetic electric resonance. I found, if the knobs
of the receiver were very close together, a weak battery and
bell being in circuit, that the occurrence of a scintilla at the
 receiver frequently caused the bell to ring for some time, and
in general to show signs that the knobs were in a state of feebly
adhesive contact. It was just as if their surface-layers or
skins had been broken through, or opened out, in such a manner
as to increase the molecular range of a few of the closest
superficial molecules and thereby to cause cohesion to set in
at a distance considerably greater than the ordinary distance.
    A phenomenon which may be similarly caused is that dis
covered by Lord Rayleigh, with regard to the effect of electri
fied sealing-wax near a vertical water-jet : drops which would
otherwise have rebounded being thereby caused to cohere.
And, by the method of two impinging jets, the necessary

      Magnetic Shielding of Concentric Spherical Shells.          95
difference of potential was shown to be only a volt or two,
since a pair of impinging jets ceased to rebound if connected
to the opposite terminals of a Grove cell.
   Once more, the effect first observed by Mr. Gruitard (1850),
and rediscovered by myself and the late J. W. Clark, con
cerning the adhesion of dust-particles or mist-globules in
electrified air, is but a more violent variety of the same sort
of effect. And the action of electricity on a steam-jet dis
covered by Robert von Helmholtz and afterwards by Shelford
Bidwell, and worked at by Richarz, Aitken, J. J. Thomson,
and others, may not be very different.
  Thinking of the Lord Ruyleigh variety of experiment as
in many respects the most definite; it is natural to explain it
eleetrolytically as due to the polarisation of the water-drops,
or the formation in each drop of molecular chains each with
a negatively charged oxygen atom at its termination on one
hemisphere and a positively charged hydrogen atom at its
opposite extremity.
   Such drops then colliding about the region of their poles
would be attracted not only by their ordinary cohesive forces,
but by electrical force also, and thus the effective molecular
range would be increased and cohesion might set in over an
unusual distance.
   In some such way I have allowed myself to fancy that the
adhesion of my knobs might be explained, and I suggest that
the conductivity of a chain of metallic filings under an electric
polarising influence may be due to something of the same
cause.
   That a tap should break the minute points of contact is
likely enough, though I see no reason why another tap should
restore communication,—if so it does.
   At the last moment I write this and send it off in the
hope that it may arrive in time to be read at the Meeting
as a contribution to the discussion on these interesting
experiments.

VII. On the Magnetic Shielding of Concentric Spherical Shells.
                    By A. W. Rucker, F.R.S*
 SPECIAL interest has of late attached to the problem of
       shielding magnetic forces by means of iron screens, and
recently the Astronomer Royal has described the arrange
ment (designed by Messrs. Johnson and Phillips) by which
   * Communicated by the Physical Society : read November 24, 1893.

96            Prof. A. W. Rucker on the Magnetic
he has protected the absolute magnetic instruments at Green
wich from the disturbances due to a dynamo.
   In that case external space was protected against magnetic
forces produced inside the enclosure.
   The converse arrangement is sometimes adopted, and, as
in Lord Kelvin's Marine Galvanometer, instruments are
enclosed in iron and thus protected against external mag
netic influence.
   In the particular case when the iron shields are spherical
shells, the method of attacking the mathematical problem
involved is well known. Maxwell gives the working in the
case of an internal space protected by a single shell (Ed. 3,
vol. ii. p. 59), and also discusses the precisely analogous
problem of the flow of currents interrupted by shells of dif
ferent conductivity from the rest.
   I behove, however, that a number of facts, which are of some
practical importance, are not generally known, and I propose
therefore to deal with them in the following paper, illustrating
them by numerical examples.
   In the earlier part of the paper the general theory is
developed, chiefly for the sake of defining the notation used,
though this course involves some recapitulation from Maxwell.
The discussion of the best conditions for shielding, with
which I mainly deal, is, I believe, new.
   The principal point to which attention is directed is the
calculation of the advantage gained by lamination, i. e. by
using shields separated by air-gaps, like those employed by
Mr. Christie, instead of a continuous mass of iron.
   That lamination would be useful might be foreseen by the
aid of the hydrodynamical analogue to the magnetic field.
   If we suppose sources and sinks of equal power to be
placed within an enclosure, we may weaken the flow outside,
either by making the enclosure or part of it very permeable,
or by making the bounding surface very impermeable.
   In like manner in the magnetic problem there are two ways
 of reducing the internal field, viz. by enclosing the central
region by shells of greater, or by shells of less, permeability
 than the surrounding space. Although we cannot in practice
 use any material of less permeability than the air, we can
 introduce into an iron shell layers of material less permeable
 than itself. These may tend to reduce the external field by
 preventing as it were the force from penetrating to the
 external shell.
    This analogy has long suggested that laminated shells, in
 which both the permeability of the iron and the relative
 impermeability of other materials are utilized, may be the

             Shielding of Concentric Spherical Shells.        97
 most effective shields; and we are thus led to enquire which
is the best arrangement that can be made under specified
 conditions as to the magnitude of the space at our disposal or
 as to the weight of the shielding material used. The answer
 to this question is supplied by the following discussion.
    As the formulae are somewhat heavy, I shall for the most
part confine myself to shells formed of the same material and
separated by air-gaps.
    The second problem, to the result of which I think it is
desirable to draw attention, is that which defines the relations
between the shielding exerted by a number of concentric
shells, (1) on external space when the magnetic forces are
produced within the shells ; and (2) on the enclosed space
when the magnetic forces are produced outside. A full dis
cussion of this is given below.
   The whole of the investigation is subject to three limita
tions. I have confined myself:—
    (1) to concentric shells ;
    (2) to cases in which the equipotential surfaces are sur
       faces of revolution about a line through the common
       centre of the shells ;
    (3) to the case in which the permeability of each shell is
       constant.
   As regards the first two limitations, I think it will be
seen that the conclusions arrived at are capable of generaliza
tion in such a way as to enable a better approach to be made
to good shielding arrangements than would be the case if the
results of the discussion in the simple case of spherical shells
were unknown. The third limitation no doubt affects the
applicability of the formulae to practice. In spite of this,
however, I venture to think that they afford some useful
guidance, and that at all events they help to put the practical
problem in definite terms.
The Relation between tlie Shielded and Unshielded Fields when
   the Shielded Space is (1) within, (2) without the Shielding:

   Take the common centre of the shells as origin. Let the
potential within any shell be expanded in terms of zonal
spherical harmonics, then the terms corresponding to PB will
be of the form '
   Each such term can be discussed independently, and it is

   Let /io, fiu . . . . fim be the permeabilities of the enclosed
space and of the shells, and for generality let M be the per
meability of external space.
   Let the coefficient of Pn in the expansion of the potential
in the pth shell be
Then at the boundary between the pth and the (p + l)th
shells (of which the radius is ap) the following conditions
must be fulfilled: —
and
                              =MP+1{^P+1ar1-(«+i)fP+i/«r2h
 or if we write

 we get            ^ + ^,-^+1-^+1^=0,
 and     ^,-NMf«,t,-/»,+i*,+i +NMp+^PtP+l = 0-
 If we suppose, for the sake of symmetry, and without refer
 ence for the moment to the expression of physical facts, that
 the coefficients of Pn in the potentials in the central enclosed
 space and in external space are
 respectively, we have in all 2m + 4 quantities to deal with,
 and since the m shells have m+1 bounding surfaces, there

              Shielding of Concentric Spherical Shells.        99
are 2m +2 equations between them, all of which are linear
and of the types given above.
   We thus get a series of equations as follows :—

 Hi<h — MiN^i^ — /*o<£o + MoN^o^o = 0.
   In the case of shielding an enclosed space the potential of
the inducing forces can be expanded within and in the neigh
bourhood of the shells in terms of positive powers of r, and
since the potential of the induced magnetization must be
finite when r=0, this also is included in d>0. Hence
yfr0=0. In external space the expansion of the potential
contains both positive and negative terms, the former due
to the inducing, and the latter to the induced magnetization.
   As the inducing forces are given <J> is known.
   As yjr0=0 and         is given, the number of unknowns is
reduced by 2 and is equal to the number of the equations.
   If, on the other hand, the inducing forces are produced in
the central space within the shell, their potential must be
expanded in inverse powers of r if the series is to be conver
gent at the boundary of the enclosure and beyond it. Hence
^r0 is known. In external space the terms due both to the
induced and inducing magnetizations are expressed in nega
tive powers, and are included in            Thus <1> = 0.
   Now (fro/fa is the ratio of the shielded to the unshielded
field in the first case, in so far as it depends on the potential
term under consideration, and V/i}r0 is the corresponding
quantity when the forces are produced within the shell.
   The relation between these may now be found.
   Putting ijr0 = Q and writing A for the determinant formed
by the coefficients of the <f>'s and ^r's in the above equations,
except those which occur in the first and last columns, we

            Shielding of Concentric Spherical Shells,             101
the external space are the same, the ratios of the shielded to
the unshielded fields are the same for each harmonic term
whether the shielded field be external or internal.
   The most interesting application of this proposition is to the
first harmonic term.
   In this case the <f>n and $> are coefficients of terms of the
form rPj, that is the field is uniform ; and -vjr0 and ¥ are
coefficients of terms of the form Pi/r2, that is, the field is pro
 duced by a small magnet placed at the centre of the shells.
   Hence the shielding effect on external space when a small
magnet is placed at the centre of the shells is the same as the
shielding effect on the enclosed space when the shells are
placed in a uniform field.
   In what follows I shall for the most part suppose that the
magnetic forces are produced within the shells ; but the
above result enables the conclusions arrived at to be applied
to the case of shielding against external forces.

 but this approximate form is only valid if ax and Oq are not

    It will be observed that the shielding depends only on the
 ratio of ax : a0, and not on the absolute dimensions.

   This table illustrates the difficulty of improving the
shielding by increasing the thickness of a shield already
moderately thick. When the latter is increased in the ratio
5 : 1, and the internal empty space is reduced sixfold, the
shielded field is only reduced in the ratio of about 1 : 3.
   In general, if the volume of the material employed in a
shell is seven times that of the internal spherical space the
external field will bo reduced to 1/100, 1/200, or 1/300 of
its unshielded value, according as the permeability of the
material is 500, 1000, or 1500.
   Next consider the case of a small magnet placed at a
distance b from the centre of the shell.
   If the axis of the magnet lies on a diameter, and if the
moment is -tyQ, the unshielded potential is
where r is measured from the centre of the sphere.
   To find the potential in the shielded field, we must multiply
each term in the expression by the corresponding value of

    If the shell is thin, so that ao—a^ — t, where t is small, this

and by
        _^|2fiSI + 2.8.P16Bl + 8.4.P^S. + Acj|
respectively.
   If we consider any point on the diameter on which the
axis of the magnet lies and on the side towards which it is
moved, all the P's are equal to unity.
   The larger b becomes, the more important are the terms
in which the shielding factors S2, S3 are small, and the more
efficient is the shielding. The total force is, however, in
creased, as all these terms are added to the first. In other
words, the force is increased owing to the approach of the
magnet to the point considered, and it is only the addition
to its original value which is better shielded. The average
shielding is improved, but the force is increased.
   The converse statement holds good for the side from which
the magnet is moved. In that case the P's are alternately
 — 1 and +1, the shielding is less efficient, but the force is
diminished.
   It may be worth while to illustrate this by a numerical
example. Let the magnet be placed on a diameter at a
distance from the centre = half the external radius ; and let
the forces be calculated at points on the same diameter, the
distances of which from the exterior of the shell are also half
the external radius.

   Let the thickness of the shield be O01 of the radius, so
that t/o!=0'01, and let the permeability be 500.

   "'          +0-051 P6 + 0-023 P7 + 0-010 P8 + &c.}.
   Multiplying each term by the corresponding shielding
factor, the shielded force is :—

   The above series gives
                    -1-994^0/ax' and 0-248^/a!8,

 sufficiently approximate for the purpose of illustration.

   As «o and a3 do not occur in the coefficients of da^ and
da3 respectively, it is evident that no particular values of
either these quantities give a maximum or minimum value of
N? when the other three a's are arbitrarily selected.
   Again, the coefficient of da0 may be written
               <na?a2 { ai (fa — £a3) — ^ (£a2 — 7?a3) } .
   Now «2<aij and since £ is >17,

Hence this expression is always negative, ». e. ^ diminishes
as a0 increases, that is as the radius a0 diminishes.
   Thus adding the permeable material within the shell so as
to reduce the internal cavity always improves the sliielding.
   In like manner, by discussing the coefficient of da3, it may
be shown that an improvement is always effected by increasing
the external diameter.
   If, however, the smallest and largest radii are given, ^
may be a maximum or minimum if the coefficients of dax and

   Let us first suppose that ax is also given, i. e. that the dimen
sions of the inner shell are fixed, then the equations enable
us to determine the effect of adding another external shell

   We may first suppose the external shell to be of vanishing

^{a0 — a1)<^a0—r]a1.
   Hence the addition of a thin external shell reduces % t. e.
improves the shielding.

but in order that this may correspond to a physical reality we
must have
                            «1>a2>a3.
The first of these inequalities when combined with the above
equation is equivalent to
                    «i£(«o — *i) >«s(f«o — V*i) •
   As aj is >«3 and f (oq— «i)<fo0— ija^ this condition may

    The second is equivalent to
                    «l(f«0 —      >«3^(«0—
which is always true.
    Hence we conclude that if the external radius of the outer
shell is so chosen that
                               e<*o—y<*i
there will be a maximum value of the shielding, while an air
space intervenes between the two shields. There will not be a
maximum if a3 is greater than this limit. In the case of the
first harmonic the condition for a maximum becomes
                     a >a f fa " W 1
where a0, ax, and a3 are the radii of the corresponding surfaces.
If there is such a maximum it is evident that for some
thickness of the external shell less than that which gives the
best result the shielding must be the same as if the whole of
the air-gap were filled.
   To find this value of a2 we have to put a? — ^ in the
expression for "9, and equate the result to the value of ¥

 thickness of the external shell increases from without inwards.
    If a3I<a!, the shielding at first improves and then
 deteriorates as the thickness increases.

whole of the space between the shells is filled, i. e. as when

    Turning next to the case when                  and oj both vary, we
 may determine the maximum shielding for given external
 and internal radii.
   The conditions to be fulfilled are :
                  — fas^Oj — «8) + «i*(f«s-- «J«b) = 0 1           _ ^
    Adding these we get either
                         cc% — OL\ or ez^tZi = (X^ccg.
    The first has reference only to the point at which the
 maximum value is equal to that produced when all the space
 between the shells is filled.
    The latter leads to the equation
                   f«i\<H — *3) — «32ao(£<*i —V»i) = 0.
    This equation is a biquadratic in oj.
    Since the expression is positive when a2=— so and nega
 tive when aa = a3, there is at least one real root <«3, with
 which, since «3>«g, we are not concerned.

 110           Prof. A. W. Rucker on the Magnetic
    As regards roots >a3, it is evident, since the whole ex
 pression is positive when a2 = oo,that there is at least one real
 positive root >a3. Also, as faj—rja3 is positive, that there
 can only be one positive root >at.
    This root must be <au i. e. since asa1 = a0att a22<a0a3; i. e.
 the expression must be positive when o22 = a0a3.
    This is equivalent to the condition
           f V«o( V<*<>— ^<h)> V«3(f V<*o— V */aZ>-
    As      u0>a3 and £ V*o— £ V«3<£ V«o— *7 V*s,
 this equality may be, but is not necessarily, satisfied.
    Before discussing these equations further, it is convenient
 to modify their form.
    Let
            J = J = X;       „ = *(!-«);        * = L.
            at! 03                              a3
    Then from (6),
                   X3(X-l)-L(X-l + e) = 0, ....                (7)
 and from (4),
                               ^(N + 1)VL
             Ir° ~ p {(X-l + e)2L-(l-e)X2(X-l)2} ;           1   ;
 or from (7),
    /Yo~ P(X-iy{\*-L(l-ej} ~ (X-l)2{X4-L(l-e) '                   w
since                 p.(N + l)2 = f— »7=ef.
    In equation (8) ¥ becomes infinite when X= 1 and when
X4 = L(l-e).
    The first of these assumptions is inconsistent with equa
 tion (7), and by substituting from \4 = L(1— e) in (7) we get
                     (X--l + e)2=-e(l-e),
which is only possible if either e or 1 — e is negative, which
they can never be, as £ is always >tj, and t) and £ are always
positive.
   In the case when the permeability is very great, J = t; = N/x2
nearly and e may be neglected in equation (7), so that Xs = L.
   If, however, X— 1 is very small, i.e. if the shells are very
thin, the term in e may be comparable with the others, and
the approximation is not legitimate. In cases where it may

                   Shielding of Concentric Spherical Sliells.       Ill
    be applied we get from equation (8) the very simple result
                              NV      (\-l)3~ (VI-l)3"
        In this case also the four quantities a0, aXf a2) a3 are in
     Geometrical Progression.
        If a!=Oi, a0/o3=\s =L, so that (7) reduces to
                                 ( v/L-l)2 = e,                      (9)
     of which the root greater than unity is VL = 1+
        This furnishes a limit below which the equations do not
     aPPty-             ...            ,
         Below the limiting case lamination must be disadvan
     tageous.
         If we remove a thin slice either from the exterior or from
     the interior surface of a single shell, the shielding power is
     impaired; and if the shielding does not attain a maximum
     when this spherical crack is supposed to traverse the shell
     from inside to outside, it must always be less than if there is
     no crack.
         Next, comparing the shielding effect of a single shell with
     that of a double shell of which the innermost and outermost
     radii are the same as that of the single shell, if wo write in
     equation (2) a3 for au and put 57 = £(1 — e), we find by com
     paring with (4) that the single shell will shield best if
   ape                                      oo^iatje8
— a3(l — e) — (1 - 6)02(00— aj) (03— at,) +a1\as—a3{l — e)}{a0-a1{l — e) ',
     which reduces to
         Now if we diminish au i. e. increase the outer radius of
      the inner shell, ccq/^ is increased ; and in like manner by
      diminishing the inner radius of the outer shell o2/a3 is in
      creased. Hence the largest value of the left-hand side of the
      inequality is attained when a^**, so that if a3/a3 = \u and
      cto/oj = \, Wi = Ij.
          Thus
                       (Xl_l)(X-l) = (£_l)(X-l),
      of which the largest value is ( yX — l)2-
          If e is greater than ( i^L — 1)2, lamination is injurious, the
      limit thus fixed being the same as that previously found.

  112           Prof. A. W. Riicker on the Magnetic
     Above this limit, if for a given oq and a3 we choose ax and
  a2 so that
                        GHGH
 the two shells will shield better than one, i. e. better than if
  the whole of the space between the innermost and outermost
 surfaces were rilled with the permeable material.
     It of course follows a fortiori that the best arrangement of
 the two shells will, under these circumstances, give better
 results than the single shell, a conclusion which can be verified
 directly.
     For we must by (8) and (2) have
                         LV                  he
               (\-l)2{X*-L(l-e)} < L-(l-e)'
 where
                    X3(\-l)-L(\-l + e) = 0.
    Eliminating L, the inequality becomes
                      (l_e){e_(X_W>0.
 which, since e is always positive and < 1, must always be true.
    At the limiting point the curves which give the relations
between L and the ^P's for one and two shells respectively
touch each other.

which is the same as the value obtained in the case of the
single shell.
  The shielding factor in the limiting case is obtained by
putting XS = L = (1+ \/e)s in (8), or in the corresponding
expression for a single shell. In either case

 if we remember that the a's diminish from aj to ab and that
 £ is > 17, it is easy to see that the coefficient is the difference
 of two positive quantities of which the second is the larger.

      Hence the whole coefficient is negative, or              diminishes as
  ato increases, t. e. as the radius a0 diminishes. Thus, as we
 should expect, we obtain the same result as before, viz., that
 the reduction of the radius of the innermost surface always
 improves the shielding. In like manner if a6 increases the
 shielding improves.
      Let us now suppose, as before, that the outermost and
 innermost radii are given. The best arrangement is then
 found by equating the coefficients of dau dot2, and rf«3, and
 c?a4 to zero.
     By eliminating the terms in a4 and a5 from the first pair,
 and also from the second pair of these equations, we get

     In the cross multiplications by which these equations are
 obtained, we assume a4— «6gfc0.
     If ax=a^ or ai=a3 two of the shells are fused into one.
Putting this case aside and substituting for (£a0 — vai)/(jxo~m «i)
in the second equation from the first we get

 reduce to
     It must be remembered that in obtaining these equations
 we have thrown out the alternative cases where any two con
 secutive values of a become identical ; i. e. cases in which
 the three shells become two, either by fusion or by the dis-
 pearance of one.
    Thus the solution for the case of two shells is contained
in the general equations for three shells, but the equality of
the above groups of ratios holds good only when there are
three.
    It remains to assure ourselves that in the case of three
shells all the variables give minima simultaneously.
    Thus, considering the coefficient of da^ the coefficient
of a* is
    Comparing these term by term, we see that the terms are
either equal or are less in the second expression. Hence
the coefficient of a* is positive. If, then, at is a little less
than the critical value, the coefficient of dav must be negative.
Hence, as at increases up to the critical value ¥ diminishes,
t. e. the critical value of av corresponds to a minimum.
    The other coefficients if treated in the same way lead to
the same conclusion. We may now proceed to put equation
(ID) into the simplest form for calculation.

numerical calculation has been applied may be summed up as

    The great advantage of the lamination of the shielding
material is here well exhibited.
   As the external field varies slowly in the neighbourhood of
the minimum, a considerable economy of material may be
effected without much sacrifice of efficiency. Thus, in the
case of two shells, we have seen that whereas to secure the
minimum external field (0'OOOG of the unshielded field) the
volume of the material used must (in the case considered) be
five times the internal volume, a practically identical result
 (0"0007) can be obtained by the use of a volume 3"66, while an
 efficiency four times greater can be obtained by a volume 4*8.

confine myself to the case of two shells when the magnet is in
the centre. In this case ax = 1/cii3 &c, so that the condition

    In this case therefore, as in that in which the radius of the

122            Prof. A. W. Riicker on the Magnetic
 outer surface was given, if very thin shells are used, lamination
 is injurious. The higher the permeability the smaller is the
 lower limit of thickness above which lamination is useful. If
                                         3
 the permeability is great, the limit is 5— x radius. If we put

                         «3
in equation (29), we get 02=a3, i.e. the thickness of the
external shell vanishes in the limiting case.
    I now proceed to give some numerical examples of the
application of these formulaB. Equation (30) is troublesome,
but when fi is large so that f and 17 are nearly equal it may
be simplified.
    It then reduces to
    We have already seen that when the radius of the outer
shell is twice the smallest radius, the best result is obtained
when the volume of the shells is five times the volume of the
space enclosed by the smaller shell.
    The above equation may be used to determine whether a
still better arrangement is possible with the same volume of
material, if we suppose the radius of the external surface
variable.
    If «o=l, 1/R=5, and equation (31) is found to have a
root such that
                        l/a3 = 9'5 nearly.
    This gives
                      as = VW5 = 2-118 ;
and, as in the previous calculation we assumed «3=2, it is
evident that the two critical points nearly coincide.
    In this case we get
                    a,=a0(l-«3/R) = 9/19,
from                       «2 = 18/101.
   The magnitude of the shielded field is practically the same
as before.
    It must be remembered that neither the equation in a3 nor
the ratio ^/^r0 are valid when £ is put =i) if the shells are
thin or (which amounts to the same thing) if R is large.
   The best method of dealing with the problem is, then, as
follows :—

             Shielding of Concentric Spherical Shells.      1 23
   Write                  £ = v(l + e),
where e is so small that terms in e may he neglected, unless
divided hy a small quantity.
   Then equation (30) may be written
        (i+*)WH)'*sa-i)}
   The terms in e may therefore be neglected unless R/a3 is
large.
   As an example, let H=10, i.e. let the volume of the metal
be one tenth of the volume of the enclosure.
   If then, as before, we take /*=501, o0=l,
            .\   f = ,7(l + 0-009)   and   e = 0-009.
    If we neglect all the terms in e we get
                            - = 2-17.
Hence                   eR/a3 = -1953,
which cannot be neglected when compared with unity.
   Taking this term into account,
                           l/a3 = 1-875.
   As the radii vary inversely as the cube roots of the a's, the
two values of the external radius are 1-233 and 1*294. As
the shielding varies slowly when near a minimum value, as
the outer shell is displaced outward, it is probable that no
very grave error would be introduced even in this case hy the
use of the approximate equation. The error would, how
ever, increase rapidly as the volume of material employed
diminished.
   Using the more correct value we get
 a^a/l-g) =1-0-0533 = 0-9467,
--=J---- + -=0-l-l-875-r056 + l = -1-831.
   Ci.j  XX   a.   ax   «0
   Hence we have for the best arrangement,
         03=0-5333, «j=0-5461, ai=0-9467, «0=1,
or       a3= 1-233,    03=1-223,     ax= 1-018,    «o=l.

   124           Prof. A. W. Riicker on the Magnetic
     It will be convenient to throw equation (4) into a form
   suitable for calculation when the shells are thin and the
   permeability is great.
     With the same notation as that just employed it becomes
                       {-*>+*<1+^)(1+^)}

  which, in the case under consideration, leads to the result
                              ¥/^0= 0-064.
     By (2), if the same amount of material were concentrated
  in a single shell, we should have
                              V/yfr0= 0-089.
     In this case therefore the advantage of the best arrange
  ment is much less than if a larger amount of material were
  used.
     No very great disadvantage is entailed in such a case if
  the outer shell be outside its best position, as, if we take
  l/a3=3, we get
                            ^0=0-069,

best position for a narrow crack within the shell is such
that the volume it encloses is the harmonic mean of the
volumes enclosed by the inner and outer surfaces of the
shell respectively.
    Case of Two contiguous Shells of different Permeabilities.
   It is evident that the question as to the best arrangement
of two shells of different permeabilities cannot be very defi
nitely answered.
   If the dimensions of the shells are variable, the more of
the more permeable material we use, the more complete will
be the shielding.
   If, however, the dimensions of the shells are fixed, under
certain circumstances (such as when its thickness is much
the greater) it will be better to make the outer shell of the
more permeable material, while under other conditions the
reverse arrangement may be best.
   Though the problem is not of any great practical interest,
it may be worth while to indicate the mode of solution.
   Let /iQ=^3=l, and let the permeabilities of the two shells
be p. and p^. Then we get

    Hence, if ^ and ^ be the external potential when the
 permeability of the external shell is ft and ft respectively,
 we get, by exchanging the positions of the symbols ft and ft
 in the above expression and subtracting,

 Hence the exchange of materials causes no difference if either
ft=ft or if the second factor on the right-hand side vanishes.
   If both the shells are thin let a2 = ai+tu and a0=a1—t0,
where the squares of tx and t3 may be neglected.

and therefore the two sides of the inequality are always of
opposite signs.
   Hence, if the permeability of the outer shell is increased,
the values of as and ax corresponding to the best arrangement
under the circumstances supposed increase, t. e., the outer
shell increases and the inner shell diminishes in thickness.
   In the case, therefore, of material such as iron, if the field
within the outer shell is such that the permeability of the
outer shell is the greater (which will generally be the case
when the enclosed space is protected), it will be better to
make the external shell relatively thicker than the above
calculation would indicate. Conversely, if the inner shell
has the higher permeability its thickness should be increased.
   There is no difficulty in eliminating a.x and 03 in turn from
the relations obtained by equating the coefficients of dax and
dot in (32) to zero, and thus finding the best values in any
given case for which the equations can be solved by trial.
                             Summary.
   In conclusion it is perhaps desirable tosummarize the principal
results of the foregoing discussion. In doing so I shall con
fine myself exclusively to the corresponding cases of a small
magnet placed in the centre of the shells, and of shells placed
in a uniform field, and thus the interpretation of the symbols
is valid for these cases only.
   The results depend upon two quantities, viz., the ratio of
the outermost to the innermost radius of the series of shells.

              Shielding of Concentric Spherical Shells.        129
In the paper the cube of this quantity is indicated by the
symbol L=«o/«n=an3/ao3> where n refers to the outermost
surface.
    The other quantity e is a function of the permeability. In
the cases which I am now considering,
              6= (2M + l)fr+g) = 2^aPProximatel*
when n is large.
    If we suppose the innermost radius of the shells (oq) to be
fixed, and the thickness of the space utilized for shielding to
increase gradually from zero to a thickness t, the material
employed is most efficient if fashioned in the form of a single
shell until
                t                  3
                — = (1 + e)* — 1=5- approximately,
if (i is large.
    After that the material will be better employed if we divide
it into separated shells ; but the result obtained by the best use
of the given quantity of material can be still further improved
by filling up the space between the shells with more of the
material, provided the thickness of the whole shell occupied
by the shielding machinery is less than the value given by
if p is large.
    After this limit is passed it becomes positively injurious to
fill the whole of the shielding space with the permeable
material.
    Better results can always be obtained by two shells with
the same internal and external radii.
    If the ratio of these radii (a%\<h= v'L) is given, the best
arrangement of two shells is defined by the equations
                             «2   «0
where X is given by the equation
                    \8(X-l)-L(\-l + e)=0.

where X is defined by the equation
                   X* (\ - 1 ) - L*(X - 1 + e) = 0.
    In both cases, when the permeability is great the best
arrangement is that in which the radii of the successive
 bounding surfaces of the shells are in Geometrical Pro
gression.
    The ratio of the shielded to the unshielded field when the
best arrangement is adopted is

 determined from the equation given above as appropriate to
that case.
    When the permeability is great and the shells are not very

 two shells, when (1) the innermost radius and the total volume

 most radii and the total volume of permeable material are

    In any case of an arrangement in the form of two shells of
 materials of different permeability, in order to obtain the best
 result, the thickness of the shell formed of the more permeable
 material should be greater, and tbat of the shell of less per
 meable material should be less than is given by the above
 rules.
    The equations are obtained by which the best arrangement
 can be calculated, if the permeabilities and external and
 internal radii are given.

VIII. Hysteresis attending the Change of Length by Mag
    netization in Nickel and Iron. By H. Nagaoka, Riga-
    kushi *.
                               [Plates I. & II.]
SINCE Joule's discovery f that the length of iron is
        changed by magnetization, the subject has been studied
by Mayer J, Barrett §, Bidwell ||, and Bergetl. Bidwell
carried the investigation into very strong magnetizing fields,
and discovered several new facts concerning the changes of
length in ferromagnetic substances. So far, however, nothing
has been definitely established regarding the manner in which
these substances change length during cyclic changes of
magnetization. The object of the present investigation is to
ascertain if there is any hysteresis in the changes of length
during magnetic cycles, and at the same time to determine
its amount.
    Several fruitless attempts were made before I obtained
any definite result. The first method I had recourse to was
that of interference-fringes. A small brass plate was brazed
to the end of an iron wire, and a plane glass plate placed upon
it. Separated by a thin air-film was a plano-convex lens of
about 40 centim. focal length, with 23 fine dots on its plane
face. The lens rested on a tripod. These different pieces of
apparatus were detached from Fizeau's dilatometer. The
change of length was determined by observing the displace
ment of the fringes produced by sodium-light. From the
position of the dots it was possible to determine a change
amounting almost to a hundredth part of a sodium wave
length D. But as each observation of the fringes required a
few minutes, it was difficult to keep the temperature constant ;
and, moreover, owing to the uniformity of distribution of
the fringes, it was not always easy to count the number dis
placed. Consequently it was necessary to devise a more
delicate method, and, if possible, some means of compensating
for temperature-effects.

   I also tried an experiment with a system of levers ; trat it
did not work smoothly, so that the readings were capricious
and could not be trusted.
   These faults were, to a great extent, removed by the
apparatus which I describe below. The horizontal and
vertical projections of the apparatus are represented in fig. 1
and fig. 2 (Plate I.) respectively. The essential part consists
of a stout brass bar 53 centim. long, 1 centim. broad, and
1*1 centim. high. It is provided with three levelling-screws
(^i> h> h)- A carefully polished V-groove is cut along the
bar. A small rectangular brass pillar (p) is erected at one
 corner of the bar. A small vertical V-groove is cut on it,
 and on this two points of the lever rest. The lever with
a mirror attached is shown in fig. 3, both from the front and
 from behind. It is a small rectangular piece of brass with
three steel points (pi,»2, p3), of which two (plf p3) rest on
 the V-groove in jo. The, other point (p3) comes in contact
 with a small plane glass plate, which is fixed to the end of the
 movable brass rod. The point of contact is in the prolonged
 axis of the wire whose change of length is to be determined.
 The distance of the line />, p2 from p3 is V125 millim. Pre
liminary testing showed that the relative positions of these
 three fine steel points were not directly affected by the
 magnetizing forces. The plate has three holes (Ax, A3, A3).
 To the holes A3 h3 is attached a thin brass wire, which is
 pulled at its middle by means of a small spiral spring (s2)
 of hard brass wire. Another spring (sj), similarly made, is
 attached to the other hole. These springs can be adjusted by
 means of slide arrangements,      and     attached to the sides
 of the bar. The circular mirror, m, attached to the lever was
 obtained from Hartmann and Braun.
    The greatest difficulty in the measurement of change of
length by magnetization arises from the temperature-changes
produced by a current passing into the magnetizing coil.
 On this account most experimenters have passed the current
 only for a very short time, and observed the change before
 the temperature produced any effect.          The consequence
 is that the changes are traced only by jumps. I found
 that the temperature-effect could be greatly compensated for
 by applying the principle of the gridiron-pendulum. This
 end was achieved by using zinc rods of different lengths such
 that, in any combination, the total expansion due to small
 changes of temperature in particular lengths of zinc and iron
 (or nickel) was equal to that in a particular length of brass.

            Length by Magnetization in Nickel and Iron.        133
 Zinc rods 5 millim. thick were carefully turned on a lathe, and
 cut into proper lengths.
    The extremities of the zinc rod (z in fig. 1) are concave,
 so that the convex ends of the brass rods (a, w') come into
 contact at the axial points of the rod. To the ends of the
 wire (w) are brazed two short brass rods («/, ic7), about
 1 centim. long and 5 millim. thick, with their ends made
convex. [In brazing the wire care was taken that the axis of
the wire coincided with the axes of the rods.]
    A brass rod (b), 5 millim. thick, is placed in contact
 with w'. At the end of the rod a plane glass plate is
 attached, so that the steel point p3 of the lever comes in
 contact with it. At the other extremity of the row of rods
 is a stop. It consists of a triangular prism of brass to
which a brass rod (d), 5 millim. thick, is attached. The
prism fits in the V-groove, and is fixed tightly by means of
a clamping-screw, c. To adjust the length (b c) it is pro
vided with a slit g. The screw (c) can be placed at any
part of the slit, and the position of the movable system
1, v/, w, w*, z, can be so adjusted that the plane of the lever is
perpendicular to the axis of the system. The slight push
exerted by the springs (s1} Sg) on the movable system prevents
the play of different parts among each other, and was sufficient
to overcome friction during contraction.
   Perhaps the following snort explanation of figs. 1 and 2
will make the various parts of the apparatus clear :—Zj, l2, l3,
levelling-screws ; a, lever with three steel points (dots in the
figure) ; p, pillar with vertical groove ; slt s2, brass springs

the wire w ; w, wire whose change of length is to be mea
sured ; z, compensating zinc rod ; d, brass rod attached to
the stop ; g, slit in the stop ; c, clamping-screw.
   The rod was placed inside a solenoid 30 centim. long, which
lay in a horizontal position magnetic east and west. It had a
resistance of 0-63 ohm, and gave a field of 37*97 C.G.S. units
for a current of one ampere. The internal diameter of the
solenoid was 3*0 centim., and no part of the measuring appa
ratus came in contact with it. Care was taken to place the
apparatus along the axis of the solenoid, and so to place the
wire that its middle point coincided with that of the solenoid.
These precautions were always necessary, especially when the
wire was thick.

   The optical method for observing the change of angle
requires little explanation. When the Gauss-Poggendorff
method is used at a great distance, it requires very strong
illumination of the scale and a good observing-telescope ; or
when the reflected spot of light is read on the scale, electric-
or lime-light must be used. This inconvenience can be
removed in the following manner (see fig. 4).
   A fine glass thread t is placed vertically in the focus of a
small achromatic lens c, and illuminated by a lamp. The
ray, after passing the lens, is reflected by a right-angled
prism p, and thrown on the mirror m. After reflexion in the
plane mirror, the ray traverses an achromatic lens L (whose
focal length was about 70 centim. in my experiment). The
image of the glass thread is then observed by means of a
microscope, M, provided with a miorometer. I used a micro
scope detached from a geodetic comparator; the magnifying-
power was about 40, but if great exactness be desired it can
be increased about five times, provided sufficient illununa-
tion be given. In place of the glass thread at t I tried a
fine slit, spider or silk thread, and diamond traces on glass ;
but it was found best to use a glass thread of such thickness
that its image was a little greater than the movable double
threads of the micrometer. In the present experiment,
1776 divisions of the micrometer were equal to 524"*1, so
that a single division was equal to 0""295. The displacement
of one micrometer division, therefore, gave a change of
length
                                4-848 x 10-" centim.
           = 0-1125 x 0-295 x——-—•              u
           = 0-805 x 10-7 centim. = 0*00137 \,
where Xp represents the wave-length of the sodium-line D.
   In experiments with the nickel wire through wide ranges
of magnetizing force, the contraction was so great that the
image of the thread passed out of the field of the microscope.
The lens and microscope were then replaced by a telescope,
in the focus of which was placed a scale divided to tenths of
a millimetre ; a single division corresponded to 20'2 x 10-8
centim. It is easy to see that the collimating-lens c can be
replaced by the lens L. For this, it is necessary to place
the prism between M and L, and the thread t at such a
distance that the optical path through the prism to the lens
is equal to its focal length. This method of measuring small

            Length by Magnetization in Nickel and Iron.             135
chaDges of angle can be advantageously used in various
other researches *.
    The magnetizing current was supplied by Bunsen cells,
and its strength was measured by a Thomson Graded Gal
vanometer. The galvanometer was gauged by means of a
deciampere balance. The current was always changed con
tinuously by means of a liquid slide included in the circuit.
    A rough plan of the arrangement of the different parts is
given in fig. 4.
    The hysteresis accompanying the change oflength in nickel
is not so complicated as in iron. I will first describe a few
experiments made with the former metal. A nickel wire,
194 centim. long and 2*04 millim. thick, was carefully
annealed by placing it due magnetic east and west in a por
celain tube, and heating it red-hot in a charcoal fire. The wire
was then placed in the V-groove of the apparatus, and inserted
in the solenoid. The strength of the current was gradually
increased, and, at convenient intervals, the corresponding
readings of the micrometer and galvanometer were noted,
till the magnetic field was 10-2 C.G.S. units. The contrac
tion of the wire was at first very slow, but when the field
was about 8 the rate of change was greatly increased.
As the field was diminished the wire tended to return to
its former state, but not by its former course. There was
lagging, so that the wire, for the same strength of field, was
more contracted than when the field was on the increase.
In fact, when the field was diminished to zero, the wire
still remained contracted 38#2 x 10-8 of its original length.
When the current was reversed, the wire continued in its
tendency to recover its former length until the reversed field
became equal to 5. There the recovery stopped, and the
wire began once more to contract, and the contracted length
in field — 10" 1 was nearly the same as that in field + 10"2.
On decrease of current, the same succession of changes took
place. The changes are graphically represented in fig. 5
 (PL I.), where the course is in the order of the letters of the
alphabet. The curve c d efg A of a cycle from the highest
field and back to it is nearly symmetrical with respect to the
line of zero field, forming complete loops on both sides.
The measurements are given in Table I. at the end of the
paper.
    On reannealing and experimenting between fields + 30,
    * I found lately that it is more advantageous to replace the prism p
 and the mirror m by a small rectangular prism attached at m. The
 positions of telescopes and collimators must be suitably changed.

136      H. Nagaoka on Hysteresis attending Change of
we get a similar curve of hysteresis (fig. 6, PI. I). The
only difference between the two is that the field which gives
the minimum contraction is higher in the second case.
   With still greater range of the magnetizing field very
similar results are obtained, as shown by the curves (figs. 6
and 7, PL I.). An examination of these curves will illustrate
the character of the hysteresis better than a mere verbal
description.
   The contraction of the magnetized nickel wire does not
show any maximum so far as the experiment goes, but the
curves have two points of inflexion, one in weak and the other
in tolerably large fields. The measured changes of length
are nearly the same as those given by Bidwell *. (See Table II.
at the end of the paper.)
    Before entering into the description of the hysteresis
observed in iron, I will describe a few experiments on the
changes observed in iron wires of different lengths. The
curves A, B, C (fig. 1, PI. II.) represent the elongations
observed in iron wires whose lengths were 66, 22, and 10'6
times the diameter respectively. In the longest, the elonga
tion reaches a maximum in field 70 nearly, and shows an
inflexion-point before reaching the maximum. In curves B
and C the inflexion-point has not been reached. On con
tinuing the curve B (given in fig. 3, PI. II.), the maximum
is found in field 230, which is very large compared to the
former. This relation of the elongation to the length of
 the magnet is very analogous to the well-known relation of
 magnetization to length.
    The changes wrought by a cycle of magnetization on the
 length of iron wire is so complex as to require a detailed de
 scription. An experiment made on a wire 19*4 centim. long
 and 2*83 millim. thick will illustrate the nature of the hys
 teresis. (For measurements, see Table III.) The curve
 given in fig. 2 (PI. II.) shows that the elongation in weak
 fields increases gradually, but that, beyond a certain strength
 of field, it increases rapidly until it reaches the " wendepunkt."
 The rate of change then gradually lessens, and the elongation
 reaches a maximum in field 70. Beyond this point, in
 increasing fields, the elongation diminishes steadily. The
 curve thus traced up to field 305 is abed. With decreasing
 current the wire again elongates, but shows lagging, so that
 the length of the wire for the same strength of field is shorter
 on the return journey until field 120 is reached. Here the
 branches of the curve cross. In lower fields accordingly the

 elongation is greater in the descending than in the ascending
cnrve, until field 25 is reached. At this point the wire
begins to shorten very abruptly. In zero field the wire is,
nevertheless, longer than at the first maximum. When the
field is reversed, the length continues to decrease, but only
slightly, until field —15 is reached. Here the minimum
occurs, and the wire begins again to lengthen. The rate
of increase is comparatively slow, and reaches a maximum
in field —70. Beyond this the wire shortens quite rapidly,
and nearly in the same way as in ascending positive fields.
With decreasing magnetizing current, the wire again shows
hysteresis and the part I m goes below k I. The two branches
cross in field —110, and the wire goes on elongating till
it reaches a maximum atp in field —25. The course of
changes from I till the field reaches its former maximum
value is nearly similar to the curve d e f g hkl, as will be
seen from inspection of the curve Impqrst (the return
curve beyond q is given in dotted lines to avoid confusion).
Although the curve of hysteresis during a magnetic cycle
is very complex,' it is symmetrical with respect to the line
of no magnetizing force. It is evident that the maximum
and minimum points in the curve are due to the lagging of
the maximum elongation.
   The measured elongations of the wire are nearly the same
as those given by Bidwell. The field at which the wire
recovers its original length will probably be about 400. On
extrapolating from the curves given by Bidwell *, I find that
when the wire has no longitudinal stress it will show no
elongation at about the same strength of the magnetizing
force.
   The course of the curve is somewhat changed when the
limiting field is only a little greater than that of maximum
elongation. This case is elucidated in fig. 3 (PI. II.), from
an experiment made on a wire 10*5 centim. long and 4*75
millim. thick. On account of the shortness of the wire com
pared to its thickness, the first maximum is only reached in
field 230 approximately, and, moreover, the slope of the curve
in higher fields is very gradual. After describing the curve
abed, the curve defghklmnpqrs is traced during a
cycle. The peculiarity observed in this case is that in place
of having the maxima as in fig. 2, there are curious " humps "
in the curve at / and n. Had the magnetizing current been
sufficiently strong to cause a large decrease of elongation, the

maxima would probably have been produced at or near
these places. (For measurements see Table IV.)
   Fig. 4 (PI. II.) represents double magnetic cycles made
on a wire 14-2 centim. long and 2"83 millim. thick. When
the maximum elongation was reached in field 75 (which is
slightly greater than in fig. 2, because the wire is shorter),
the magnetizing force was decreased and a cycle performed.
The cyclic curve is b c d ef g h. The curve evidently shows
hysteresis, and is symmetrical with respect to the vertical axis.
When this cycle was completed, the field was further in
creased till a sufficient decrease of elongation set in, and a
second cycle with greater range was gone through. The
curve (shown in dots) is d' e'fg h' k' m' rip' q' r' s' t' u', and is
in every respect similar to that given in fig. 2
   The experiments above described prove that elongation
in iron and contraction in nickel by magnetization both show
decided hysteresis. The curve of hysteresis is symmetrical
with respect to the line of zero magnetizing force, so that the
elongation or contraction during cyclic changes is an even
function of the magnetizing force. When the wire is mag
netized, it cannot be brought to its original length by simple
reversal of field. While this paper was passing through the
press, Mr. Lochner published the results of his investigation
on the change of length in soft iron by magnetism, in the
December number of this Magazine. The curve given in
fig. 3 of his paper distinctly shows hysteresis.
   Some of the elongations measured in nickel and iron wires
are given in the following Tables.

     IX. Magnetic-Elongation and Magnetic-Twist Cycles.
            By Prof. C. G. Knott, D.Sc, F.R.S.E*
IN measuring the successive changes of length of iron
      and nickel wires subjected to cyclic magnetizations, Mr.
Nagaoka has worked out a problem of extreme difficulty. Not
only is the quantity to be measured excessively minute, but,
unless very refined precautions are taken, it is certain to be dis
turbed beyond recognition by inevitable temperature-changes.
With admirable experimental skill, Mr. Nagaoka has applied
the principle of the gridiron-pendulum ; and the remarkable
smoothness of the curves which embody his instructive results
is an evidence of the perfection of the compensation. Joule's
original experiments, and all similar experiments of later date,
demonstrated the existence of what might be called a residual
elongation when the magnetizing force was removed. Mr.
Nagaoka has now given us the whole history of the magnetic-
elongation cycle, and has done for this very much more
difficult enquiry what Warburg and Ewing did for the mag
netization cycle.
   It may not be without interest to compare Mr. Nagaoka's
results with what I believe to be closely related results obtained
by myself several years ago. As long ago as ] 85 8 Wiedemann
discovered f that, when a current passes along a longitudinally
magnetized iron wire, the wire twists. In 1883 I observed
the same phenomenon with nickel wire similarly treated, and
more recently also with cobalt \. This phenomenon is, for
present purposes, conveniently called the Wiedemann Effect.
Maxwell suggested that it could be explained in terms of
the Joule Effect, as we may also conveniently term the
phenomenon which has been engaging Mr. Nagaoka's atten
tion. In my papers on the subject Ihave brought this probable
explanation prominently forward. The general features of
the Wiedemann Effect in the three magnetic metals were
just what was to be expected if Maxwell's explanation were
admitted. Not only so, but certain of these features sug
 gested corresponding characteristics in the Joule Effect—
characteristics which Mr. Bidwell has subsequently observed §.
   In my paper of 1891 (Trans. R. S. E. vol. xxxvi.) I have
 given the magnetic-twist cycles both for iron and nickel.

tudinal field acting on the wire was gradualty altered between
limits + H, and at suitable intervals observations of the twist
were made. With small range of field the hysteresis curve
obtained by plotting twist against field was very similar to the
well-known hysteresis curve of magnetization. But with
limiting fields stronger than the field which produced the
maximum twist, the hysteresis curve crossed itself twice and
formed three loops. A typical example is shown in the figure,
the magnetic-twist cycle being the Z-shaped graph with
the thick lines.
                         Magnetic-Twist Cycle.
    In the magnetic-elongation cycle, the change of sign of the
magnetizing force does not produce a change of sign in the
elongation. On the other hand, in the magnetic-twist cycle,
as the magnetizing force passes through zero from positive to
negative, the twist tends to do the same, though laggingly.
 Suppose, now, that we change the sign of the twist throughout
one-half of the cycle. In other words, take the reflexion of
 the one-half of the graph in the horizontal axis, as indicated
 by the thin lines in the figure. Then round off the sharp
 angles by the dotted lines, and we get a curve similar to
 Mr. Nagaoka's magnetic-elongation curve, fig. 2, Plate II.
 Or, taking Mr. Nagaoka's curves of fig. 4, Plate II., we
 may reflect one half of each in the horizontal axis, ioin the
 parts so as to have continuous flowing lines, and thus get
 curves identical in form with those of the magnetic-twiat
 cycle (see plate iii. of my paper already referred to).
    The magnetic-elongation curves obtained for nickel are all
 of the simpler two-looped form, the reason being that there
 is no maximum contraction for nickel. But with high ranges

              On the Law of Distribution of Energy.          143
of field, the magnetic-twist curve for nickel is exactly similar
to the same for iron. The reason is simply that with nickel
there is a field of maximum twist for each value of current
passing along the wire, although there is no field of maximum
elongation. The explanation of this is given in my paper of
1888 (Trans. R. S. E. vol. xxxv.). It is sufficient to note that
the twist, under a given combination of circular and longi
tudinal magnetizing forces, depends not only upon the elonga
tions but also upon some function of these forces which changes
sign with each, and to which the existence of the maximum
 twist is largely or altogether due. For even in the case of
 iron, which has a maximum elongation, the maximum twist
 occurs in quite a different field. Indeed the field of maximum
 twist varies with the value of the current along the wire.
    Meanwhile the broad character of the hysteresis in the
 magnetic-elongation cycle, as established by Mr. Nagaoka's
 delicate experiments, agrees perfectly with what might be
 inferred from the character of the hysteresis in the magnetic-
 twist cycle—a phenomenon whose experimental study is one
 of the simplest in the whole subject of magnetic strains.

            X. On the Law of Distribution of Energy.
                    By S. H. Burbury, F.Ii.SS
 IF there be in any space a great number of mutually acting
       molecules, Boltzmann's law of distribution of energy
 requires that the number per unit of volume of molecules
 whose coordinates and momenta lie between assigned limits
 varies as e~Hx+T) in the known notation. The proofs of that
 law given by Boltzmann and Watson are based on the hypo
 thesis that, from the instant when mutual action commences
 between two molecules to the instant when it ceases, no
 action takes place between either of them and any third
 molecule, or, as it is called, the encounters are binary. I
 propose to consider the more general case when, for instance,
 no group of molecules is ever free from the action of other
 parts of the system.

and all its coaxial minors shall be positive. Hence each ot
the coefficients a is positive, and 4a a,—VL is positive for
all values of p and q.
    If S be the energy of an association, the above condition is
necessary for its stability. So for two associations near to one
another, let the energy be a1xli + bl3xix3 + .. . + o1'ar1" + <fec.,
and let A be the double determinant 2 + 2au 2a2 . . . 2a/. . . .
Then in order that the two associations, considered as a single
system, may be stable, A and all its coaxial minors must be
 positive. If the expression for the energy contains no terms
 of the form bxx', where x belongs to one and x1 to the other
 association, A is the product of the two single determinants
 2 + 2a1( 2as . . . and z ± 2a/, 2a2'. . . , and if the condition be
 satisfied for them, it is satisfied for A. But if any terms of
 the form bxx' make their appearance, they may make A or
 some of its coaxial minors negative, and the two associations,
 though separately stable, may be unstable together, and dis
 sociation may ensue.
                               PiiRT II.
    (8) Now let us suppose that S is proportional to the kinetic
 energy, or to a part of" the energy, of an association. Let the
 number of association, or, as we will now call them, systems,
 be very great. Each has its own S. And we will effect a

                      Law of Distribution of Energy.             151
 redistribution of S among them in the following way. Con
 sider any group of N systems for which the variables are
 *ii> x2u "°«> an(l f°r which S has the values Sx, S, . . . SN.
 Let these contribute respectively «r,      s s &c. ; and let the
 contribution          be represented by the energy of a similar
 system whose variables are -—=:, —7=?, &c. ; and let            &c.
                                     V-N v-N                 «
 be represented in the same way.
    From that group of N systems we will form the variables
mj . . .        for one system in the new distribution by making
                           ( _xn+xn + . . . + xm
                        *1 =                          1

                         &c.                 &c.
 see post. (11).
    Now let us take at random other groups, each of N systems,
and deal with them in the same way. And so on until every
original system has appeared N times as a member of a group
of N.       Since in case of each group it loses ^ , it will finally
have parted with all its energy S. When this process has
been carried out, the whole of S for all the systems will have
been redistributed among them. And owing to the mode of
formation of xx' &c, the chance of the variables x^ ... xj of
any system in the new distribution having the values

    (9) If, then, for the original systems
                        /(*! . . . x.) =0e-»,
the law of distribution is the same for the new as for the
original system. In other words, it is unaffected by our
process of redistribution.
   If for the original systems ffa... xn) have any other
form, we shall choose ax, b^, &c, to satisfy the equations
                        -,      £n     — Du
                              :~TT'    x*x* = ~\) > ^c''

  152                Mr. S. H. Burbury on the
 where D is the determinant of ^ 2au j^u, &c, and then
 in the redistributed system the law will be
                                              nS
                        F(o1...vn) = Ce-n
 as before, and will remain unaffected by any further redistri
 bution. In stationary motion, therefore, F (cx . . . cj has the
           _n8
 form Ce 2T, with a quadratic function for S, whether the
 initial distribution /(#! . . . a?n) has that form or not.
    This assumes that the process of redistribution of the
 original systems has been carried out completely. If it be
 carried out only partially, as for instance if only a portion of
 the original systems be subjected to the process, the distribu
 tion in the new system will approximate more and more to
 the permanent form Ce 2T, according as the redistribution
 is more complete. And by successive partial redistributions
 it will ultimately be reduced to the permanent or stationary
 form.
    (10) The processes which we have supposed to take place
successively may, of course, take place simultaneously.
Further, we may suppose the whole process of redistribution
to take place at a given rate per unit of time. Finally, our
results will not be affected if the variables in any association
undergo any other series of changes during the same time,
provided these changes do not on average alter S. •
    (11) By the method of art. 8 energy is conserved in the
final result, but is not conserved in each separate process,
because generally S', the energy which we suppose to be
received by a system in the new distribution, is not equal to
¦ 1     8   *"      , the energy which the contributing systems
part with. That may create a difficulty in the application of
the method to a physical system, even although, when the
contributing systems are rapidly oscillating and in different
phases, it may be that S'= —— ° vr'"             ~ on *ne average
of a very short time.
    (12) If our associations be material systems fixed in space,
we may suppose the energy, S, of oscillation to be transmitted
through space— t. e. asther—in waves with conservation of
energy, so that the energy of a wave which passes per
xinit area and time through a spherical surface of radius R

                   Law of Distribution of Energy.               153
described about the centre of disturbance varies as , „,. or
             2                                            lira,"
 varies as ^, if N=47rR3 and the coordinates x, of which
that energy is a quadratic function, vary as -r^.      If, now, we
 may further assume that any number of such waves may
 coexist, so that the disturbance x at any point at any instant
 is the algebraic sum of the disturbances due to all the waves
 which are passing the point at that instant, the redistribution
 of S will go on in the physical system in exactly the same
way as in our analytical system—and with the same result,
                                          _bS
that the distribution denoted by Ce 2T will be permanent.
 The disturbances xx . . . xn in any system will be respectively
 — .— times the sums of the values of uthe corresponding
 2xt^ *7T
 disturbances in systems distant R from the one in question,
                                  T>
as they were t seconds ago, — being the velocity of wave-
motion. The potential energy, Xi °f the internal forces of a
system we suppose not to be capable of transmission in that
form. But if the law of distribution be e~h^+s'>, we know
that this distribution will not be affected by the internal
forces ; neither will it be affected, on the above hypothesis, by
the transmission of S. It will therefore be permanent.
    But if we are not allowed to assume the coexistence of
waves in the sense above stated, the law cannot be permanent,
except in the known case of binary encounters.
                              Part III.
    (13) Our investigation hitherto has been based on the
assumption that the N associations are independent of one
another ; that is, that the chance of the variables Xi...x„ in one
association having assigned values is independent of the
values of .r/ . . . x„ the variables in another association, or, if
/ (x) be the chance of any one of the first set having assigned
         df(x)
value, *., , = 0 for each x1.        The condition of complete
independence is that the expression for the energy contains
no term of the form bxx', where x and a/ belong to different
associations. This condition may not be satisfied if our
associations are material systems very near to one another.
    It is necessary to replace the stringent condition by one
which can be satisfied more easily, as follows :—In the first
place it will be shown that our method is applicable even

 154                  Mr. S. H. Burbury on the
when the associations are not all independent of each other,
provided we can choose in many ways a group of them con
taining a great number which are independent of each other.
   Let there be ~Nq systems, where N is very large and q a
positive integer to which we may assign any value. Let
them be called Au A2 . . . ANg. If it be not true that every
one of the Ny syste ns is independent of every other, never
theless it may be true, and we will assume that it is true, that
the N systems Ax, A1+?, Ai+2„, &c. are independent of each
other. And, similarly, the N systems A2, A2+s, &c. may be
independent of each other, and so on for other groups. On
this assumption that A,, Ai+?, &c. are mutually independent,
we may apply our metbod to them. And let Ft (fj . . . c)
dc1 . . . dcn be the chance that the sum of the a^'s in these N
systems, each divided by VN, shall be C\ . . .Ci + dcx, &c.
Then Ffo . . . cn) = Ce_— 2T. Also let F2(Cl . . cn) be the corre
sponding chance for the group A2, A2+„ &c. All the systems
being supposed similar in character, evidently
                 Fl(c1...cn) = ¥3(cl....cn)=&o.
But the result for any one of the groups of N systems cannot
dilfer from that for the whole       systems. Whence it follows
that F(ci . . . cB) for the N<^ systems
                  = F1(o1...c„) = F2(e1...c.)=&c.
                             -1?
                       = Ce a?.
   We are therefore at liberty to apply our method to the Nj
systems, provided that, although they are not all independent
of each other, yet we can divide them into groups, each of N
systems, the members of which are independent of one another.
   (14) Again, in order that the N systems A1; Ai+5, &c.
may be independent of each other, it will be sufficient if we
make every variable, as x, in Ai independent of every
variable ad in Ai+?, Ac, that is *^j^r must be zero or
negligible.
   Let us therefore consider a series of single magnitudes
«i, xs, &c. which may be the variables in many systems of «,
and let the chance of their simultaneously having assigned
values be
and let it be required to find the condition that • 'r'^ shall

                  Law of Distribution of Energy.               155
vanish.    In order to find           we integrate according to
each of the other variables between the limits ± oo . The
result will be proportional to e-(A-r12+Bi,ir)j where A does not
 concern us, and          a B, or the condition that          shall
                    axT         '                        dxr
vanish is that B = 0. Also B= . lr , where A is the deter-
minant of r rows % + 2ax 2a3. . . . and Alrrl a coaxial minor.
   (15) We have, then, to find a relation between the coefficients
au bu, &c, which will make AIr vanish compared with Alr rl
 without making all the coefficients b vanish which connect
 the variables in any one of the original associations with those
in any other. That can be done in many ways. It will be
 sufficient to give one example. Let us suppose all the a's
 equal to each other, and all the J's of the form bpf^\ equal
 to one another, and all other b's zero.
    Further, let bl3=b13= &c. =2ad.
    Then the determinant assumes the form
                              2a b . .
                    A=         b 2a b .

                               . . b 2a
 and iffr be its value for r rows, the law of formation is
                        fr=fr--0Vr-3                            (A)
 Since every / is to be positive, /r_, > fr.       Ultimately as r
 increases the ratio ^—f becomes constant.         Let its constant
                     fr-X
 value be \. Then equation A gives
 or                                   a/1-402
                              X-*±        2      '
 of which the positive sign will be taken. This result shows
 that if/ , or A, be always positive, 81 cannot be greater than
 or 6 greater than    Also if 6— we easily find A = r ¦+ 1 (2a) r,
 and therefore              .

     XI. On the Relative Strengths or " Avidities " of Weak
           Acids. By John Shields, D.Sc, Ph.D.*
WHEN the sodium salt of an acid A is mixed with the
          equivalent quantity of another acid B, the base will
in general be distributed between the two acids, and the ratio
of distribution will depend on the relative strengths of the
competing acids A and B.
   If f represent that fraction of the neutral sodium salt
which is decomposed on the addition of the acid B, then 1— £
will represent the quantity of the original salt which remains
undecomposed.
    By applying Gruldberg and Waage's law, after equilibrium
has taken place, we get
or
                           (w) =o,'
where c and Cj denote the velocities of the opposed reactions.
    The ratio of distribution of the base between the two acids
is therefore proportional to the square root of the ratio of the
 coefficients of velocity,
    This ratio of distribution gives us the measure of the
 relative strengths or, as Julius Thomsen has called it, the
 " avidities " of the acids for any given dilution.
    As regards the measurement of the ratio of distribution,
 Thomsen employed a calorimetric method ; but Ostwald,
 Gladstone, Jellet, Wiedemann, and Lowenthal and Lenssen
 employed various other methods, which, however, are not
 particularly well adapted for measuring the relative strengths
 of very weak acids. In the present paper I propose to show
 how the avidities of the weakest acids may be determined
 from the rate at which their salt-solutions are hydrolyzed.
 At this stage it will be convenient to point out that water is
 here regarded as a weak acid, and potash and soda as the same
 base since they are equally strong (cf. Reicher, Annalen,
 ccxxviii. p. 257).
    Arrhenius (Zeitsch. f. physikal. C/iem. v. p. 13, 1890)
 has shown that when two weak acids compete for the same
 base, the ratio of distribution is very nearly proportional to

the square roots of tho electrolytic dissociation-constants.
But the dissociation-constant is arrived at from the equation
in which m is the degree of electrolytic dissociation or the
ratio of the molecular conductivity at any given dilution, v, to
that at infinite dilution. Now, when m is very small, the
above equation becomes
or, when the dilution for different acids is the same,
                            mi     ki
i. e. the electrolytic dissociation ratios are as the square
roots of the dissociation-constants, or directly as the ratios of
distribution.
   According to Guldberg and Waage's law (as enunciated by
Julius Thomsen), the ratios of distribution are as the square
roots of the velocity-constants. If we call K the velocity-
constant in the hydrolysis of aqueous salt-solutions, then 4/K
becomes the measure of the dissociation ratio, or the relative
 strengths of the two weak acids are as        : »/ K,.
   To apply this method to a few specific cases, we may
obtain the necessary data in my former paper on hydrolysis
in aqueous solutions of salts of strong bases with weak
acids (Phil. Mag. [5] xxxv. p. 365, 1893). It was there
pointed out that when potassium cyanide, for example, is
dissolved in water it is partially decomposed into free acid
 and free base, and the following equilibrium takes place :
               KOH + Hf!Ny->- KCN + HOH,
from which we get the equation
                KOH x HCN=K(KCN x HOH),
 where K= — of the more general equation,
              c,(KOHx HON) =cs(KCNx HOH),
 in which Cj and cs are the velocity-coefficients in opposite
 directions (Guldberg and Waage, Journ. f. pr. Chem. [2]
 xix. p. 69, 1879).
    In the present case, however, we desire to study the for
 mation of the salts or the ratio of distribution of the base

                    or "Aridities" of Weak Acids.              161
 between two acids, so we may write
                   (KOH x HCN) = KCN x HOH.
    Instead of the K of the former paper we must therefore
 use its reciprocal
    In Table I. the strengths of the acids in tenth-normal
 solution have been compared ; that of hydrocyanic acid being
 arbitrarily taken as unity. The values of K are taken from
 the paper on hydrolysis (loc. cit.).
    Strictly speaking only the monobasic acids are comparable ;
 but in order to form some conception of the order of magni
 tude of the relative strengths of carbonic and biboric acids,
 the characteristic constants have been halved and the calcula
 tion proceeded with in the ordinary way.

   The great difference between acetic acid and the others is
very remarkable. A still better idea of the relative strengths
of these weak acids is obtained when they are compared with
some of the stronger acids. Hydrochloric acid together
with the three chlorinated acetic acids seem specially well
adapted for this purpose, as they supply different grades of
strength. The values attached to these acids are taken from
Ostwald's tables, and are calculated from the velocity of
catalysis of methyl acetate by half-normal solutions of the
acids.
   Table II. contains a list of the acids arranged in their
relative order of strength.

    The numbers attached to each acid cannot of course be
 considerd final. As regards carbolic and carbonic acid,
 for example, it is impossible to say which of the two is the
 stronger, all that we may safely infer is, that they are about
 equally strong.
    From the above table it also follows that hydrochloric acid
 is about one hundred thousand times stronger than carbolic
 acid in tenth-normal solution ; or, what amounts to the same
 thing, the electrolytic dissociation ratio is one hundred
 thousand times greater in the former case than in the latter.'
    In other tables of the avidities of acids the values for tb,e
 weakest acids are usually represented by blanks, but the
 method which has just been described enables us to arrange
them in proper order and to assign definite values to them.
    This seems all the more necessary as a great deal of mis
conception still prevails as to the relative strengths of the
acids and the conditions under which a comparison is
possible.

   ON THE FREEZING-POINTS OF SODIUM-CHLORIDE SOLUTIONS.
                       BY S. U. PICKERING, F.R.S.
TN a recent communication to the Phil. Mag. (xxxvi. p. 484)
-*- Mr. Harry Jones has made sundry very incorrect statements
as regards a controversy respecting the regularity or otherwise of
the freezing-points of weak sodium-chloride solutions. I should
not have troubled to correct them had Mr. Jones inserted any
reference to the communication which has apparently closed this
controversy (Ber. d. deutech. chem. Gesell. xxvi. p. 1977), and which
must have been in his hands before he corrected the proofs of liis
paper for this Journal.
    In the Berichte (xxv. p. 1314) I published a series of determina
tions with this salt which I considered indicated the presence of

                 Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              103
changes of curvature at certain points. Mr. Jones subsequently
 published (Ber. xxvi. p. 551) some still more accurate determinations,
 which he considered entirely disproved the existence of these breaks.
I proved, however (Ber. xxvi. p. 1221), that, so far from this being
the case, Mr. Jones's results showed the very same breaks as mine
did, but in a still more satisfactory manner. 1 proved that
parabolas deduced mathematically from his values so as to allow the
existence of these breaks agreed most perfectly with the known
experimental error as determined by two independent methods,
whereas, when represented by a single parabola without breaks, the
error was 10,000 times too large. Mr. Jones found it convenient
to ignore the results of this investigation in his answer (Ber. xxvi.
p. 1635), which may be summarized in his own words in the Phil.
Mag. " I have carefidly examined his [Pickering's] results . . . and
have shown that the 4 breaks' are caused only by the experimental
errors in his results. Mr. Pickering has applied his method of
curve-drawing to my results from sodium chloride, which differ
from his to the extent of more than 50 per cent., and with it
claims to have found the same ' breaks ' as in his own results.
He has thus shown the true value of his method, which seems to
be largely independent of the .experimental data. I have since
shown that his curve contains the following fundamental errors :—
I. At least some of the points in his curve are wrong. II. The
choice of points through which he has drawn the curve is purely
arbitrary."
    It is true that I did examine Mr. Jones's results by drawing curves
through them, but, as I never published the results, I fail to see how
he can pretend to know anything about them, unless it is from a
rough woodcut on p. 1222 of the Berichte. His answer, which
does not, and evidently could not, apply to the mathematical
investigation, appears to me to be calculated simply to shirk the
results of this investigation, which are too conclusive to be with
stood. His statement that my results differ from his by at least
50 per cent, may be characterized by your readers as they think
fit. The sole foundation for it is that in the one extreme experi
ment, and in that only, there is such a difference, and that there it
amounts to but 0-002° C, an error of which many of Mr. Jones's
duplicate results are by no means innocent.
    Mr. Jones's " careful examination " of my results consisted of
displaying some of them in a woodcut iu a manner which would
inevitably fail to reveal anything as to their true nature, and his
" proof " of the regularity of his own results consists of a similar
plotting. 1 can only repeat in English what I have already told
him in German (Ber. xxvi. p. 1979), that so long as he offers no
evidence to invalidate that which I have brought forward in favour
of the irregularity of these results, and so long as he declines to
give the smallest proof whatever to support his statement that they
form a regular curve, I must decline to discuss the matter any
further.
    I am tempted, however, to say a word as to Mr. Jones's recent
results, although it is impossible to attempt a criticism of thein till the

 104          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
experimental values, instead of the present "smoothed" values, are
published. The most remarkable part of the conclusions which he
draws from them is that non-electrolytes in very weak solutions
give an abnormally large depression similar to that given by
electrolytes, but which according to the dissociation theory should
be shown by electrolytes only. It is still more remarkable, how
ever (especially when we remember that these results emanate
from Prof. Ostwald's laboratory), that Mr. Jones should have pub
lished them without any reference to the fact that my own results
(although they differ somewhat from his in individual cases) had
established the existence of this same phenomenon, not only as
regards aqueous solutions, but still more conspicuously as regards
benzene solutions (Ber. xxiv. pp. 1460,3329; xxv. pp. 1854,2011,
2518, 3434).
   Mr. Jones suggests a possible explanation of this excess in the
case of non-electrolytes, without noticing, however, that it must
apply equally to electrolytes also, and thus upset the very couclusions
w hich he has drawn from the rest of his work, namely, that the excess
is due to dissociation and agrees accurately with the electric con
ductivity. Perhaps I may help him a little out of his difficulty by
suggesting that, alter all, part of this 25 per cent, excess may be
due to experimental error. When a student whose work is
hitherto unknown publishes results which claim an accuracy ten
times greater than any previously attained, it is but reasonable to
expect fuller details than those given by Mr. Jones. A mercurial
thermometer reading with certainty to the ten thousandth of a
degree is an instrument unknown in England, and any systematic
investigation of its capabilities would add confidence to our esti
mate of the results obtained. Independent of errors due directly
to the thermometer, I should like to ask if Mr. Jones has satisfied
himself that he gets the same value for the freezing-point of water
(on which all his conclusions depend) whatever method he uses for
determining it. In his apparatus the sides and bottom of the vessel
are being constantly cooled by the surrounding medium, the top
is being constantly heated by partial contact with the air, and the
contents are being heated by the friction of the stirrer. When
freezing begins, the liquid can only be kept at the same temperature
as the ice if this latter is disseminated throughout it in con
siderable quantity and in minute particles ; but, according to my
experience, this is almost impossible when dealing with a large
bulk of pure water, even when violently stirred : the ice forms
and agglomerates on the sides of the vessel, leaving the liquid in
the middle to become superheated and give too high a reading for
the freezing-point. A similar phenomenon occurs to a less extent
with very weak solutions, and gradually becomes negligible as the
strength increases, and as the ice which separates forms in smaller
crystals which do not agglomerate so easily. An error due to
this cause would account for the very high values obtained by
Mr. Jones for weak solutions.

    XIII. Tlie Phases and Conditions of Chemical Change.
                      By V. H. Veley, M.A*
                 " Was nun die Beobachter einer scientifischen Methode
           betrifft, so haben sie hier die Wakl entweder dogmatisch oder

THE investigations on the subject of chemical change
       published in the course of the past ten or twelve years
have more than ever rendered it difficult to give a satisfactory
answer to the questions : first, what is chemical change ?
and, secondly, what is the cause of its commencement ? It is
pretty plain, however, that in the long run these two problems
resolve themselves into the first. Recently there have arisen
two schools of thought, which, though widely opposed in
matters of detail, yet agree in the general principle that
chemical and electric phenomena are more exclusively related
to one another than to any other form of energy. On the
one hand, there are writers who hold that chemical change is
the reverse of electrolysis ; and, on the other, there are those
who consider that chemical change is conditioned by the
separation or dissociation of compounds into oppositely elec
trified ions. Both schools have set forth answers to the
                    • Communicated by the Author.
  Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 37. No. 225. Feb. 1894.                  N

166            Mr. V. H. Veley on the Phases and
problems of the commencement of chemical change, and espe
cially with regard to the function and necessity of an inter
mediate or third substance to promote reaction between two
other substances.
   But generally there seems to be a tendency among writers
on chemical as on other forms of philosophy to accept the
hypotheses of their predecessors as matters of acquired know
ledge without due examination of their validity, and to super
impose upon them other hypotheses which their successors in
their turn accept as facts. In chemical philosophy, as in that
of pure reason, there are writers of a dogmatic type who set
forth with a most unqualified assurance hypotheses neither
wholly in accordance with facts nor strictly logical in their
demonstration. But others of an agnostic type are content
to conceal their ignorance under such commonly accepted
terms as "catalysis," "fermentation," " nascent action," and
the like, which are regarded as all sufficient explanations of
phenomena not understood ; such terms are of course con
venient, but do not render any material assistance. Again,
it is to be feared that chemists too often content themselves
with a study of the ultimate products of a reaction and omit
the intermediately formed substances, which, though in some
cases they may be transitory, yet are the more important. It is
as if the morphologist were to consider an organism as a whole,
and to iguore the structure and function of individual cells,
whether somatic or reproductive. In the present communi
cation it is proposed to discuss the conditions and phases of
chemical change, and to deal with the several hypotheses
concerning its nature.
              The Phases of Chemical Change.
   From our earliest and everyday experience it is learnt
that chemical changes start slowly at first, are accelerated up
to a maximum and for some time constant stage, and thence,
unless reversible, proceed with a velocity diminishing accord
ing to the proportion of the reacting masses. To adopt the
phraseology of the biologist, the changes are at first anabolic
and then katabolic. There are thus a series of phases or
periods which pass into one another more or less continuously ;
and though in some cases, especially of detonations and cer
tain explosions, all these periods have not as yet been clearly
defined owing to the rapidity of their succession, it is, how
ever, reasonable to suppose: that with improved methods of
observation, whether of chronography or photography, these
changes will be found to follow the same course.

                    Conditions of Chemical Change.                       167
    The periods may be defined as follows :—(i.) of Commence
ment,; (ii.) of Inertness * or Reluctance followed by Accele
ration ; (iii.) of Constancy ; (iv.) of Diminution of Velocity f.
The first three periods will be considered seriatim more fully.
                    (i.) Period of Commencement.
    Writers on the kinetic theory of gnses have supposed that
the velocity of movement of translation of gaseous molecules
is, from the nature and degree of violence of their mutual
impacts, an average of velocities of widely different values ;
 their kinetic energy is therefore expressible by the factor
 Awn*8, wherein u is the average of velocities V1; V2, ...V„.
 It is supposed that certain molecules will be moving with a
 velocity which would thereby render them more liable to
 atomic disruption when they meet molecules of a different
 kind of matter, so that the free constituent atoms which
 would otherwise pair with atoms of a like kind pair with
 atoms of an unlike kind.
    Clausius further assumes that an E.M.F. (and probably
 changes induced by light are to be included under the same
category) tends to give a " set " or direction to the atomic
constituents, causing those of an electro-positive nature to
 pass in one, and those of an electro-negative nature to pass
in another way. The same course of reasoning will apply to
solutions, except that the problem is rendered more com
plicated by the internal viscosity of the liquid and the thereby
diminished probability of molecular encounter. The theory
of the free and paired atoms has been developed on mathe
matical lines by J. J. Thomson f ; and the results calculated
from the equations set forth are in agreement with those
obtained in experiments on the dissociation of iodine (Crafts
and Meier), of the compound of methyl oxide and hydro
chloric acid (Friedel), and on the dissociation of phosphoric
chloride (Wurtz).
    In the particular case of hydrogen and chlorine (discussed
more fully below), let us postulate the condition that certain
molecules of each gas not only are moving faster, but also by
the agency of light have a tendency to move in one direction
   * It seems preferable to use the term "Inertness" or "Keluctance"
rather than " Inertia," as the cause is chemical rather than dynamical, and
the implied analogy would therefore be misleading.
   t Hell and Urech (Ber. dent. chem. 6-'es. xiii. p. 531) divide the course
of chemical change into the three last periods, while Pringsheim (Wied.
Ann. xxxii. p. 400) gives the first three, but the method of observation
adopted precluded any observations of the fourth period.

168              Mr. V. H. Veley on tlie Phases and
rather than in any other ; these molecules collide, the hy
drogen and chlorine atoms change partners to produce hydro
chloric acid. If it be further supposed that the external
temperature remains the same, and that the walls of the vessel
are absolutely non-conducting, then the heat evolved by the
combination of the hydrogen and chlorine would increase the
velocity of translation of the remaining molecules, and thereby
increase their tendency to combine, if the external cause of
the " set " continued. There would thus be an acceleration
 of the combination up to the point at which there would be
so many particles of hydrochloric acid not only in the way
but also with an increasing velocity of translation. The
 phenomena of acceleration discussed in the succeeding section
 might be accounted for by dynamical considerations; but,
 as will be seen, this is not the conclusion of the whole matter.
    However this may be, it is clear that when once a direction
 has been given to the molecules or their constituents whereby
 a chemical change is produced, they will continue to move in
 the same direction, and the change, other external causes not
 intervening, will proceed to its ultimate limit. The phe
 nomenon may be of the same kind as, or at least analogous to,
 that observed by Faraday, viz., that when once an electric spark
 has passed through a gas the passage of another immediately
  afterwards is much facilitated, a fact confirmed by the expe
  riments of Hittorf and Schuster*.
     The theory of Clausius in a more or less modified form has
 been almost universally adopted by chemists and physicists
 alike. Armstrong f, however, practically rejects it on the
 somewhat slender grounds that it affords no explanation of
 the phenomena of electric conduction of certain silver salts in
 the solid state, and of the variations in conductivity of mix
  tures of sulphuric acid and water.
          (ii.) Period of Inertness followed by Acceleration.
     These phenomena were first noticed by Draper in the par
  ticular case of the reaction of hydrogen and chlorine gases
  under the influence of sunlight, and traced by him to an
  allotropic modification of the latter element f . Similar obser
  vations were made by Bunsen and Koscoe in their investi
  gations on the same subject, and the phenomenon was desig
  nated by them " Photochemical Induction " § ; a term which has

                   Conditions of Chemical Change.                     1 69
been handed down through a series of manuals on Chemistry,
the writers of which seem to consider that the phenomenon is
necessarily conditioned by the agency of light. Bunsen and
Eoscoe make a mental presentation of resistance to be over
come before chemical change can commence. It is to be
supposed, though the writers do not state it in so many
words, that the term " induction " is based upon an analogy
of magnetic and electric phenomena, called by the same term,
which last just so long as the predetermining cause, namely
the vicinity of an electrified or magnetized body.
    The analogy is, however, incomplete in that though there
are chemical changes which last as long as the external cause
or condition, be it E.M.F., light, or heat, yet there are others
which, when once commenced, will proceed, so far as can be
judged, without the external agency. As the phenomenon is
not necessarily dependent upon sunlight *, and as probably it
is not entirely of a dynamical character, I have preferred to
adopt the term " Inertness " or " Reluctance."
     Bunsen and Roscoe further showed that when a mixture
of hydrogen and chlorine gases, in which chemical change
has set in under the influence of light, is darkened and then
again exposed, the phenomena of inertness and initial accelera
tion are repeated ; this observation, which has an important
bearing on the course of chemical change, seems to have been
quite overlooked by writers upon the subject. Pringsheim
(<*/". supra), repeating Bunsen and Roscoe's experiments,
traces the above phenomena to the purely chemical cause of
an intermediate reaction, basing the explanation on the fact
that a mixture of hydrogen and chlorine gases was less sus
ceptible to actinic rays when dry than when moist (an obser
vation confirmed by Dixonf). Pringsheim considered the
reactions to be as follows :—
                (i.)  H2 + CI, + H20 = C120 + 2H2,
                (ii.) C120 + 2H2=2HC1 + H20,
without, however, bringing forward any experimental evidence
in support of the view, and, indeed, it is not probable that
the anhydride C120 would exist, as such, in the presence of
water. But the investigations of Pedler } supply the necessary
data, in that he has shown that chlorine in the presence of
    * Bunsen and Roscoe themselves also illustrate their results by others
obtained in the study of the bromination of tartaric acid, a chemical
change probably not wholly conditioned bv actinic rays.

170            Mr. V. H. Veley on the Phases and
water and under the influence of sunlight, the two conditions
required, give hypochlorous acid as one of the initial products
of the reaction ; the changes can therefore be written :—
                (i.)   C12 + 2H20 = 2HC10 + H2.
                (ii.) 2HC10 + 2H3=2HC1 + 2H20.
The above results afford a sufficient answer to the somewhat
sceptical remark of Ostwald :—" Ueber die Natur derZwischen-
 Substanz liess sich nicht bestimmtes ermitteln "*.
    As regards this phase of the reactions of hydrogen with
 chlorine, Armstrong (Proc. Chem. Soc. 1893) writes :—" That
 no such irregularity is observed on heating iodine with
 hydrogen is not surprising, as hydrogen iodide would be
 formed from the very first, and the electrolyte present would
exert a minimum resistance at once." But it is surprising
 that the reactions of hydrogen with chlorine and iodine re
 spectively should ever be compared at all ; the only factors
common to the two are the element hydrogen and the some
what similar behaviour of the two resulting haloid acids.
For the reaction between hydrogen and chlorine is conditioned,
as everybody now admits, by the presence of water and by
taking place at ordinary temperatures under the influence of
sunlight, and under those conditions it is probably not re
versible; further it is exothermic ( + 22,000 cals.), and some
hydrochloric acid is formed after the lapse of about 2-4
minutes (Bunsen and Roscoe, Pringsheim) . On the other hand,
there is no experimental evidence at present to show that the
reaction between hydrogen and iodine is conditioned by the
presence of water ; it is unaffected by sunlight, as Lcmoino t
has shown that at ordinary temperatures and after one month's
exposure to summer sun no appreciable combination takes
Elace, though under the same conditions 80 per cent, of
  ydriodic acid is decomposed ; further, the reaction is re
versible and endothermic ( — 800 cals.) . Lastly, it is practically
certain that hydriodic acid is not formed from the very first,
as at a temperature of 200° 97*1 per cent, of the hydrogen
present in a mixture of iodine and hydrogen still remained
free after an interval of £>£ hours (Lemoine), which, to put it
another way, would mean that only "005 per cent, of the
hydrogen has entered into combination after the lapse of
one minute, presuming the change to proceed uniformly.
   The phenomena of inertness and acceleration were also ob
served by Berthelot and Pean de Saint Gilles in their studies
                 * Lehrbuch. p. 1063.

                     Conditions of Chemical Change.                       171
  on the rate of formation of ethereal salts ; these writers gave *,
 without apparently being aware of the fact, the same ex
 planation as Bunsen and Roscoe.
    Again, Hell and Urech (cf. supm) noticed these same
 phenomena in their investigations on the bromination of the
 acids of the acetic series ; they very cogently pointed out that
 their results would be incomprehensible on the hypothesis
 that the reaction consists in the simple substitution of hydrogen
 by bromine, for in that case the maximum velocity should
 be at the commencement of the reaction, when there is the
 greatest mass of unaltered bromine present. These writers
 seem to have been the first to give the probably true explana
 tion of this phase of chemical change, tracing it to the forma
 tion of an intermediate compound (in the particular case of
 acetic acid to a body of composition C2H402Br24HBr) f,
whereby a delay would of necessity be occasioned, and the
chemical change, though started, could only proceed at first
slowly.
    It was noticed also by Harcourt in some unpublished in
vestigations, and confirmed by later experiments of my own,
that the evolution of gases from homogeneous liquids as a
process of chemical change t illustrates in a remarkable way
the same phenomena. These were especially observable in
the decomposition of potassium ferrocyanide with concen
trated sulphuric acid, and in the reduction of nitric acid with
ferrous sulphate j reactions in which intermediate substances
are undoubtedly formed, and, indeed, in the latter case the
progress of the change is rendered visible. In the course of
the experiments it was noticed that, if a liquid from which a
gas was being evolved was cooled and subsequently restored
to its former temperature, or if the stipe rincumbent pressure
was suddenly increased from a third to one atmosphere, then,
though the evolution of gas was perfectly uniform before the
temporary alteration of condition, the phenomena of inert
ness and acceleration were repeated in a greater or less degree.
    Simultaneously Spring and van Aubel§ noticed that the
   * Ann. de Chim. [3] lxvi. pp. 5-153. On the above point the authors
write as follows :—" Pour la concevoir il faut admettre line sorte d'inertie,
de resistance a vaincre qui retarde la combination . . . ; cette acceleration
initielle semble done constituer un caractere assez general de ce genre de
reactions."
   t The writers do not bring forward much experimental evidence in
favour of the existence of this particular compound, but the formation of
unstable bromo-addition products, such as that of camphor for example,
is by no means infrequent among carbon compounds.

   § Ann. Chim. Phys. [0] xi. pp. 505-534.

172             Mr. V. H. Veley on the Phases and
velocity of the reaction between metallic zinc (containing *6
per cent, of lead) and the halogen acid increases until it
reaches a maximum ; these writers, however, apply again the
term " induction." Precisely similar results were obtained
by myself in the course of experiments on copper with diluted
nitric acid *; if the conditions were such that the reaction
commenced at all, then it started at first slowly. But these
two latter examples will be more especially discussed in the
sequel.
   Again, it is a familiar fact to photographers that the
action of light upon silver salts is less during the first period
of exposure than subsequently ; the researches of H. B.
Baker have shown that the chemical changes involved are
extremely complicated by the formation of intermediate
compounds.
   The proposition set forth of the production of intermediate
compounds can for simplicity be resolved into two general
cases :—
    (i.) In a chemical system compounds ub and cd unite to
form a third compound abed, which in its turn is resolved into
compounds ac and bd thus
                          (i.) ab + cd=al>cd.
                          (ii.) abcd=ac + bd.
    (ii.) A compound abed decomposes into compounds ab and
cd, which subsequently react to form ac and bd, thus
                           (i.) abcd=ab + cd.
                          (ii.) ab + cd=ac + bd.
   Both cases come under the category of concomitant varia
tions, and the observations obtained in the course of experiments
are not susceptible of mathematical analysis until the several
amounts of reacting substances and products have been
accurately ascertained. I have dwelt upon this phase of
chemical change at some length, not indeed with the view of
pointing out that changes proceed slowly at first, for this is
patent to the merest tyro in experimental chemistry who
 pours some dilute sulphuric acid upon metallic zinc ; but
rather I would wish to draw attention to the great importance
 of the study of intermediate compounds which are either
 generally overlooked or at best summarily dismissed as of no
 concern t- It is to my mind idle to discuss as to what may
   • Proc. Roy. Soc. xlvi. p. 217.
   t The remark of Lord Rnyleigh (B. A. Address 1884) is as pregnant
as ever :—"If I might without presumption venture a word ofrecommenda
tion, it would be in favour of a more minute study of the simpler chemical
 phenomena."

be or may not be, or whether certain "composite electrolytes"
may or may not be formed ; for such discussions seem to
reduce the fair field of experimental chemistry to the dry
and arid waste of academical metaphysics.
                       (iii.) Period of Constancy.
    This period has been observed in most of the cases dis
cussed in the previous section, and would follow as a neces
sary consequence of two opposing factors, the one of accele
ration, and the other of retardation due to the diminution of
the masses of reacting substances. Its duration is therefore
dependent upon the products of these factors ; and according
to experimental conditions it has been observed to last either
for the space of a few minutes or for several hours.
    Berthelot's experiments have also shown that the velocity
 of propagation of explosive waves rapidly increases until a
constant maximum is reached, the value of which varies with
the nature of the exploding gases. Though the researches of
 Dixon* have conclusively proved that this maximum for the
 same pair of gases is dependent upon either the presence of
 moisture or of an excess of one of the gases, or of a third
 gas, whereby secondary reactions may ensue, yet, so far as I
 am aware, the effects produced on the earlier period of acce
 leration have not been made the subject of any elaborate
 series of experiments. I have therefore omitted their dis
 cussion in the preceding paragraph, though there can be but
 little doubt that in these cases also the formation of inter
 mediate compounds (carbonic oxide, for example, as the first
 stage of the oxidation of carbon) would have a very important
 bearing.
                (iv.) Period of Diminishing Velocity.
    It is only necessary to allude to the final stage, so cha
 racteristic of all save reversible chemical changes, and which
 has so often been shown in the many elaborate memoirs
 published in the last thirty or forty years to be a function of
 mass, temperature, and other conditions.
                   What is Chemical Change ?
    In the preceding paragraphs the course of chemical change
 has been discussed ; we now pass on to the more difficult
 problem concerning its nature.
     Some sixty years ago Faraday, impressed, doubtless, with
 his wonderful experiments upon electrolysis, wrote f:—"The
          * Phil Trans. 1884, p. 617, and 1893 [A], pp. 97-188.
           t ' Experimental Researches.'

 174            Mr. V. H. Veley on the Phases and
 forces termed chemical affinity and electricity are one and
 the same," a sentence which has hecome the text of the dis
 courses of numerous writers in the present generation. With
 somewhat more reserve Helmholtz * put forward the view
 that " the very mightiest among chemical forces are of electric
 origin," which is another frequently quoted text.
    Of course everybody will grant that the chemical changes
 in a battery and electrolytic cells are identical both in kind
 and quantity ; everybody also will allow that chemical change
 and E.M.F. are frequently interdependent variables, and
 lastly the ionic dissociation theory has a whole school of
 followers. But it is not as yet possible (notwithstanding a
 certain array of experimental evidence) in our present state
 of knowledge to accept Armstrong's definition of chemical
 change as " reversed electrolysis " f , or the proposition, not
 wholly identical with it, that in order that chemical change
 m(*iy take place the system operated upon should comprise an
 electrolyte. For, on the one hand, there are cases of chemical
 change which do not occur even in the presence of an elec
 trolyte, and, on the other, there are cases which occur even
 in the absence of an electrolyte.
    For example, it will not be denied that dilute hydrochloric,
sulphuric, and nitric acids are electrolytes par excell-ence ; yet
 for all that certain metals in a state of purity will not dissolve
in them. But if, before introduction of the metal, an electric
 current be passed through these several acids, whereby
 (possibly) pcrsulphuric, nitrous, aud oxygenated chlorine
acids are produced, then under these circumstances chemical
 reaction ensues. Thus electrolysis causes the formation of
some intermediate compound ; is it logical, therefore, to con
clude that electrolysis is the necessary antecedent and con
comitant of its own reverse ?
    Again, to take an example from everyday life, the materials
 of a common match-head and box do not apparently contain
 an electrolyte, yet the chemical change is violent enough
 when one is rubbed against the other. At present we are with
 out evidence to show that no change would take place if this
everyday experiment were performed with absolutely dry
 materials (especially the potassium chlorate) and in an abso
lutely dry atmosphere.
    It seems most rational to suppose that mechanical is con
verted into heat-energy, which is subsequently degraded by
the combustion of the substances present.

   Again, the electric conductivity of hydrocarbons is for the
most part extremely small, yet in many cases they readily
enter into^ chemical change at ordinary temperature without
the intervention of extraneous energy. For example, many
of them combine directly with bromine with extreme violence,
yet it could hardly be supposed that a trace of hydrobromic
acid formed as a by-product in the midst of an insulator is
the determining cause. The reactions of the zinc and other
organo-metallic compounds upon oxygenated compounds pre
sumably dry are also examples of changes wherein there is
as yet no evidence to show that they are dependent upon the
presence of an electrolyte, or that they are of the nature of
reversed electrolysis. Such examples might be multiplied,
and will readily occur to any student of chemistry.
    Lastly, is there any evidence to show that chemical
changes induced by finely divided platinum are conditioned
by the presence of an electrolyte ? or any proof that moisture,
 or some other " tertium quid " must be present ? or generally,
has any satisfactory explanation of the nature of surfaces
 been given ? " Catalytic reactions are reactions which we
 do not understand/' this has become a by-word and a re
 proach among chemists. Guesswork as to what may be is
 of no avail ; we want to know what is. In any case there
 seems nothing to warrant the exclusive selection of two par
 ticular forms of energy, namely the electric current anil
 chemical affinity, and to define absolutely the latter as the
 reverse of the former. For with equal reason, and with as
 fair a show of argument, heat and chemical energy might
 likewise be defined as terms mutually reversible. Probably
 the true position of the case is most exactly summed up by
 the quotation from HelmhohVs writings given above, that
 some of the very mightiest among chemical forces are of
 electric origin.
  What is the cause of the commencement of Chemical Change f
    Of recent years the reactivity of substances has been con
 sidered to be conditioned by the degree of ionic dissociation,
 the measure of which is expressed by the factor
 wherein u and um are the molecular conductivities at any
 particular and at infinite dilution. This hypothesis has been
 so widely accepted, not only as affording a convenient

176               Mr. V. H. Veley on the Phases and
explanation of the commencement of chemical change but
also as being supported by evidence derived from a study of
other physical phenomena*, that it would seem to savour
almost of ultra-conservatism f to pass any criticism upon it.
    On all sides it is admitted that if the hypothesis of ionic
dissociation be granted other phenomena would follow as
logical consequences ; and of these no other explanation has
been given, though they are not wholly otherwise unintel
ligible. But the propounders of this theory seem at best to
slur over the initial difficulties, and to postulate properties of
certain kinds of matter of which, ex hypothesi, we can have
no cognition.
    To take the more commonly selected example : it is sup
posed that when potassium chloride is dissolved in excess of
water it is more or less dissociated into free potassium and
free chlorine atoms, each with enormous electric charges, equal
and opposite in kind. It is further assumed f that the free
potassium ions are a kind of matter different from a lump of
potassium, and that the free chlorine ions are a kind of matter
different from chlorine gas in a jar, somewhat as yellow and
red phosphorus are different kinds of matter. Writers allow
that there is no exact knowledge of the amount of these
electric charges, and, indeed, if according to the hypothesis
these are equal and opposite in kind, there seems to be some
difficulty in devising any experimental method for their mea
surement. But they consider that it is a matter of acquired
knowledge that the chemical and physical properties of ele
mentary substances are greatly altered and almost nullified
by electric charges imparted to them by the mere process of
solution of their compounds in water. A lump of potassium
is regarded by this school of writers as made up " of mole-

Electrolytes," Acad. Science, Sweden ; also W. N. Shaw, B. A. Report,

   t One can hardly refrain from quoting the following passage from
Nernst's work Theuretische Chemie (Stuttgart, 1893), as an example
of self-satisfactory dogmatism almost unequalled in any scientific publi
cation :—" Es ist hier natiirlich nicht der Ort, auf den Inhalt einer der-
artigen unfruchtbaren Opposition, die auch nicht ein einziges neues
Moment zu Tnge fiirderte, und die daher am besten einer schnellen Ver-
gessenheit anheimfiele, niihor einzugehen."
   \ Writers upon this subject seem almost to consider that no assumption
is here implied ; thus Ostwald (Lehrbuch der allyemeinen Chemie, Leipzig,
1893, p. 784) writes :—" Die Aufklarung des sclieinbaren Widerspruches
liegt so viel dnrin, dass ' freies Kaliunimetall ' und ' freie Kaliumionen'
ganz verschiedene Dinge sind ; sie sind nicht identisch, sondern nur
isomer." This last sentence would imply a definite statement of fact.

cules * consisting of an unknown and probably great number
of potassium atoms," even though the determination of its
molecular weight, alike by the methods of vaporization, the
depression of freezing-points, and diminution of vapour-
pressure, would point to a molecular number 3D- 1, if tbat of
hydrogen be taken as 2. Thus the only point of differentiation
is the assumed enormous electric charge. But even if it be
granted that such a charge would alter the properties of
a kind of matter (of which, be it remarked, there is no expe
 rimental evidence) precisely as 3-ellow phosphorus is converted
 by the process of heating into red phosphorus, yet the dif
 ference between these two last modifications is for the most
 part one of degree and not one of kind. But we are asked to
 believe that ionic potassium would not decompose water, and
 that ionic chlorine would possess no odour.
     The propounders of this hypothesis take away attributes
 hitherto regarded as essential to the various elementary kinds
 of matter, and substitute for them mere mental abstractions.
 As such they might be useful in the same sense as circles and
 triangles, and we might possibly deal with them as implied
 postulates ; but to predicate properties of kinds of matter of
 which we can have no cognition, and to differentiate them
 from kinds of matter of which we have cognition, is to carry
 scientific imagination beyond its legitimate bounds. The
 following sentences taken from Ostwald's Jjehrbuch illustrate
 the relations given in the text :—(i) " Chlor is ein stark
 riechendes Gas ;" (ii) "Das molekulare Chlor, Cl2, geht in
 Chlorionen liber;" (iii) " Ebenso muss in Gefasse B ein
  Ueberschuss von Chlorionen vorhanden sein ... in keinem
  Gefasse nimmt man etwas besonderes wahr—weder . . . noch
  Chlorgeruch in B."
     Though the element chlorine when combined with potassium
  in potassium chloride or with hydrogen and carbon (in
  chloroform, for example) has none of the properties of ele
  mentary chlorine by itself, yet this would not affect the
  question ; for by tho ionic dissociation theory the chlorine in
     * It is time to protest against such a sentence as this in a book (Nernst,
  cf. supra) written presumably, as our English phrase hath it, " for the use
  of schools and colleges": —" Wasserstoff und Chlor sind uns beide bei
 gewohnlicher Temperatur nur als Ha und CL, bekannt." We know the
  properties of hydrogen—or at least we have a rational expectation,
  amounting almost to a certainty, that the properties of a specimen
  of hydrogen collected to-day are the same as those of a specimen of
 hydrogen collected fifty years ago ; but we do not know hydrogen as H2.
 All that we can say is this, that, adopting certain hypotheses of the con
 stitution of matter, we believe, or we imagine, or at best we conventionally
 represent the molecule of hydrogen to be Ha.

178               Mr. V. H. Veley on tfie Phases and
dissolved potassium chloride is considered to be free, or at
least not combined with the potassium. Williamson pointed
out years ago that it is not strictly accurate to speak either of
the element potassium or the element chlorine as present in
potassium chloride, and, indeed, there is a certain inconsistency
in modern nomenclature in that one element and not the other
is put in the adjectival form.
   It can be argued that an asymmetric carbon atom is like
wise a mental abstraction; but specific attributes are not
predicated of such a carbon atom—all that is or can be done
is to put forward this abstraction as a working hypothesis to
explain the constitution of certain carbon compounds. Mole
cules also are ideals, but we cannot predicate of them any
attributes, whether of sphericity or non-sphericity, of elasticity
or inelasticity : as we may apply the ideal geometrical tri
angle for the more real triangle of velocities, so likewise we
apply our ideal molecules to solve problems on the velocities
of congeries of them.
   But certain writers incline to draw students away from the
main issue by a distinction between heat-dissociation and
ionic or electrolytic dissociation (both terms being unfortunate
enough). Thus to select a case, these statements are made
equally as of matters of fact*: —" If sal ammoniac is dissolved
in a large quantity of water it is electrolytically decomposed
almost completely in accordance with the equation
                             NH4C1=NH4 + <J1,
and if we vaporize it under sufficiently low pressure, it
decomposes again in accordance with the equation
                           NH4Cl=NH3-rHCl,
viz. in unelectrified molecules. Both are quite different phe
nomena, the interdependence between which, even if jrrobable, is
not yet knoivn."
    The former reaction is, however, quite theoretical, and we
have no manner of means of identifying the presence of the
hypothetical radical, NH4, or the elcctro-negatively charged
elementary substance chlorine, possessing hypothetical pro-

perties ; whereas we can identify, by suitable mechanical
means, in vaporized sal ammoniac the real gases ammonia and
hydrochloric acid. Yet, forsooth, there may be a relation
between these two phenomena, and we teach boys in onr
public schools that chemistry is an exact science ! But apart
from these arguments, which are based upon the nature of
the evidence of the phenomena in themselves, without con
sidering others which may or may not bo logically deduced
from them, there is further the dilemma, pointed out alike by
Armstrong * and Pickering f, that those compounds which we
regard as most undecomposable are precisely those which
electrolytically most decompose, and this, too, as an effect of
solution in water, generally considered a relatively inert
material.
   Here, again, Prof. Ostwald would seek to draw us into
a side-issue by the supposition that his opponents would
confound stability with reactivity. The stability of a com
pound is generally represented as an attribute of it with
reference to the decompositions produced by forces other
than chemical ; its reactivity is an attribute of it with
reference to those forces which we call chemical. Yet the
reactivity of substances is considered to be a function of their
electrolytic dissociation, or their instability when dissolved in
water.
   Again, the argument brought forward by Pickering $
seems as yet to have been unanswered and to be well-nigh
unanswerable, namely, that if we acknowledge the doctrine of
electrolytic dissociation we must deny the principle of the
conservation of energy, for which there is an abundance
of direct evidence. This writer has pointed out, as one
example out of many, that if two molecular proportions of
hydrochloric acid, when dissolved in water, be entirely disso
ciated into their individual atoms, there must be an absorption
of 44,000 + x+y cals., whereas, as a matter of fact, there is an
evolution of 34,630 cals., or a creation of an amount of energy
represented by (78,630 + & + y) cals. out of nothing and from
nowhere.
   In fact many writers of the present day seem to deal with
electric and chemical forces or electrified and non-electrified
atoms as two cards in a kind of game of blind-hookey, either of
which may be turned up at will.
   But there is the real dilemma of the reactivity of substances

The non-combustibility of charcoal, sulphur, and phosphorus
in oxygen, the non-combination of ammonia with hydrogen
chloride, the inappreciable change when undiluted acids are
poured upon carbonate*, and a host of other examples might
be cited. Upon this point Ostwald, on the one hand, appears
 to beg the. whole question when he writes that, "as probably
there is no absolute non-conductor, there is the possibility in
all cases of assuming the existence of at least a few ions."
 On the other hand, Armstrong would assign to " water special
properties which enable it to act directly ; moreover—perhaps
because—in such cases composite electrolytes would result."
On both sides, be it noted, we are asked to be content with
mere possibilities, which are even more unsatisfactory in the
science of chemistry than they are in matters of real life.
    As yet there seems to be no answer forthcoming to the
question, Why does chemical change ever begin ?
             The Reaction of Acids with Metals.
    The particular case of these reactions I have proposed to
consider separately, partly on account of its practical im
portance, partly also to deal with another " eidolon " of
chemistry, nascent hydrogen, and lastly because I have been
more specially interested with the problem. In former years,
and possibly even to this day, it was customary to teach that
both zinc and copper, for example, directly displace hydro
gen from sulphuric acid ; but in the first case the gas is
liberated as such, while in the latter it is nascent and reduces
the sulphuric acid to sulphur dioxide. So also the more
complicated results of the reaction of metals with nitric acid
have been supposed to bo the successive products of the
reduction of the acid by nascent hydrogen of greater or less
activity.
    As to the latter problem, and more especially with regard
to the metals silver, copper, mercury, and bismuth, it was
originally shown by Millon t for the first three metals, subse
quently more completely by Kussell % for silver, and finally by
   * Apart from the Baconian maxim, " Corpora non agunt nisi soluta,"
the following passage shows that the necessity of water for chemical
change had been the subject of observation even at the commencement of

on muriatic gas when both are perfectly dry ; yet water, to which the
gas has no chemical affinity, will condense it : in "this state it will readily
form an intimate union with the lime " (Iliggins, ' Experiments and
Observations on the Atomic Theory,' 1814).

myself* for the last three, that these several metals do not
dissolve in nitric acid, but if the reduction-product of nitr
acid, be it nitrous acid or nitrogen peroxide, is present, then
these metals dissolve. To put the tacts in a logical form :—
 (i.) These metals do not dissolve in nitric acid ; (ii.)
these metals do dissolve in nitric acid containing nitrous
acid f.         Unfortunately at present there seems to be
no means of proving the third term, namely, that these
metals do not dissolve in nitrous acid, though it is clearly
demonstrated that the amount of metal dissolved varies
not with the amount of nitric acid within certain limits, but
with the amount of nitrous acid. It must therefore be con
 cluded that the presence of the nitrous acid is the cause, or a
 necessary part of the cause, of the phenomenon of the solution;
 and it would follow that, whatever be the correct interpretation
 of the chemical change, nitric acid is not the actual solvent
 of the metal. Indeed my own experiments have shown that,
 within limits, the presence of an excess of nitric acid not only
 does not increase, but actually retards the solution of the three
 metals copper, mercury, and bismuth. But Armstrong con
ceives that " the hydrogen of the acid is virtually directly
 displaced by the metal with the assistance, however, of the
 current-energy derived from its own oxidation by the nitrous
 compound" J. There are, therefore, at least two interpreta
tions of the problem : First, it is supposed that the hydrogen
 of the acid is displaced, and this in the nascent condition, or
 somehow or another, reduces the nitric to nitrous acid, thus:—
                    2HNO3 + M = M(N03)3 + H3,
                     HN03 + H3 = HN03 + H30;
 or                 2HN03 + Ha = N304 + 2H30.
Secondly, it may be supposed that the nitrous acid or nitrogen
peroxide is formed from the nitric acid per se, and then the
 metal can be dissolved thus :—
           (i.)       HNO3      = HN03 + 0,
           (ii.) 2HN03 + M = M(N03)3 + 2H30 + 2NO;
 °r        (i.)      2HN03 = N304+H30 + 0,
          (ii.)    M + Ns04     = M(NOs)3.

without wishing to exclude the possibility that the active material
is really nitrogen peroxide.

 182           Mr. V. H. Veley on the Phases and
    The first view is based upon the analogy of the solution of
 certain metals in sulphuric acid, whereby hydrogen is set free,
 and also upon the argument that this same gas is set free, when
 metallic magnesium is dissolved in nitric acid j but it appears
 that, if we accept this view, a certain property, namely that of
 reducing nitric acid, is attributed to the element hydrogen when
 in a certain condition (to which also is superadded a current-
 energy), which it does not possess in the state or condition in
 which we know it. The general conception is that the element
 hydrogen in the former case is " atomic " and in the latter is
 " molecular," though it is to be observed that the relations of
 atoms to molecules are in obscurity. That is to say, four distinct
 hypotheses are involved:— (i.) that of nascent hydrogen ; (ii.)
 that nascent hydrogen is atomic ; (iii.) that nascent or atomic
 hydrogen differs in its attributes from hydrogen as we know it;
and (iv.) that hydrogen, as we know it, is molecular. Further,
 it does not seem sate to argue from the reaction of magnesium
 with nitric acid to those of copper &c. with the same acid, for
 at present there is no evidence to show that the solution of
 magnesium in the acid is dependent upon the presence of
 nitrous acid. If this is shown not to be the case, cadit quwstio.
    The often-cited argument in favour of the nascent hydrogen
hypothesis, namely, that no reduction ensues when hydrogen
gas is passed through nitric acid, appears to be rather beside
the question, for on the one hand the contact between a gas
and a liquid is very incomplete, only the outer shell of each
bubble being affected, and on the other the stream of the gas
would mechanically blow off any nitrous acid (or nitrogen
peroxide) which might be formed.
    The argument from the reactions supposed to take place in
the Grove's cell seems also to be beside the point, since there
must be a certain amount of interdiffusion between the nitric
and sulphuric acids which would complicate the chemical
changes. But, on the other hand, the following facts support
the view that the nitrous acid or nitrogen peroxide is
formed initially from the nitric acid per se : —First, the
more concentrated acid very rapidly turns yellow from the
formation of nitrogen peroxide, when exposed to the sun
light, but more slowly when the acid is kept in the dark
or diluted. Further, my experience has shown that even
the jolting of a railway journey is sufficient to increase the
proportion of the nitrous compound even in the case of acids
of about 30 per cent, concentration. Secondly, the same
change is very readily effected by the presence of organic
matter, which it is well-nigh impossible to eliminate from the
air of laboratories.

                   Conditions of Chemical Change.               183
   In the course of the investigations conducted by Burch and
myself on the E.M.F. of certain cells containing nitric acid,
it was continually found that if the containing vesssel was not
clean, if the metallic strips were touched with the fingers, or
if the strips were not thoroughly cleansed, the E.M.F. of the
cell rose to its maximum at once. It is quite clear, therefore,
that a trace of the nitrous compound could be formed in
numerous ways, and, when once formed, would tend to increase
in the presence of the metal. The recent investigations of
Sabatier and Sanderens* have shown that finely divided
copper readily absorbs nitrogen peroxide at ordinary tempe
ratures to produce a nitro-copper of composition Cu2NOj,
upon which water reacts with violence to give a solution
of copper nitrate and nitrite, nitric-oxide gas being evolved.
    Though it is not wholly safe to argue from the results of
experiments conducted under one set of conditions to those
conducted under another, yet it is remarkable that the pro
ducts of the reaction of copper with diluted nitric acid are in
the main identical with those of water with the nitro-copper.
The conclusion is not, therefore, wholly improbable that the
nitrogen peroxide present in the nitric acid combines with
the copper to form intermediately the nitro-copper, which in
its turn is decomposed by the water to re-form the nitrous
compound. The researches of Freer and Higley f have
 further shown that in the case of concentrated acids the main
product of the reaction of metallic copper is nitrogen peroxide.
    It is also remarkable that metallic lead dissolves very rapidly
in the liquid obtained by the addition of nitrogen peroxide to
water J, even though of a less degree of acidity than other
mixtures of nitric acid and the nitrous compound, though
here again it is not wholly safe to argue from the results
obtained in the case of one metal to those of another. At
present I am engaged upon this point for metals other than
lead. If, then, the formation of nitrogen peroxide be accom
plished, then not only will nitric oxide result, but also the
more deoxidized products such as nitrous oxide and nitrogen
will be produced from subsidiary reactions between the nitric
acid and the metallic nitrates. The formation, therefore,
 of all the products in the case of the metals mercury, copper,
 silver, and bismuth can readily be explained without recourse
 to the convenient hypothesis, nascent hydrogen. But at
present there is no satisfactory explanation of the formation
 of ammonia and hydroxylamine, and this mainly for the

reason that the reactions between nitric oxide and metallic
nitrates have hitherto received but little attention.
    The reactions of metals with sulphuric acid have not been
the subject of many investigations, partly, no doubt, from
 their assumed simplicity. Even at present there is no exact
 knowledge as to the nature of the intermediate substance
 formed from the sulphuric acid, which enables the metal to
 dissolve and to continue dissolving ; probably it is some pro
 duct of electrolysis, for it has been shown that pure zinc
 dissolves in diluted sulphuric acid through which an electric
  current has been passed, though no reaction ensued between
 the same samples of zinc and sulphuric acid previous to the
  passage of the current. Yet, whatever this substance may
  be, if the metal dissolves in the dilute acid, there are always
  formed traces, however small, of products other than hydrogen,
  and especially of hydrogen sulphide, while cadmium (which
  in many other respects resembles zinc) gives such reduction-
  products that the liquid turns milky with formation of
  sulphur.
      The reaction of copper and allied metals with concentrated
  sulphuric acid is generally represented as taking place in two
  successive stages, namely, first the direct replacement of the
   hydrogen by the metal, and, secondly, the reduction of the
   sulphuric acid by the nascent hydrogen, thus :—
                  (1)   Cu + H3S04 = CqS04 + H3 ;
                  (2)   H2S04 + H2 = 2H30 + S03.
       But here, again, there seems to be but little necessity for
   the hypothesis of nascent hydrogen, for the reaction only
    ensues with more concentrated acid, in which there is a
    greater tendency towards a decomposition of the acid into the
    trioxide and water, and the metallic copper may reduce the
    former with formation of cupric oxide and sulphur dioxide.
    Or, if the solution of the metal, as that of zinc in sulphuric

  XIV. A Study of the Polarization upon a Thin Metal
   Partition in a Voltameter.—Part I. By John Daniel*.
                         [Plates m. & IV.]
                          Introduction.
THE curious polarization phenomena of very small elec
        trodes in a sulphuric-acid voltameter bearing a strong
 current, accounts of which appeared in the Annalen during
the winter of 1892, suggested to Dr. L. Arons, of the Uni
versity of Berlin, to try a very thin metal partition in a
voltameter, expecting, as he said, that there would be a deve
 lopment of heat at this partition, resulting in the destruction
of the partition. Dr. Arons used gold-leaf as a partition.
The gold-leaf was pasted with Canada balsam over a hole
 about 15 millim. in diameter bored in a glass plate, which
was slipped into the groove of a wooden or vulcanite frame
in the middle of the voltameter. This did not give a tight
partition, but sufficed for the observation that there was not
even risible development of gas on the gold-leaf; whereas
platinum *02 millim. thick, substituted for the gold-leaf,
showed profuse development of gas with the current-strength
 used, even when punctured with a hole 2 millim. square. I
 think Dr. Arons also tried the gold-leaf partition in a solution
 of Cu or Ag salt, and observed that the metal was deposited
 on the partition.
   At the suggestion and under the kind direction of Pro
fessor A. Kundt and Dr. L. Arons I undertook a more
thorough investigation of the subject. Several problems pre
sented themselves :—
    (1) By quantitative measurement to determine whether
there be a critical thickness below which there will be no
polarization at the partition, and, if so, to determine this
thickness.
    (2) To determine the other critical thickness for which the
polarization is as great as for very thick plates.
   (3) The quantitative measurement of this polarization with
the same current-strength for plates of various thicknesses
between these limits.
   (4) By varying the current-strength in these different cases,
to determine what function the polarization is of the current-
strength.
    (5) To learn how the polarization in these cases varies with
the time during which a given current-strength flows, readings

186        Mr. J. Daniel on the Polarization upon a
being made periodically until the polarization becomes con
stant, or nearly so.
   These are the principal direct problems that have been
attacked. Numerous minor observations have been made and
will be discussed in their place. The experiments have been
made in a room of fairly constant temperature, and no attempt
has been made to account for slight variations of temperature
as affecting resistance &c, as the quantities to be measured
are interesting mainly as regards their relative values ; but
especially because such a slight correction would be cloaked
by such unavoidable variations as irregular escape of gas from
the electrodes or partition, in case of its development there.
                              Apparatus.
   The instruments employed as well as the plan of the experi
ments are very simple. As a galvanoscope as well as current-
measurer, a well-damped ring-galvanometer was used. The
galvanometer had four coils of about 22 ohms each, which
could be connected as desired. Deflexions were read with a
telescope on a scale divided into millimetres, fixed at a
distance of 1*5 metre. The instruments were supported by an
independent stone pier. As nearly as possible the same de
flexion of the galvanometer was always used, the resistance
being so adjusted as to effect this; and the "figure of merit"
of the galvanometer for this position was determined by con
necting a Daniell cell with the galvanometer in series with a
known resistance of such value as to give the deflexion to
be used, and found to be, by Ohm's law,
           y = 0*000000265 ampere per scale-division.
For a new position used later, 7= '000000224.
   The connexions for the galvanometer circuit are shown in
fig. 1.
   (a) To measure the strength of current flowing through
the voltameter at any time, we observe the scale-deflexion,
and apply the following simple relations of current and
resistance, by KirchhofFs law :—
      (1)   I=t,+i,.
      (2)   iiri = i2r2, but ?2=7aj and r2=li00, always ;
            .-. 1100 x 0-000000265 x*=j1r1=t>1.
 Here, r, being known, ?\ is determined, and from (1) I is
 found. The shunt resistance, r1? was changed as the main
resistance, B, was altered so as to maintain the same deflexion
of the galvanometer.

  (b) For measuring the ohmic resistance of the voltameter,
Kohlrausch's method with induction-coil and electrodyna-
mometer was used. The connexions for this measurement

188        Mr. J. Daniel on the Polarization upon a
are indicated in fig. 2. A solid iron core was used in the
induction-coil to avoid the great difference in the direct and
inverse currents which exists when a wire coro is used, and
which results in a polarization of the voltameter. The P.O.
box was used as a Wheatstone bridge, of which the voltameter
was one arm, and the movable coil of the electrodynamometer
was connected across the branches of the bridge in the usual
" null method " fashion, the fixed coils being in series with
the main circuit. Being thus used only as a galvanoscope,
its constant need not be discussed ; suffice it to say that the
arrangement was sensitive to several decimals, though resist
ance was measured only to hundredths of an ohm.
    (c) The voltameter is simple, though its construction
involves the only novelty in the apparatus. The voltameter
first used was a glass vessel, 18 centim. long, G centim. wide,
8 centim. deep, with a hard rubber partition, sealed-in with
sealing-wax, in the middle. The opening in the vulcanite was
3 centim. wide, and extended to within 2 centim. of the bottom.
This frame for the partition was made by sealing two pieces
of vulcanite together with a rim of the same between, of the
same thickness as the glass plates bearing the metal partitions,
which were slipped down into the groove thus formed. This
was convenient, as the plates could be easily and quickly
changed ; but a quantitative test showed leakage around the
edge of the glass plate of nearly 20 per cent, of the conduc
tivity when the plate was open, using solid and bored glass
respectively : hence the results obtained with this voltameter
are only relative, not quantitatively correct. This voltameter
and its results would not be mentioned here but for the fact
that I was so careless as to think that this tight-fitting glass
would not allow sensible leakage under the circumstances,
and so made a long series of measurements before testing
the leakage quantitatively, and, too, with some solutions
which I have not had time to repeat with the
                  Voltameter as finally adopted.
   This consists of a glass vessel 20 centim. long, 12 centim.
wide, 11 centim. deep. In the middle is fixed by sealing-wax
a plate-glass partition 3 millim. thick, with a hole in the centre
2 centim. in diameter. A smaller glass plate, with hole
1'5 centim. in diameter, is sealed over this opening, the metal
partition being first sealed over the hole in the small glass.
This gives two water-tight compartments, which also offer no
electrical communication except through the metal under

                 Thin Metal Partition in a Voltameter.           189
  experiment, which covers the hole in the glass. The end
  electrodes are of platinized platinum, 4 by 6 centim. and
  0"1 millim. thick. With CuS04 solution, Cu electrodes were
 used. Very thin plates of metal, even ordinary gold-leaf,
 were easily sealed over the hole in the small glass plate by
  laying the foil on smooth paper, carefully melting sealing-
  wax placed around the hole in the form of powder, and then
  cautiously picking the thin metal up with the melted wax.
  This being safely accomplished, sealing the small glass plate
  over the opening in the partition is easy. Each side of the
  voltameter could then be filled up to the lower edge of the
  opening at once : then, by carefully pouring the solution
  alternately in the two sides a little at a time, using a glass rod,
  the vessel was filled above the gold-leaf, which showed sur
  prising strength in being able to stand a difference of level
  of several millimetres.
     For the voltameter in fig. 1 we have the following rela
  tions :—
      (A) The voltameter included in the circuit and the partition
  open,
                                   E-<?

                                    rx    r%
      We are concerned only with the change in the auxiliary
  resistance, and not its absolute value, in order to make the
  current the same when the partition is changed, and hence
  may simplify the case by representing the sum in the deno
  minator by W. Therefore

      In every case the auxiliary resistance was so adjusted as to

  190        Mr. J. Daniel on the Polarization upon a
  make the current as nearly as possible the same with partition
 in and partition out. This could not be done exactly, but
 ¦was corrected by interpolation. We shall be mainly con
 cerned with the polarization on the partition ; and we see
 from (A) that this polarization, expressed in volts, is the
 simple product of current-strength in amperes, and the change
 of resistance necessary to keep the current the same when
 the partition is added that it was with partition open.
     The same box of resistance was used for all purposes—in
  determining the " figure of merit " of the galvanometer, the
 resistance of the voltameter, and as rheostat to regulate the
 main and branch currents ; hence we are not concerned with
 the question as to whether the units are true ohms, as it does
 not affect our results.
                  Solutions used as Electrolytes.
    With the old voltameter relative values have been obtained
 for 30 per cent. H2S04, 5 per cent. H2S04, and very dilute
 H2S04, such as to give voltameter resistances of 20, 60, and
 100 ohms, about. With the new voltameter, quantitative
measurements have been made with
     30 per cent. H2S04 ;     sp. gr. = T22 ; v— 1*1 ohms.

Also some observations with
                3 per cent. H2S04 ;     sp. gr. = 1*2 ;

and very dilute sulphuric acid.
    As partitions in the voltameter, platinum, gold, silver, and
aluminium have been used, such as are described below. The
thickness of the thick plates was measured with a micrometer-
gauge ; that of the thin plates was calculated from their size,
weight, and specific gravity. The plates marked S, & W.
were from Sy and Wagner, of Berlin, and are supposed to be
quite pure. Those marked M. are from Miiller, of Dresden,
and are, some pure, as indicated, others of the quality of the
finest gold-leaf, i. e. 0*925 pure. It will be convenient in the
Tables to refer to these partitions by the numbers, and the
following description will suffice once for all.

   The series of gold plates is fairly complete. They were
beaten to order by Ferdinand Miiiler in Dresden. Effort
was made to get a similar series of platinum ; but as platinum-
foil for " silvering " seems to have fallen into disuse, I was
unable to find anyone prepared to make it for me. This is
unfortunate, as platinum is the only metal which seems to
remain free from chemical action under a strong and long-
continued electric current. However, as $ 2 and $ 3 of the
platinum happen to fall below and between the critical limits
respectively, they serve as a very important check upon the
results obtained with the more complete gold series, and show
that these results are at least qualitatively correct. Below will
be found reasons for believing them to be quantitativelycorrect.
    In the Tables which follow,
    I = current, in amperes, passing through the voltameter;
    x = polarization, in volts, on the metal partition ;
    v = ohmic resistance of the voltameter, partition open.
    Table I. was obtained with the old voltameter.
    The results in Table II. were obtained with the new volta
 meter without leakage. The readings were taken after
 waiting two minutes for the current to become steady when
 a new plate was inserted, or the resistance changed for a new
 current-strength ; and in case of the thicker plates, where
 the time-change in the polarization was more pronounced
 and continued longer, five to ten minutes was allowed between
 readings, or in each case until the galvanometer indicated
 that the current had become about constant. Later tests
 given in another table show that this time-change of polari
 zation, especially for thick plates, though at first rapid and
 then very slow, really continues some time.

   In this manner, from such a table in the note-book, one
line in Table II. was obtained. The sample-page of my
notes for £ 7 gold was selected to illustrate the method of
observation and reduction, because it also serves as a fair
sample of many efforts to measure quantitatively the polariza
tion on gold-leaf in good-conducting (30 °/0) HsS04. One
has only to look at the time-variation of the polarization
on the end electrodes to be able to account for such slight
variations from zero as occur here (see Table III.). Having
become satisfied from many such series of observations that
there was no measurable polarization on gold-, aluminium-,
and platinum-foil for currents as strong as used, I then
adopted an efficient method of testing them for polarization
in various solutions, viz., to allow the strongest current to
flow through the plate long enough to become constant, and
then, without opening the circuit, to remove the metal parti
tion with a glass rod and simply observe whether there was a
change of deflexion of the galvanometer. On this method of
observation is based the statement under the tables that for
these thinnest partitions there is no polarization for the
currents used. The qualitative results of Table I., with the
old voltameter, seem to indicate pretty clearly a small pola
rization on J 7 gold in very dilute (badly-conducting) acid.
A preliminary test in the new voltameter of water containing
only a few drops of acid, using gold-leaf as partition, gave
sufficient polarization to develop visible gas.
   From Table IV. (p. 198) it seems that for a given current-
strength the polarization is fairly proportional to the square
of the thickness of the partition for plates near the lower
critical thickness. The last column shows this ratio as worked
out for $ 5 and $ 6 gold.

   • We may now briefly summarize the experimental observa
tions :—
     (1) The polarization on a gold-leaf partition in good-
 conducting H2S04 is zero, or too small to detect with our
 apparatus, for the range of current used.
     (2) The " critical thickness " in good-conducting solutions
 of KfiOt, CuS04, and NaCl is greater than -00009 millim.
 for gold ; "00015 millim. for platinum ; and "0005 millim.
 for aluminium, under the above conditions. It is less than
 •0004 millim. for gold ; -002 millim. for Pt ; and "002
 for Ag.
     (3) The "upper critical limit" of thickness under these
 conditions seems to be about -004 millim., rather less than
 tt 3 gold.
     (4) Tables I., II., and III. all point to the conclusion that
 between the " critical limits " of thickness the polarization for
 a given current increases with the thickness.
     (5) Table IL, showing relation of polarization to current,
  expresses two interesting facts :— (a) That the polarization on
  " thick " plates is about the same, in this voltameter, for all
  currents between "2 amp. and, say, "01 amp., provided time
  enough be allowed in each case for the current to become
  constant : t. e. between the upper limit of current at which
  the development of gas is so profuse as by mechanical ob
  struction and irregular escape to interfere, and the lower
  limit, at which the formation of gas is no faster than it can be

              Thin Metal Partition in a Voltameter.            199
dissipated, (b) Quite different is the case for " thin " plates,
where, within the limits of current and thickness prescribed,
the polarization is dependent upon the current, and gives
for each thickness a different curve, or rather straight line,
for they are all straight lines converging to the origin, and
differing only in slope. The current-strength at which the
polarization on very thin plates would reach a maximum is
far above that used, being, perhaps, expressed in amperes
instead of tenths and hundredths.
   By thick plates are denned those above the " upper critical
limit ;" by thin plates those below this limit of thickness.-
    (6) Inspection of Table III., which gives the time-change
of the polarization, will show a similar distinction between
" thick " plates and " thin " to that noted in the last paragraph,
viz., that for thick plates the change is considerable and con
tinues slowly for hours ; for thin plates, the change of
polarization with time is both less pronounced and extends
over much less time.
    (7) It was noted, especially in the case of CuS04 as elec
trolyte, that there was polarization on gold-leaf if the gold
exposed contact with the solution some distance beyond the
edge of the hole in the glass pla^ to which it was sealed.
Thus in CuS04, for the stronger current used there was a
symmetrical deposit of Cu, decreasing in thickness from the
outside toward the centre, and vanishing at a small distance
from the edge of the hole, this distance being less the stronger
the current. If only one corner was left exposed, the Cu
was deposited there. This phenomenon was further tested
by bending a thick strip of aluminium 4 centim. long into
 the shape of a narrow U and simply hanging this U in the
 open hole of the glass partition, in CuS04, and closing the
 circuit on the voltameter ; the two ends of the metal strip
 being thus in contact with the CuS04 on opposite sides of
 the glass, two centim. from the edge of the opening, there
 was decided deposit of Cu on one end and escape of oxygen
 from the other end.
    (8) In CuS04 all the plates except those below the critical
 thickness were destroyed by oxidation. #1 silver was destroyed
 in less than one minute. Of course gold and silver above the
 critical thickness could not be used in NaCl because of
 chemical action, though the thinnest plates were quite un
 affected. Only the # 7 gold was tested in KOH, as it dissolved
 the sealing-wax.
     (9) Thick plates of gold were strongly oxidized in H2S04,
 especially with strong currents. Thin gold plates were
 apparently only oxidized under action of strong or long
                                 P2

continued currents. Compare Tables II. and III. Silver was
even more easily oxidized than gold. Aluminium was so
intensely oxidized by the current that no satisfactory measure
ments could be made for this metal, though the thin foil was
unaffected.
   (10) With H^SO^ as electrolyte, after a thick plate of
pure gold had been used as partition for the time-change of
Table III., the end kathode was found to be gilded. A thick
Pt plate being then substituted for the gold in the same
solution for the results of # 1 Pt in Table III., the Pt par
tition was found on removal to be gilded. The polarization
for J 1 Pt in this case was somewhat less than for the same
Pt after both it and the end electrodes had been thoroughly
cleansed, the electrodes re-platinized, and a fresh solution
made.
    (11) The polarization in CuSO<, using Cu electrodes,
reached a maximum almost immediately and remained very
constant. The maximum polarization for thick Pt in CuS04
was hardly 75 per cent, of that for the same in H2S04. In
NaCl the polarization became constant very quickly also, but
its value was decidedly greater, especially on thin plates, than
 in HjSOi ; though the same distinctive behaviour of thick
 and thin plates maintained.
    (12) In HsS04 of different concentrations the maximum
Eolarization for a partition was of the same order of magnitude ;
  ut its value for very weak currents was decidedly greater in
 weak solutions than for the same current in stronger solutions,
 up to 30 per cent. This shows itself especially with thin
 plates, and also in the shorter time required for thick plates
 to reach a maximum polarization with weak currents. The
 greater change in temperature and the greater change in
 concentration of weak solutions may account for this. For
 currents between 0*1 and 0*2 ampere, the polarization on
 the end electrodes was,
                   forHjSO*       . . . 1-84

 with Cu electrodes, though if the current-density was too
 great or the time long, the anode would oxidize and become
 irregular. C. Fromme, in a paper " Ueber das Maximum der
 galvanischen Polarization von Platinelektroden in Schwefel-
 s'aure " (Annalen d. Physik u. Chemie, xxxiii. pp. 80-126),
 states that the maximum polarization varies both with the
 concentration and the relative size of the electrodes, the
 extreme limits being given a.s l-45 to 4-31 volts—the mini
 mum polarization coinciding with maximum conductivity.

 His method for measuring polarization was somewhat similar
 to that used in this work. As bearing upon "the change of
 polarization with time " I would refer especially to the in-
Testigation of Dr. E. Boot upon this subject, discussed by
Prof, von Helmholtz, Wisch. Abh. vol. i. p. 835. These ex
periments by Dr. Root seem to prove clearly that the
liberated ions penetrate deeply into the electrode, even when
liberated upon but one side of it, as in this case. I take
great pleasure in expressing here my thanks and deep
obligation to Professor A. Kundt and Dr. L. Arons for their
kind sympathy and direction in this work.

          XV. A Potentiometer for Alternating Currents.
                         By James Swinburne*.
                                Argument.
   A direct pressure is balanced against an alternating pressure by means
of a differential electrometer with single-fibre suspension, a null method
being employed. An alternating and a direct current are similarly
compared by means of a differential dynamometer with the controlling
spring removed.
ONE of the chief difficulties in the way of the accurate
         measurement of alternating pressures and currents
arises in the calibration of the instruments. Some of the
alternating-current instruments, such as those on the electro-
dynamometer principle, give the same reading whether a
direct or alternating current is used ; and electrometers and
some forms of electromagnetic instruments with soft iron
cores are also adapted equally well for direct and alternating-
current work. This is not the case, however, with a large
class of instruments, and the only method at present available
for calibrating such instruments is comparing them with
another instrument which has been calibrated by means of
a direct current. Such a practice allows errors to creep
in.      No careful electrician would trust to direct-current
instruments calibrated second-hand, and accuracy is just as
important in alternating-current work. In addition to this,
the collection of cells and resistances which are now included
under the name " potentiometer " is exceedingly useful in
any laboratory where it can be permanently set up, as it
measures currents and pressures throughout an enormous

202           Mr. J. Swinburne on a Potentiometer
range with an accuracy that is quite unattainable by means
of any otber forms of voltmeter or ampere-meter. It is
therefore of the highest scientific importance to be able to
extend the potentiometer method into alternating-current
work, so that comparisons can be made directly with a
standard cell.
   In October 1891* I described two forms of alternaiing-
current so-called ohmmeter. These instruments measured
either a quantity R such that ffl/R was the power when E
was the effective or virtual pressure, or a quantity r such that
Cr2 was the power when C was the virtual or effective current.
Of course in a circuit with capacity or self-induction, R and r
are not equal. One form of alternating ohmmeter was elec
trostatic, the other electromagnetic. The electrostatic ohm
meter can be coupled up in such a way as to compare two
pressures, and one of these may be alternating and the other
direct. The electrostatic instrument has the advantage over
the electromagnetic in requiring only one connexion to the
moving system, or needle, and that connexion has not to carry
any appreciable current. The needle may therefore be sus
pended by means of a single silk fibre, connexion being made
through a hanger dipping into water, and this hanger may
end in a vane to make the instrument dead-beat. As the
ohmmeter does not need any torsional control, but should be,
on the contrary, as free as possible, this form of instrument
can be made exceedingly sensitive. For potentiometer work
it is best not to use the instrument for giving the ratio of two
electromotive forces, but to design it as a differential galvano
meter which shows whether the pressures are equal or not.
                                   Fxg. 1.
   The disposition of the whole apparatus is shown diagram-
matically in fig. 1. In this scheme a is a battery maintaining

a current in the resistance be, which is regulated by an
adjustable resistance so that the standard cell e is balanced
when its contact/ is touched down at the mark corresponding
to its electromotive force at the temperature at which it
stands ; k is an alternating dynamo, and h is the alternating
voltmeter to be calibrated. The differential electrometer is
connected up as shown. The double fishtail-shaped needle
is pulled one way by a force varying as the square of the
direct electromotive force, and the other way by a force vary
ing as the square of the alternating pressure. The fishtail
shape is necessary to ensure that the needle is in stable equi
librium when the forces are equal. Fig. 1 is, of course, a
mere diagram. Resistance-coils for adjustment are left out,
and b c is shown as a stretched wire, whereas it is made up of
resistance-coils. As to sensitiveness, it depends on the con
struction of the electrometer ; but, as already explained, there
is no controlling force except that due to the suspending fibre.
Take as an example an instrument that will indicate one volt
when there is no pressure on the other side : it will- admit of
the comparison of two pressures of approximately 100 volts
within one in ten thousand ; and it will serve for comparing
2000 volts within one in four million. To find the true zero
of the instrument the four quadrants are connected together.
The key for making this connexion is not shown.
   One of the great advantages of the potentiometer method
in direct-current work is the ease with which large currents
can be measured by the fall of potential over very small
resistances. As the electrometer must bo used idiostatically
in alternating work it is not sensitive to very small pressures;
and the method given is, unfortunately, useful only for
pressure measurements. Accurate current measurements can
be taken by the use of a differential dynamometer. This
instrument has two fixed and one moving coil. The direct
circuit is through one fixed and the alternating through the
other fixed coil, and both circuits are led through the moving
coil. The controlling spring is removed. This method is
somewhat more complicated than in the case of pressure, and
mercury contacts are necessary. The arrangement is shown
in fig. 2. The battery, a, supplies a direct current, which is
measured by the fall of potential over the low resistance, b,
and which passes in one of the fixed coils, c, and the moving
coil, d. The alternating-current circuit is led through the
circuit,/, whose current is to be measured, and through the
other fixed coil, e, and the moving coil, d. There is a slight
error due to the whole of the alternating circuit being in
shunt to the moving coil considered as part of the direct-
current circuit, and vice versd ; but this is very minute. If

204        Prof. Q-. M. Minchin on the Magnetic Field
e and e are wound close together so that there is no appre
ciable time-lag in any current induced in c by e, the small
error due to the mutual induction of these coils cancels out.
 Of course a double dynamometer might be used, but then
 four mercury connexion? are needed. It is not unlikely that
 a method with no mercury contacts can be made available,
 and greater accuracy could then be attained.
 XVI. Calculation of the Magnetic Field of a Current running in
   a Cylindrical Coil. By Professor G. M. Minchin, M.A.*
 LET there be a series of very close circular currents run
        ning in the same sense and lying on a right cylinder
 of radius a whose axis is 00' (fig. 1), and let it he required
 to find the magnetic potential of this system at any point, P,
 in space.
    Replace each of these circular currents by its equivalent
 magnetic shell, which we shall take as a uniform circular
 plate coinciding with the aperture of the circle. Supposing
 the currents to circulate in the sense ACB, the upper surface
 of each plate (as seen in the figure) will be positive and the
 lower negative. Each circle being touched all round by the
one below it, the negative surface of any plate will coincide
 with the positive of the one next below it ; so that we shall
be left with a terminal positive plate, ACB, and a terminal

negative plate, A'C'B', as the approximate equivalent of the
given coil of wire. We shall now calculate the potential

 matter on this plate being m.

     Of course it is well known that this potential can be ex
 hibited by a series of Zonal Harmonics proceeding by powers,

  positive or negative, of the ratio —, where 0 is the centre
  of the plate and a its radius, according as P is near 0 or
  distant from it ; but when OP is not very much greater or
  very much less than a, the series is inconvenient, owing to the
  enormous number of terms that have to be taken to give a
  good approximation.
     Hence we shall not use Spherical Harmonics.

206        Prof. G. M. Minchin on the Magnetic Field
   Let PN be the perpendicular on the plate from P ; let
AB be the diameter in which it is cut by the plane through
the axis of the plate and P ; let Q, S be two very close
points on the circumference, NQ making the angle 8 with
NA. Then we shall suppose the plate broken up into tri
angular strips such as QNS, and calculate the potential of
each strip at P.
   Let L be any point on NQ, let NL = f ; then the poten
tial of the element ml-di-dO at P is m&i&0 QT m^ ffif
where PN = «. If NQ = r we find by integration that the
potential produced by the strip QNS is
                     mdd(Sr* + z*-z),                         (1)
 and the potential, V, of the whole plate is
                      2m j( >J?+7-z)dd                        (2)
   Now if, as in the figure, the point N falls within the plate,
the limits of 6 are 0 and it ; if N falls on the edge of the
plate, at B, the limits are 0 and _ ; and if it falls outside the
plate, the limits are 0 and 0. Taking 0 as the independent
variable would, then, give us three different expressions for V,
according to the position of N ; and hence we must choose a
more convenient variable than 6. Let <f> be the angle QOA,
and change the expression (2) into one in which <f> is the
 independent variable. We shall then have

    The integral in (5) is the complete elliptic integral of the
 third kind with modulus k and rparameter (a +—          x)* This
 parameter is numerically greater than the modulus ; and we
 shall find it convenient to convert the integral into one
 in which the parameter is less than the modulus by the
 well-known rule that a function with parameter n can he
 converted into one with parameter — .        If the angles PBA

   From (14) we can derive an expression for the conical
angle subtended at any point, P, in space by a circle, i. e., for
the magnetic potential due to a current coinciding with the
circle. It is well known that this conical angle is numerically
equal to the component of the attraction, perpendicular to the
plate, at P due to a uniform circular plate coinciding with the
aperture of the circle—a result which is evident from the
principle that the current can be replaced by a magnetic
shell, or thin plate, the upper and lower surfaces of which
are, of course, of opposite signs. But the resultant potential
of these two indefinitely close plates is the difference between
the value of V in (14) and the value which (14) assumes when
z + Az is substituted for z ; that is, the magnetic potential at
                              dV
P due to the current is —— . Az, and the strength of the
                              dz
magnetic shell is m . A;, which is i, the current in the circle ;
so that the magnetic potential is i multiplied by minus the
differential coefficient of the right-hand side of (14) with
respect to z.
   Denote the function tt + KK' — KEj — EKj by the symbol

the two terminal plates, ACB, A'CB' may be considered as

The field due to the plate AB is most readily mapped out by
describing a large number of very close circles of the ortho

«AB, pAB, ... of /9, drawing a line BP in the assigned
direction 0, and from Legendre's tables of Elliptic Integrals
taking out the values of K, E, K^, E',.
   The properties of the orthogonal circles lead to some simple
results with regard to potentials. Thus, if any line, AP, is
drawn from A cutting any circle of the series in P and P',
the lines joining P and P' to B are equally inclined to AB,
i.e., Z.ABP' = tt-0.
   Now if in Ae we put ir — d for 6, we have, in virtue of
Legendre's relation between complete complementary inte
grals, Aw_e=ir-Ae, i. e.,
                           A„-*+A, = 7T                    (21)
Hence, from (18), if ft, ft' are the conical angles subtended
at P, P' respectively by the circle (or plate) AB, we have
the remarkable relation
                    ft + ft' = 2tt- ik'K sin 6              (22)
 Again, if V, V are the potentials at P, P' due to the plate,
 we have from (15)
                     + ^, = 2m(2E->rrk! sm0), .       . .   (23)
a result which enables us to lay down the field at all points
to the right of the perpendicular Bp when the field to the
left of Bp is known.
    Supposing now that instead of a single wire of diameter
AB, we have a series of wires forming a coil contained be
tween the diameter AB and the diameter ST, i. e., the breadth
 of the coil is BT or AS ; then in calculating the potential at
 P we shall have to find the potentials due to a series of cir
 cular plates, each of surface-density m, and to add these
 potentials together. But observe that the potential at P due

           of a Current running in a Cylindrical Coil.         213
to any plate, AB, of radius a is of the form
                                                               (24)
where <p(k, 6) is the coefficient of a in (15), and <f>(k, 8) is a
function of 6 and 6', the angles PAB and PBA. Hence if
we take a plate of radius OQ, and from B draw Bq parallel to
QP and meeting OP in q, the potential of this plate at P is
to the potential of the plate AB at q as OQ is to OA ; for, if
AR = BQ, the angles 7BA and 9AB are equal, respectively,
to PQR and PRQ. Hence, if r=OQ and Yg is the potential
at q due to the plate AB (of radius a), the resultant potential
at P due to the series of plates of radii extending from OB to
OT is
                             £Sr.V9                            (25)
the points q on OP ranging from t to P, where B< is parallel
to PT.
    Of course any plate of the series may be taken instead of
AB as the reference plate.
    Thus, the resultant potential, due to all the plates, is calcu
lated from values of the potential of any one plate at a series of
points ranged along the radius vector OP.
    Pass now to the consideration of the practical problem in
hand, viz., the potential at P due to a coil of depth 00', i. e.,
 we have to consider the whole of the spaces BTT'B' and
ASS'A' tilled with wire traversed by a current of strength i.
We have already seen that we have to subtract from the
 potential at P due to a series of uniform attracting plates,
 each of surface-density m, ranging from the radius OB to the
 radius OT, the potential at P due to the lower series, each of
 surface-density m, and ranging from radius OB' to radius OT'.
 It merely remains to express m in terms of current-density.
 If C is the total quantity of current traversing (at right
 angles to the plane of the paper) a unit area (square centi
 metre) of the space BTT'B', the quantity flowing in a filament
 of depth dy and breadth dr is Cdydr. Now this filament is
 replaced by the magnetic shell of radius r and thickness dy ;
 and since we know that the strength of the shell is equal to
the current in the filament, we have m . dy = Cdydr, .\m = Cdr;
hence (25) becomes, from (15),
                         iC$r.<f,(k,0)dr,                      (26)
 which is the potential due to the upper series of plates,
OB, . . . OT.
    This quantity may be graphically represented and calcu
 lated as follows. Let a very close series of curves representing

parallel to 00', the depth of the coil, the potential at P due
to the lower series of plates, OB', . . . OT', is equal to that at

          XVII. On the Thermal Behaviour of Liquids.
     By Prof. William Ramsay and Prof. Sydney Young.
           To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine.
       Gentlemen,
 DURING recent years several papers on the thermal pro
         perties of gase3 and liquids, which contain what we
 believe to be incorrect conclusions, have been published ; and
 in the interest of accurate knowledge we feel bound to make
 some comments on them, and to point out in what respects
 they are erroneous.
    We shall first consider certain observations on the critical
 point.
    Battelli (Atti del R. Tstituto Veneto di Scieme, iv. serie vii.
 1892-93 ; also a pamphlet published by Antonelli, Venice)
comes to the following conclusions regarding the critical
 point:—
    " 1. The critical temperature is that at which the cohesion
 of the liquid particles is so diminished that they no longer
 remain together, but expand throughout the containing vessel.
    " 2. Above the critical temperature the liquid particles con
 tinue to vaporize, t. e. to separate into molecules of saturated
 vapour, as the temperature rises.
    " 3. Retaining for the term ' critical point ' the significa
 tion which it has in the isothermal diagram, the determination
 of the critical point (temperature ?) by means of the optical
method is not generally exact ; because the disappearance of
the meniscus takes place at a temperature higher than the
critical temperature, and striae (intorbimento) appear at a
temperature the lower, the greater the amount of liquid
contained in the experimental tube."
    Again, in Wiedemann's Annalen, vol. 1. p. 531, Galitzine
states that the critical temperature, determined by heating
the liquid and allowing it to cool until a meniscns is just
visible, is lower than the true critical temperature. He also
makes the remarkable assertion that at temperatures con
siderably higher than the critical temperature the substance
at constant pressure may have different densities, varying as
much as 25 per cent., owing to the formation of liquid com
plexes 1 A short account of these conclusions is to be found
in ' Nature/ November 23, 1893, and in this Journal, Dec.
1893, p. 552.
   Zambiasi and de Heen also state that the temperature at
which mist and strise appear when the substance is cooled is
lower than the true critical temperature, but in other respects
                                 Q2

216            Profs. Ramsay and Young on t/te
the results obtained by these two observers are contradictory.
Zambiasi found that the temperature at which the meniscus
disappears on heating is identical with that at which mist and
striae form on cooling; and that both temperatures are lowered
by increasing the quantity of the liquid relatively to the
vapour. De Heen, on the contrary, found that the tempera
ture at which the meniscus disappears is raised on increasing
the relative quantity of liquid ; while Galitzine found the
temperature at which the meniscus disappears to be higher
than the temperature at which it appears, but both of them
practically independent of the relative quantity of liquid.
   Again, the critical temperatures of the esters given by
de Heen differ enormously from those observed by Nadejdine
and by one of us ; that of methyl acetate differs by no less
than 46° I
   There can be little doubt that in most, if not in all of such
experiments, the arrangements employed to maintain constant
high temperatures must have been sadly defective. Battelli
made use of fractions of petroleum-oil, boiling at intervals
of temperature of 10°. This plan was tried by one of us as
long ago as 1879, and subsequently rejected as entirely
unsatisfactory. The heating arrangement employed by Galit
zine would be satisfactory if the sample of naphthalene used
as a jacket were pure. This method is a modification of that
which we have constantly employed, and frequently recom
mended, during the last ten years ; yet it is strange that while
 Galitzine refers to an early paper by one of us containing
 conclusions which have been acknowledged as erroneous in
subsequent papers, he makes no reference to our later work,
of which he appears to be ignorant. Moreover he relies on
 de Heen's work, which is very inaccurate. Precisely such
 conclusions as appear in these papers were given by one of us
 in the paper referred to (Proc. Roy. Soc. 1880, xxx. p. 323,
 and xxxi. p. 194), in which similar arguments were adduced
 in favour of liquid molecules, and of the non-identity of
 the liquid and gaseous states at and above the critical
 point. The author of that paper again takes this opportunity
 to say that he no longer believes in the conclusions ; and
 he would regret the publication of that paper were it not
 for the hope that it may serve as a beacon to warn others,
 beginning to experiment on the subject, from the numerous
 rocks and shoals with which it is beset.
    Since that paper was published we have been engaged on
 many pieces of joint work, and the critical constants of ether
 and of the alcohols have been determined with great care ;
 the constants for no less than 18 other liquids have also been

                   Thermal Behaviour of Liquids.              217
determined by one of as. Our observations have led us to the
following conclusions :—
   1. If temperature and volume be kept quite constant, stria
are never seen, but only a blue, misty appearance.
   2. It is absolutely essential that the whole of the sub
stance should be equally heated, and this result cannot be
attained if the vapour of an impure liquid be employed as a
jacket.
   3. It is equally essential that the liquid examined should
be perfectly pure and free from air ; these precautions are
especially important in the determinations of volumes near
the critical point, since the smallest alteration in temperature
or pressure produces a great alteration in volume ; and to this
fact the erroneous conclusions referred to are in all probability
to be attributed.
   In certain cases, as for example with alcohols and acids,
there may be molecular complexes at the critical point ; but
we have no doubt whatever that the substance is physically
homogeneous, as much so indeed as a thorough mixture of
oxygen and hydrogen gases is ; and that the only difference in
density in different regions is that due to the weight of the
substance itself compressing the lower regions to a slightly
different density tbau that of the upper regions, just as the
density of the atmosphere at the level of the sea is greater
than that on a mountain (see Gouy, Compt. Rend. 1892,
p. 720).
   These considerations are sufficient, we think, to explain the
erroneous conclusions of the authors referred to.
   It is necessary next to draw attention to an incorrect ob
servation of Battelli, regarding the vapour-pressures of liquids
and in particular of alcohol (Memorie delta Reale Aceademia
delle Scienze di Torino, serie ii. torn. xliv. p. 11). He there
states that he notices with alcohol what he has previously
noticed with other liquids, that the vapour-pressure at a given
temperature depends on the relative volumes of liquid and
fas, increasing as the volume of liquid increases and gas
  iminishes, t. e. with decrease of volume. This observation
is absolutely opposed to our experience, and implies one of
two causes,—either that his sample of alcohol contained some
other liquid, or that it contained some permanent gas. His
data do not allow us to decide to which of these causes his
results are to be attributed. It is also to be noted that the
vapour-pressures which he records are in every case some
what higher than those observed by Regnault and by ourselves.
   Such work as that referred to requires the utmost care,
especially in securing uniform known temperatures ; and it

218       Mr. W. H. Steele's Thermoelectric Diagram
is to be regretted that observations should be published,
and conclusions drawn which are affected by errors easy to
avoid by the use of pure vapours from liquids boiling under
constant known pressures as a means of obtaining constant
known temperatures. A little trouble taken at the beginning
of a research in purifying the liquids employed as jackets is
well-rewarded in the avoidance of erroneous observations
during the progress of the research ; and inasmuch as many
mathematical physicists are endeavouring to find some ex
pression which will better fit facts than van der Waals' simple
but approximate formula, it appears a pity that untrustworthy
observations should be offered as a groundwork for their
ana,ysis-                                 William Ramsay.

   XVIII. Thermoelectric Diagram for some Pure Metals.
           By W. Huey Steele, if.A., Melbourne*.
SINCE 1873, so far as I am aware, no work on this subject
      has been published. Tn that year Professor Tait, in the
Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, published
" A First Approximation to a Thermoelectric Diagram," and
stated that it was only an approximation and that other re
sults would follow. The results in the paper above have since
been accepted as the most reliable. In his paper he gives
very little experimental detail, such as the method of observa
tion, sensitiveness of galvanometer, &c, and the greater part
of the paper is taken up with the behaviour of the iron line.
In making some thermoelectric observations I had reason to
suspect that his diagram was not quite rjght, and further
measurements showed that the copper line was far from its
right position. I determined therefore to construct a diagram
for as many pure metals as I was able to obtain.
   Whatever method of observation is adopted, one essential
in thermoelectric observation is an exceedingly delicate gal
vanometer, that one being the best which indicates the least
electromotive force applied to its terminals, not the one
indicating the least current. Of the various sensitive galvano
meters at my command, the best was a one- coil, low-resistance
 (about half an ohm), astatic instrument made by Elliot
Bros. The needles, about 45 millim. in length, were
                 • Communicated bv the Author.

                    for some Pure Metals.                    219
magnetized to saturation by flashing through a very great
number of turns of fine wire round the needles as heavy a
current as the wire would carry. They were then sus
pended, and the stronger gently stroked with a weak magnet
till the desired sensibility was obtained. The system was
quite stable in the earth's field, and the time of swing was
about 10 seconds. The mirror was concave, with a focal
length of 8 inches. A half-millimetre scale ruled on glass
was placed about 60 inches from the mirror, between it and
a well-lighted frosted window. The image of this scale was
very sharply defined and permitted magnification by an eye
piece magnifying 10 diameters, the lines still being sharp
and clear, and tenths of a division could be estimated. An
electromotive force of ten absolute unite produced a deflexion
of one scale-division, and one absolute unit might be detected.
A Thomson galvanometer of 10,000 ohms to be equally
sensitive would have to indicate 10-la amperes.
    The method of observation may be learned from the accom
panying diagram. E is a Clark cell joined in series with an
adjustable high resistance It, a known low resistance r, and a
key Kj ; as a shunt on r there is the thermal junction e, the
galvanometer G, and a key K3. A copper wire to, of the same
resistance as the junction, is put across its ends in such a way
that by means of the three-way key K3 either this wire or the
junction may be put into the gavanometer circuit. In making
an observation to is put into the circuit, K2 closed, and the
deflexion, if any, observed. This comes from the unequally
heated junctions forming the circuit ; and so great was the
sensitiveness of the galvanometer that even when there was
nothing but copper and brass in circuit, and it had not been
 interfered with for some hours (the first thing in the morning

 220       Mr. W. H. Steele's Thermoelectric Diagram
 for example), a deflexion of a scale-division or two was always
observed on closing K2. This deflexion generally increased
while observation was going on, chiefly from Peltier effects
 in r. This deflexion having been mentally noted, w was
 thrown out and e put in, Kj and K2 closed, and R adjusted till
 the deflexion was the same as that observed previously. Then
e/E is equal to ^/(R + r + Ej), E6 being the internal resistance
 of E. I used the Clark cell, as it had been recommended by
 Prof. Threlfall (Phil. Mag. 1889, vol. xxviii.) as a good source
of small constant currents. I made three according to Lord
 Rayleigh's instructions, and on testing them found that they
 gave consistent results when closed through resistances of not
less than 6000, 5000, and 4000 ohms respectively. That is, the
values of the internal resistance from any two observations
with resistances higher than those mentioned were consistent,
but began to vary when the cells were closed through less
resistances. But after being closed through lower resistances,
they quickly recovered on being left on open circuit. The
resistances of the cells were 265, 43, and 50 ohms. In my
observations I never used more than two thirds of the current
that I might have as determined above, and when I wished to
have a greater current (as was necessary in working with
antimony) I put the three cells in parallel and closed through
3800 ohms.
   When copper was one of the metals forming the pair under
examination, the junctions of the copper with the two ends of
the other metal, generally a wire, were immersed in beakers
of oil, the junction formed by twisting the wires together
being wrapped round the bulbs of the thermometers. When
copper was not one of the pair, then the one junction was in
a beaker of hot oil as before, and the two junctions of copper
with the two other metals were kept in the same beaker of
oil, insulation being of course attended to. By observing the
temperatures of the hot and cold junctions on each occasion,
it was not necessary to take any precautions to keep the cold
junction at a constant temperature, as the correction to be
applied was determined from each set of observations.
   I did not go higher than 100° C. in observing, as I had
shown (Proc. Roy. Soc. Victoria, 1893) that at high tempera
tures the ordinary thermoelectric formulae fail, and occa
sionally I noticed irregularities coming in even at 100° C.
In the paper quoted I have described some months' experi
ments in heating single conductors, in wbichjl found that at
the temperature of 1000° C. an irregular, arbitrary sort of an
electromotive force niav be obtained. This is sometimes

                     for some Pure Metals.                  221
enormously high (as thermoelectric forces go), as in the case
of half a dozen different metals I observed 3 volt, about the
same as that given by a junction of bismuth and antimony at
that temperature, did the ordinary formulae hold so far. At
lower temperatures these irregular offects are not so great,
being more than proportionately smaller, but still on several
occasions I found them distinctly marked even as low as
200° C.
   In any series of observations the relation between the
observed values of the temperature T and E.M.F. e is of the
form e=a(T— T0) +b(T— Tu)8, where T0 is the temperature of
the cold junction and a and b are constants to be determined,
b being positive or negative, according as the lines of the two
metals being examined intersect below or above T0. In
each, a and b were determined by the method of least squares.
e having been calculated again in each case from the values
of a and b thus obtained and the observed values of T, the
means of the differences between the values of e thus
calculated and those observed are given below in each case as
the mean error in absolute units. To compare the error in
different cases, I have also expressed it as the mean error in
temperature. It will be noticed that frequently the dis
crepancies between different sets of observations on one junc
tion are enormously greater than the mean error in one set,
in spite of the fact that, as far as one could tell, they were
in exactly the same condition in each case and were not even
touched between the experiments. In view of the experi
ments referred to above and these discrepancies, one is led to
the suspicion that the thermoelectric constants are not really
constant, but that they vary in a given specimen in a manner
which, if not arbitrary, yet arises from changes in condition
which are inappreciable. I usually made three sets of obser
vations on any pair of metals I examined, but with copper and
lead I made more,—first to find out if the constants tended to
become more constant, or, if not, to see if they varied in any
regular manner ; and, secondly, because I had taken copperas
a base-line for some metals which lay close to it, and it was
therefore necessary to determine its position with more than
usual accuracy. The following are the thermoelectric heights
observed ; the metal with the higher line being in each case
put first :—

   The column headed " mean error " shows the mean error
of each set of observations, expressed in absolute units of
E.M.F., and also in fractions of a degree. The last column
is the calculated E.M.F. of a pair one of whose junctions is
at 0° C, the other at 100° C. The discrepancies between the
values determined from different sets of observations are very
much greater than the mean error of a single set, which
appears to indicate, as already mentioned, that the thermo
electric " constants " are not absolutely constant. In deter
mining these constants, it is an open question whether they
should be found from a short range of low temperatures, or
whether a long range of temperatures should be observed.
In the former case the most accurate observations can be
taken, and are practically uninfluenced by the irregular effects
mentioned above ; but in this case the Thomson effect comes
in as a quantity of a much smaller order of magnitude than
the absolute height. If the range of temperature be greater,
the Thomson effect is a much more important quantity, and
can consequently be determined more accurately. In this
case, however, the accuracy of the observations is very
seriously interfered with by the irregularity of the effect
referred to above. Different ranges of temperature with
different junctions might be advisable, but I considered that
a range of 85° or 90° would give sufficiently accurate results.
I was disappointed in some of them, e.g. antimony and cad
mium, but in these the mean result is probably not very far
from the truth, especially in calculating electromotive forces ;
the error in the constants considered apart from one another
is of course greater. In writing down the thermoelectric
height of each relatively to lead, some metals will have two
values ; that is, in cases of three metals where the three pairs
were examined separately, as for instance in lead, copper,
and zinc, the height of the zinc line might be taken as the
observed height above lead, or the sum (or difference) of the
lead-copper and copper-zinc heights. In this case, where the
zinc line lies between the copper and the lead lines, the
former of the two values will be the more accurate, and in
estimating the position I have given the two values weight in
the ratio of three to one. In the case of tin, which lies very
close to lead compared with copper, I have taken the directly
observed height as the true one, as the other is the difference
of two large and nearly equal quantities—a very inaccurate
method of observing the value. The following table is the
result of all the observations, which is also shown graphically
on the diagram with the exception of the antimony line :—

    Lead.—This was very pure, and was specially prepared for
me by the method of IStas, by Mr. N. T. M. Wilsmore,
M.Sc, F.C.S. Lead acetate was dissolved in water and
digested for a week with sheet lead. The solution was
filtered into hot dilute sulphuric acid, and the precipitated
sulphate treated with water, dilute sulphuric acid, and again
with water till perfectly free from acid. The sulphate was
then stirred for some days in a beaker with solution of large
excess of ammonium sesquicarbonate and ammonia, and washed
till free from soluble ammonium sulphate. This treatment
was repeated till the lead sulphate was nearly all converted
into carbonate. A little of this was converted into monoxide
by heating in a platinum dish, and the remainder nearly dis
solved in dilute nitric acid, and the oxide added little by little,
thus precipitating any iron which might be present. The
solution was again filtered and added to solution of excess of
pure ammonium sesquicarbonate and stirred, thus forming
pure lead carbonate. This was dried and reduced under
potassium cyanide in an unglazed porcelain crucible, the
contents of which were poured into a polished steel mould.
The lead button was washed with water, alcohol, and ether,
and immediately placed in a glass tube with a narrow tube
sealed on to the end. This was alternately exhausted and
 filled with pure hydrogen about a dozen times, and finally
 exhausted with a Sprengel and hermetically sealed. The
 lead was again melted and run into the narrow tube, a com-
Sact rod being thus obtained, which was drawn through
  raw-plates down to a wire of the desired size. All the
reagents used were as pure as could be obtained, and were
tested for impurities, especially metallic impurities, and when
necessary were repurified. Mr. Wilsmore considered that
the lead was free from all other metals, and from impurities
of all kinds except perhaps a trace of oxide formed during the
washing in water.
    Silver.—This was prepared by Mr. W. Percy Wilkinson,
 Government Analyst, and considered by him to be " fairly
 pure/' Silver chloride was reduced with wood charcoal and
 pure sodium carbonate. The ingot was washed with boiling
water slightly acidulated with hydrochloric acid, and finally
scrubbed with clean sand. This was re-dissolved in pure
nitric acid, largely diluted, precipitated with dilute hydro
chloric acid, washed with water, boiled with nitric acid,

 226       Thermoelectric Diagram for some Pure Metals.
 washed with water, dried, digested with pure, hot hydro
 chloric acid, washed with boiling water, and dried at 100° C.
 The chloride was then reduced with pure sodium carbonate
 and wood charcoal, the ingot being treated as before. It was
 hammered into a rod with a polished steel hammer, on a
 similar anvil, and drawn through steel and agate draw-plates
 and annealed.
    Antimony.—This was also prepared by Mr. Wilkinson,
 being reduced by him from pure antimony oxide, and con
 sidered by him to be " very pure." I melted it and cast it
into a long rod in an iron mould, and broke off the ends and
 soldered them on at right angles so as to dip into the oil
 baths, and also soldered copper wires on to the ends to form
 the junction. (This was the only case in which I used solder;
 in all others I merely twisted the wires together.)
    Gold.—This was an exceedingly pure specimen supplied by
 the Melbourne branch of the Royal Mint. The percentage
of gold being 99"994 according to the most delicate tests that
 could be made at the Mint. The Mint has also supplied the
 Physical Laboratory with a specimen of purity 99'998, but I
 was content to use the inferior of the two. The wire was
 drawn through three holes of the draw-plate after the last
 annealing, and may therefore be considered hard-drawn.
    Zinc.—The zinc I used was supplied in rods by Messrs.
 Baird and Tatlock as pure redistilled zinc for making Clark
cells. I could not draw it, and fused several rods end to
end and bent it into the required shape.
    Thallium. —This was given me by Mr. Wilkinson, who
obtained it from Schuchardt as pure. Professor Masson
analyzed it for me and found it contained 97*9 per cent of
thallium, 1*5 per cent, lead, and traces of arsenic and copper.
    Cadmium was also Schuchardt's pure, given me by Mr.
Wilkinson. It was in form of a thick rod, which I hammered
into a finer one and drew it through steel draw-plates.
   Tin.—From same source and treated in same way as
cadmium.
   Copper.—" Pure Swedish Copper," as sold in the city for
gold-refining processes. I used it in the hard-drawn state.
   Aluminium.—Commercial Neuchatel aluminium.

     XIX. On Ridge-Lines and Lines connected with them.
 By J. McCoWAN, ALA., D.Sc, University College, Dundee*.
THE topography of mountainous regions, districts of
        upland and valley, was discussed by Cayley, in 1859,
in a paper " On Contour and Slope Lines "t, and again by
Maxwell, in 1870, in a paper " On Hills and Dales" {. So far
as contour- and slope-lines are immediately concerned the dis
cussion may therefore be regarded as complete ; but I desire
to define and call attention to certain lines connected with
these which I shall discuss in some detail in the following
paper, and which are especially characteristic of the general
configuration of a region of mountain and valley. These
lines I have called ridge-lines, but they are not to be con
founded with those to which Cayley gave that name. The
word "ridge "as he employs it seems in general usage to have
given place to the term " watershed," used in its stead by Max
well ; so perhaps I may be permitted to transfer it to the
lines I wish to discuss, as being specially descriptive of them.
It may be noted that in general there will be a ridge, as I
define it very near to, and in some cases coincident with, tbe
particular line of slope to which Cayley gave the name.
             § 1. Contour-Lines and Lines of Slope.
    Consider the configuration of a surface, of any form, rela
tively to a plane fixed with respect to it. This plane will be
called the base and will be regarded as horizontal, so that
Elanes parallel and perpendicular to it may be described as
  orizontal and vertical planes respectively. The surface may
be, for example, that of any portion of land, and the base the
sea-level, provided that the part considered is not so large as
to require the curvature of the earth's surface to be taken
into account.
    The curves in which the surface is intersected by horizontal
planes are called contour-lines, or simply contours. Lines on
the surface which cut the contours orthogonally are called
lines of slope : the inclination at any point of a line of slope to
the base is therefore equal to the inclination to the base of tbe
tangent plane at the same point and is a measure of the slope
there. Points at a maximum or minimum height above the
base at which horizontal tangent planes touch the surface are

matical Society, December 8, 1893.

228              Dr. J. McCowan on Ridge-Lines
called summits and immits respectively : all lines of slope run
from summits to immits, and obviously cannot cross each other
at any intermediate point, though a line may branch at any
point where there is a horizontal tangent plane. At summits
and immits the surface is synclastic and the contours are
reduced to points ; but a horizontal plane may touch the sur
face at a point, called a col, where the surface is anticlastic,
and where consequently two branches of a contour-line will in
general intersect, the point of contact being a double point of
the curve of section. Other varieties of contact need not be
specially noted here as their occurrence is very exceptional. In
the case of a land surface the summits are the tops of the hills,
and the immits the bottoms of lakes or basins, while the cols
are such points as the heads of passes between hills or places
where streams flow out from lakes. The two lines of slope
from a col to the two adjacent summits form together what is
called a watershed, and the line of slope from a col to an
immit is called a watercourse*.
                  § 2. Definition of Ridge-Lines.
   The section of a surface by a plane parallel and very near
to the tangent plane at any point, or, as it is generally called,
the indicatrix for that point, is in general a conic. The
directions of the axes of this conic, depending only on the
form of the surface and not at all on its relation to the base,
are independent of the directions of the slope- and contour-
lines, and therefore the surface in the immediate neighbour
hood of any point is in general unsymmetrical about the line
of slope through the point. There are, however, points on
the surface at which the directions of the principal axes of
the indicatrix coincide with the directions of the slope- and
contour-lines, and the locus of such points is a line which I
 propose to call a ridge-line. The ridge-line, then, is defined
by this property:—A surface, in the immediate neighbourhood
of any point on a ridge-line, is symmetrical about the line of
slope through that point.
    The topographical significance of the line is to be noted.
The features of a hilly country which are, perhaps, most cha
 racteristic are the ridges and spurs of the hills and the glens
or valleys between them. The general trend of these features
is given by the ridge-lines, each ridge-line being, so to speak,
the central or axial line, the line of (infinitesimal) symmetry
of a ridge or valley—the valleys may be regarded as negative

 or inverted ridges. The ridge-lines run down the bottoms of
 the glens or along the tops of the ridges and spurs of the
 hills, or again down the lines where the descent is most
 precipitous.
    Many of the most interesting properties of the ridge-lines
 may be derived almost immediately from the definition. For
 instance, it may be noted that wherever a line of slope or
 contour is crossed by a ridge-line, the lines of slope or contour
 touch the lines of curvature of the surface, for the directions
of principal curvature are given by the axes of the indicatrix.
It is most convenient, however, to proceed at once to the
equation to the ridge-lines from which all such properties
almost immediately follow.

    Take the base as the plane 2 = 0, z being measured verti

the surface near to the point x, y, z also on the surface.
Suppose, for the present, the surface to be determined by the
equation

which must hold at all points on a ridge-line, and is therefore
the equation to its projection. Equation (7) may be regarded
as that of a cylinder whose intersection with the surface, given
by (1), is the ridge-line. It will, however, be convenient to
regard parts of the general locus as separate ridge-lines ; and
in general each of the branches which passes through a mul
tiple point, such as a summit or immit (v. infra), will be
spoken of as a separate ridge or ridge-line.
   It may be remarked that if the surface is given by an
equation such as (1) of the nth degree, the equation (7) to
the projections of the ridge-lines is of degree 3w— 4.
   It is interesting to note, and the fact constitutes a not
unimportant claim of the ridge-lines to attention, that whereas
in many cases lines of slope and contour-lines cannot be found
at all, being determined by differential equations which are in
general not integrable in finite terms, the ridge-lines can
always be deduced directly from the equation to the surface
by mere differentiation.
      § 4. The Relation of the Summits, Immits, fyc. to the
                              Ridge-Lines.
   The equation (7) which determines the ridge-lines is
satisfied by p=0, <? = 0, and therefore—as is also geometri
cally obvious—all points at which the tangent plane is hori
zontal, that is to say, all summits, immits, cols, &c. lie on the
ridge-lines : a result in accordance with the popular notion
of a ridge, namely, a line running along the summits of a
range of hills.
   At such points equation (2), which gives the form of the
adjacent surface, reduces, on neglecting terms of the third
degree, to
                      i=* + i{rP + 2&i + tt?}t .... (8)
and therefore by (7), the projections of the ridge-lines are
given by
       {(rf + sv) 2 - (*£ + tV)*}s = (rf + en) («f + tV) (r-t),
which reduces to
                 (rt-s'){*tF-V>)-{r-t)k}, ....                    (9)

 the equation to a pair of orthogonal straight lines, the pro
jections, as is obvious from (8) or comparison with (6), of
 the principal axes of the indicatrix.
     Thus in general through every summit, immit, and col two
 ridge-lines pass, crossing each other orthogonally and touching
 the lines of curvature, and therefore also the lines of slope ;
 for at summits and immits all the lines of slope touch one of
 the lines of curvature, except one, a limiting case, which
 touches the other line of curvature*, and at a col there are
 only two slope-lines coinciding with the lines of curvature.
    In the foregoing it is supposed that the point, summit,
 immit, or col is an ordinary point on the surface ; but if
 rt = s2, or s = 0 and r — t, or r=s = t = 0, in which cases the
 point is a parabolic point, umbilic, or point of no curvature
 respectively, the equation (9) will vanish identically, and
 terms of the third degree must be retained in (8). The
 equation corresponding to (9) will then be of the third
 degree, so that three ridge-lines will in general cross each
 other at such a point ; but as two of these may be imaginary,
 there may be in special cases only one ridge-line through the
 point—for instance, where the surface is a conicoid and the
 summit one of its umbilics.
    The case in which the summit or immit is an umbilic may
 be examined. In this case s = 0 and r=t ; hence, retaining
terms of the third degree in (2) , the surface near the point is
 given by
       S=z + ±r{? +                + Wv + Wv + dv'};     .   (10)
 and, by (7), this gives

 as the equation to the projection, for points near the summit
 or immit, of the three ridge-lines which cross at the umbilic.
This is the same equation as that which gives the three lines
of curvature at the umbilic, so that the ridge-lines and lines of
 curvature there coincide. At an umbilic there is obviously
no special connexion between the ridge- and slope-lines, for
the latter proceed in all directions from such a point.
    Other exceptional cases need only be mentioned. At par
ticular points on a surface the indicatrix may have any form :
if at any such point the tangent plane is horizontal, there will
obviously be as many ridge-lines and lines of curvature

through the apses.
   It must be observed that the points here considered, that is
to say points at which the tangent plane is horizontal, are
not the only multiple points on the ridge locus. The geo
metrical characteristic of the others will be considered later.
                § 5. Properties of the Ridge-Lines.
    It has already (§ 2) been pointed out that at points on a
ridge-line the lines of curvature touch the slope- and contour-
lines ; hence their projections touch also. The projections
 of the slope- and contour-lines cut orthogonally everywhere,
 but in general those of the lines of curvature do not : they
 can only do so when they touch the lines of slope and contour.
 Thus, for all points on a ridge-line, but nowhere else, the pro
jections of the lines of curvature cut orthogonally; or, in other
 words, the projection of the ridge-line is the locus of the points
 of orthogonal intersection of the projections of the lines of
 curvature.
    This is otherwise obvious analytically, for the differential
 equation to the projections of the lines of curvature is
    { (1 + Qi)s-pqt)dyi + { (1 f j»)r- (1 +pr)t}dxdy
                          + {pq,— {l+pi)s}dxi=0, . . (12)
 and these cut orthogonally wherever (7) is satisfied, for it
 makes the sum of the coefficients of dxi and dy1 vanish. It
 may also be noted that (7) is obtained at once from (12) by
 the substitution of p and q for dx and dy, that is by imposing
 the condition that lines of slope and lines of curvature are
 to touch.
    By transformation of (7) other interesting properties of the
 ridge-lines may be made immediately obvious.
    Thus it may be written
                             da     da .                        ,, „,

 where

     By (14) a is the angle of slope, that is the inclination of a
 line of slope or tangent plane to the base, and (13) shows
 that at any point on a ridge-line this does not vary along a
 contour. Thus at all points on a ridge-line the coutour-lines
 touch the lines of a constant slope or isoclinics. The same
 fact may be otherwise expressed by saying that for each
 contour-line the slope is a minimum or maximum wherever
 it is crossed by a ridge-line. In this sense a ridge-line might

                  and Lines connected with them.             233
 be called a line of minimum or maximum slope, and might
 have been defined by this property had not the definition
chosen appeared the more fundamental.
    Again, (7) may be written
                           dd      dd n

and 6 is therefore the inclination of the projection of the line
of slope to the axis of y. Thus (15) shows that at points on
a ridge-line the projections of the lines of slope have no cur
vature, or, in other words, the projection of the ridge-line
passes through the points of inflexion of the projections of
the lines of slope.
  § 6. The Ridge-Lines as particular members of a Family
                            of Lines.
    The equations (13) and (15) suggest at once another point
of view from which the ridge-lines may be regarded, namely,
as members of the family of curves whose parameter y is
determined by one of the equivalent equations
              (p>-q*),-pq(r-t) = tf + q*)*l*y, . . . (17)
                                                            <18)
where dC and dS aro elements of contour- and slope-line
projections respectively. The parameter 7 is by (19) the
 curvature of the projection of the line of slope at any point,
 or, by (18), it may be interpreted as the rate at which at any
point the slope -line turns round the contour-line as an axis
per unit distance of advance along the contour. In passing,
 the interesting theorem thus given may be noted, namely,
 that the rate of twist of a slope-line about a contour-line at
 any point on a surface is equal to the curvature of the pro
jection of the slope-line at the same point.
    The ridge-line is the curve for which the parameter 7 is
 zero, a value which obviously reduces the equations (17), (18),
 and (19) to the forms (7), (13), and (15) respectively. The
 curves for the general case, 7= constant, have not much
 special interest, but the consideration of 7 leads to a simple
 geometrical characterization of those multiple points on the
 ridge-lines which were left over in § 4.

234              Dr. J. McCowan on Ridge-Lines
    The conditions for a multiple point on any of the curves
7= constant are
                           S=». t=°.                           w)
which are also the conditions for a maximum or minimum
value of 7. Hence the points of the surface for which 7, or,
 say for clearness, the curvature of the projections of the
lines of slope is a maximum or minimum, are multiple points
of the particular curves on which they lie. In the case of the
ridge-line, 7 = 0, and for a multiple point this must be a
maximum or minimum value of 7. Thus, while in general
the curvature of the projection of a line of slope changes from
positive to negative in crossing a ridge-line, so that the point
 of crossing is a point of inflexion, at a multiplo point the
 curvature will not in general change sign, and therefore the
point will not be a point of inflexion. Hence, finally, the
 ridge-lines branch in general at points whose projections are
points of no curvature but not points of inflexion on the pro
jections of the lines of slope which pass through them.
         § 7. Definition of Outlines.    Contact Theorems.
    The consideration of another class of lines connected with
 the surface leads to a further interesting interpretation of
 equations (15j and (16).
    Imagine a cylinder whose generating lines are horizontal
 to envelop the surface. This cylinder touches the surface
 along a line, the locus of the points of contact of the generators
 and contours. This line may be called an outline, for it is
 the line which would appear to bound the surface when seen
 from an infinitely distant point on one of the generators.
 There is of course a whole family of such lines, as the
 generators of the cylindric envelope may have any direction
 parallel to the base. Outlines corresponding to points at a
 finite distance and in any direction might be considered,
 but the more restricted definition chosen is sufficient for the
 purpose at present in view.
    If 6, the inclination to the axis of x, of the generators of
 enveloping cylinder, be taken as the parameter for the out
 lines, then (16) is the equation to their projections, for it may
 be written
                       cos 0^+ sin 0j|=O,                      (21)
 which shows that the generators touch the contours wherever
it is satisfied. Thus it is to be noted that, as in the case of

                  and Lines connected with them.               235
 the ridge-lines, the outlines may he derived directly from the
 equation to the surface by differentiation only.
    This interpretation of 6, as an outline parameter, leads to a
 corresponding interpretation of (15), namely—aline of slope
 touches an outline wherever a ridge-line crosses it. This
 points to a simple method of tracing the ridge-lines on a
model of any surface if the lines of slope (or lines of curvature)
are already traced on it. It is only necessary to view the
 surface from a point at a considerable distance in the base
 plane, and then, turning the model slowly round, to mark the
points where the slope-lines (or lines of curvature) touch the
 continuously changing outline. The ridge-lines on a moun
tain could not be traced in a corresponding fashion, by a
person moving round it at a sufficient distance, for there
would be no means of identifying either slope-lines or lines
of curvature on its surface.
   Two general theorems with respect to the contact of the
various lines considered have now been proved :—
   I. At every point on a ridge-line, the outline, line of slope,
and one of the lines of curvature have a common tangent.
   II. At every point on a ridge-line, the isoclinic or line of
contant slope, the contour-line, and the other line of curvature
have a common tangent.
   It is an immediate inference from the first of these theorems
that if any line has at once the characteristics of any two of
the lines there named it must also have the characteristics of
the other two, and it easily follows that such can only be the
case when the line is that of a section of the surface by a
vertical plane. For example, suppose an outline to be a line
of slope : it is therefore by 1. a ridge-line, and therefore,
again by I., a line of curvature. Further, since it is an out
line p/q is constant, therefore, since it is also a line of slope,
dy/dx is constant for the projection of the latter, which is thus
a straight line, and the line itself is the section of the surface
by a vertical plane through this.
   Again, it follows in similar fashion from the second of
these theorems that if a line has the characteristics of any two
of the lines there named it must have also those of the other
two, and in this case, being a contour-line, it is a section of
the surface by a horizontaL,plane.
   An obvious illustration of these results is afforded by sur
faces having a plane of symmetry : if the plane is vertical the
section by it is evidently a ridge-line, an outline, a line of
slope, and a fine of curvature ; but if the plane is horizontal
the section is a ridge-line, a line of constant slope, a contour-
line, and line of carvature.

236       On Ridge-Lines and Lines connected with them.
                  § 8. General Considerations.
   Certain general inferences from equation (7) deserve notice.
If F(z) be substituted in it for z, it is only altered by the
introduction of a factor (the cube of F'(z)). Thus if two
surfaces have the same lines for the projection of their con
tours, the projections of their ridge-lines will also be the
same, except that certain contour-lines (given by F'(z)=0)
may be ridge-lines for one of the surfaces only, ridge-lines
all along which the surface touches horizontal tangent planes.
   Again, a surface may have no definite ridge-lines, or, in
other words, all points on the surface may satisfy (7) : in fact
(7) may be regarded as the partial differential equation of
such surfaces. In the form (13) the solution of this equation
is obvious : thus, surfaces whose slope at any point depends
only on the height of the point above the base have no definite
ridge-lines, or, as it may be perhaps better put, every line of
slope and every contour-line on such a surface is a ridge-line.
Surfaces of revolution obviously belong to this class.
   The conditions that a point on a surface may be an umbilic
are
                       r+7a =                                (22)
for these make dyjdx indeterminate in (12). These ratios
make (7) vanish identically : hence all the umbilics of any
surface lie on ridge-lines. This is otherwise evident from the
consideration that in the neighbourhood of an umbilic the
lines of curvature have all directions. Again, (7) is identically
satisfied at points where r=s = t = 0 ; that is to say, at points
where the surface has no curvature. All such points there
fore lie on the ridge-lines.
   Again, it is geometrically obvious—or may be proved as
below —that all singular points at which there is a tangent
cone lie on ridge-lines. The thrpo classes of points here
shown to lie on the ridge-lines are peculiar to the surface :
they have no relation to the base. This leads to the interest
ing result that while in general the ridge-lines on a surface
will continuously vary when it is moved relatively to its base,
these points will be fixed points through which they will
 continue to pass.
   As the equation to a surface is in general most simply
 expressed in the form
                          4>{x,y,z) = c,                     (23)
it is desirable before concluding to give the corresponding
equation determining the ridge-lines. Still taking 2=0 aa

                    Notices respecting New Books.                237
the equation to the base, the ridge-lines will be determined
by the intersection of the surface (23) and the surface whose
equation is
dx dy dz \ dx*          dy2 )    dz \ dx1      dy2 J dx dy
            I rfic2   (fy* J \ dx dy dz      dydxdzj
The proof need not be given as it may be very easily supplied.
It may be remarked that this is satisfied wherever
so that all conical points lie on the ridge-lines, a result which
is, however, obvious geometrically. If (23) is rational and
integral and of the degree n, (24) will be of the degree 4n — 5,
and therefore the ridge locus will be a curve of degree 4ns— 5n.

 A Treatise on the Mathematical Theory of Elasticity (in two
     Volumes). By A. E. H. Love, M.A., Fellow and Lecturer of
    St. John's College, Cambridge. Cambridge : at the University
    Press, 1893.
 SOME apology would seem becoming for a delay of six months
       in noticing the first volume of this important contribution to
 our higher text-books in Mathematical Physics, were it not that
 there is always an advantage in considering at once the complete
 work. It speaks much for Mr. Love's devotion to the task he set
 himself, that the second volume has appeared so soon after the
 first—when a longer delay might well have been excused, or even
 expected.
    The author informs us in the preface to vol. i. how this treatise
 originated in a suggestion of Mr. Jt. K. Webb that they should
 jointly prepare a work on Elasticity, but Mr. Webb's important
 avocations having prevented his cooperating, Mr. Love has had
 to take on himself the whole of the work—and it must have proved
 no light one. Following the excellent precedent of recent conti
 nental writers the authorcommences with an Introductory Hist orical
 Sketch of pp. 34, founded, of course, on the late Dr. Todhunter's
 History as edited and continued by Prof. K. Pearson. Herein
 the course of the Mathematical Theories of Elasticity is briefly
  traced from Hooke's enunciation of his famous law ' ut tensio sic
  vis' in 1676 to those modern developments which Navier and
  Caucby originated.
    A good deal of space in this, as in other recent works on special
 branches of Mathematical Physics, is taken up —perhaps necessarily,

  238               Notices respecting New Books.
  to make the treatise sufficient in itself—with such subjects as
  would be treated of once for all in a systematic work on the Prin
  ciples of Natural Philosophy like Thomson and Tait's, to which
 preliminaries Mr. Love's first five chapters are devoted.
     In Chapter vi. the treatment of concrete problems is commenced
 with the " Equilibrium of Beams," in solving which St. Venant and
 Clebsch are, of course, mainly followed. The analogy between
 the problem of the resistance of a cylindrical beam to flexure and
 the hydrodynamic question of the motion of frictionless liquid in
 a rotating cylindrical vessel is explained. There follow the " Tor
 sion and Flexure Problems," very fully and clearly worked out in
 the practicable cases suitable for a text-book, with references to
 the sources for further recent developments. In a note at the end
 of vol. i. are some valuable remarks on JEolotropy ; wherein the
 typographical slip of " luminated " for " laminated " may be pointed
 out, into which perhaps the printer was led by the occurrence of
 " luminiferous " lower down.
    Chapter vii. is devoted to an exposition of " Curvilinear Coordi
 nates," first introduced by Lame in the C. B. for 1838. The
 method Mr. Love adopts is one founded on Mr. Webb's as given
 in his very able paper " Stress and Strain in Cylindrical and Polar
 Coordinates," Messenger, vol. xi. Some examples in illustration
 follow.
    " General Solutions " occupy Chapters viii. and ix., wherein Betti,
 Cerruti, and Boussinesq are mainly followed ; the solid strained,
 the dilatation and small motions in which are sought, being of no
 special form.
    Chapters, is occupied with the most recent generalization of
 Lame's problem of the displacements of an elastic spherical shell ;
 viz. a gravitating sphere subject to surface-tractions. Some account
 of the application of these results to the case of the elastic tides
 of the solid earth as discussed by Lord Kelvin and Prof. Darwin
conclude the chapter.
    Prof. Lamb's solution of the problem of the vibrations of an
elastic sphere and spherical shell (Proc. L. M. S. xxiii., xxiv.)
forms the subject of Chapter xi., as a particular example of the
general theory explained in Chapter viii.
    The subject of the application of curvilinear coordinates is
further illustrated in the concluding chapter of vol. i. ; and the ap
plication of conjugate functions to problems of elastic equilibrium.
    In the second volume of Mr. Love's treatise are considered " in
greater detail the special problems that arise when some linear
dimensions of a body are small in comparison with others." The
bending of rods in one plane ; of rods and wires, with twisting, in
three dimensions and the general theory of the same, as treated
by Kirchhoff in particular, form the matter of Chapters xiii., xiv.,
and xv. ; the theory of the small vibrations of thin rods that of xvi.
Chapter xvii., treating of Resilience to Impact and Yoigt's and
Hertz's theories of Impact—the former taking account of the
motions set up in the surface-films, the latter of the compression

                    Notices respecting New Books.                239
 therein as gradually subsiding— separates Chapter xviii., on the
 general theory of wires naturally curved, from xiv. and xv., to
which it would seem more appropriately a sequel.
   In Chapter xix. the elementary and then the general theory
of thin plates is entered on ; to be continued later in the con
cluding chapter (xxiii.), treating of the important question of
the stability of elastic rods, plates, anil shells—the intermediate
Chapters xxi., xxii., dealing with the general theory of thin elastic
shells and applications of the same.
    It will be apparent, from the foregoing glance at the contents of
 this treatise how wide a field it covers; and it may be added that
 where his plan and limits compel the author to exclude further
 developments ample references are given to the memoirs wherein
 they are to be sought. Frequent among these are references to
 Lord Kelvin's Mathematical and Physical Papers, and to Lord
Rayleigh's, Prof. Lamb's, and Mr. Basset's papers in the Proceedings
of the London Mathematical Society ; also to Mr. Chree's in the
Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society. References
to the sections on the subject of the treatise in Thomson and
Tait's ' Natural Philosophy ' and to Prof Pearson's exposition of
St. Venant's work occur frequently, it is needless to say. Nor is
Mr. Love himself only a judicious and careful compiler from the
work of predecessors and contemporaries ; his own original con
tributions to the sum of knowledge gained for the subjects on which
he writes being considerable. A " Note on Kirchhoff's theory of
the Deformation of Elastic Plates " and an elaborate memoir of
52 pages (" really an attempt to construct a theory of the vibra
tion of bells") on the same problem appeared in the Transactions
of the Cambridge Philosophical Society and the Royal Society,
respectively, for 1888 ; and since that date his papers have
appeared in the London Mathematical Society's Proceedings at
frequent intervals ; while the present treatise is marked by all the
thoroughness, accuracy, and candid confronting of difficulties
which have characterized those original essays. This is, in short,
a learned and valuable addition to the available text-books on
departments of the higher Applied Mathematics.

ON THE NATURE OF THE REFLEXION OF ELECTRICAL WAVES AT
   THE END OF A CONDUCTING WIRE. BY MM. KR. BIRKELAND
   AND E. SARASIN.
IN a communication of April 17, 1893, one of us attempted,
    starting from the theory of the motion of electromagnetic energy
in space, to make a hypothesis on what takes place in the vicinity
of the end of a metal wire along which electrical waves are passing.
   We have examined the question together, exploring the electrical
field about the end of the wire, with small resonators of 10 to 25
centim. in diameter, and although the point of view explained in
the note in question has not been confirmed in all points by our
results, they form none the less an interesting experimental con
tribution to the remarkable theories of Prof. Poynting.
   The electrical waves were furnished by a small plate-exciter, the
sparks of which, about 3 millim., passed in oil. Opposite one of
these primary disks was a similar one from which proceeded a
copper tube 1 centim. in diameter and 9 metres in length. This
tube was supported on thin wooden rods 1"5 metre high.
   The resonators were circular and fixed vertically with the spark
uppermost ; they had a double motion—they could be rotated about
a vertical axis passing through the spark, and they could also be
moved parallel to the conducting tube.
   We arranged so that even in darkness we could mark the
distance from the centre of our resonator to the end of the con
ducting wire, measured parallel to the wire, and also the angle
which the plane of this formed with the wire.
   The observations were made by means of a telescope mounted
horizontally at a distance of a metre from the circle, which is
necessary owing to the considerable disturbance produced by the
body of the observer on the rapid oscillations.
   Our researches were directed to two points principally : we first
determined the four first nodes in seven different distances from
the wire ; the plane of the circle being always normal to this.
These nodes are each determined by at least ten measurements ;
the numerical results thus obtained for the circle of 10 centim. are
given in the subjoined table. The different distances of the resonator
from the conducting wire are counted from the axis of this latter
to the nearest point of the circle. The numbers in each column
give the distance of each node to the normal at the end of the wire.

    In fig. 1 we have represented by small dots the position of the
centre of the resonator of 10 centim. in the 27 nodes given
numerically above. The small circles on the same figure give the
positions of the nodes due to a circle 25 centim. in diameter in
four different distances from the conducting tube.
   The impression which directly results from the distribution of
all these nodes is that, if the first shock arrives at the resonator
almost parallel to the conducting wire, the second must arrive
there by a direct radiation proceeding from the neighbourhood of
the end of the wire. In fact all the nodes are situated virtually
as if the energy producing the second shock in the resonator
travelled quite close to the wire until it arrived at the end, and thence
moved directly on the circle. It must, however, be observed that
this mode of viewing the reflexion does not justify the considerable
recession of the first node when the resonator is close to the
                                   Fig. 1.
                        \             \              s
conducting wire ; a recession which, according to the experiments
of Sarasin and De la Rive, is greater as the circle itself is greater.
We believe, however, we have now well established that this
recession is due to the geometrical form of the resonator; the
electrical shocks, arriving along two rectilinear conductors, tend

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.           243
each to charge the nearest point of the resonator, so that the first
oscillation is produced between the diametrically opposite parts of
the circle. As, however, the electricity tends to oscillate in all
the amplitude of the circle, this takes then its normal period, and
the nodes are arranged along the wire.
   We have in the second place investigated how the plane of the
resonator must be turned about its vertical axis in order that the
total effect of the two " shocks " which excite the oscillation may
be as great as possible.
   These directions are indicated in fig. 1. They have for the
most part been determined where the maxima should be according
to the measurement of the nodes. Among other orientations
figured are two which have been taken in the nodes (dotted lines).
These directions of maximum effect pronounce strongly, it seems
to us, for a direct radiation from the end of the wire.
   Of the three series of observations made in the centre of the
loops it follows that the perpendicular to the circle is almost along
the bisectrix of the angle which the line going directly to the end
of the wire forms with the parallel to the conducting wire. The
two observations made in the nodes themselves show that to have
the maximum effect the circle must be orientated so that the
electrical undulations coming from the end of the wire arrive
perpendicularly to its plane, and that the action of the second
shock is by this fact annulled.
   The results which we have enunciated enable us to give a certain
development to the conception of the moving electrical tube devised
by some English men of science. Assume that the electrical tube
of the direct wave, which moves at each point at right angles to its
                                Fig. 2.
momentary direction, is almost rectilinear, and at right angles to
the conducting wire: this will no longer be the case with the
reflected wave.

244            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles*
   Now measurements made by one of us of the interferences on
the surface itself of the conducting wire show that in this case
there is no appreciable recession of the first node, and that there
fore the part of the electrical tube immediately near the conductor
turns about the end of this almost instantly. But the distant
parts of the tube cannot -traverse simultaneously the same angular
distance ; they remain behind and the electrical tube curves then
almost like the tail of a comet about the end of the wire (fig. 2).
   This would be the origin of this characteristic radiation pro
ceeding from the end of the conductor, the existence of which we
may admit. It would follow from this that as the elements of the
tube continue to move at right angles to their direction for the
time being, the energy escapes from the end of the wire and is
lost in the surrounding space*.— Comptes Betidus, Nov. 6, 1893.
                  DENSITIES IN THE EARTH 's CRUST.
      To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
Gentlemen,
      Probably many of your readers will have read the Introductory
Review in Mr. Blake's ' Annals of British Geology ' for 1892,
and will, like myself, have been surprised at the very direct manner
in which he has impugned the accuracy of Mr. O. Fisher's
conclusions regarding the comparative densities and thicknesses of
those parts of the earth's crust which underlie oceans and con
tinents respectively.
   Mr. Blake undertakes to show that Mr. Fisher's method " is
wholly fallacious." After stating the method referred to, he gives
three reasons from which " it is easily seen that this method
cannot lead to correct results." The manner in which these
reasons are expressed does not make it clear to the ordinary reader
that Mr. Blake has entirely upset Mr. Fisher's reasoning ; but when
he narrows the issue to " the definite point where the fallacy
comes in," the non-mathematical geologist must wish to know how
far Mr. Blake's mathematics are correct.
    I think that all who are interested in terrestrial physics
must hope that Mr. Fisher will either admit or deny the value of
Mr. Blake's criticism, and as he cannot reply in the ' Annals of
British Geology,' perhaps he will favour your readers with a note
on the subject, the issues being of considerable importance.
                                               A. J. Jukes-Bbowne.
   * There should be an appreciable loss of energy on reflexion. We
hoped to complete our research in this direction by measurements on the
¦wire itself (eon/. Birkeland, Wied. Ann. vol. xlvii. p. 583). For three
wave-lengths X,= 6»n, Xa= 2'7 m, and X3= \"2 m, we found the re
flected wave respectively 0 6, 0 45, and 0 35 of the direct wave. But
we have devised another method of directly measuring the loss and we
have not again found these values, so that we only give them under
reserve, not having succeeded in explaining these contradictory results.

                  By Arthur Smithells, B.Sc."
     Part I.— The Luminosity of Flames free from Solid
                             Particles f.
 IN a brief note communicated to the Chemical Society in
      1892 (Proc. Chem. Soc. no. 105) I described some
experiments on flame-coloration made with my flame-cone
separating apparatus, and in order to explain the results ob
tained I adopted provisionally the view that flame-spectra in
some cases must be regarded as the direct effect of chemical
action.
   Almost simultaneously E. Pringsheim read before the Akad.
d. Wissenschaften, Berlin, a paper on " Kirchhoff's Law and
the Radiation of Gases," which was subsequently printed
in Wied. Ann. xlv. p. 428, 1892. In this paper Pringsheim
records an elaborate series of experiments on the radiation and
absorption of sodium vapour, and arrives at the conclusion
that the spectrum of sodium salts in a flame and of sodium
vapour heated in neutral gases is due directly to chemical
action. In a subsequent paper % Pringsheim has extended his
experiments to other substances and has obtained similar
results.

 and that this is subsequently reduced by the carbonaceous
 matter of the flame. Again, it may be asked how is it that
 copper chloride, which is known to lose its chlorine at quite
 moderate temperatures, can not only be vaporized but be
 made incandescent in a flame, and in a flame too which con
 tains reducing gases ?
    The solution of the difficulties here presented is not so
 obvious that it should be withheld, yet I have been unable in
 searching the literature of spectrum analysis to find any dis
 cussion of these fundamental questions.
   With regard to the luminosity of " non-luminous " gas-
 flames and the luminosity of gases in Geissler-tubes the
difficulty has been to some extent grappled with, and as such
flames are the media in which colorations are obtained it will
be convenient to discuss them first.
   Attempts to produce Luminosity in Gases by External
Heating.—The consideration of the luminosity of flames free
from solid matter, such as the flame of hydrogen or the
ordinary Bunsen gas-flame, has been held to involve the
question as to whether gases can be made luminous simply by
increasing their temperature. The luminosity of gases through
which the electric discharge is passed and of those in a flame
may be directly due, it is alleged, in the first case to the
electricity, and in the second to the chemical processes.
   At the end of last century Wedgewood (Phil. Trans. 1792,
p. 271) performed an experiment which proved that a current
of air sufficiently hot to raise a strip of gold to bright red
ness possessed no luminosity.
   In 1879 Hittorf (Wied. Ann. vii. pp. 587, 591, and ibid.
xix. p. 73, 1883) found that on passing an electric current
from a battery consisting of 1600 elements through air at a
pressure above 15 millim. the platinum electrodes became
white-hot, yet the air in their immediate neighbourhood
showed no luminosity even when the platinum was melting.
He found the same to be the case when pure iridium electrodes
were employed. These when melting communicated no
luminosity to nitrogen, hydrogen, or carbon monoxide. He
concluded that the luminosity and line-spectra of gases could
only bo obtained at much higher temperatures developed by
the momentary discharge of a condenser. He adds :—" The
light of ordinary flames, which do not contain solid particles,
is not determined by the temperature but by chemical pro
cesses and must be regarded as phosphorescence. For if these
gases acquire the temperature of the flame, without being
involved in the chemical process, they radiate no light per
ceptible to the eye. One can convince oneself of this by
                               S2

 246                Professor Arthur Smithells on
    This unexpected confirmation of the conclusion suggested
 by ray own experiments increased my belief in its probable
 correctness, and further evidence in its favour appeared from
 a consideration of well-known facts of spectrum analysis.
    Having been requested to show the experiments at the British
 Association at Edinburgh in 1892, 1 brought the matter before
 Section A, where it roused an animated discussion. Widely
 different views wore expressed. Professor von Helmholtz
 held the opinion that flame-coloration and the luminosity of
 gas-flames not containing solid carbon must be attributed to
 radiation consequent on chemical action ; on the other hand,
 Sir G. G. Stokes did not consider that there was any con
 clusive evidence in favour of this view.
    Object of the Experiments.—The object of what follows in
 this paper is to ascertain how far the luminous radiation from
 gaseous flames (including " non-luminous " gas-flames and
 such flames coloured by metallic salts) may be ascribed to
 incandescence, and whether any other cause has to be sought
 for an explanation of the phenomena observed. By incan
 descence is meant the evolution of light as a direct consequence
 of the application of heat.
    The currently accepted Doctrine.—When a small quantity of
common salt or other salt of sodium is introduced into the
flame of a Bunsen-burner a yellow flame is produced, which
is ordinarily ascribed to the vapour of metallic sodium glowing
in consequence of the high temperature of its surroundings.
The green-blue flame due to copper chloride under the same
circumstances is attributed to the incandescent vapour of
copper chloride. With calcium chloride the red flame which
is obtained is said to be due to the vapour of calcium chloride
and of calcium oxide. These may be taken as typical cases.
' The authority for these views dates back, as is well known,
from the earliest days of spectrum analysis. One or two
questions connected with them which are at once obvious to
the chemist are as a rule passed over in silence. If it be
asked, for instance, how does sodium vapour become free in
the flame, what answer is to be given ? The usual answer, I
believe, has been that the salt is dissociated, notwithstanding
that we have no other evidence of the dissociability of sodium
chloride at any attainable temperature *. Another explanation
that I have seen, and that only once, is given by Mendel6efF
in his ' Principles of Chemistry ' (vol. i. p. 563). He says that
the NaCl is acted upon by steam in the flame to produce NaHO
   * Sir Q. Q. Stokes informs me that he has never entertained this view,
but it has certainly been widely expressed.

                               S2

 248              Professor Arthur Smithells on
hanging horizontally a narrow cylinder with open ends and
made of the thinnest platinuin-foil in the hottest part of the
flame given by a Bunsen-burner with fully open air-holes.
 In order to keep the radiation of the hot metal from the eye
one looks through a narrow tube laid in the direction of the
axis of the platinum cylinder, and the experiment is per
 formed in a dark room. The gas within the tube appears
 dark to the eye and different from that of the luminous flame.
 Gases give the same result when in tubes made white-hot by a
coal-fire." Hittorf refers to the observations of Wedgewood
 {vide supra) and Melloni (Pogg. Ann. lxxv. p. 62, 1848) on
the same subject.
    In 1882 Werner von Siemens, unaware of the work just
 referred to, made experiments with a Siemens regenerative
gas-furnace and found that oxygen, nitrogen, steam, and
carbon dioxide possessed no luminosity at a temperature
somewhat above 1500° 0. In confirmation of this conclusion
he points out that, when a flame is made hotter by increasing
the air-supply or previously heating it, the visible flames be
come smaller although the products of combustion must be
hotter. If the luminosity of flame were due to the simple
glowing of the products of combustion, the visible flame
should increase and not diminish in size under the conditions
just described. The luminous region of flame is therefore
couterminous with the region of chemical action and (he
argues) is directly due to it. He adds : —" If we assume that
the gas molecules are surrounded by a sheath of aether an
alteration of these sheaths of aether must take place when two
or more such molecules combine. The resultant movement
of the aether particles must be compensated by vibrations
which can form the origin of the flow of heat and light waves.
In quite a similar way we can picture the light-effects which
appear when an electric current is passed through gases."
                The Internal Condition of Flame.
   The experiments of Hittorf and Siemens may, I think, be
hold to establish two facts— (i.) That air, carbon monoxide,
steam, and carbon dioxide emit no sensible light when at an
average temperature of 1500° O. or perhaps 3000° C; (ii.) That
the luminous part of flame is conterminous with the region of
chemical action. They do not establish, I think, a third and
most important conclusion, namely, that the luminosity is due
directly to chemical action and not to heat. Before such a
conclusion can be justified we must be sure that the products
of combustion in the flame do not exceed 1500° or 3000° 0.
   It is assumed by Hittorf and Siemens, and has also been

                    the Luminosity of Gases.                 249
assumed by Pringsheim (loc. cit.), that we are justified in
speaking of the temperature of a flame as the temperature
indicated by thermometric instruments when they are intro
duced into the flame. This seems to me to be fundamentally
erroneous. Such a recorded temperature is no doubt the
effective temperature of the flame, but it is merely an average
temperature.
   Every chemical student knows that the thinner the platinum
wire he uses the hotter it becomes when introduced into a
Bunsen flame, and it matters not whether the measurements
of temperature depend on the fusibility of metals or salts, on
specific heat, expansion, thermoelectric junctions, or electrical
resistance, they are all open to the obvious objection that they
only give the mean temperature of a considerable region of
the flame uncorrected for conduction losses. What are we to
say of the temperature of a candle-flame which will not melt
a small bead of common salt but which will melt a platinum
wire if pure and of a certain fineness ?
   We may best deal with the matter by considering an ideal
flame. Let us suppose that we have hydrogen issuing from
a vertical cylindrical tube into oxygen gas, and let us consider
a horizontal slice of the gas one molecule thick moving up
wards in the tube.
   For the sake of simplicity we may neglect the molecular
motion of the gas, and we will also suppose the gas to inflame
spontaneously on meeting with the requisite oxygen. The
slice of gas as it ascends the tube is retarded by friction at
the edges and will issue with a conical form from the tube.
Here it inflames and gives us a small conical flame. This
flame would consist of a conical sheet of hydrogen, one mole
cule thick, combining with oxygen. If we are to measure
the temperature at the locus of combination we must have a
thermometric instrument small compared with the thickness
of the sheet of combustion. If the instrument does not fulfil
this condition, it will protrude into the unburnt gas within the
cone and the cooling gases outside, and the temperature indi
cated will be the average of the whole region in which it is
immersed.
   It may be objected that this is only an ideal flame, and that
the conical sheath of flame actually obtained when hydrogen
burns in oxygen has a very sensible thickness. This is no
doubt true ; but it must be at once pointed out that if the
sheath of burning hydrogen has a sensible thickness, that is to
say if the hydrogen is burning on the outside surface, the
inside surface, and in the intervening thickness of the sheath,
hydrogen must all the while be passing through the sheath

250               Professor Arthur Smithells on
without undergoing combustion, in order that there may be
some on the outer surface to maintain the combustion there
taking place ; and oxygen must be passing through from the
outside to maintain the combustion of the hydrogen on the
inner surface. If, then, we can get a thermometric instrument
small enough to be wholly immersed in the region of com
bustion, the temperature indicated will not be that of the steam
just formed but the average temperature of the hydrogen,
oxygen, and steam within the sheath.
    From this I think it is plain that no thermometric instru
ment can possibly indicate the temperature of the product of
combustion in a flame at the moment of its formation. The
temperature of 1500° ascribed to the hottest part of a Bunsen
flame is therefore not the temperature of the products of com
bustion, and experiments that show these products to be non-
luminous at a temperature even of 3000° C. afford no proof
that the luminosity of flame is due to some other cause than
 the mere high temperature of the products.
    How, then, are we to ascertain the temperature of the pro
ducts of combustion ? The only remaining method is to
calculate it theoretically. This may be done if we make the
assumption (which must be considered as doubtful in view of
recent experiments) that the specific heat of gases does not
alter greatly with increase of temperature.
    In the production of 18 grammes of steam from 2 grammes
of hydrogen and 16 grammes of oxygen there are evolved
 57,560 calories. The specific heat of steam being "4805 we
have the rise of temperature :—
                  /   / -    57560       C(,,,0
This temperature then (with the proviso as to the constancy
of specific heat of steam) must be the temperature of the
 steam-molecules formed in a flame of hydrogen, assuming the
whole heat liberated during the reaction to oe stored in the
newly-formed molecules. It is well known that steam begins
to dissociate far below this temperature, but the question of
 dissociation only enters into our present consideration in this
 respect, that it forbids us to assume a hydrogen-flame as con
 sisting of molecules all in the act of combining. Whatever
the degree of dissociation there is plainly some combination
 taking place, and if the heat liberated is stored in the molecules
 formed their temperature must rise to the theoretical 6600°.
 Even the average thermometric temperature of a hydrogen-
 flame is above the temperature nt which dissociation of steam
begins, and there must be therefore a certain number of un

                     the Luminosity of Gases.                 251
combined hydrogen and oxygen molecules in the flame. Our
theoretical temperature of flame is no more an indication of
its average temperature than its average temperature is a
measure of the temperature of the steam which it contains.
A gas may in fact exhibit a certain average temperature in
two ways—it may have been raised to the average tempera
ture by external heating or by internal chemical combina
tion. In both cases the velocity of the molecules shows the
same average, but this average is very differently compounded
in the two cases. In the first case it can be shown theo
retically that the number of molecules having velocities four
times the average is extremely small. In the second case
 (flames) we have a large number of molecules of intensely
high temperature and a large number of low temperature.
The average temperature is in this case compounded of two
extremes, and there is every reason to anticipate a difference
of physical qualities. This difference we might reasonably
expect to manifest itself in the emission of light by the gas
which contains the intensely-heated molecules.
    Similar considerations apply to the temperature of carbonic
acid produced in flames. The theoretical temperature for the
combustion of carbonic oxide in oxygen is 7180° C.
    As neither steam nor carbon dioxide has been raised by
 external heating to anything approaching the temperatures we
 have indicated as accruing to them theoretically in the act of
 formation, it is still possible that the luminosity of flames in
 which they are produced may be due to high temperature in
 the ordinary sense of the term. The remark of Siemens
 (supra) that flames become smaller on increasing or heating the
 air-supply does not affect the conclusion arrived at, for it is
 not claimed that the luminosity of the products of combustion
 is of appreciable'duration. Admixture with more air produces
 a smaller region of combustion, for it spares the combustible
 gas the necessity of wandering outwards to find the necessary
 oxygen. There would bo in consequence a greater number of
 hydrogen and oxygen molecules uniting within a given space,
 the flame would bo brighter but not necessarily larger, and
 this is certainly the case.
    It may be stated further, in relation to the luminosity of
 air, steam, and carbon dioxide, that having regard to their
 extremely small optical absorptive power it is not to be ex
 pected that they will show any great emissive power even
 when raised to very high temperatures. The degree of lumi
  nosity shown by a Bunsen gas-flamo, assuming the products
  to have the temperature calculated theoretically, appears to be
 just about what we might expect from a, priori considerations.

252              Professor Arthur Smithells on
                  Incandescent Iodine Vapour.
   Having discussed the ahove question with Sir G. G. Stokes,
I tried, at his suggestion, the experiment of heating iodine
vaponr. This, heing strongly absorptive at ordinary tempera
tures, might be expected to emit visible radiations at com
paratively low temperatures.
    The experiment was made by filling the bowl of a "church
warden " tobacco-pipe with iodine and closing with a lute of
plaster of Paris. The stem was laid along a Fletcher tube-
furnace and strongly heated. The bowl of the pipe, which
protruded from one end, was heated with the flame of a Bunsen-
burner. The tip of the stem, which protruded about one inch
from the other end, was shielded from stray light and viewed
 against a background of black velvet. When the stem was
heated to such temperature as could be obtained with the
unforced draught of air, the issuing stream of iodine vapour
 was not luminous ; but when the furnace was fed with a blast
of air and the temperature sufficient to soften the pipe, the
iodine became luminous and the vapour presented the appear
ance of a pointed yellowish flame about an inch in length.
 A similar appearance was obtained when a glazed porcelain
 tube was substituted for the pipe-stem, so as to exclude all
 possibility of furnace-gases diffusing into the interior. My
 attention was subsequently drawn to the fact that the effect
 had been already described by Salet (Pogg. Ann. cxlvii.
 p. 319) and had been achieved in a simpler way.
    The experiment may be best performed as follows:—A piece
 of hard glass tube about half inch diameter and five inches
 long and closed at one end is suspended horizontally by
 platinum wires from the ring of a retort-stand and heated
 along its whole length by the flame of a flat Bunsen-burner.
 This should be done in the dark, and the burner removed as
 soon as the glass is seen to glow. The tube is allowed to
 cool till it has just ceased to glow, and then a long piece
 of platinum-foil bent into a trough and filled with iodine is
 passed into the tube and the iodine tipped out. The tube is
 immediately filled with the glowing vapour of iodine. This
 can be made to glow still more brightly by a reapplication
 of the flame. How much of the luminosity is due to the
 iodine and how much to the hot glass may be seen at any
 moment by blowing out the iodine vapour by a puff of air.
 The effect is very marked, and there seems no room to
 doubt that the glowing is due to hot iodine vapour. The
 lowness of the temperature seems to forbid the suggestion
 that the glow may be due to combination of the iodine with

                    the Luminosity of Gases.                   253
oxygen or to the dissociation and recombination of the atoms
of the iodine molecule.
   The result of this experiment is in conformity with the
views already expressed as to the luminosity of flame and
enables us to see that, whilst colourless gases like those forming
the products of ordinary combustion are not likely to glow
at the average temperature of a flame, they would at some
higher temperature emit visible radiations.
   The chief conclusions arrived at in this part of the paper
are :—
   1. That in speaking of the temperatures of gases regard
must be paid to the mode of heating.
   2. That external heating produces an average temperature
compounded in a different way from the same temperature
as developed by internal chemical reaction.
   3. That the experiments of Hittorf, Siemens, and others
showing that gases do not glow at an average temperature
of 1500° C. produced by external heating are no evidence that
the same gases when produced in flames of the same average
temperature are not veritably incandescent.
   4. That if the heat of chemical combination be supposed
to be stored in the products of combustion in a flame, the
temperature of these products must be exceedingly high and
probably high enough to produce luminosity.
   5. That iodine vapour can be made incandescent by heating
to temperatures below that at which glass is red-hot.
           Part II.— The Genesis of Flame-Spectra.
    I propose now to discuss some cases of flame-coloration in
respect to the chemical reactions by which they are accom
panied in the flame.
    Sodium.—The characteristic yellow flame of sodium with
the D line-spectrum represents, as is well known, the most
 easily obtainable flame-spectrum. It is yielded by all salts
 of the metal in the flame of coal-gas or hydrogen. It is
 quenched, according to Mitscherlich *, if hydrochloric acid
 be supplied in excess along with the sodium salt, which may
 be done by adding an excess of ammonium chloride to the
bead.
    The yellow tint is also, according to Mitscherlich, not
 yielded in the flame of hydrogen burning in chlorine when
 these gases are burnt in an oxy-hydrogen burner. 1 have
 repeated Mitscherlich's experiments with great care, using
             • Pogg. Ann. cxvi. p. 499 ; also cxxi. p. 459.

254               Professor Arthur Smithells on
the flame of hydrogen in chlorine and of chlorine in hydrogen.
So long as any oxygen remains in the gases the flame shows
a distinct yellow colour when a bead of a sodium salt is
introduced into it. As the oxygen is removed by a current
of purified gas (chlorine or hydrogen), the yellow colour fades
until it is imperceptible to the eye. Viewed with the spec
troscope the D line shows a corresponding diminution of
intensity, and, in entire absence of oxygen, is doubtless ex
tinguished. As I have only once succeeded in entirely ob
literating it, I do not wish to speak positively. The fact that
the red line of lithium is easily quenched under similar con
ditions confirms the belief that the same would be the case
with the more sensitive sodium, if all traces of oxygen could
be removed.
   It appears to me that the above facts present great
chemical anomalies and difficulties. If we are to make
the common assumption that the yellow flame is due to
sodium vapour, the element must be liberated either by disso
ciation by heat or reduction. Of dissociation by heat we
have no independent evidence, and it is gratuitous to suppose
that it should take place in a coal-gas flame and not in the
flame of hydrogen burning in chlorine. If the process is
one of reduction, we have to go beyond our experimental
knowledge to suggest an explanation. Thus the liberation
of sodium from common salt in a hydrogen-flame must be
due either to the union of hydrogen with the chlorine to
form hydrochloric acid and free sodium, or to the action of
steam which forms hydrochloric acid and sodium hydrate or
oxide, the latter being then reduced to the metal by the
hydrogen. If it is said that hydrogen may decompose salt in
the first way at high temperature, it must also be remarked that
hydrochloric acid itself dissociates at high temperatures. If,
on the other hand, the steam is the active agent, it is cer
tainly taking a liberty to invoke its presence to act on the
salt, and to ignore its probable interference with any reduc
tion of the oxide or hydrate to be subsequently effected by
hydrogen.
   If we can explain the coloration of a hydrogen-flame by
salt, it will of course be easy to explain it in the case of
a coal-gas flame.
   The suppression of the colour in a hydrogen-chlorine flame
can only be explained from the point of view of reduction by
assuming that the conjoint action of oxygen and hydrogen is
necessary for the decomposition of the sodium chloride, the
hydrogen taking the chlorine and the oxygen the sodium, the
sodium oxide being thereupon reduced by hydrogen.

                        the Luminosity of Gases.                     255
   The only alternative to the ahove explanations is, so far as
I am aware, that indicated by Arrhenius in his experiments
on the electrolytic conduction of the heated vapours of salts
(Wied. Ann. xlii. p. 18, 1891).
   Arrhenius supposes that when salt is supplied to a flame,
sodium hydrate is formed by the influence of steam and that
the hydrate then undergoes partial ionic dissociation, the
liberation of sodium taking place without the intervention of
ordinary chemical action. The process is thus regarded as
analogous to the dissociation of electrolytes in dilute aqueous
solution. I cannot attempt to summarize the experimental
evidence by which Arrhenius seeks to establish his interesting
theory. If true, it would certainly remove many difficulties
which have been met with in attempting to account for
the phenomena of flame-coloration on purely chemical
grounds *.
    With regard to Arrhenius's view of the matter, I will only
remark at present that the liberated sodium must sooner or
later meet with oxygen, and burn. If the yellow light of the
flame is due to the vibrations of ionic sodium, it would seem
likely that the light emitted during combustion of the sodium,
 and due presumably to sodium oxide, should be different.
 Now the light from sodium burning in oxygen gives a con
 tinuous spectrum, and it is possible that the faint continuous
 spectrum which accompanies the line-spectrum of sodium salts
 heated in a flame may be due to the combustion of the sodium,
 whilst the line-spectrum is due to the mere vibration of the
 sodium ions.
    The genesis of the sodium spectrum has recently been made
 the subject of experiment by Pringsheim (Wied. Ann. xlv.
p. 428, 1892). He shows first of all that sodium carbonate
and sodium chloride, when vaporized in a hot porcelain tube,
 five neither absorption nor emission spectra. Metallic sodium
   eated in the tube filled with nitrogen gives first a coloured
 vapour showing a banded spectrum, and then a transparent
 vapour exhibiting the ordinary sodium spectrum. He then
 raises the question whether this spectrum is dependent on
 temperature alone, or is caused by the act of chemical union
    * In addition to those already pointed out I may adduce the follow
 ing :—When a flame coloured by a bead of sodium salt is viewed against
 a bright background of D light, it is seen to be surrounded by a Tblack
 mantle. If this is due to absorption by free sodium, then the element
 must be able to exist in an atmosphere of steam and carbon dioxide.
 This is utterly opposed to our ordinary notions of the chemical relations
 of the substances in question, but would present no difficulty from the
 point of view of Arrhenius.

 256              Professor Arthur Sruithells on
 of sodium with traces of oxygen lingering in the nitrogen
 and the oxygen contained in the siliceous material of the
 porcelain tube. To test this question he produces a " cool "
 flame by igniting a current of air charged with just enough
 vapour of carbon disulphide to give a combustible mixture.
 The average temperature of the flame is below 150° C. In
 this flame a fine spray of a sodium salt gives no spectrum ;
 and he finds that not until enough additional carbon di
 sulphide is supplied to give a much higher temperature does
 the spectrum appear. Comparing this result with the results
 of the porcelain-tube experiments, Pringsheim concludes that
 since in the latter case the sodium salts show no spectrum at
 temperatures which, in the case of a flame, suffice for the
 display of the spectrum, chemical action and not heat alone
 must be the cause of this difference ; that, in short, flame-
 spectra of sodium salts are not due to simple dissociation by
 heat, but to chemical processes of reduction.
    By way of confirming this conclusion Pringsheim then
 describes the effect of heating sodium salts in a hot porcelain
tube in presence of different gases. In air, nitrogen, or
 carbon dioxide no spectrum is produced, but in hydrogen the
 D-line immediately appears. This is not quenched by the
 addition of carbon dioxide, but immediately disappears on
the introduction of air. The reduction of the sodium salts
 and the production of a spectrum he also effects by iron and
carbon. Finally, by an ingenious device, Pringsheim studies
the phenomenon in another way. The sodium salt is intro
duced into the tube in a nickel or iron boat which can be
suddenly removed from the hot part of the tube by an electro
magnet. In the case of the iron boat the iron acts also as a
reducing agent. The point is to see whether, having deve
loped the spectrum with the iron boat in the hot part of the
tube (filled with hydrogen), this spectrum fades suddenly or
gradually when the boat is withdrawn to the cold part of
the tube. If it fades gradually the conclusion is that the
liberated sodium vapour is luminous per se, and only ceases
to give a spectrum as it migrates to the cool part of the
apparatus. If the spectrum fades suddenly the conclusion is
that the spectrum is only evinced at the moment of libera
tion of the sodium from its compound, and is therefore the
direct result of chemical action. The latter Pringsheim finds
to be the case.
   Pringsheim then summarizes his conclusions as follows :—
   1. There is no gaseous source of light which satisfies the
conditions of KirchhofFs law.

                    the Luminosity of Gases.                  257
    2. Glowing gases can be obtained of a temperature below
 150° 0. (cold flames).
    3. Sodium salts emit light in flames only as a consequence
 of chemical processes.
    4. Metallic sodium heated in neutral gases emits light only
 as a consequence of chemical processes.
    5. The assumption that gases can emit light by mere ele
 vation of their temperature is a hypothesis demanded neither
 on experimental nor theoretical grounds.
    These conclusions, which go to the root of spectrum analysis,
are, it must be admitted, of the most serious importance. I
 am not satisfied that they are warrantable, and wish to direct
 attention to the following points :—
    (I.) The fifth, and in all probability the first, conclusion
 (supra) of Pringsheim is contradicted by the experiment with
iodine vapour which I have already described (p. 252).
    (II.) The second conclusion of Pringsheim is unwarrant
able, for the reasons stated in the first part of this paper. It
may be that a certain disulphide air-flame can be obtained
having an average temperature below 150° C. This tells us
nothing of the temperature of the molecules of C02 and S02
 which are formed in the flame. Theory, on the other hand,
would assign to them a very high temperature if the heat
produced in their birth is assumed to be stored in them for
an instant. The ready inflammability of the mixture only
points to the relatively great distance at which the com
bining molecules of CS2 may be apart, and to the inter
polation of a large number of non-burning molecules which
tend enormously to lower the average temperature of the flame.
   (III.) Pringsheim's third and fourth conclusions are un
doubtedly the most serious. Metallic sodium, he says, heated in
neutral gases emits light only as a consequence of chemical pro
cesses. This conclusion is reached only by indirect evidence.
In the first place, I would remark on the fact that according to
Pringsheim (loc. cit. p. 444) the admission of carbon dioxide
to the hot porcelain tube, in which the sodium spectrum has
been developed by the action of hydrogen on sodium com
pounds, does not destroy the spectrum, while air does so
immediately. Why is this ? Hot sodium vapour and carbon
dioxide are quite incompatible ; surely C02 and air ought
both to extinguish the spectrum ; both are powerful oxi
dizing agents to sodium. The important experiments are
those with the movable iron or nickel boat, and in these
another difficulty with C02 appears. After withdrawing the

258      Prof. A. Smithells on the Luminosity of Gases.
iron boat from the hot part of the tube filled with 002, the
spectrum does not fade to the degree anticipated but acquires
a stationary intensity. This is attributed to the lingering of
sodium vapour, ¦which attacks the sodium silicate with which
the interior of the tube has become coated in previous experi
ments. A " reciprocal " reaction is said to take place : the
sodium vapour attacks the silicate, liberating other sodium
vapour, a process at first rapid but gradually attaining equili
brium. After this the process goes on steadily, sodium libera
ting sodium. This seems to me to be a very extraordinary as
sumption, and more a robbing of Peter to pay Paul than the
 picture of a chemical equilibrium. We are to suppose that
a film of sodium silicate —at the most, liquid—in contact with
sodium vapour, and above all in an oxidizing atmosphere of
 carbon dioxide, is constantly giving and taking sodium atoms
so as to keep up the chemical action which Pringsheim
 demands for the development of the sodium spectrum. Such
 a state of things will be, I imagine, as surprising to chemists
 as it is novel. It is true that dissociation phenomena are
 pictured as involving a constant in-and-out movement of the
products of dissociation from the compound undergoing dis
 sociation. But if sodium acts on sodium silicate at all it will
 be to liberate silicon, and after that is complete we can only
assume the resulting sodium oxide to react with fresh sodium
at the temperature at which sodium oxide dissociates. We
have no knowledge of the dissociation of sodium oxide. If,
as I venture to think, Pringsheim's explanation of this point
is not to be accepted, there is less difficulty in accounting for
his other observations, for the sudden reduction of the intensity
of the spectral effect in hydrogen when the boat is suddenly
withdrawn is only important in comparison with what occurs
in C02. I do not see any cause for surprise that the intensity
of the spectrum should suddenly diminish in hydrogen when
the boat is withdrawn suddenly. One would expect the
moving boat to drag its small atmosphere of sodium vapour
with it to the cool part of the tube,—and, again, one would
not expect the spectrum to persist in air. I can, therefore,
see no adequate grounds for the important conclusion which
Pringsheim draws from these experiments, namely, that
metallic sodium only gives its spectrum when undergoing
chemical change.
    I may summarize the views above expressed as follows :—
    1. There is no evidence for, but much against, the suppo
sition that sodium salts when introduced into a flame are
dissociated by heat so as to liberate the metal.

            Dr. A. M. Mayer's Researches in Acoustics.               259
    2. There is great difficulty in accounting for the reduction
 of the metal by purely chemical processes.
    3. Arrhenius's hypothesis of ionic dissociation in flames is
 a chemically acceptable way of accounting for the liberation
 of sodium when its salts are heated in flames.
    4. There is no direct evidence and no decisive indirect
 evidence that the sodium spectrum is the direct consequence
 of the chemical action in which the atoms are engaged.
                                Postscript.
    In a recent number of Wiedemann's Annalen * there is a
 paper by Paschen in which he shows by bolometric mea
 surements that the invisible spectra of hot gases exhibit
 distinct maxima of intensity—that, in short, gases do give
 discontinuous spectra on being heated, independently of
 chemical action. On these grounds and others, some of
 which are similar to those explained in the foregoing paper,
 Paschen does not consider that Pringsheim's conclusions can
 be accepted.

     1. On the Law connecting the Pitch of a Sound with the
                 Duration of its Residual Sensation.
IN October 1874 I published in the American Journal
       of Science Paper No. 6 of .Researches in Acoustics,
which contained an account of my attempts to establish the
law connecting the pitch of a sound with the duration of its
residual sensation. The law given in that paper was the
expression of the results of the first experiments, extend
ing through several octaves, ever made on the duration of
 sonorous sensations.
    Subsequently, in April 1875, I published in the American
Journal of Science % the results of similar experiments which

   t Communicated by the Autho r.
   \ The papers cited above were published in the Philosophical Magazine
of May 1875, in one paper, " Researches in Acoustics, No. VI."

260        Dr. A. M. Mayer's Researches in Acoustics.
Madame Ema Seiler had made at my request. She made a
long series of experiments with the same apparatus I had
used. Her determinations, though agreeing with mine in
having approximately the same variation of the residual
sensation with the pitch, yet differed considerably in the
absolute quantities which she found for the durations of these
sensations. That the two series of observations should differ
was to be expected from the known variation of the sonorous
sensations among different observers ; but the principal cause
of the difference is to be attributed to the apparatus (fig. 3)
iised in these experiments. This apparatus generated sounds
in addition to the one to be specially observed, so that the
determinations were difficult to make except by -one whose
hearing was peculiarly trained and naturally gifted in the
power of excluding other sound-sensations from the one
alone to be studied. In the ability to analyse composite
sounds Madame Seiler was noted ; and I had no doubt at the
time of the publication of her results that they were more
worthy than mine to form the basis of a physiological law.
This I stated in my paper of 1875, and the experiments
described in the present paper, made with improved methods,
show that the opinion then entertained was correct.
    That there is a physiological law which gives the relation
between the pitch of a sound and the duration of its residual
sensation is shown by the numerous experiments contained in
this paper. But those published in 1874 and 1875 sufficed
to establish that fact ; yet those experiments have never been
repeated by physiologists.
    I have waited nineteen years in the hope that others would
make similar experiments, so that the combination of the
results of various experimenters would give an expression of
the law which might be regarded as general and accepted as
expressing the average residual sensations of sounds.
    It is true that Professor C. R. Cross and H. M. Goodwin
published a series of similar experiments in " Some con
siderations regarding Helmholtz's Theory of Consonance"
 (Proc. Amer. Acad., Boston, June 1891). They obtained
the smallest consonant intervals of simple sounds by blowing
sheets of air across the mouths of resonators. The reciprocals
of the differences of the frequency of the vibrations forming
the intervals thus found are plotted in the curve C C of
 fig. 1. I and I' give their determinations of the durations
 of the residual sensations of UT3 and of UT4, deduced from
their observations of the coalescence of these sounds when
interrupted by a perforated disk rotating between a resonator
 and its corresponding fork.

   The curve S shows Madame Seiler's determination of the
residual sonorous sensations ; M shows mine. It is evident
that the meandering, undecided curve, C, cannot be the
expression of a law, and that the data I and I' cannot be
combined with those contained in the curve S, or in the

   The duration of a residual sonorous sensation is really the
duration of the entire period in which a sensation of sound
is perceived after the vibrations outside of the ear, giving
rise to that sensation, have ceased to exist. While the total

duration of the after-sensation produced by the stimulus of
light can be measured, as in the case of an electric flash, the
determination of the total duration of the after-sensation of
a sound appears, in the light of our present knowledge and
with the means of experiment at our command, to be a
problem very difficult to solve.
   The object of this research was not to determine the total
duration of the after-sensation of a sound, but to measure
that duration in which the after-sensation of a sound does
not perceptibly diminish in intensity.
                              Fig. 2.
   In fig. 2, D and E represent openings in a screen im
pervious to sound. The distance between the openings
equals thrice the diameter of an opening. A tube, R, having
the same interior diameter as the openings, is supposed to
convey sound-vibrations against the screen, while tho tube
itself moves from left to right with its mouth sliding along
the surface of the screen. In the position A, the sound is
just about to traverse the opening D to the ear on the
other side of the screen. As R progresses over the opening
D, the sound traverses the opening till R has reached the
position F B. Then, in the path of the tube from B to
C, no sound traverses the screen. When the edge B of the
tube has reached the position 0, the sound is again just on
the eve of traversing the screen through tbe opening E. As
the distance A to B equals B to C, the periods during which
the sound traverses the screen equal those in which it does
 not do so. If these alternations of sound and silence should
succeed one another so rapidly that the sensation of the
sound is uniform in its intensity, it may at first sight appear
that during the time that the tube takes to go from B to C
the after-sensation of the sound has not diminished in intensity.
But is B to C to be taken as the measure of the duration of
uniform sensation ? As the tube R moves over D a sound
with a varying intensity traverses the opening in the screen.
We cannot suppose that the residual sensation caused by the
stimulus of the sound traversing a minute opening in the
screen equals that caused by the sound which traverses the
screen when the circles R and D coincide. In such experi
ments, however, we are driven to take as the duration of the

          Dr. A. M. Mayer's Researches in Acoustics.        263
undiminished residual sensation the time that the centre of
the tube, R, takes to go from the centre of D to the centre
of E.
   In this illustration I have, for simplicity and conciseness,
supposed the tube R to move over the openings D and E.
In the actual experiments D and E are two of several holes
in a disk, arranged in a circle, and the disk rotates while the
tube R is fixed. Another tube placed in the prolongation
of the tube R, on the other side of the disk, conveys the
interrupted sound to the ear.
   Evidently the manner in which the tube conveying the
sound to the disk is open and closed by the revolving disk
has to be considered in researches made with this apparatus.
I give two cases whose discussion has led me to modify,
                              Fig. 3.
with marked efficiency, the apparatus, shown in fig. 3, which
was used in the researches published in this Journal in 1875.
In that apparatus the interruptions of sound were made
by a perforated disk revolving in front of the mouth of a
resonator, while the interrupted sound was conveyed to the
ear by a tube attached to the small opening in the nipple
of the resonator.
   This mode of obtaining the interruptions of the sound is
objectionable because the resonator is not in tune with the
fork except when the former is fully opened, and also because
                               T2

 the perforated disk rotating across the mouth of the resonator
 gives rise to two secondary sounds and a resultant sound,
 fully described in my paper of 1875 *. These sounds, from
 their intensity in this form of experiment, mask the proper
 sound of the fork, mak ing the determination of the durations
 of the sonorous sensations both difficult and uncertain. Also,
 in these experiments the action of the interrupted sound on
 the ear is distressing, even injurious ; for the hearing of one
 of my ears was permanently impaired by the experiments I
 made with this apparatus nineteen years ago.
    In the apparatus presently to be described, the fork vibrates
 in front of the mouth of the resonator, and the interruptions
 in the flow of sound are caused by the perforated disk re
 volving in front of the small opening in the nipple of the
 resonator, as shown in fig. 7.
 Discussion of the Effects of the Relative Sizes of the Openings
    in the Revolving Disk and of the Opening in the Tube
    conveying the Sound to the Disk.
    First Case. Suppose that the opening of the nipple of the
 resonator and the openings in the disk have the same dia
 meter.      In the actual experiments these openings were
 1 centim. in diameter. The nipple of the resonator had a
 tube of that diameter adapted to it.
                                  Fig. 4.
    Fig. 4 is the graphic representation of the results of com
puting the varying areas of the opening of the tube of the
resonator, as an opening in the disk passes in front of it.
This diagram is to be studied in connexion with fig. 2. The
entire length on the axis of abscissas OX gives the space
A to B of fig. 2, divided into sixteen parts. The ordinates
of the curve give the relative areas of opening for corre
sponding positions on the axis of abscissas. The ordinate

 of the tube of the resonator and of the disk coincide. It will
 be observed that the tube is opened and closed slowly, and is
 only instantaneously fully opened at 8.
    Second Case. The openings in the disk remain 1 centim. in
 diameter, but the opening in the nipple of the resonator is
 £ centim. in diameter. Fig. 5 shows the relations between
 the areas of opening of the nipple of the resonator and the
                              Fig. 5.

path A to B (fig. 6) of this opening, It, as it is supposed to
move across the opening D in the disk. Fig. 5 is to be
studied in connexion with fig. 6. Fig. 5 shows that the
opening and closing of the nipple of the resonator take place
rapidly, and that the nipple remains fully opened from 4 to 8,
that is, during one-third the time that the opening in the
disk takes to traverse the opening in the resonator. The
advantages gained by this mode of experimenting are con
siderable. The periods of sound and of silence are sharply
marked, and, as we shall now show, the fact that the hole in the
resonator has half the diameter of the hole in the disk gives
us the means of approaching nearer to the measure of the
veritable time during which we have an after-sensation of
uniform intensity.
                             Fig. 0.
   In fig. 6 It represents the opening in the nipple of the
resonator, supposed to pass over the opening D in the
disk. In this case, as in fig. 2, the space A to B in which
sound traverses the revolving disk is equal to the space B to
C in which silence supervenes, for the distance separating two
holes in the disk equals twice the diameter of a hole, or four

266        Dr. A. M. Mayer's Researches in Acoustics.
times the diameter of the hole in the nipple of the resonator!
But in this form of the experiment we are again in doubt as
to what space should he taken as measuring the duration of
the uniform residual sensation. The period from the full
opening of the resonator in one position to the full opening
in the succeeding one is equal to the time the disk takes to
go from G to H, which is equal to the distance D to E
between the centres of the openings in the disk minus the
diameter of the opening in the resonator, or, DE minus
J DE.       This distance, G to H, evidently measures the
periods between maximum and maximum intensities of
succeeding sound-pulses ; and we have taken this distance,
in terms of velocity of rotation, as the measure of the
period of uniform residual sound-sensation, because we have
no certain knowledge of the relative durations of the
residual sensations corresponding to vibrations which pass
the disk with increasing intensity, from 0 to 4, fig. 5, and
with decreasing intensity, from 8 to 12.
    In our experiments we measured the number of flashes of
sound entering the ear by knowing the number of revolutions
of the disk per second, and the number of holes in the disk.
From this knowledge we compute the time it took the disk to
go over D to E in fig. 6, the distance between centres of two
neighbouring holes ; then we reduced this time by one sixth,
 which is the ratio of the diameter of the opening in the
 nipple of the resonator to the distance D to E, and took this
 reduced time as the duration of the uniform residual sensation.
 The duration of the sonorous sensation determined in this
 manner is evidently nearer the truth than that obtained with
 apparatus in which the hole in the tube conveying the sound
 to the disk and the boles in the disk have the same diameter.
   The Apparatus and Methods used to Measure the Durations
                 of Residual Sonorous Sensations.
    [A.] I shall first describe the apparatus which I found the
 most efficient for these measures, and then describe three
 other forms of apparatus used.
    In fig. 7 is seen a perforated disk mounted on the axle of
 a rotator. In front of the disk is the resonator with its
 nipple close to the surface of the disk. A tuning-fork is
opposite the mouth of the resonator. On the other side of
 the disk, with its axis in line with the axis of the nipple of
 the resonator, is the tube which conveys the interrupted
 sounds to the ear. The opening in this tube has the same
 diameter as the openings in the revolving disk. Behind the
line of this tube is seen, on the end of the axle, a fly-wheel
of copper weighing a kilogramme.

          Dr. A. M. Mayer's Researches in Acoustics.       267
   The bevelled face of the driving-wheel of the rotator has
three grooves cut in it, in steps. Corresponding grooves are
cut in the pulley of the axle.
   To run a rotator of this description smoothly, without jars
or vibrations, it is necessary that the cord which passes over
the driving-wheel and pulley should be very flexible and
have a circular section of uniform area throughout its length.
                              Fig. 7.
I obtained such a cord by soaking a cord of porpoise leather
in neat's-foot oil, and then drawing it many times through
wire-drawing plates. The ends of the cord are connected by
a short hook-and-eye coupling. The driving-wheel can be
slipped up or down the standard of the rotator to adjust the
tension of the cord.
   The driving-wheel is turned by a handle of aluminium of
the form shown in the figure. It is necessary to have a
handle of small diameter in order to turn the wheel with a
uniform velocity. The fingers which clasped the handle were
coated with plumbago dust.

 268         Dr. A. M. Mayer's Researcltes in Acoustics.
     In all the experiments the driving-wheel of the rotator was
 revolved either once in a second or twice in a second. This
 is accomplished, after some practice, in the following way :—
 The rotator, on which is mounted the disk and fly-wheel, is
 placed near a clock giving loud beats of seconds, and the
 driving is revolved by the guidance of the hand and ear.
 The results of the experiments showed that the velocities thus
 given to the disk were sufficiently uniform, and the measures
 of the durations of sonorous sensations sufficiently concordant
 and precise to obtain the data of the physiological law.
     I adopted this method of rotation in preference to mechan
 ical means for controlling and measuring the revolutions of
 the disks. To determine when the interrupted sounds have
 blended requires, so to say, a flexible apparatus whose velocity
 is under the immediate control of the hand and ear. This is
 important in making the final judgement between sounds, one
 of which appears to have too few interruptions, the other a
 few more interruptions than are necessary to give a continuous
 uniform sensation. It is evident that when we can at once
 slightly increase or diminish the velocity of rotation of the
 disk, we have the means of making comparisons rapidly suc
 ceeding one another. A rotator, driven as described, forms
 more a part of the observer than one driven and regulated by
mechanism.
    As there were three grooves in the driving-wheel and three
in the pulley on the axle, and as the driving-wheel was re
volved either once or twice in a second, eighteen different
velocities could be given to the rotating disk.
    Disks were made having numbers of holes from 5 to 19, so
that, with 18 velocities and the various numbers of holes in
the disks, it was easy to select a disk, driven with a known
velocity, which gave the exact number of interrupted sounds
per second to blend.
    The 18 ratios of velocities of the driving-wheel and of the
pulley on the axle of the rotator were obtained as follows :—
A circle of cardboard, divided into one hundred parts, was
clamped on the rotator in front of a disk. The driving-
wheel was rotated either once or twice in a second, so that the
conditions were the same as in the experiments. From 10 to
 100 revolutions of the driving-wheel were made before the
ratio was determined. The division to which a fixed index
pointed on the divided circle feave the fraction of a revolution.
The whole number of revolutions was given by a simple
counter which moved with very little friction.
   The rotating disks were made of mahogany, 5 millim. thick,
with disks of cardboard about 2 millim thick screwed to the
wooden disks. The circumferences of the holes in the wooden

           Dr. A. M. Mayer's Researches in Acoustics.        269
and cardboard disks exactly coincided. The circle of holes
in the disks was placed 5 centim. from its border. The
rotator and disks were so carefully made that the nipple of
 the resonator was only A millim. from the surface of the
 revolving disk. The mouth of the tube conveying the inter
 rupted sounds to the ear was about the same distance from
 the surface of the other side of the disk. The disks were
clamped on the axis of the rotator between smaller flat disks
 of brass, not shown in the figure.
    The diameter of the holes in the disk, and of the interior of
the tube conveying the sounds to the ear, was 1 centim. The
diameter of the opening in the nipples of the resonators was
 £ centim.
   The disks were made of mahogany which had been in my
possession for thirty years. It was well seasoned and had
nearly the thickness required for the disks. This wood was
used becauso it holds the form given it better than any wood
1 have had experience with.
    Sound passes through mahogany and other woods even
when a centimetre in thickness. Sound also passes through
cardboard, but not so readily as through wood. I found
that by placing cardboard on wood I formed a screen of hetero
geneous materials which presented an effective obstruction to
the passage of sound.
                             Fig. 8.
                   A                   3=3
    [B.] In the second form of apparatus I replaced the re
sonator by resonant tubes as shown in fig. 8, where F is the
fork, T the tube, with a tube of larger diameter, A, sliding on
T, so that the air in the tube could be adjusted to vibrate
with the fork. On the other side of the disk D is the tube T,
to which is attached the tube of caoutchouc which leads to the
ear. This arrangement is like that used by Dr. R. Koenig,
and described on page 140 of his Quelques Expiriences
d'Acoustigue, Paris, 1882, and used by him for the obser
vation of the sounds produced by interruptions of continuous
sounds.

270         Dr. A. M. Mayer's Researches in Acoustics.
   Experiments made with this apparatus gave the same
results as those made with apparatus [A] , but the sounds given
are so feeble compared with those coming from the resonator
(fig. 7), that the periods of sound and silence (or, rather, of
sound and much diminished sound) are not sharply separated.
It followed that the judgment of a continuous sensation on
the ear could not be so neatly made with the use of the
resonant tubes as when the resonators were employed.
    [C] To obtain sharper demarcation of sound and silence
by having no aperture for the lateral escape of sound between
the rotating disk and the nipple of the resonator and be
tween the disk and the tube conveying the sound to the
ear, I made the following apparatus (fig. 9). I turned disks
of brass flat and of uniform thickness. These disks were
revolved on a rotator driven by gear wheels made of
" fiberoid," so that the movement should be noiseless. The
number of teeth on the wheels and holes in the disks were
such that I was enabled to make three determinations corre
sponding in the number of interruptions of sound to those
already obtained with apparatus [A],
   Two brass tubes, T and T', fig. 9, one having an interior
diameter of £ centim., the other an interior diameter of
1 centim., slid accurately and with little friction in two tubes,
                               Fig. 9.
A and B, with flanges on their ends. These flanges were
[>ressed against the surfaces of the disk D by two delicate
 lelical springs fitting over the tubes at S and S', between the
flanges of A and B and the standards P and P'. The tubes
T and T' were as close as possible to the disk while it rotated.
The flanges A and B were of such diameter that no sound

            Dr. A. M. Mayer's Researches in Acoustics.       271
could issue between them and the surfaces of the rotating
disk, because the flanges entirely covered the hole in the disk
while this hole traversed the tubes T and T. A tube of
caoutchouc led from the tube       to the ear.
   Although a film of oil was between the flanges and the
disk, and the disks were so accurately made that the greatest
departure from uniformity of thickness amounted to only
5*5 millim., yet the sounds produced by the sliding of the
disk between the flanges caused much distraction in the
perception of the sound from the resonator, which was adapted
to the tube T, of £ centim. in diameter. The results obtained
with this apparatus agreed with those given by apparatus [A] .
    [D.] I had formed great hopes of having the best apparatus
for the determination of the duration of a residual sensation in
                             Fig. 10.
the one shown in fig. 10. A is the lower drum of a Helmholtz
double siren; D, the perforated disk of the siren, which was
rotated by the driving-wheel W. The disk D was enclosed in a
cover, C, of the form shown in fig. 10, clamped to the drum of
the siren. The sound issued from the box thus formed, and was
conveyed to the ear by the tube E, to which was attached a tube
of caoutchouc. The sound to be experimented on was conveyed
from the fork, F, and resonator, R, through a long tube, T, to
the drum of the siren. By placing pulleys, P, of various dia
meters on the axle of the disk of the siren, and by opening one
 or another of the various circles of holes in the drum A, I had

272        Dr. A. M. Mayer's Researcltes in Acoustics,
the means of obtaining a considerable range in the number of
interruptions of sounds per second.
   The results given by this apparatus were the same as those
obtained with [A] , but the objection to its action is the pro
duction of sounds by the apparatus itself, caused by the
rotation of the perforated disk. These sounds distracted the
attention from the phenomenon of the continuous sensation
produced by the interruptions of the sound from the fork, and
 so masked it that I consider this apparatus the least efficient
 of those I have described.
    These experiments on the blending of interrupted sounds
are not pleasant to make. The ear soon becomes fatigued, and
the perception of sound is dulled. After an experiment the
ear has to be rested during a considerable time before the
experiment can be repeated satisfactorily. Thus much time
is consumed, and these experiments cannot be made in a few
days, but weeks are required to arrive at satisfactory measures ;
also, considerable time is consumed in gaining mastery over
the apparatus. To make these experiments less tedious,
fatigue of the ear is to be avoided. This is done by not
allowing the interrupted sounds to enter the ear longer than
during two or three seconds ; then a rest of five to six seconds
is taken, while the fork is kept in action and the disk revolved
with the same velocity ; then another three-second period of
sound is given the ear. This is best done by placing the
rubber tube in the meatus of the ear and pinching the
tube between the fingers. By relieving the pressure more
or less we can regulate the intensity of the sound which
enters the ear, or we can shut the sound off". The other ear is
tightly closed with beeswax softened with a little turpentine.
    Within the limits of the intensities of sound used in these
experiments, I found no change in the duration of the sen
sation with change in the intensity of the sound. It seems
probable that such connected changes exist. If they do exist,
then it would appear, from the smoothness of the curve I have
obtained from the experiments, that the relative mean inten
sities of the sounds used did not vary sufficiently to make
apparent any change in the duration of the after-sensation with
change in the intensity of the stimulus.

   Column A gives the names of the sounds, and B the numbers
of their vibrations (v.d.) per second ; 0, the number of beats
of interrupted sound received by the ear in a second to blend
into a continuous uniform sensation. In column D are the
durations of the residual sonorous sensations, expressed in
vulgar fractions. The numbers in column D are obtained,
as already explained, by diminishing the reciprocals of the
numbers in column C by            Under E are the fractions in
column D in decimals. Under F are the durations of the
residual sensations, computed by the formula
                      r33,000     ,D-|
in which D equals the duration of the residual sensation given
by a sound of N number of vibrations per second. Under G
are the differences between the computed and observed values
of the residual sensations. These differences are so small,
except in the case of S0L3, that we may adopt the empirical

 formula as expressing the law which connects the pitch of a
 sound with the duration of its residual sonorous sensation.

          Dr. A. M. Mayer's Researches in Acoustics.         275
This formula, however, only refers to my own auditory sen
sation. It is a physiological law ; and I imagine that the
durations of these residual sonorous sensations will vary more
with different observers than do analogous visual sensations.
It is therefore to be wished that others will repeat these expe
riments and obtain determinations which, when combined, will
give a law which may be accepted as the expression of the
average durations of the residual sonorous sensations.
   The results in column E are given graphically in the
curve I of fig. 11. The unit on the axis of abscissas is
100 v.d. The unit on the axis of ordinates is •Ol second.
   The determination of the duration of the residual sensation
of UT! [64 v.d.] was very carefully made, and made many
times. The experiments gave "0361 second for the duration
of this sound. The formula gives "0369, which is ^ greater
than the observed duration. The greatest difference existing
between the observed and computed duration of the remaining
sounds of the table is in the case of SOL3 [384 v.d.], where
the computed is ^ greater than the observed duration.
   In column L of Table I. are given the number of wave
lengths of the sounds which pass into the ear through a hole
in the rotating disks when these interrupted sounds blend into
uniform sensations. The average number of wave-lengths
which pass a hole is about 21. As the sound rises in pitch,
more wave-lengths pass the hole ; thus, while only l-38 wave
length passes in the case of UT^ three wave-lengths pass in
the case of UTe.
   An examination of fig. 6 shows that sound passes to the
ear while a hole in the disk passes over three diameters of the
hole in the nipple of the resonator, while the distance between
the centres of neighbouring holes in the disk equals six
diameters of the hole in the resonator. Hence, to ascertain the
number of wave-lengths which enter the ear during the
passage of a hole in the disk across the hole in the resonator,
we must divide the number of vibrations per second of the
sound, given in column B, by twice the corresponding
number in column C.
    2. On the Smallest Consonant Intervals among Simple
                             Tones.
  When two simple tones which differ slightly in pitch are
sounded simultaneously, beats are produced, which become
more frequent as the difference in pitch increases, and with

276         Dr. A. M. Mayer's Researches in Acoustics.
this increase in the interval between the tones the dissonance
becomes harsher, reaching a maximum dissonance when the
nnmber of beats are about *0 of the number required to blend,
then becoming less dissonant as the interval increases till, at
last, the two tones blend into a consonance. These are the
phenomena observed from SOLj [96 v.d.] to the highest
tones used in music.
    Having the law which gives the number of beats (produced
by the interrupted sounds of tones of various pitch), which
blend, one might naturally infer that the smallest consonant
interval could be computed by that law. Given the pitch of
a tone, we compute by the law the number of interruptional
beats of this tone which blend, and adding this number to the
frequency of the given tone we should apparently have the
pitch of the upper tone which makes with the lower the
smallest consonant interval *. This, however, is not so.
Take, for example, UT3 [256 v.d.]. The number of inter
 ruptional beats of this sound which blend is 62, and 256 + 62
 = 318, which, according to the law, should make a consonant
 interval with UT3. But experiment shows that a tone of
 256 + 58 = 314 v.d. forms the nearest consonant interval
 with UTa.
    To render less tedious the comprehension of the results of
many experiments on the smallest consonant intervals among
simple tones, I shall at once give a table (Table II.) of the
results of these experiments, and then give the account of the
experiments that furnished the data of the table.
    In column A are given the lowest tones of the consonant
intervals which were experimented on. In column B are the
number of vibrations to be added to the tones of column A to
form the higher note of the smallest consonant interval, as
deduced from the experiments on the duration of the residual
sensations of interrupted sounds. In column C the numbers
of vibrations by which the tones in column A have really to
be increased to form the higher notes of the smallest consonant
intervals. In column D are the numbers of vibrations to be
added to those of column A to form the smallest consonant
intervals as computed by the formula
                   N:N +
   • Rigorously, we should take in the computation the number of beats
which blend corresponding to a sound of a pitch which is the mean of the
pitch of the lower and upper sounds of the interval.

 = the number of vibrations of the higher tone of the interval.
In column E are given the differences between the com
puted values [D] and the observed values [C] . The formula
fives quite closely the true values from SOLs [192 v.d.] to
  [I6 [2560 v.d.]. In column F are given the smallest con
sonant intervals as determined experimentally from SOLj
 [96 v.d.] to the tone of 2806 v.d., expressed in semitones of
the equal-tempered scale.
    In fig. 11 these intervals, computed from the numbers in
column C, are expressed graphically by the curve N.C.I.
 The units of ordinates (on the left of figure) are semitones,
and the units of abscissas are 100 vibrations. This curve
shows in a striking manner the contraction of the smallest
consonant interval as we ascend the musical scale ; while
 SOLj [96 v.d.] requires a sound separated from it by 6^-j
 semitones to give the smallest consonant interval, SOLg of
 3072 v.d. forms a consonant interval with a higher sound
 separated from it by only 1^ semitones.
    The curve AV, of fig. 11, which has the same units of
 abscissas as curve N.C.I., and the units of whose ordinates, in
 number of vibrations, are on the right of the diagram, shows
 graphically the number of vibrations to be added to the tones,
 on the axis of abscissas, to obtain the smallest consonant
 intervals.
    The experiments which form the basis of the statements
 given in Table II., I shall now describe.
    Having but few forks below UT3 in pitch, and those not
 numerous enough to determine with accuracy the consonant
 intervals, I requested my friend Dr. Rudolph Koenig, of
 Paris, to determine for me the smallest consonant intervals
 among sounds below UT3 in pitch. The numbers in the table
 referring to tones SOL.j, UTlf SOL,, UT„ and SOL,, ex
 periments nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of Table II., were furnished
 by Dr. Kcenig's experiments. The account of these experi
 ments, which Dr. Koenig so obligingly made for me, I give
 in his own words :—

deux notes primaires, paraît être presque entièrement indé
pendant de leur intensité absolue, quand elles sont graves,
tandis que le rôle de l'intensité absolue augmente avec leur
hauteur. En effet, les résultats des observations faites avec
des diapasons relativement faibles, et sans résonateurs, sont
pour les octaves graves presque absolument identiques avec
les résultats donnés par les gros diapasons et résonateurs du
grand tonomètre, et publiés dans le tableau, page 113, des
Quelques Expériences d'Acoustique, tandis que pour les
intervalles avec les notes fondamentales UT2 et SOL2, les
différences des résultats devient déjà sensible. Je pourrais
aussi résumer ces faits en disant que l'influence de l'intensité
absolue des deux sons primaires sur la perceptibilité de batte
ments, qui est absolument nulle pour les battements lents,
augment pour les roulements et raucités avec les nombres des
battements qui les produit, car, pour example, les 8 batte
ments de UTi :          sont aussi distinctement entendus avec
des notes UTj et REl très faibles, qu'avec des notes les
plus fortes, tandis que le roulement des 32 battements de
 UTi : SOL1, se fait beaucoup plus sentir quand les deux notes
sont fortes, que quand elles n'ont qu'une faible intensité.

    I experimented on the hearing of twelve persons with all
the forks at my command among which I could obtain con
sonant intervals. It is true that the number of intervals thus
furnished, by 80 forks, did not amount to many. Many such
intervals can only be obtained in the laboratory of Dr. Kœnig,
where is his " grand tohomètre " giving the frequency of all
sounds from 16 to 21845 complete vibrations per second.
However, I secured, between D"T3 and SOL6, enough intervals
among the forks to establish the law and the facts given in
Table II.
   All the persons experimented on, except myself and one
other observer, were accomplished musicians, several of them

282"       Dr. A. M. Mayer's Researches in Acmcstics.
violinists of more than exceptional ability. Three were
graduates of the Conservatory of Music of Leipzig.
   These experiments were all made in the same manner, viz.
by taking the fork giving the lower tone and sounding it suc
cessively with others which gave more and more beats per
second, till these beats blended into a continuous smooth
sensation, forming the smallest consonant interval. As musi
cians rather avoid than dwell on dissonant intervals, I educated
each one in the special subject of the roughness of the sen
sation given by beats by making the beats more and more
frequent till near consonance, then giving an interval which
is admitted by everv one to be consonant. In this way their
hearing was trained in what I wished them to discern, viz.
that separation in the pitch of two forks which just gives a
consonant interval.
   The variation among the decisions of these different observers
never equalled two vibrations ; generally they agreed exactly.
The agreement among observers in the judgment of a
consonant interval is remarkable. I give the mean of these
experiments. The number of the paragraphs refer to the
number of the experiment given in Table II. :—
   [6] UT3 : MI3 = 256 : 320 gave a consonant interval. I
narrowed the interval by lowering the pitch of MI3 from 320
to 315, 314, 313-5, and 313.
   UT3 : 315 consonant.
     „ : 314 just consonant.
     „ : 313-5 slightly rough.
     „ : 313 decidedly rough.
   These experiments show that 256' : 256 + 58 = smallest con
sonant interval.
   [7] MI3 : SOL3 = 320 : 384 is decidedly rough. Separated
the interval by lowering the MI3 fork from 320 to 316; then
   MI3 : SOL3 = 316 : 384 = 316 : 316 + 68=smallest consonant
      interval.
   [8] LA3:UT4 = 439: 517-4 decidedly harsh. Separated
interval by lowering LA3 of 439 v.d. to 432 v.d. ; then
   LA3 : l!T4=432 : 517-4 = 432 : 432 + 85-4 = smallest conso
      nant interval.
   [9] RE4 :FA4 = 576 : 682-65 slightly rough. Increased
the interval by lowering RE4 of 576 v.J. to 575 v.d.; then
   RE4 : FA4 = 575 : 682-65 = 575 : 575 + 107-65 = smallest
      consonant interval.
   [10] SOL4 : fork of 896 v.d. = 768:896 slightly rough.
Increased the interval by lowering SOL4 of 768 v.d. to 766'2;

    S0L4 : 896=766-2 : 896 = 766-2 : 766-2 + 129-8 = smallest
      consonant interval.
    [11] LAS:S16=1706-6:1920 consonant. Narrowed the
interval by lowering SI6 of 1920 to 1917 ; then
    LA6 : Sl6 = 1706-6 : 1917 = 1706-6 : 1706-6 + 210- 4 = smallest
      consonant interval.
    [12] RE6 : MI,=2304 : 2560 consonant. Narrowed the
interval by lowering MI6 of 2560 v.d. to 2549 ; then
   RE„ : MI6=2304 : 2549 = 2304 : 2304 + 245= smallest
      consonant interval.
    [13] MI6: Fork No. 116=2560: 2816=2560: 2560 + 256
is just perceptibly rough.
    [14] Fork 11 : SOL6 = 2816 : 3072 slightly dissonant.
Increased interval by lowering Fork 11 of 2816 v.d. to 2806;
then
   Fork 11 : SOL6=2806 : 3072=2806 : 2806 + 266=smallest
      consonant interval.
   In the experiments just described the intervals of the tones
that gave consonance were made by simple tones of small in
tensity and without the slightest trace of the upper partial
tones of the forks, and the two forks were vibrated so that
they gave, as near as I could judge, the same intensity of
sound. The results given only refer to intervals so formed.
To obtain them the forks were gently vibrated by strokes of
rubber hammers that varied in hardness with the pitch of the
forks. The lower the pitch of the fork, the softer should be
the hammer. A hammer of hard rubber striking low-pitched
forks will develop the upper partial tones of the forks, and so
vitiate the experiments that a really consonant interval might
be judged as dissonant.
   The results of all the experiments may be summed up as
follows :—From SOLa of 192 v.d. to Ml6 of 2560 v.d. the
smallest consonant intervals are closely given by the formula
                    N:N+       42500 1      \       *
   For sounds below SOLj the interval as computed by the
formula is too small to agree with the true interval. For
sounds above MI6 (2560 v.d.) the intervals computed by the
formula, like those belo.v SOL3, are too small. That the ex
perimental determination of the smallest consonant intervals
throughout four octaves, upward from SOL2, or throughout
the tones given by the violin, should agree so closely with the
formula indicates the existence of a law connecting the mag

284        Dr. A. M. Mayer's Researches in Acoustics.
nitude of the smallest consonant interval with its position in
the musical scale.
   Dr. Koenig has shown that a consonant interval does not
exist among simple sounds of pitch below SOL^ [96 v.d.],
yet I have found that the sound of UT, [64 v.d.], when
interrupted by a rotating perforated disk, blends perfectly,
to my ear, when these interruptions occur 23*1 times in a
second. It may appear strange that although 23*1 interrup
tions per second of the sound UTj blend, yet a consonant
interval does not exist throughout the octave of UTj till the
interval of UTj : UTg is reached ; but the beats produced by
the rotating perforated disks are produced by the interrup
tions of one tone, whereas when two simple tones are con
joined two sets of beats are produced, inferior and superior :
thus, when UTx forms an interval with UTj + 23 v.d., the
inferior beats are 23 per second and the superior beats are
41 per second, and the interaction of these inferior and
superior beats produces secondary beats, which give to the
interval a confused rumbling sound *. Of this interval UTj :
UT1 + 23,1, Dr. Kcenig wrote to me as follows:—"Your
23-l interruptions of UTj correspond, in number, to the
inferior beats of the interval of the simple tones UTj : UT,
 + 23"1, but it is just at this magnitude of interval that the
superior beats begin to assert themselves, to produce with
what remains perceptible of the inferior beats the confused
rumbling, which evidently would be but a slight roughness
 (disappearing entirely at a further increase of the interval),
if the superior beats, whose intensity from this point increases
with the interval, did not exist."
3. The Durations of the Residual Sonorous Sensations as
      deduced from the Smallest Consonant Intervals among
      Simple Tones.
    If we assume that two simple tones form the smallest
consonant interval because the beats produced by these
 conjoined sounds have blended into a smooth continuous
 sensation, then we may deduce the durations of the residual
sonorous sensations from the observed smallest consonant
intervals in the following manner :—The reciprocals of the
 numbers in column C of Table II. are taken as expressing
 the durations of the sonorous sensations given by tones whose
numbers of vibrations are the mean of those of the lower and
higher tones of the corresponding consonant intervals, for,
   * See Quelques Experiences d'Acottstique, par Rudolph Kceniej (Paris,
1882), pp. 89, 107,113.

          Dr. A. M. Mayer's Researches in Acoustics.        285
when two sounds of different pitch blend, there is no reason
why the duration of their residual sensation, as given by the
reciprocal in column 0, should refer to the lower sound more
than to the higher. Therefore we have taken these recipro
cals from column C as expressing the durations of sounds
having the mean pitch of the two associated sounds forming
the interval. The residual sensations thus found were
projected in a curve, drawn to a large scale. From this
curve were obtained the durations of the residual sonorous
sensations of the tones of the musical scale. These durations
are given in column H of Table I.
   In column I of Table I. are given these durations as
computed by the formula
    In column K are given the differences between the dura
tions computed by the formula and the durations given in
column H. The differences show that the formula expresses
closely the durations of the residual sensations thus deduced
from the determinations of the smallest consonant intervals,
except in the case of UT3 ; for which tone the computed
number of vibrations to be added to it to form the higher
tone of its smallest consonant interval, as shown in Table II.,
is 5"2 vibrations less than the number really required.
   In fig. 11 these durations, as determined from the smallest
consonant intervals, are plotted in the curve F, so that the
comparison of the durations of the residual sonorous sensa
tions thus determined may be readily compared with those
given (by the curve I) of the residual sensations as determined
by the blending of sounds interrupted by rotating perforated
disks.
   The ordinates of the curves I and F of fig. 11 are obtained
in fractions of a second by changing the numbers 1, 2, and
3 on the left of fig. 11 into -01, -02, and -03.
    These two curves of fig. 11 present the same general
character of a rapid upward flexure at the points corre
sponding to the pitch of about 600 v.d.
    The durations of the sound-sensations as deduced from the
smallest consonant intervals of the forks average about $
Greater than those given by the beats of interrupted sounds,
  t may be supposed that the durations of the sonorous sensa
tions deduced from the smallest consonant intervals of simple
tones are greater than those determined by sounds inter
rupted by the perforated disks, because in the resultant
actions of the vibrations of the tones, forming the smallest

 286         Dr. A. M. Mayer's Researches in Acoustics.
  consonant intervals, the periods of silence, or the periods
  of great diminution of sound, are a fraction of the periods of
  sound, or of the periods of maximum intensity of sound.
 To test this opinion I combined the sinusoids corresponding
 to the two tones of various smallest consonant intervals. On
 taking as the residual duration of the sound, not the time
from maximum to maximum of vibration (as in the deduction
 of the durations from the smallest consonant intervals), but
 the interval of time during which much diminished intensity
 of sound exists, as shown in the combined curves, I found
 tbat the durations of the sonorous sensations were thus
 reduced, on the average, about £, whereas the reduction in
 time should be only J to make these durations agree with
 those determined by the rotating perforated disks. The
 explanation suggested is therefore not tenable.
    For the period of much diminished intensity of sound I
 took that length (in time) of the resultant curve which is
 bounded, at each end, by an amplitude of vibration £ of the
 maxima amplitudes of the curve. We here are in doubt as
 to the relative intensities of the sensations given by two
 sound-vibrations whose amplitudes are 2 : 1, and whose
 energies are as 4 : 1. We at once face an obstacle which,
 from our want of knowledge, is insurmountable : for,
 assuming that either the law of Weber, or the formula of
 Fechner deduced from it, correctly gives the relations
 existing between the intensity of a stimulus and its corre
 sponding sensation, we cannot apply either of these laws,
because we do not know the absolute energies of the sound-
vibrations whose sensations are to be compared. Thus, if we
adopt the law of Weber, with the least perceptible difference in
the sensation of two sounds equal to £ of their energy, as given
by the experiments of Volkmann *, we find that if 1 and 4
   * In the investigations on this subject of which I have knowledge,
the expei imenters have used either noises, or soundsjof corrplex composi
tion mingled with noise, and the ways in which they have determined
the relative energies of sounds, or noise-producing vibrations, are open to
criticism. I do not know of similar experiments made with simple
sounds or tones. I would suggest that the problem of determining the
difference in the energies of two simple sounds to give a perceptible
difference in the sensations they cause may be solved as follows :—A fork
or rod is vibiv.ted with a constant amplitude, and this amplitude is
accurately measured with a mierometer-micro.<<cope. A second fork, or
rod, placed alongside of the first fork or rod, has a much smaller amplitude
of vibration, which can be varied, and is also measu-ed with a micro
 scope. The second fork differs from the first slightly in pitch, so that,
 say, three beats per second are given. The amplitude of the secord, or
 of the first fork, is varied till the perception of beats just vanishes, or
 just appears, while the ear is kept at a fixed distance from the forks.

             Dr. A. M. Mayer's Researches in Acoustics.                  287
 are the absolute energies of the sound-vibrations, we get for
 the ratio of their corresponding intensities of sensations
 1 : 2-6 ; but if the absolute energies of the sounds are 10 ard
 40 (and their ratio is also 1:4), we get for their relative
sensations 1 : 1'48. Or, what is the same, on the curve
expressing the law of Weber, or of Fechner, the ratio of the
sensations of two sounds as given by their corresponding
ordinates depends on the number of units in the abscissas
forming the ratio of the energies of these sounds.
    Professors Cattell and Fnllerton, from extended experi
ments " On the Perception of Small Differences " *, very
carefully made and skilfully reduced, have formed the opinion
that neither tho law of Weber nor Fechner's formula is
correct, and a priori considerations lead them to [the opinion
that it is probable that the sensation is directly as the stimulus.
If the sensation increases directly as the stimulus, then we
can obtain the relative sensations of two sounds whose relative
energies are known. Adopting this relation, we have 1 : 4
as the ratio of the maximum sensation in the periods taken
If we take for the relative intensities of the sound-giving vibrations the
ratio of the squares of tho amplitudes of the forks, the least perceptible
difference in sensation corresponding to the differences in the energies
of the sounds may be computed. As example, suppose the second
fork has ^ of the amplitude of vibration of the nrst. Then the
energy of the maximum sounds of the beats will be 20+F=441, and
the energy of the minimum sound of the beating will be 20— 12 = 301,
      441
and gyj=the ratio of the stimuli giving the least perceptible difference
in sensation. Sound-vibrations of different amplitudes and of different
pitch will have to be experimented with, and the fork giving the greater
amplitude of vibration should, in successive experiments, De lower in
pitch, and then higher in pitch, than the fork giving- the lesser amplitude
of vibration, for reasons set forth in my research (1) " On the Oblitera
tion of the Sensation of one Sound by the simultaneous action on the
ear of another more intense and lower sound ; (2) On the Discovery of
the Fact that a Sound even when intense cannot obliterate the sensation
of another Sound lower than it in pitch " (Phil. Ma;*. Dec. 1870 ;
' Nature,' Aug. 10, 1870). Such a research will be difficult and tedious,
and will require manv precautions in arranging the experiments.
   Any one may readily observe the phenomena described by sounding a
 fork with long amplitude of vibration, and, gradually bringing up to the
ear a second fork with a small amplitude of vibration, giving with the first
 three beats per second. As the latter fork gradually approaches the ear
the beats become stronger, reaching a maximum of intensity, and then
diminishing till, at a certain distance of the fork from the ear, they vanish
 in the more intense sensation of the more intense sound, to reappear when
 the faintly vibrating fork has been brought closer to the ear.

 XXIV. A Study of the Polarisation upon a Thin Metal
    Partition in a Voltameter.—Part II. By John Daniel. *
IN this paper two questions will be discussed : first, the
       passage of ions through a gold-leaf partition in a volta
meter ; second, the minimum current-strength at which the
ions are deposited visibly upon the partition for various
electrolytes. This will be called the " critical current." This
paper is a continuation of the work done last spring in Berlin
in the quantitative measurement of the polarization upon
metal partitions ranging in thickness from '0001 millim. to
•02 millim. for various current-strengths in a 30-per-cent.
HjSO* voltameter. In those experiments there was no
development of gas nor polarization on a gold-leaf partition
(•0001 millim. thick) for the highest current used, which was
four tenths to five tenths ampere.
    The present apparatus consists essentially of a glass volte-
meter vessel with platinum electrodes separated by the metal
partition under investigation, so that there is no path for the
current except through this partition ; an accurate current-
measurer, and a strong, steady battery. The voltameter con
sists of an outer glass jar 8 centim. high, 8 centim. wide, and
8 centim. long ; and a glass jar 8 centim. high, 5 centim.
wide, and 5 centim. long, placed inside the first jar. A
platinum kathode suspended by a platinum wire is placed
inside the inner jar, and a similar electrode serves as anode in

when the electrolyte was CuS04. A hole 2 centim. in
diameter was bored in one side of the smaller jar. Glass

              Thin Metal Partition in a Voltameter.           289
plates 4 centim. wide, 6 centim. long, and 1 millim. thick
were bored with a hole l-5 centim. in diameter. Powdered
sealing-wax was placed around the edge of this hole, melted,
and the gold-leaf secured to the melted sealing-wax.
   This plate was then securely and perfectly (i.e. with no
possible chance for leakage) sealed upon the side of the inner
jar so that the gold-leaf was over the hole almost centrally.
The voltameter was then carefully filled, keeping the liquid
inside and outside on the same level so as not to break the
gold-leaf partition, and was then ready for use.
   To measure the current, a Thomson No. VI. Composite
Electric Balance (No. 106), and a Weston double-scale
ammeter No. 598, ranging from 0 to 1'5, reading directly to
"01 ampere and estimated to "001, and from 0 to 150, read
ing to amperes and estimated to "01, were used in series
with the voltameter. The two instruments were found to
 agree so well that the Weston ammeter was used alone for
 most of this work as it was much more convenient to read.
     The battery consisted of 25 Accumulator Company
 " 23 M " type accumulators, 350 ampere-hours capacity,
 50 volts E.M.F. The currenfr-strength was adjusted to any
 desired value by resistance in series, which could be varied
 at pleasure between zero and 12,000 ohms. For sealing-wax,
 pure rosin and bees- wax (without colouring-matter), mixed
 in such proportion as to give a low melting-point, was used.
 The gold-leaf used was bought in Nashville, and is known to
 the trade as " XX." It is about -0001 millim thick.
    Careful selection was made of such parts of the gold-leaf as
 were found, by holding up to the light, to be free from small
 holes. It has already been observed, in Part I. of this paper,
 that when CuS04 was used as the electrolyte and the current-
 strength was over *3 ampere, Cu was deposited on the rim of
 the gold-leaf, which was necessarily larger than the hole in
 the glass plate. In this work it was found necessary to
 remove this gold quite close up to the edge of the hole by
 scraping it off, as was first tried, or by covering it carefully
 with sealing-wax, which was found both easier and better.
 This was accomplished by melting the sealing-wax over the
 gold with a hot brass hammer of peculiar shape made for the
 purpose. The wax could thus be made to flow quite close
 to the edge of the hole. This left only that part of the gold
 exposed which was immediately over the hole. To neglect
 this was in all cases to reduce the critical current, the deposit
 of the cation appearing first on that part of the gold-leaf
 which was nearest the anode and farthest from the opening.

290         Mr. J. Daniel on the Polarization upon a
      Passage of the Jons through tlie Gold-leaf Partition.
  To test this, CuS04 solution (17 per cent. i. e. 1 gram
CuS04 to 5 cub. centim. H20) was used in the outside vessel
(anode side of the voltameter), and H2S04 (30 per cent,
solution, sp. gr. 1'23) in the inside vessel (kathode side of
the voltameter). These solutions being separated by the
gold^eaf partition, the appearance of the ions upon the
electrodes and upon the partition, when the current was
closea, was noted. The first method of observation was to
close the circuit upon the voltameter, read the current-
strength by the ammeter, and at stated intervals weigh the
Cu deposited on the kathode. This gave Table I., where it
may be seen that the amount of Cu deposited was very small
at first, not more than 2 per cent, or 3 per cent, the first
hour, but increased rapidly with the time.
   This did not settle the question as to whether the current
caused the copper to pass through the gold-leaf partition
or not.
   The second method was to set up two exactly similar volta
meters at the same time, close the circuit on one leaving the
other open, and at statea intervals weigh the Cu deposited on
the kathode of the vol.ameter through which the current had
passed, and at the same time make a quantitative analysis of
f'e solution on the kathode side of both the open and the closed
vo'tameters. This was done by extracting 10 cub. centim.
from each with a pipette, and depositing the Cu electrolytically
in two similar platinum crucibles connected in series. Equi
librium was maintained in the voltameter by adding 10 cub.
centim. of the 30 per cent. H2S04 solution to replace the 10
cub. centim. thus removed. Knowing the volume of solution
in each voltameter, these analyses were sufficient to determine
the total amount of Cu that had passed through the partition
during the same interval for each voltameter. Table II.
gives the results.
   Here it was observed that imperceptible differences in the
specimens of gold-leaf were sufficier * to cause enough differ
ence in the diffusion to leave the question unsettled. The
amount passing the partition of the open voltameter was as
often greater as it was less than that of the closed voltameter.
It was now evidently necessary to test one and the same gold-
leaf partition for diffusion with circuit open and closed suc
cessively. This leads to the third method shown in Table III.
   It is thought that this is entirely free from objection or
serious error, and leads to the conclusion that the current
does not sensibly affect the diffusion of CuS04 and H2S04

              Thin Meted Partition in a Voltameter.            291
through the gold-leaf partition. This method, in detail, was
to set up two sinrlar voltameters at the same time, leaving
both open, and making quantitative analyses at stated in
tervals ; then, closing the current on both in series, to again
make quantitative analyses of the solution on the kathode
side and weigh the Cu on the kathodes : finally to break the
circuit and again repeat the analyses.
    Curves plotted from these results show no break nor change of
slope for the intervals during which the current was passing.
 In the foregoing experiments there was no deposit of Ou on the
gold-leaf partition provided the current was loss than about
0*3 of an ampere. The time-curves for the two specimens of
gold-leaf aie not identical, showing a different rate of diffusion,
 but are quite similar in shape.
    Using a Cu anode there was no visible gas on the anode,
 but the anode was dissolved by the current in the usual
 manner. Using a platinum kathode and a platinum anode,
there was, of course, an escape of gas from the anode pro
 portional to the current-strength.
    Gas always escaped from the Pt kathode, proportionally but
 less as the amount of Cu deposited increased. In the case
 where the partition was removed and the solutions thoroughly
 mixed there was no gas, but the full amount of Cu deposited
 on the kathode.
    Thus it seems that the passage of the current in such a
 voltameter is not accomplished by the passage of the Cu
 through the gold-leaf partition. Some of the CuS04 passes
 the partition by diffusion, and then does its proportional part
 of the conduction of the mixed solution of Cu804 and H2804,
 which accounts for the increased percentage of Cu deposited
 on the kathode as the interval from the time the voltameter
 was filled increases.
    In the time-curves which may be constructed from Table III.
 (PI. IV. fig. 2) it will be noticed that the amount of Cu at the
 end of the first interval seems too small, causing a similar bend
 in both curves. This is doubtless due to the fact that the
 current was not continued long enough to deposit all the Cu
 in the 10 cub. cent, sample. The amount of CuS04 present
 being very small, it would be deposited very slowly ; and tho
 circuit should have remained closed several hours instead of
 less than an hour, as was the case. A similar bend occurs in
 both curves, because the specimens were analysed in series
 and the same defect applies to both alike. If the current
 was increased beyond about 0*3 ampere, with CuS04 and
 HjSO, as the solutions, separated by a gold-leaf partition,
 there was development of gas and Cu on the partition. This

 292         Mr. J. Daniel on the Polarization upon a
 brings us to the second problem, i. e. :—The minimum
 current-strength at which the ions are deposited visibly on the
 gold-leaf partition for various electrolytes.
              Critical Current-Density for Gold-leaf.
     This part of the investigation consists simply in closing the
 circuit on the voltameter with a high auxiliary resistance,
 gradually and slowly increasing the current by decreasing
 the resistance, and observing at what current-strength bubbles
 of gas or deposit of metal begin to appear upon the partition.
 Table IV. shows these values for various solutions used as
 electrolytes, with a gold-leaf partition. Table V. gives the
 results in 30 per cent. H2S04 for aluminium-leaf, platinum-
 leaf, and gold-leaf respectively.
    Table V. shows the same for a gold-leaf partition in HsS04
of various concentrations from 100 per cent. (?) to 0*5 per cent.
    Unfortunately, the importance of the concentration of the
solution in affecting the value of the "critical current" was
not noted until after several of the solutions had been tested
and thrown away without measuring their concentration or
specific gravity, which is therefore not given for those cases.
The specific gravity of those solutions for which it is given
was determined by a very sensitive and accurate set of hydro
meters reading directly to 0*001. Table V. gives the case of
30 per cent. HsS04 with Pt partitions of various thicknesses ;
also of a " thick " Pt partition perforated with 1, 2, 3, and 4
holes successively, each 0-5 millim. in diameter. This is
important as showing that the very small holes which may
have existed in the carefully selected gold leaves used as
partitions could not have had much, if even a sensible,
influence on the value of the critical current.
    Table VI. shows the interesting case of a 0*02 millim.
palladium partition in 30 per cent. HgS04.
    The values given in the Tables are in most cases the mean
of several determinations which differed but slightly.
    The importance of having the edges of the partition covered
well up to the edge of the hole in the glass was emphasized
in this work on account of the fact that the anode was usually
placed on one side, and sometimes even at the back of the
inner vessel, instead of in front, in order not to obscure a free
inspection of the partition, and to avoid the disturbance of
the gas escaping from the anode, as this was considerable
with the strongest currents used, i. e. ten to twelve amperes.
Thus one edge of the exposed partition being nearer to the
anode than the opening, the deposit would always begin first
on the nearest edge.

               Thin Metal Partition in a Voltameter.        293
   Inspection of the Tables will show that in 30 per cent.
H2S04 the gold-leaf partition will pass about ten amperes
before gases are developed upon it.          Platinum-leaf and
aluminium-leaf showed sensibly the same " critical current,"
rather less for the aluminium, which was, however, thicker
though not so free from hole3.
   A solution of Cdl2 showed regular deposit of both Cd and
I upon the partition for the weakest current to O'OOl ampere.
This case was peculiar in having both ions solids and indicated
as a consequence that neither would pass through the gold-
leaf partition.
   Using 9 per cent. AgN03 solution, Ag202 was deposited
on the anode, but this came about by secondary action at
the anode ; and though we have in this case also two solids
deposited on the electrodes as the result of the electrolysis,
one of them is not primarily a solid, and the critical current
is of the order of magnitude of that for other metallic salts.
A similar case was found in that of MnS04 solution, where
Hn02 was deposited on the anode.
   A solution of lead acetate gave Pb02 on the anode, but
showed a very low " critical current."
    An interesting fact is the dependence of the " critical cur
rent " upon the concentration of the electrolyte, as shown in
Table V., indicating that the " critical current " is propor
tional to the conductivity of the electrolyte. I have made
some experiments to determine whether variation of the tem
 perature has the same effect upon the "critical current" as
 upon the conductivity, though the results are as yet hardly
 sufficient to justify a conclusion. I have been entirely unable
 anywhere to get a series of platinum partitions of thicknesses
 suitable to repeat the quantitative measurements of polariza
 tion which were made in Berlin for the gold plates. Table VI.
 for 0-02 millim. palladium is interesting. Either gold, pla
 tinum, or aluminium as thick as this behaves like a very thick
 plate, i. e. shows gas at once in amount corresponding to the
 current-strength. When first set up, the O02 millim. pal
 ladium partition showed a "critical current" of 0-08 ampere.
 After considerable use the "critical current" has gradually,
 though not slowly, increased to 0"3 in 30 per cent. H2S04.
 This seems to bo quite distinct from the well-known property
 of palladium of occluding gases, especially H ; for this plate
 will pass 0"2 ampere or more for hours without showing gas,
 and develops gas at once for a little stronger current. The
 gas on the partition of palladium will cease to escape if the
 current be again reduced below the " critical " value. Cur
 rents of several amperes have several times been passed

294            Mr. J. Daniel on the Polarization upon a
through this partition, developing profuse gas, and it was
thought probable that the palladium was being dissolved by
the 30 per cent. H3S04 under the action of the current.
Accordingly a test of the solution was made for palladium
by adding ammonia till alkaline, and then adding ammonium
sulphide, which gave no indication of the presence of pal
ladium.
   It has been observed that Pt is perfectly constant, showing
the same " critical current " as often as tested. Gold is
oxidized the first time the "critical current" is attained, and
its value decreases on repeating the test (with the same
specimen).
   Efforts were made to test the critical currents for four
thicknesses of gold from O0004 to 0*0018 millim., in am
monium nitrate, hoping that this would not oxidize the gold ;
but the partitions were oxidized by currents strong enough to
develop gas.

     A new specimen of the same palladium is being tested and
 is showing the same phenomenon of increase of the critical
 current. This last specimen was carefully selected and has
 no holes. Its critical current at first was 0"016 ; after some
 use it is now 0"043.
     I have begun to use a solution of sodium acetate with the
 hope that it will not oxidize the gold. I can already say that
 it is at least very much less active than sulphuric acid ; it also
 shows a decided temperature coefficient for the critical current.
 This part of the investigation will be resumed when oppor
 tunity offers.

                      Note added April 15, 1893.
     More satisfactory specimens of palladium have not yet been
 obtained, so the matter is left for the present with the seem
 ingly anomalous results recorded above as I find in my
 note-book.
    As regards the temperature coefficient of the " critical
current-density," I requested Mr. R. W. Clawson, a student
in the laboratory, to make some measurements which are
tabulated below.
    It may be well to state that the method of observation, that
of observing the first appearance of visible gas, is not very
sensitive, because this development of gas on thin partitions
is not quite sudden and sharply defined, but begins gradually,
especially with very thin partitions. The probable error of

               Thin Metal Partition in a Voltameter.             299
 a reading is, however, not more than 5 per cent., I think.
 Only " XX " gold-leaf has been used in a solution of sodium
 acetate. The method was to set up the voltameter with gold-
 leaf partition, close the circuit, and run the current up till
 the "critical current-density" was reached. Current and
 temperature were recorded, the current slightly reduced and
 allowed to pass till the temperature had risen, say 5 degrees,
 when the current was again increased to the " critical "
 value for this new temperature. The limit was reached at
 about 45 degrees C, when the sealing-wax softened. Since
 both " critical current-density" and conductivity of the electro
 lyte increase with temperature, effort was made to learn
 whether both these quantities have the same temperature co
 efficient by raising the current just to the critical value, and
 without altering the outside resistance to observe if the
 increasing current, due to increasing conductivity of the
 electrolyte, just sufficed to maintain an incipient escape of
 gas at the partition. In every case the gas soon ceased to
 escape on being left alone after adjusting the current to a
given temperature, requiring always some reduction of the
outside resistance to regain the critical current for the higher
temperature. A quantitative correction for the temperature
coefficient of the outside metallic resistance in the circuit
 would probably account for the discrepancy.

 XXV. Calculation of the Coefficient of Self-Induction of a
     Circular Current of given Aperture and Cross-Section. By
    Professor G. M. Minchin, ALA*
 LET ACB (fig. 1) represent a circular wire in which a
         current of strength i is circulating ; let 0 be its centre
 and OV its axis (perpendicular to its plane) ; let P be any
 point in space and through P describe a circle, PQ, parallel
  to the plane of the current, its centre being V on the axis.
 It is required to calculate the normal flux of magnetic force
 passing through the circle PQ. If VP = jt, and the vector
 potential of the current at P is G (this latter being, of course,

perpendicular to VP and parallel to the plane of the current),
the component, Z, of the magnetic force at P parallel to OV
is given by the expression
                                                              (1)

(See my paper on the " Magnetic Field of a Circular

                            z=l djGx)

The function Gr . x is the same as Stokes's current function
which exists for fluid motion which is symmetrical about an
axis. (See Basset's ' Hydrodynamics/ vol. i. p. 12.)
                              Fig. 1.
                              Fig. 2.
   Taking a circular strip of radius x and breadth dx at P,
the flux of force through the strip is 2ir7ixdx, i. e.,
                          9d(Gx)

 Hence, integrating this from x = 0 to # = VP, we find that
 the total normal flux through the circle PQ is the value of
                             27rG*                             (3)

 302       Prof. Minchin on the Coefficient of Self-induction
of the wire is a (as in my paper on the " Magnetic Field close
to the Surface of a Wire conveying an Electrical Current,"
Phil. Mag. August 1893).
    Then we shall calculate the total normalflux offorce through
any surface which is intersected once in the. positive direction by
 every tube offorce emanating from the given current.
    This quantity, divided by the current-strength, is the co
efficient of self-induction of the current. Taking the general
case, viz., that in which the current-density at every point in
the cross-section of the wire varies inversely as the distance
of this point from the axis OV—we have found (Phil. Mag.
  bid. p. 218) that at any point, P, close to the wire

                        1  rT /3c3     m2N     TO*   15c2
                  -cos2^{L^+ia-^-^}]}.(4)
where m = PD, </> = /. PDA, L = log, — .
    The -surface through which we shall take the flux of force
is that which is represented in section by BJEOFKA, i.e., a
surface consisting of the upper half portion of the anchor-
ring formed by the wire and of its central aperture (which
latter is a circle whose diameter is FE). Obviously this
surface is intersected by all the tubes of force. Any surface
starting from B and going round to A, i. e., any surface
having the circle of diameter AB for bounding edge, would
do equally well, so far as the above condition is concerned ;
but the calculation is simpler for the first.
    The flux through the aperture FE is, then, the value of
27rG . x at E, which is obtained by putting m = c, <j>=0 in the
above.
    Thus the flux through the aperture is
    To calculate the normal flux through the upper half of the
anchor-ring, we must take the value of the magnetic potential,
ft, at any point close to the ring. This is the resultant conical
angle subtended by the circuit at the point, multiplied by i ;
and it is therefore (Phil. Mag. ibid. p. 213) given by the
equation

         of a Circular Current of given Aperture Sfc.              303
                    -{(6L-5K + c2+^}sin2</»]}. .(6)
    Now the normal force at any point on the anchor-ring is the
value of — t— with m=zc : it is therefore
              am

    If P is any point on the anchor-ring, the distance of P
from OVis a— ecus if), and the area of a narrow circular strip
of the ring parallel to the plane of the aperture of the ring is
*2ir(a — c cos <f>) .cd(f> ; and this multiplied by (7) is the normal
flux of force through the strip. Integrating the product from
<f> = 0 to =           we get the flux through the whole of the
upper half of the ring. The result is simply
               ^'C^L— jjj* (a — c cos</>) sin <j:d<f>,
the second term in (7) being neglected because it gives a
term of the third order. ' Thus this part of the flux is
                                W(L~).                             (8)
Adding this to (5), we have the whole flux sought, divided
by i, equal to
        7r(4a(L-2) + 2(-(L-J)-Ig-(2L+19)},                      .  (9)
where L=log„y.               This, then, is the Coefficient of Self-
induction. If in this expression a and c are taken in centi
metres, the result is the coefficient measured in absolute units;
and if this is divided by 109, we have the coefficient of self-
induction in secohms.
    Thus, for example, a circular current running in a wire the
diameter of whose cross-section is 2 millim., while the diameter
of its central filament is 2 centim., has a coefficient of self-
                                                    59*207

                                                      10"
and if the dimensions of the cross-section were neglected, this
number would be 58-866.
    Clerk Maxwell (Elec. and Mag. vol. ii. art. 704) gives the

 304                       M. P. Rudski on the
 coefficient of self-induction as 4ira(L— 2), which agrees with
 (9) in the principal term.
      In the same way we may find the coefficient for a super
 ficial current in the wire. For (Phil. Mag. ibid.) if q is the
 total quantity of the superficial current, we have the value of
 Gtx at E equal to
             2?[a(L-2)-|(2L-l)+i£(L + ^)],
 while from the value of the potential we find the normal flux
 of force through the upper half of the anchor-ring equal to
                               2iryc(2L + l).
 Hence the Coefficient of Self-induction is
           7r|4a(L-2)+2c(L + |) + I^(4L+ll)},                 . (10)
which is somewhat greater than the value (9) for a steady
current.

IT has been advanced by Helmholtzf that the contraction
        of the sun may be the principal source of the energy of
that celestial body. He seems to believe that the temperature
of a radiating and contracting sun may be rising. On the
other hand, Lord Kelvin} esteems such a behaviour highly
improbable.
     A. Ritter§ states a theorem, that the temperature of a
gaseous celestial body when emitting heat must be rising.
But this theorem is based on the supposition that the body is
in an adiabatic state, contrary to the other supposition that it
is losing heat. Mr. Lane || has obtained similar results, but
the method he has arrived at is unknown to me.
     My purpose is to illustrate the assertion of Lord Kelvin,
and to define in a certain manner the meaning of the word
contraction in the special case which we are considering.
     Consider, first, a small body, such as we are observing on

the surface of the earth—rigid, fluid, or gaseous. Suppose it
uninfluenced by external forces, take the temperature and
the volumes as independent parameters but suppose them to be
functions of the time. We write the known equation
                  dQ_BQ dv BQ dT                                 .
                   dt ~ Bt> " dt + BT * dt '     • ' ' ' <¦ ;
   where Q, as usual, denotes the heat received from without,

      „ t           „        „      time.
From (I.) we deduce
                            <*Q_BQ dv
                      dT     dt   dt> 'dt

                                 BT
   Daily experience tells us that the right member of (II.) has
always the sign of        i. e.    has the sign of ^«
   There is no doubt that mutual gravitation performs work
on the smallest body when it is changing its volume, hence
we can admit only two cases :—
   (1) The law that ~ has the sign of           is quite general
and applicable to the celestial bodies.
   (2) The law that ~ has the same sign as ^ holds only
for small bodies, because the work of gravitation is so small
that the heat generated by these forces may be neglected.
   The first case suggests no discussion. For the second take
the converted heat into account. Instead of (I.) we have now
      d<Z^W_(-dQ,y[\dv ,/BQ ,BV\dT
      dt + dt ~Vb« + %v)dt + \bt *wr)df • (LLL-)
V denotes the potential of gravitation. [The mechanical
equivalent of heat is supposed equal to unity.] But
                           BT    u»
since the potential of gravitation does not depend on tempe
rature, and we see that if
                         dt     3» dt'                     1     ¦>
then the equation (III.) is reduced to (I.), and we have again

306        Dr. G. Gore on Changes of Temperature caused
                            rfQ_BQ dv

                      dt ~       BQ
and the law that       has the sign of ^g- again holds good.
    Consider, now, the meaning of the condition (IV.). Evi
dently the meaning is that the potential of gravitation should
be a continuous explicit function of volume alone. To every
infinitesimal variation of volume corresponds an infinitesimal
variation of the potential. This condition is realized when
the body passes in a continuous manner from one configuration
of mechanically stable equilibrium to another. It is evident
that, when speaking of the contraction of a celestial body, we
mean a" grosso modo " continuous passing from one configura
tion of stable equilibrium to another. Hence, resuming our
reasoning, we may say that the temperature of a celestial
body, uninfluenced by external forces and radiating heat,
must be sinking. But a rain of meteorites (as Lord Kelvin
has suggested) may bring quanta of energy sufficient to
compensate the loss of heat by radiation, because the sun and
a meteorite falling upon it constitute a mechanically unstable
system, and the condition (IV.) is not fulfilled.
XXVII. Changes of Temperature caused by Contact of Liquids
     with Powdered Silica 8fc. By Dr. G. Goke, F.R.S.
IT is already known that the physical properties of the
       surface-layer of molecules of a solid or liquid substance
are in some respects different from those of the molecules
which constitute the inner portion of the mass, and that those
of a very thin film of liquid are not exactly like those of a
large bulk. It is further known that solid substances have
the power of condensing extremely thin films of liquids,
vapours, and atmospheric air upon their surfaces and in their
pores, and that the physical properties of the liquids and
vapours are thereby modified.
    According to Eiicker, the specific electric conductivity of
a film of soap-solution increases as the thickness decreases
 (' Nature,' June 1 and October 2b', 189o, pp. 116, 625). The
superficial film of a liquid is usually very much more viscous
than the interior (Daniell, ' Text-book of Physics,' p. 258).
According to Overbeck, distilled water offers more, and
alcohol less, resistance to the vibrations of a pendulum at its
surface than in the interior of its mass (' Nature,' Feb. 24,
                   * Communicated by the Author.

          by Contact of Liquids with Powdered Silica.        307
1881, pp. 397, 398). Pockels states that the surface of water
has greater solvent power than the mass, and that a thin disk
of camphor partly immersed in a vertical position in water
having the cleanest possible surface is cut through in the
course of a few hours (ibid. March 12, 1891, p. 439). We
know that plates of metal partly immersed in a vertical
position in corrosive liquids are frequently cut through at the
air-contact line : this is often the case with anodes in electro
lysis; and I have observed, whilst electrolytically depositing
pure grey antimony from its solution, the deposit spread from
the cathode over the surface of the liquid as if the surface
 conducted better than the interior of the liquid. Mens-
 brugghe, speaking of the cause of surface-tension and evapo
 ration of liquids, concluded that the molecules of the surface-
 layer of a liquid are farther apart than those of the mass
 (ibid. March 2, 1893, p. 428) ; he also observed that the
 boiling-point of carbon bisulphide contained in the pores of
 finely-divided carbon was higher than that of a mass of the
 free liquid (Phil. Mag. July 1877, p. 43). I have shown that
 when the molecules of a solid or liquid conducting substance
 are separated farther apart by solution or dilution, they
 acquire greater electromotive force due to increased mole
 cular volume ("A Relation of Electromotive Force to
 Equivalent Volume and Molecular Velocity of Substances,"
  Proc. Birm. Phil. Soc. 1892, vol. viii. pp. 63-138).
 J. J. Thomson states that, with saline solutions, in some
  cases the surface-film of the liquid contains more and in
  other cases less salt per unit of volume than the interior ;
  and that permanganate of potassium is removed from its
  aqueous solution by trickling through pure silica (' Applica
  tions of Dynamics to Physics,' pp. 191,192). It has long
  been known that vinegar is to a certain extent separated from
  water by pure quartz sand, and that when potato-brandy is
  filtered through that substance, water passes through first,
  then alcohol, and finally alcohol plus fusel-oil, as unaltered
  liquid (Gmelin's 'Handbook of Chemistry,' vol. i. p. 114).
   Further, in a recent research on the " Decomposition of Liquids
   by Contact with Powdered Silica," I have found that on agi
   tating various aqueous solutions of acids, alkalies, and salts
   with finely precipitated pure silica and allowing the powder to
   subside, the latter substance in many cases abstracts a larger
   proportion of the dissolved compound than it does of the
   water, and in a number of cases less (see Proc. Birm. Phil.
   Soc. 1894, vol. ix. part 1, pp. 1-24), and that in some
   instances it abstracts more than 80 per cent, of the dissolved
   substance.
     It is generally recognized by physicists and chemists that

 308      Dr. Gr. Gore on Changes of Temperature caused
 the surfaces of mutual contact of two different substances (or
 of two masses of the same substance in different physical or
 molecular states) are usually localities of change and trans
 ference of energy. Two such substances can rarely be brought
 into mutual contact without such change occurring, and the
 changes which occur are more or less different in every differ
 ent case. In multitudes of cases the changes are of a chemical
 character, in others they are physical. Volta showed that the
 mere contact of two different metals rendered them electro-
 polar. Many years ago Pouillet {Annates de Chemie, 1822,
 vol. xx. pp. 141-162), also Regnault (Gmelin's 'Handbook
 of Chemistry,' vol. i. p. 300), and recently Meissner ('Nature,'
 Nov. 4, 1886, p. 24), found that when finely divided dry solid
 substances, such as silica, metals, emery, carbon, &c. were
 wetted by liquids, such as water, benzol, or alcohol, which
 have no dissolving or corrosive action upon them, heat is
evolved. Pouillet employed many oxidizable substances.
 Daniell states that when a liquid begins to flow through a dry
tube, heat is evolved ('Text-book of Physics,' p. 284).
    In the present research I have endeavoured to extend our
 knowledge of the thermal phenomena of this subject. The
 following is a sectional sketch and a description of the appa
ratus and method of experimenting.
A is a glass vessel usually containing
50 centim. of the liquid and the bulb
of a sensitive thermometer, and is
supported in a wire ring having three
slender legs. B is a wide glass tube
containing 100 grains of finely pre
cipitated pure and dry silica or other
fine powder. C is a narrow glass
tube open at both ends, and loosely
enclosing the stem of the thermo
meter ; it is supported firmly at its
upper end by the clip D, and has
fixed securely upon its lower end a
conical and very smooth piece of
cork which accurately fits the outer
tube.
   Both the glass vessels A and B
are thickly coated with cotton wool.
   The thermometer is capable of di
stinctly indicating a one-hundredth
of a Centigrade degree change of
temperature, and its bulb is sup
ported a quarter of an inch above
the bottom by a small piece of cork.

The apparatus is placed in a situation in which the tempera
ture remains sufficiently uniform, and is entirely surrounded
by a movable screen of cardboard.
   In making an experiment, the powder and liquid were
placed near each other in a covered glass vessel in a sheltered
situation during a period of sixteen hours, in order to acquire
the same temperature. The liquid was then poured into A,
and the powder into B, the cup A placed in position beneath
with the thermometer immersed in the liquid, and the entire
arrangement allowed to stand a sufficient period of time,
usually about half an hour, for the solid and liquid to regain
the same temperature. The outer tube B was then raised so
as to allow the whole of the powder to fall slowly in a thin
annular stream into the liquid. The powder entirely sur
rounded and covered the bulb to a height of one fourth of an
inch above its upper end. If the bulb was not sufficiently
covered by it, the changes of temperature were less owing to
the liquid above being less heated than the powder. The
liquid was not stirred in any instance. The act of pouring
the liquid into A caused a rise of temperature of about 'OS0 C,
but that of pouring the silica into B had no apparent effect.
The maximum rise by contact of the powder and liquid
usually occurred in about three minutes. The powders em
ployed were almost wholly different from those used by
M. Pouillet, and were such as would not oxidize, and had no
recognized chemical action upon the liquid : it is important
also to use powders which do not agglomerate or change by
use.
                         Experiments.
                  Silica with various Liquids.
   In all the following experiments with silica, except thoso
otherwise indicated, the weight of silica employed was 100
grains, the volume of solution was 50 centim., and the pro
portion of dissolved anhydrous substance was 10 per cent, by
weight of the water.
   The silica was thoroughly purified and ignited previous to
each experiment, and was kept in a covered glass vessel
during the cooling until it was used. The proportion of
cyanogen in the cyanide agreed with that of 100 per cent.
KCy; but by evaporating a solution of it to dryness with an
excess of sulphuric acid, the weight of sulphate obtained
indicated a mixture of li'45 per cent. NaCy and 85-55 KCy.

with silica.

   Note "A," exp. 42.—In this case the silica was exposed in an uncovered
vessel to the air during sixteen hours, but this had only a minute influence
upon the amount of rise of temperature (compare with No. 39).
   Remarks.—In every one of the instances of Table I. a rise
of temperature occurred ; as, however, water alone gave a
rise and was used as the solvent in all cases, this circumstance
may explain that uniformity of result. Whilst many of the
solutions gave larger rises than water, quite as many gave
smaller ones ; ana we may regard all those which gave
smaller ones as containing substances which absorbed heat
and diminished the rise, whilst those which gave larger ones
evolved heat and added to the amount of rise produced by
water alone. Probably by further research some substances
may be found which will more than neutralize the temperature-
effect of the wnter and give negative numbers.
   Tho series of results obtained with potassium cyanide in
exps. 52, 53, 54, and 57 show that the magnitude of rise of

           by Contact of Liquids with Powdered Silica fyc.       311
temperature increased with the strength of the solution ; but
those produced by strontium chloride in oxps. 4, 27, and 33
do not appear to afford consistent results : whether this was
due to differences of molecular constitution of the dissolved
substance I have not investigated.
              Influence of Size of the particles of Silica.
   Exp. 59.—With 50 centim. of the 10-per-cent. solution of
potassium cyanide and 100 grains of coarse quartz sand, the
 articles of which averaged about one sixteenth of an inch in
  iameter, the rise of temperature was only "03 0. degree,
whilst that produced by the same w eight of the precipitated
silica was '82 C. degree (see oxp. 57), or 27*3 times as much.
These results indicate a method of ascertaining the average
magnitude of the particles of insoluble powders.

   In each of the following cases, 200 grains of alumina and
50 centim. of 10-per-cent. solutions of the substances were
employed. The alumina was precipitated from a solution of
alum by means of ammonia, then thoroughly washed, and
finally heated to redness, and was very pure.

     The volume of liquid in each case was 50 centim. Washing
 the barium sulphate with a 10-per-cent. solution of ammonia,
 then with water, and finally heating to redness, hardened it.
  In the above experiment (No. 96) it was not washed with
 ammonia.
                   General Remarks and Conclusions.
      It is evident, that as in all cases the formation of a liquid
  film upon the surfaces of the solid particles must have been
  attended by the destruction of an air-film, and the latter
  action was probably accompanied by absorption of heat
  (different in amount with different powders), the observed
  rise of temperature did not represent the whole of the heat
  evolved by contact of the liquid and solid. Consequently it
  is possible that in those cases in which little or no rise of
  temperature was observed, the amount of heat absorbed by
  the liberated air may have been equal to that evolved by the
  uniting liquid.

           by Contact of Liquids with Powdered Silica Sfc.     313
     In all the experiments the formation of a liquid film evolved
  a larger amount of heat than that absorbed by the air-film
  which it displaced.
     The further fact must not be overlooked, that in all these
  experiments there existed a minute source of error which
  could not be avoided, viz., that although each powder em
  ployed appeared to be perfectly wetted in ten or twenty
  seconds, it was not so, but continued to evolve a very small
  quantity of minute bubbles of air after that period. With
  peroxide of iron this action ceased in about half an hour, and
  with silica and alumina it continued during several days ; but
 even in the latter cases it was probably not sufficient to affect
 the general result to an extent of a one-hundredth part.
    As all the observations of maximum rise of temperature
 were compelled to be taken at the moment they occurred,
 viz., in about three minutes after mixing, any amount of heat
 evolved after that period could not be included. Even when
 a separate portion of the powder was thoroughly shaken with
 some of the liquid in a bottle, the bubbles similarly appeared,
 but with coarse white sand they did not occur. Another
 circumstance (which has already been mentioned) is that the
 temperature of the immersed powder was higher than that of
 the liquid above it.
    The general results confirm the conclusion arrived at by
 previous investigators (Pouillet and Meissner), that in all
known cases the contact of a liquid with an insoluble powder
 evolves heat. From the present ones, however, in which
 organic .and oxidizable substances were avoided and only
 water and aqueous solutions were employed, it appears prob
able that (subject to the foregoing considerations), whilst
many dissolved substances evolve heat and add to that pro
duced by the water, a large number absorb heat and subtract
from that effect : with silica nearly half the number of solu
tions evolved less than water alone.
    In all aqueous solutions the change of temperature appears
to be attributable to several causes, viz. :—1st, the union of
the water with the powder ; 2nd, that of the dissolved sub
stance with the powder ; and 3rd, the separation of the film
of air ; and the rise of temperature is reasonably explained
by the general view that a degree of mechanical union takes
place of the powder with the water or with the dissolved
substance, the powder abstracting from the liquid, either some
of the water or of the dissolved substance or of both (see
" Decomposition of Liquids by Contact with Powdered Silica,"
Proc. Birm. Phil. Soc. 1894, vol. ix. pp. 1-24).
   If we compare the order of magnitude of rise of tempera

314      Pr. G. Gore on Changes of Temperature caused
 true with that of amount of dissolved substance abstracted by
the powder (ibid.), we find that the two do not usually vary
 together. This is a result which might be expected if the
amount of change of temperature depends upon all the con
ditions above suggested, and especially as it further depends
in many cases upon heat absorbed by contact of the powder
with the dissolved substance.
    The fact that the portion of dissolved substance which
unites with the powder is entirely removable by washing with
water proves the reversibility of the action, and that the
phenomena are essentially the same as those of chemical un'on
 and separation in reversible cases (ibid.). The substitut:on
 also of a film of water or solution for o'-e of air in contact
 with the powder must obey the same general laws as that of
 substitution in recognized chemical actions. And we may
 further reasonably infer that whilst the union of the water or
 of the dissolved substance with the powder is usually attended
 by evolution of beat, the separation of the film of air from
 the powder is frequently accompanied by abso-ption of heat.
    As the action is purely a surface one, and the amount of
 rise of temperature increases with that of immersed solid
 surface, it is essentially the same whether the amount of sur
 face is obtained by means of largo particles or small ones.
    As the union of the water or the dissolved substance with
 the powder is attended by loss of molecular energy, the action
 must be due to both of the touching substances, and must
 obey the law of equality of action and reaction, a portion of
 the molecular motion of each substance being neutralized and
 changed into heat, and the molecules of the liquid which have
 los* motion must remain nearer to the solid, or, in ordinary
 terms, " adhering" to it. The amount of* heat set free by the
 "adhesion " of the liquid to the solid is probably dependent
 both upon the mass and the loss of velocity of the " adhering"
 molecules. As nearly the whole of the change of temperature
 caused by the " adhesion " occurred in a few minutes, the
 mutual loss of molecular energy by the two substances must
 have quickly ceased. After the evolution of heat has ceased
 there remain permanent changes of superficial molecular state
 and a new condition of balance between the different seta of
 molecu'es present, until by washing and subsequent heating
 the powder is restored to its original state.
     The reversibility of the action, and the new state of mole
  cular balance intervening between the evolution of heat by
  wetting the powder and the absorption of heat by drying it,
  is analogous to cases of reversible chemical union, to the
  sudden electric chargo of two different metals by mere con

         by Contact of Liquids with Poiodered Silica fyc.    315
 tact, the ensuing state of steady charge and the subsequent
 discharge ; and may be further compared with the effects of
 approach and withdrawal of magnets and their armatures,
 and with the commencement and cessation of electric currents
by magnetoelectric and dynamoelectric induction. All these
five actions are reversible ones, attended by molecular change,
disturbance of the aether, and transference of radiant energy
at the moments of commencement and termination, with a
new state of molecular balance but no external dynamical
effect during the intervening statical period, and by an
undoing of the first dynamical effect by the second one in
each class of cases. They are all evidently based upon similar
mechanical principles of molecular motion.
   As the quantity of heat evolved per given weight of
potassium cyanide in experiments 52, 53, 54, 57 was larger
t^e more dilute the solution, the amount of loss of velocity,
and the actual velocity of the molecules of that salt were
greater the more dilute the solution. The latter conclusion
agrees with the observation that the voltaic electromotive
force of a dissolved substance is usually increased by dilution
 (see " A General Relation of Electromotive Force to Equiva
lent Volume and Molecular Velocity of Substances," Proc.
Birm. Phil. Soc. 1892, \ol. viii. pp. 63-138).
   In proportion as the amount of heat evolved is greater, the
degree of " adhesion " is stronger and partakes more of the
character of ordinary chemical union. Each particle of the
powder "adheres" both to the solvent and to the dissolved
substance probably in all cases, but in each case apparently
in different proportions (ibid. 1894, vol. ix. pp. 1-24). If the
powder " adheres " to a larger proportion of the dissolved
substance than it does to that of the solvent, the " adhering "
film of liquid is a more concentrated solution than the re
mainder, but if it " p.dheres " to a smaller one the opposite
effect occurs ; but in either case chemical analysis of the
separate portion of liquid reveals the change and affords
data for comparison with the alterations of temperature, total
amount of heal., &c.
   The easily formed anticipation that the amount of rise of
temperature produced by a given weight of silica increased
with the degree of smallness of the particles was verified by
actual experiment. Thus the rise produced by 100 grains
weight, consisting of 1037 particles of coarse sand, by im
mersion in 50 centim. of a 10-per-cent. solution of potassium
cyanide, was only "03 C. degree, whilst that produced by the
same weight of the finest precipitated silica, after washing
and heating to redness, was "82 0. degree (see Experiments

316         Dr. G. J. Stoney on the Limits of Vision :
 57 and 59), or 27*3 times as much. If the proportion of in
 crease of temperature to that of surface were known, the
average magnitude of the particles of the finest insoluble
powder might perhaps he calculated.
   The evolution of heat by the mere contact of solids and
liquids which do not in the ordinary meaning of the . term
" chemically unite," must to a minute extent affect the de
termination of the specific heats of insoluble powders by the
method of mixing them with water. And if contraction of
volume follows immediately upon its loss of heat, then the
specific gravities of insoluble powders when arrived at by the
process of weighing them, first in air and then in water, are
probably also slightly influenced.
    The heat produced by the mere contact of insoluble solids
such as silica, alumina, &c. with water and aqueous solutions
of salts, may account for that produced by spring-water, sea-
water, mineral-water, &c, filtering through geo'ogical strata,
and for that developed in other cases of underground tem
perature where ordinary chemical action is absent.

     HE President of the British Association, at the recent
T       meeting of that body in Nottingham, mentioned in his
opening address that the image formed by the compound eye
of an insect had been photographed. This suggests the
inquiry how the image is formed, and what is the limit of the
vision of which it is the physical basis. The investigation of
this point shows that insects cannot see very minute objects,
and the whole inquiry seemed of sufficient interest to be laid
before the Royal Dublin Society, especially as it suggests
much further study which the author could not attempt, but
which there are other members of the Society most competent
to undertake.
   • From the ' Scientific Proceeding ' of the Royal Dublin Society of
the 20th December, 1893. Communicated by the Author.

         with Special Reference to the Vision of Insects.            317
                Section I.— Of Vision in general.
   As preliminary to the inquiry it is well to consider what
are the causes that limit the amount of detail that can be seen
by the instrumentality of eyes such as our own, the kind of
eyes of which we know most. Tbat tlere is such a limit to
human vision may be easily seen by placing a well-illuminated
ruling of parallel lines at different
distances from the eye of a person                        -Fig. 1.
whose vision is good. Let us suppose
black lines ruled, as in fig. 1, on a
white surface at intervals of one
millimetre from the middle of one
line to the middle of the next. If
an observer with keen vision views
these from a distance of eleven or
twelve feet, he is able barely to make
out that they are a ruling ; beyond
that distance, they seem one uniform               Millimetric Ruling.
grey surface, while from stations
nearer to them he perceives the individual lines distinctly.
Now, at a distance of eleven feet a millimetre subtends an
angle of V (one minute) . Hence we learn from observation
that in order that two objects may be seen as two, they must,
at least, subtend an angle of about 1' at the eye. If they
subtend a less angle than this they are seen as one object.
    Now there are three distinct causes, any one of which is by
 itself competent to put a limit of this kind to our power of
 distinguishing minute objects ; and in persons with the best
 vision each of these three seems to put nearly the same limit
 as the other two. Th;s adjustment between them is, no doubt,
 the result of development, since any further improvement on
 the lines of any one of these causes would bo useless, unless it
 were accompanied by a simultaneous improvement in both
 the others.
    One cause is the spacing of the cones that occupy the
fovea lutea, into the small area of which about 7000 are
 packed. The fovea lutea is that spot in the retina which
 furnishes us with the exceptionally distinct vision which we
 have in the middle of the field of view. The cones are here
 without accompanying rods, and are at intervals of about 4/4 *,
 measuring from the middle of one to the middle of the next.
 This interval is about half the diameter of the red corpuscles
    * The micron p is the millionth part of a metre. This is the same
 as the thousandth of a millimetre, or the l/.'oiOOth of an inch.

 318          Dr. G. J. Stoney on the Limits of Vision:
 of human blood, an object familiar to every microscope-
 observer. Again, the " optical centre " * of the eye lies a
  centimetre and a half in front of this part of the retina ;
  and at this distance the interval between adjoining cones sub
  tends an angle of nearly 1'. Hence, in order that the images
 of two points of light may fall on the corresponding parts
 of different cones, their distance asunder must subtend an
 angle of, or exceeding, 1' at the optical centre of the eyes ;
 in other words, the interval between the objects in external
 nature that are being examined must subtend this angle at
 the eye. Thus we fail to see with the unassisted eye much
 detail which is :evealed to us by the microscope. This happens
 if at a distance of ten inches, the distance of most distinct
 vision, the intervals at which those objects are spaced subterd
 an angle of less than 1'. Such objects iray, however, be seen
 with optical aid, provided it is such that the little interval
 subtends an angle exceeding 1' at the optical centre t of the
 object-lens used in the microscope, a point which, with the
 higher powers of the instrument, lies ciose to the object on
 the stage. But beyond this limit, and therefore beyond the
 reach of the microscope, there are still worlds of events in
nature which we can never see, although we may infer the
 existence of some of them in other ways.
    We have found that the spacing of the cones in the fovea
 lutea is competent to put a limit to the minuteness of the
 detail that can be seen with the naked eye. Now, the small
 s:ze of the pupil of the eye also, and independently, determines
sveh a limit. Astronomers are familiar with the fact that
the image of a star (which is virtually the image of a point
of light, since no telescope is competent to show the truo disk
   * From each point of a visible object a cone of rays, starting from that
point as its apex, falls on the pupil. In passing through the eye this cone
of rays is made to converge, and finally becomes a cone of rays advancing
towards that point of the retina where the image is formed. The apex
of the second cone is accordingly at this point. Most of the rays of the
first cone are bent in passing through the cornea and optic lens, ard
advance in a new direction in the second cone. But there is one among
them, which, in the second cone, continues in the same direction, or at
least parallel to the direction which it had in the first cone. This ray is
called the undeviated ray. It is easily seen that there is one such ray in
the light coming from each point of the object. Now all the undeviated
rays very nearly pass through a certain point which is situated close
behind the optic lens, and 1 £ centimetre in front of the middle of the
retina. This is the point which is called the " optical centre " o" the eye.
   t The optical centre of the object-lens of a microscope is the point
where the "undeviated rays'' cross (see last footnote). In compound
microscopes this point lies in or in front of the object-lens, and with high
powers is close to tho object.

           with Special Reference to the Vision of Insects.             319
of a star) consists of a small round central patch called the
spurious disk, surrounded by coloured rings which very
rapidly fall off in brightness. This phenomenon is due to
the interference of the light coming from the two halves of
the object-lens, and is susceptible of mathematical treatment.
It thus appears that the angular radius of the first dark ring,
estimated from the middle of the object-lens, is
                              0=(1'22)|,
where \ is the wave-length of the light, and A the aperture,
i. e. diameter, of the object-lens. This furnishes a boundary
 within which the central spurious disk lies, and up to which
 its faintest outlying portion barely extends. It also fixes the
 minimum visibile with that aperture, since two points would
 have begun to be blurred into one another if so close that the
 middle of the spurious disk of each lay on the first dark ring
 of the other. Let us then put into this formula, 0 = 1'= "00021)
in circular mef suro (this is the limit already fixed by the rods
and cones), and\='6 of a micron (which is the wave-length
 of yellow light). We thus find
                           •00029 = (1-22) |
 whence A =2524 microns, which is very nearly -fa of an
 inch. This, then, is the diameter of the pupil of the eye
 when of such size as to put the same limit on the visibility of
 small objects as the rods and cones do. Now, this is about
 the size to which the pupil of the eye shrinks when we
 scrutinize well-illuminated objects, and is the smallest to which
 it can be allowed to shrink without interfering with the vision
 of minute detail, by placing a further restriction beyond that
 imposed by the layer of rods and cones*.
     Again, the eye viewed as an optical instrument is far from
 perfect. Its chromatic defect may be detected by placing
 the finger horizontally in front of the eye, and looking just
 over it at the bar of a window. In this way the window-bar
 is viewed through the upper half of the pupil, and is then seen
    * It might be thought that with the more dilated pupil which we have
 in faint light, we could see more detail. But the reverse is the case ;
 for instance, the two small double stars <, and f2 Lyrce are more than 3'
 asunder, and yet, in consequence of their faintness, are nearly at the limit
 of what a very good eye can see distiuctly as two objects. To eyes that
 are fairly good they appear as one object elongated, while persons may
 have tolerably good sight and not even see the elongation.

   320            Dr. Gr. J. Stoney on tlw Limits of Vision :
   to be bordered with colour. Finally, the spherical aberration*
   of the eyes becomes conspicuous when we view a considerable
   star or planet with one eye. Instead of being seen as a point,
  it is seen as a small irregular patch with short tails from it,
  and of somewhat different shape according as it is viewed with
  the right or with the left eye. Now this is due to spherical aber
   ration co-operating with another defect which it is difficult to
  disentangle from spherical aberration, and which is caused by
   the light having to pass through the other layers of the retina
  before reaching the rods and cones. These layers, however,
  do little harm in the fovea hitea, as here they are either
  absent or thin, so that the irregular image seen when we look
  directly at a planet is chiefly due to pure spherical aberration.
      Now these defects, viz. the chromatic and spherical aberra
  tions, including under the latter that further defect which
  arises while the light is crossing the retina, are dealt with in
  nature in the same way in which a photographer deals with
  them in his photographic camera, viz. by limiting the aperture,
  which diminishes the effect of these imperfections. We have
  already found that the aperture of the pupil is contracted
  as much as is compatible with the other conditions to be
  fulfilled. Now it is evident that a certain amount of the
  defects with which we are at present dealing, especially when
  rendered less operative by the limited aperture of the pupil,
  may be allowed to remain in the eye without rendering it
 incapable of distinguishing objects separated by 1' of angle,
 the limit already fixed by the rods and cones ; and there can
 evidently be no tendency in evolution to effect any further
 improvement of the eye as an optical instrument. Accord
 ingly, in persons with the best vision, the eye seems to have
 been just improved up to this point, leaving its outstanding
 defects still very conspicuous when searched for; and it is
 shortcoming in respect to these defects which is chiefly what
 makes one man's eyesight less perfect than another's.
     We shall next deal with another preliminary remark,
which it is well to make, as it will dispel the oft-repeated
error that there ought to be some connexion between our
vision and the position of the image formed on the retina.
It is pertinent to point this out when engaged in inquiring
into the vision of insects, for, as we shall see presently, the
    * If a sphere be drawn round a point of the image formed by light of
one wave-length, to represent the crest of one of the luminous waves
advancing towards that point, the whole of the crest should reach that
sphere at the same instant of time. There are, however, usually little
deviations of some parts of the crest of the wave from this sphere, which
defect is called spherical aberration.

         with Special Reference to the Vision of Insects.    321
image formed by compound eyes is erect, while that formed
by single eyes, such as ours, is inverted. Neither position,
however, nor a sideward position, nor any other, would
be incompatible with our seeing the objects of the world
around us exactly as we now do. For the direct physical
adjunct of a visual perception in our mind of a point of
the object, is not any event in the eye or along the optic
nerve but in a more deep-seated part of the brain, probably
in its occipital lobes which lie in the back of the head, over
the cerebellum. Now (speaking from the physical stand
point) the way in which this event in the occipital lobe is
usually evoked is by light from the point of the object being
guided through the eye to one of the rods or cones, after
which some event travels along one of those nervelets with
attendant nerve-cells which penetrate the retinal layer from
the expansion of the optic nerve, and each of which is asso
ciated with one individual rod or cone. This is succeeded
by some event along one fibril of the optic nerve, after, which
there seem to follow other events within the brain, which
finally lead up to that particular event which, and which
alone, is the true physical adjunct of the visual perception in
 our mind—our perception of that point of the object from
 which the light set out to enter the eye. I, for convenience,
 speak of this event as situated in the occipital lobe, although
its location can hardly bo said to be ascertained.
    Now it is evident that the image on the retina is only one
 link in this long chain of physical causes and effects, and
 that the image might be erect as it is in the compound eyes
 of insects, or inverted as in our eyes, or might have any other
 orientation, and that nevertheless the positions of the rod or
 cone, nervelet, fibril of optic nerve, &c, could be so disposed
 as to produce precisely the same final event within the occipital
 lobe of the brain, as now occurs. Now it is this last alone
 which is essential, the others being only instrumental in
 bringing it about: it alone is the true physical adjunct of
 the visual perception which becomes part of the mind.
    Again, although the train of causes and effects described
 above is the usual process by which this adjunct of percep
 tion is evoked, it is not by any means the only way in which
 it can be brought about, as is conspicuously manifested by
 dreams, and may be detected by a careful introspective study
 of the memory of visual perceptions. I am of opinion that
 in all cases, when remembering a past scene, there is some dim,
 usually a very dim, recurrence of the perception, or of parts
 of it : at all events, under some circumstances, this is dis
 tinctly the case. When, unfortunately, we He awake for

322        Dr. G. J. Stoney on the Limits of Vision i
several hours, especially under the influence of tea or coffee,
until a feeling of weariness and an indisposition to any pro
longed train of consecative thought have come over us, I
have observed that the revival of visual perceptions, when
thinking about past scenes, becomes stronger and is easily
perceived, and that in some cases it may become almost vivid.
In extreme cases it even amounts to a kind of dreaming with
the eyes open—the dream, however, differing from ordinary
dreams by being one the progress of which we can ourselves
di'/ect. It is important to note that these visions are not
based on any affection of the retina, and in this respect differ
wholly from tboLe spectral images wh'ch we see after gazing
for some time at objects which somewaat dazzle the sight.
These latter shift their position wiih every movement of our
eyeballs ; the others retain what we estimate to be their
positions in space, notwithstanding that the eyes be moved
about. Now this is very significant. It shows that the irain
of physical causes which lead up to that event in the posterior
lobe, which is the adjunct of our perception of these visions,
did not originate in the retina, but in a part of the brain
where it could arise in conjunction with some of those events
wh'ch are the physical adjuncts of oar judgments aboat space.
This is an important conclusion to have reached.
   What is probably in reality only a further stage of these
waking dreams is sometimes experienced in fever, when the
patient has been for days without sleep. I myself saw appari
tions in this way, after having been three days without sleep,
those 1 saw having a marvellous appearance of reality, and
being seen in the daylight when I could at the same time see
in the ordinary way the objects about me in the room, except
where one of these novel figures intruded. In these places
the connexion with the retina seems to have been rendered
more or less inoperative, and a visual perception, otherwise
produced, was substituted for the ordinary one.
   Another instructive and more agreeable way of making the
observation is to experiment on ourselves when in that stage
of drowsiness ill which wo seem to have fallen partially asleep,
but not so much so but that we can still voluntarily direct
our thoughts to some well-remembered scene, or, still better,
f rst to one, and afterwards to another. If we repeatedly
seize opportunities of making this experiment, we shall
gradually accumulate instances of every degree of vividness,
from the full distinctness of a dream in respect of colour,
brightness, and form, down to the shadowy dimness of what
 we very imperfectly see in the exercise of ordinary memory.
 The same important observation mav be made here as on a

        with Special Reference to the Vision of Insects.    323
former occasion. The objects so seen do not shift their
positions when we voluntarily move our eyes about. They
have their origin not in the retina, but in immediate connexion
with the part of our brain which is directly related to our
judgments about space.
   Another interesting observation is of what happens when
we get into what is sometimes called a " brown study "—
thinking intently upon some past scene that engrosses our
attention. On such occasions the visual image befo-e " our
mind's eye " becones more vivid than usual, and in the same
degree the image produced in the ordinary way of the external
objects towards which our eyes may chance at the time to be
d:rected becomes less distinct, and, in extreme cases, may
alrrost fade out, so that even noteworthy events may happen
in our presence which we do not see, or at least wnich do not
impress us sufficiently for us to retain any memory of them.
   Two experiences, one of a friend and one of myself, seem
worth recording in this connexion :—
    Some years ago this friend and I rode —he on a bicycle, I
on a tricycle—on an unusually dark night in summer from
 Glendalough to Rathdrum. It was drizzling rain, we had no
lamp:, and the road was overshadowed by trees on both sides,
 between which we could just see the sky-line. I was riding
 slowly and carefully some ten or twenty yards in advance,
 guiding myself by the sky-line, when my machine chanced
 to pass over a piece of tin or something else in the road that
 made a great crash. Presently my companion came up,
 calling to me in great concern. He had seen through the
 gloom my machine upset and me flung from it. The crasli
 had excited the thought of the most likely cause for it, and
 the event in his brain, which was the physical adjunct of the
 thoughts thus passing through his mind, were so associated with
 that other event in the brain, which is the adjunct of visual
 consciousness, that the one (speaking from the physical stand
 point) evoked the other, perhaps faintly. This involved a
 visual perception in the mind faint, but sufficient on this
 occasion to be seen with sufficient distinctness when not over
 powered by objects seen in the ordinary way through the
 eyes.
    The experience I had myself was one which frequently
 occurred to me when a lad. Several of us boys were fond of
 witnessing sham fights in the Phoenix Park, at which some of
 the most conspicuous objects were the single horsemen who
 now and then galloped at full speed, with orders, from one
 part of the field to another. Almost always, after a day spent
 in viewing this spectacle, as I lay in bed at night I saw

 324        Dr. G. J. Stoney on the Limits of Vision :
 vividly what seemed to be a tiny horseman galloping violently
 from right to left, or from left to right, as the case might be.
 All the movements of the horse were reproduced, the dashing
 about of the sabre-tasche, the coloured uniform, the move
 ments of the horseman. It cannot have been in the retina
 that this revival took place. It must have been in a much
 more deep-seated part of the brain.
    It would, I think, be of very great interest to ascertain
 from the inhabitants of a blind asylum, whether those who
 have recently had their retinas extirpated, or rendered func-
tionless, continue to dream of scenery, so long as the memory
 of visual perceptions is recent. I should expect they -would,
 as the structures which they have lost do not seem to be con
cerned in either memory or dreaming.
    From a review of all the evidence it appears clear that the
 retinal image is only one of the stepping-stones in a rather
 long progress from the object in nature to the event in the
 brain which is the direct adjunct of visual perception. Why,
 then, it may be asked, is an image necessary ? Why is it
 never absent ? Why is not something quite different some
times substituted for it ? The following is, I think, a sufficient
answer. There must be some difference in the events occurring
 in the occipital lobe in order that two points of an object may
 be seen distinct from one another. To bring this about either
 a different nervelet must have been acted upon in the organ
 of sight, or the same nervelet must have been differently
 acted on. In the case that actually occurs, it would appear
 that a different nervelet is acted upon when the points of the
 object are sufficiently separated to be seen as two, and that a
 difference of action on the same nervelet is reserved for ex
 hibiting to us variations of brightness and colour, but not of
 position. Now this can manifestly be effected by distributing
 the points of an image of the object over an apparatus such as
 the layer of rods and cones, consisting' of closely packed
 individuals, each of which is capable of acting on its own
 nervelet ; or through an intermediate apparatus, which con
 sists of channels for transmitting light as numerous as the
 rods and cones, each of which conducts the light from a spe
 cific point of the image to its own rod or cone, which latter
may, in this case, bo situated at a distance from the place
where the image is formed. The first of these is the arrange
ment which we find in our own eyes ; the other seems to be
that which we find in the compound eyes of insects. Now it
is doubtful whether any other machinery for bringing about
the result than one or other of these two can be devised.
These, at all events, are the ways in which nature attains the
end ; so that reither man nor nature seems to have found out

        with Special Reference to the Vision of Insects.      325
any other. But the position of the images, whether erect,
inverted, or any other, is obviously immaterial. It is the
ultimate effect within the occipital lobe of the brain that is
alone essential.
         Section II.— Of Vision with Compound Eyes.
   After these preliminary remarks on vision in general, we
seem to be in a position to deal intelligently with the in
quiry—How is the retinal image formed in insects ? and what
kind of vision do they enjoy through the instrumentality of
the compound eyes with which they arc furnished ? These
questions may be most conveniently dealt with by describing
a rough model of an insect's eye. Imagine a hemispherical
shell of some transparent material, e. g., naif of a sixteen-inch
globe of glass, that is, a globe of which the diameter is six
teen inches. Place your eye at its centre, and look through
it at the objects of nature around you. Next, let an accurate
picture of these objects be painted on the outside of the globe,
so that when you place your eye at the centre you still see
the same scene as before. Now let a network of scratches
be made all over the painting, dividing it into patches, each
of which is the size of a square quarter of an inch. This is
about the size of the cross section of a lead-pencil. There
will be about 6400 of these patches on the hemisphere. Next,
let the paint of each patch be removed, and a sing'e dab of
paint substituted, of a tint and brightness which is the re
sultant of the part of the picture wnich fell within the patch.
In this way, a somewhat coarse mosaic is substituted for the
more perfect picture of the external world previously drawn.
This coarse mosaic gives a rough imperfect representation of
the external world, and represents correctly the vision which
an insect has of it. The compound eyes of some insects,
especially insects that attack other insects, have more nume
rous facets than what correspond to 6400 over a hemisphere ;
and in such cases the mosaic is less coarse, and the vision is
proportionately better. Thus the eye of a dragonfly is better
represented by substituting smaller patches, each the size of
a square eighth of an inch. This increases the number over
the hemisphere to 25,000. But there is a somewhat narrow
limit to improvement in this direction, owing to its necessi
tating a diminution of the aperture of the lenses. The way
that nature deals with this difficulty is by increasing inordi
nately the size of the compound eye of the insect out of pro
portion to its other features. In this way the number of the
patches, one of which is formed by each facet, can be
   Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 37. No. 226. March 1894.          Z

326         Dr. G. J. Stoney on the Limits of Vision :
increased without diminishing too much the aperture of the
little lenses.
   With a mosaic such as is described above, the diameter of
each patch subtends about a degree and eight-tenths (1°"8) at
the centre of the hemisphere. Accordingly, the interval be
tween two objects in nature would need to subtend an angle
of about a degree and three-quarters at the insect's eye, to be
distinguishable as two by the insect. Hence, if as far off as
ten inches, the distance at which we see most distinctly, they
would need to be separated by nearly the third of an inch to be
seen by the insect as more than one object ; while, if close to
the insect, only one-tenth of an inch off, the separation would
need to be about the same as that which the human eye is
capable of distinguishing at a distance of ten inches. Thus,
 the insect cannot see more detail upon its own antennae, close
as they are to it, than we can with our naked eye. We
must, therefore, dismiss from our thoughts the mistaken im
pression that insects see very minute objects far beyond
human vision. On the contrary, their vision is imperfect
compared with ours. Still, it is evidently quite enough to
enable a bee to be guided in its search after honey by the
markings upon a flower, or effectually to assist a fly in its
 wanderings about the room, or in sopping up its food.
    We have next to consider how this mosaic is formed. For
this puq>ose let us again turn to our model. Suppose 6400
hollow conical funnels to be pro
vided, each one inch long. Let Fig 2.—The Funnels of an

sphere spoken of above, the larger
ends outwards, and the smaller planted on the middles of the
little patches that were marked out on the hemisphere. The
little lenses will then lie on an outer hemispherical sheet
eighteen inches in diameter.
    Let us fix our attention upon one of the little lenses, and
consider how it operates. The light from distant objects in

the external world would, if not interfered with, form an
inverted image one inch behind this lens, that is, at the dis
tance of the glass hemisphere, which we shall call the primary
surface ; but it is prevented from forming more than ono
patch of that image by the blackened walls of the funnel.
Accordingly, only one tiny patch of the image, one-sixteenth
of an inch across, is actually formed. It is formed by the
light -which passes the whole way down the funnel and,
emerging at its end, falls on the surface of the primary hemi
sphere. Here it produces one little fragment of the inverted
image, the rest of the imago which the lens is competent to
form being extinguished by the blackened walls of the funnel.
In the insect's eye the small portion of the imago that
emerges is, no doubt, a portion of a rather indistinct image,
owing to the very small aperture of the lens ; but neither
this nor its belonging to an inverted image is any detriment,
since all the rays that go to form the little patch are trans
mitted to a single one of the pieces of apparatus in the insect,
corresponding to the rods and cones in our eyes. They,
therefore, can result in only one of the optic nervelets being
affected, and in some one definite way ; in other words, the
whole of the light forming one patch, or rather speck, of the
image can produce only one elementary visual impression in
the insect's mind.
   It will bo observed that the image that is formed resembles
rather a mezzotinto engraving, which consists of separate
specks, than a mosaic which consists of patches of colour
large enough to touch ono another ; and that it differs from
the mezzotinto in that the specks are specks of light, instead
of being, as in the engraving, specks of shade.
   If we endeavour to make out what provision is made in
compound eyes for enabling the insect to accommodate its
vision to varying distances of the object, we find, upon a
scrutiny of the section of such an eye, that the arrangement
appears to be one which gives to an insect the very singular
power of adjusting different parts of its field of view to
different distances, and operates in a remarkably simple way
which may be illustrated upon our model if we add somewhat
to it. For this purpose let a third hemisphere be provided,
concentric with the other two, but smaller —-suppose with a
diameter ten inches across. Let the funnels which have been
spoken of, and which lie between the outer surface and the
primary surface, be made of some extensible material like
indiarubber, their outer ends being fastened to the lenses
and their inner ends to threads of glass the thickness of
thin knitting-needles, and extending, as in fig. 3, from the

primary surface to the inner surface. To make it possible to
do this, the glass hemisphere which we have used to represent
the primary surface may now be removed ; it is no longer
required, since its position is sufficiently indicated by the
points of junction of the indiarubber funnels and the glass
                                      Fig. 3.

threads. The outer surface of our model, which carries the
lenses, should be a stiff immovable arch, but the inner sur
face is to be made of some material which is capable of
slightly contracting. If, after constructing the model in this
way, its inner surface is made to shrink a little*, this will
pull the glass threads inwards and elongate all the india-
rubber cones. In this way the narrow ends of the cones are
brought farthe- from their lenses, iuto tho position where the
image of a near object would be formed. The model now
represents the insect's eye when accommodated for the vision
of near objects.
   In this model the image of the outer world is formed
either at the primary surface or at the inner surface, for a
speck of light falling on the upper end of one of the glass
threads will travel lengthwise along the thread and emerge
from its lower end, being kept from escaping laterally by
   * A diminution of the radius of the inner surface of the model to the
extent of about one millimetre would effect a sufficient range of accom
modation. The motion in the insect's eye may need to be more than in
proportion to this, since the filaments, as" well as the funnels of its eye,
are probably extensible, which is not the case in the model.

total reflexions. Now, it seems probable that something of
this kind actually occurs in the insect's eye. In fact the
apparatus corresponding to the rods and cones of our eyes
seems, so far as I can make out, to be situated, not at the
primary surface where the image is first formed, nor even at
the inner surface where the image may be reproduced in the
way described above, but in a deeper situation with which
the inner surface communicates only through curved trans
parent threadlets. Each of these threadlets seems to have a
thin transparent core, and if this core be of sufficiently highly
refractive material, it would, although curved, be competert
to carry the light forward by total internal reflexions, from
the lower end of one of the glass threads to one of the pieces
of the apparatus which corresponds to the layer of rods and
cones in our eyes*.
    It is, perhaps, worth observing that an eminently useful
adjustment which we cannot effect seems to be possible in an
insect's eye. In fact, the inner surface of our model might
be drawn inwards more at one place than another ; and I am
disposed to think that muscles, acting on the inner surface,
are in the insect so disposed as to make this possible in its
eye. Now this would effect an accommodation to the dis
tances of objects which would differ in the different parts of
ihe field of view f. Moreover, this result may be brought
about in another way. The lenses and the funnels posterior
to them vary in size from one part of the compound eye of a
 dragonfly to another, being largest in the position which I
suppose to be about the middle of the eye, and gradually
 dwirdling to about half this size near the margin t- An
equable contraction of the " inner surface " of such an eye
would obviously effect a different accommodation in different
   * The light is probably carried forward most effectually where, as
in the dragonfly, the cores are less than a micron in section, i. e. not
much more than the wave-lengths of the light that has to traverse them.
Light would adapt itself to the sinuosities of such filaments, like sound
in a speaking-tube.
   t In the sectiojs of the eyes of dragonflies, which I have examined,
the filaments from the funnels down to tho " inner surface " are enclosed
wHhin a sheath of fibres and are straight, but immediately after passing
through the inner surface they aro each apparently enclosed within a
tube, and grouped in bundles, between which are open spaces which
may, perhaps, in the living insrct have been occupied by muscles.
Muscles, in this situation, would be competent to effect the optical ad
justment spoken of in the text. (See fig. 3.)
   % The increased aperture of the lenses towards the middle of a dragon
fly's eye, and the diminished curvature of the stratum in which they lie,
both conduce to make its vision mo.'e perfect towards the middle of its
field of view ; and as this lies in the direction of the insect's flight, the
arrangement must be of advantage to it in its pursuit of prey.

 parts of the field of view. Accordingly, in one or other of
these ways, or by a combination of them both, the insect may
be able to adjust one part of its field of view for near objects,
and other parts for more distant ones ; e. g., a fly may be able
to view distant objects around with the utmost distinctness of
which its eye is capable, at the same time that it is closely
scrutinizing the details of a lump of sugar and applying its
 proboscis rapidly to one minute crystal after another. As
the adjustment which would enable it to do this would be
of service to the insect, and as the construction of its' eye
 admits of it, it seems likely that it is one for which pro
 vision has been actually made.
    On a review of the whole subject we seem to have a satis
factory general insight into the process by which vision
through compound eyes is carried on. Doubtless much de
tailed information of the minute anatomy of these interesting
structures has been reached by microscopic anatomists ; but
I am not acquainted with it, and have been obliged to rely
on my own imperfect observations. It is, however, likely
that, notwithstanding the diligence of microscopists, much
still remains to be explored ; and this, I hope, may be fol
lowed up more intelligently if the general optical process is
understood. It is on this account that I have endeavoured
to trace it out, and especially because among my scientific
friends there are to .be found some of the most competent
persons thoroughly to explore the whole of this interesting
subject.
   I have hitherto said nothing about vision through the
isolated eyes with which insects are also furnished. They
cannot, from the minuteness of their lenses, give them nearly
so good vision of distant objects as man enjoys. And the
limit is very possibly still more restricted by their being
furnished with but a moderate number of rods and cones.
It would be of interest to ascertain by observation whether
this is so, and to collect such data as would enable us to
estimate with tolerable exactness how far the imperfection
goes.
  SNote, added February 21.—It is not obvious why the apparatus of
    a and cones in the human eye is nearly on as small a scale, and as
closely packed over the rest of the retina as in the fovea lutea, since the
amount of detail we can see in the corresponding parts of the field of
view is immensely less. Possibly the line of the embryonic development
of this layer may be such that it could not be evolved of the requisite
minuteness in one part, without being made nearly as minute over the
whole. The only other possible explanation seems to be that its bein<r
minute serves some other unknown purpose, as well as removing one of
the three obstacles to our vision of small details.]

Theorie der Optisehen Instruments nach Abbe. Von Dr. Siegfeied

TTHE subject of Geometrical Optics might with advantage be de-
*• fined so as to include all those parts of the theory of light and
optical instruments which can be treated by geoiretrical and formal
considerations, without detailed discussion of dyna.nical questions.
In strictness, of course, the Theory of Light is a branch of Dynamics ;
but it is rather striking how completely the subject divides itself
into two distinct regions. The practically important part involves
but very slight recourse to dynamical treatment, while the specu
lative part is almost wholly concerned with dynamical questions.
The title of Geometrical Optics to separate existence rests on
this fact ; but it ma}r fairly be urged that, in opposition to the
usual practice, the greater part of the subject of Diffraction and
Interference of light should be assigned to this branch of the
theory, on account both of its geometrical character and of its
importance for the working of optical instrumerts.
    As ordinarily developed, the subject is a branch of Geometry
which is concerned with the reflexion and refraction of rays of light.
But if it is severed too much from the practical applications that
gave it birth, there is perhaps no department of mathematics
that can be made so repulsive. In matters of Pure Mathematics
the natural mode of progress is to adhere closely to the track of
symmetry and elegance ; and there is no other canon of merit that
is applicable. But in the subjects that are cultivated more directly
for the sake of useful applications there is no choice of topics
allowed ; and the aim must be to develop methods of investigai'on
that will satisfy the demand for mathematical elegance, and will
at the same time allow of an exact correlation between the mental
process and the natural phenomenon.
    The book before us is a treatise on Geometrical Optics, compiled
from the point of view of the Theory of Opiieal Instruments. The
position which Dr. Czapski holds, in conjunction with Professor
Abbe, in relation to the famous manufacturing firm of Zeiss at
Jena, is a guarantee that the more technical information contained
in the work is exact and up to date. Prom the pspeet of theory,
perhaps the most valuable feature of the book is the very copious
reference to the works of original wri.ers ; for to obtain a real
command of any department of a cubject of wide practical ramifi
 cations, the consultation of text-books, however good, is but a poor
 substitute for the assimilation of the ideas and points of view of

 the topics which have been indicated above, with the exception of
 the theory of Diffraction, of which the treatment is,presumably left

 to another department of the general undertaking of which this
 hook forms a part. The phrase " nach Abhe " which occurs in the
title is a little puzzling to non-German readers : in extending widely
the capabilities of optical construction and manufacture, a very
high degree of credit is due to Prof. Abbe and his collaborators at
Jena ; but yet it seems strange to associate his name so markedly
with the tit'e of a theoretical treatise whose contents would appear
for the most part familiar to many people who have possibly never
heard of his work, and whose knowledge of Optics was acquired
before his time.
    From the nature of the book, as forming an article in an
Encyclopedia of Physical Science, the subject is broken up some
what into separate headings, with a view to facilitate reference.
 If ever the time comes for a final gathering together of the threads
of this somewhat discursive subject into a compact form, it is to be
 hoped that much attention will be paid to the geometrical methods
 of discussion employed by the earlier English writers such as
 Eobert Smith and Thomas Young, which amalgamate so easily
with experimental requirements ; and that the capabilities of the
 Hamiltonian method of Action as a basis for the analytical part
 of the subject will be fully utilized.                          J. L.
         Amvendung der Quaternionen aufder Geometric.        Von
                           Dr. P. MoLENBROEK.
Tras is the promised sequel to the Theorie der Quaternionen by the
 same author, which we reviewed in November 1801. In his pre
 face Dr. Molenbroek replies to certain of our comments at that
time. He repudiates the description then given of his novel
 irterpretation of >J —\ &s an operator. Yet his own generalized
 description is in these words : " This definition shows that under
 the symbol 1/ —lu there are included not only an infinite number
 of arbitrary quaternions but also a similar number of right quotients
 [that is, versors] whose indices are all perpendicular to a." And
 thus, we still must believe, the operator 1/ — 1 has the " singularly
 felicitous but hitherto unsuspected power of adjusting its axis so
 as to be perpendicular to any vector to which it may be applied !"
    We had hoped to find in the present volume, which treats of
 geometrical applications, a further development of Dr.Molenbroek's
 pet creations—the Vektorkreis, the Veltorl-eyel, and the Conisch
 Sjialtendw Quaternion. Prom plane triangles with their " circles "
 and " points," to curvature and geodeties, we find many good
 illustrations of the power and elegance of quaternions; but of the
 conically spreading quaternion which transforms a vector into a
 conical sheet like a Japanese umbrella and then as with a fierce
  blast turns it inside out or in some other fashion de-axializes the
  original vector stem :— of this we find no mention. Our disap
  pointment is, however, more than balanced by the real quaternion
 character of the book as a whole. A great many of the examples

                    Notices respecting Neic Books.                333
 are reproduced, with very slight changes of notation, from Pro
fessor Tait's well-known treatise, and, we are sorry to say, repro
duced without acknowledgment. In his preface Dr. Molenbroek
refers to Professor Tait only by way of criticism, accusing him of
finding an integrating factor where none such can be. The truth
is that quaternions give a solution where ordinary mathematics
fail—although it would probably baffle even a Hamilton to give
a geometrical interpretation of log Uq.
    Occasionally Dr. Molenbroek advances along a path of his own,
as, for example, in his approach to the quaternion equation of quadric
surfaces. His transformation of the ordinary Cartesian equation
(which is assumed) into quaternion form may well send a shiver
 down the back of a disciple of Hamilton.
    Having neglected (as was pointed out in our former review) to
discuss the operator v in 'he Theorie, Dr. Molenbroek has to make
a digression in the present volume so as to establish its elementary
 properties. In the preface he gives as an excuse for the former
 neglect the statement that Tait devotes only one line to v 'n the
theoretical part of his book. Still, Tait has it ; and in the 3rd
edition (1890) devotes four pages to it in the chapter on Differen-
 tation. But even in the very first edition (1867) of his treatise
 (in which no hard-and-fast line was drawn between the theoretical
 part and the applications) Tait gives ample evidence of the import
 ance of v ; and we still think that a more recent writer, wise in
 the accumulated experience of his predecessors, should have had
 something to say concerning the theory of this remarkable differ
entiating operator. Dr. Molenbroek himself employs it with effect
 in his discussion of partial differential equations. It plays a
 conspicuous role in the theory of orthogonal surfaces. It is pre
 eminently the force-function operator. It is the heart of Green's
 theorem, the key-note of spherical harmonics. But we now learn
 on Dr. Molenbroek's authority that its value in physical applications
 is much over-rated (sehr iiberscliiitzt). We shall wait with interest
 his promised demonstration of this statement, which will probably
 be a unique feature of a succeeding volume. Meanwhile it is
 interesting to note that the last chapter of the present volume,
 which discusses with considerable elegance Hamilton's theory of
 rectilinear rays, ends with the equation, S . rvr=0.
    It is satisfactory to find in Dr. Molenbroek an enthusiastic
 admirer of the quaternion and all that it involves. Adhering more
 or less closely to the methods and notation of Hamilton, he has
 made an honest endeavour to familiarize German reading students
 with the beauty and power of the system. We trust that his
 efforts will be rew arded and that in Leyden, at any rate, will grow
 up a school of Hamiltonian workers who will effectively help in
 developing the infinite resources of quaternions.

 Physikalisches Praktikum, mit besonderer Beriicksichtigung der
   physikalisch-chemischen Methoden.       {Practical Physics, with
   special reference to physico-chemical methods.) By E. Wiede
   mann and H. Ebeet. Second Edition, 1893. Vieweg und
   Sohn, Brunswick.
Dubing the past year the subject of practical physics seems to
have received an unusual amount of attention both in Germany
and England. Some morths ago we had occasion to notice
a new work by Traube dealing with the methods of practical
chemical physics, and the present volume bears a very similar title.
 Until quite recently Kohlrauseh's classical text-book was almost
 universally adopted in German laboratories, but alterations in
design of apparatus, changes in methods of teaching, and a
necessity for the measurement of constants the importance of
 which was formerly unrecognized, have combined to make the
 work appear antiquated in a modern laboratory. The authors
 have treated the subject in a comprehensive manner as far as
description of experiments is concerned ; each section is introduced
by an epitome of the theory of the experiments to be performed ;
this is followed by accounts of the experiments, apparatus and
requisite manipulation, and when necessary the method of
calculating results is indicated. The data of actual experiments
are given as examples, and these show the degree of accuracy
attainable. It would be an improvement if these data were stated
in the way in which a student would be expected to write them
down in his note-book, the method of entering results being one
of the greatest difficulties experienced by the younger students in
a laboratory. As they stand the quantities are merely designated by
letters, of which the meanings can only be found by reference
to the context.
   As the work was written more especially for chemical students,
the sections devoted to Electricity and Magnetism are not so
complete as the rest of the book; for example the methods of
measuring induction-coefficients and the capacity of a condenser
are omitted. The rough determination of the specific inductive
capacity of a dielectric, and of the resistance of a badly conducting
liquid might, however, have been included with advantage.
   The lists of apparatus required for each experiment form an
excellent feature of the book, and will be of great service to the
laboratory assistant. The illustrations are likewise good, especially
those in colours, representing the solar spectrum, chromatic
aberration, and grating spectra respectively. Indeed, the volume
quite maintains the high standard which physicists have previously
ascribed to the scientific work of its two authors.

 La Chalevr (Heat). By Piebbe de Heejt, Professor of Experi
    mental Physics in the University of Lieye. Liege : Nierstrasz,
   1894.
In the somewhat remarkable preface to this work the author
discusses the two methods of studying science by mere experiment
and deduction therefrom, and by assumption of a theory which is
afterwards put to the test of crucial experiment, respectively. It
is ouly by the latter method that we succeed in acquiring a know
ledge of the causes of things, which is the true aim of physical
science. In the ordinary text-books of heat (and indeed of all
branches of physics, except perhaps sound) the former method
has been generally adopted ; a miscellaneous collection of facts is
given concerning expansion, the laws of gases, calorimetry, &c,
and these lead to a higher analytical or mechanical development of
the subject, but no theory is given to unite them into a connected
system. Such a connecting link is first met with in the kinetic or
molecular theory of gases, by which the behaviour of gases under
various conditions of temperature and pressure is completely
explained. By a suitable choice of temperature and pressure,
however, a gas may be changed to liquid, or a liquid to solid, so
that a similar theory must apply to all three states of matter.
But as the molecules become crowded together the increasing
complexity of their motions defies all calculation, although Van
der Waals and others of the same school, to whose influence the
present work is doubtless due, have achieved a certain amount of
success in the case of liquids near their critical temperatures.
Again, if we grant that the properties of liquids and solids are
capable of explanation by molecular motion, it follows that such
properties will be functions of the molecular weights of the
substances. This conclusion has been verified in many cases in
which a complete explanation is yet wanting.
   In the volume before us heat is regarded as a molecular motion,
and its chief phenomena are explained from this point of view as
far as is possible in the present state of knowledge. The author
assumes a knowledge of elementary phenomena, and occasionally
borrows formulas from thermodynamics, so that his work must be
considered as an exposition of molecular physics rather than a
text-book of heat. We have found several misprints in the book,
notably in connexion with names of authors, for example Clairant,
Peluj, Quinke, all of which might be corrected in a future edition.

   ON THE MAGNETIZATION OF SOFT IRON.             BY M. P. JOUBIN.
'T'HE phenomena of magnetization have as yet only been re-
      presented by empirical and approximate expressions ; thus, for
instance, the well-known formula of Froblich which is so frequently
used does not show that the magnetic susceptibility passes through
a maximum, a fact which is very important.
   1. Let I be the intensity of magnetization, H the field, K the
susceptibility, defined by the equation I = KH. In order to find
another relation between these three magnitudes we may, with
Bowland, trace a curve by taking for coordinates not I and H,
but I as ordinate, and K or 4a-K as abscissa?. To each value of K
two values of I correspond, and the centre of each chord is on a
right line very slightly inclined to the axis of abscissa?, and the
angular coefficient of which is negative. This curve is exactly a
parabola (except near the axis of the ordinates) as Howland
has shown, who, however, represents it by a sinusoidal function.
Thus it is that the equation
              1=660-0-078 4ttK + 14-53 V 2336 - 4tK
represents exactly the magnetic condition of an iron in\ estigated
by Bosanquet, as shown in the following table. This example is
taken at random among many others.

  2. The general aspect of these curves recalls in a striking
manner the curves which give the densities of saturated fluids
as a function of the temperature (MM. Cailletet and Mathias).
To each value of the susceptibility (which replaces the tem
perature) correspond two values of the intensity of magnetization
(or superficial density) which approach each other as K is increased,
and merge into each other at the critical point. The maximum

              intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            337
intensity Im is nearly equal to three times the critical intensity Ie ;
in fact in the preceding example Ic=478 and Im= 1400, a third of
which is 467. Now this property of ordinary fluids may be
deduced from the equation of Van der Waals ; we are thus led to
inquire whether we may compare the magnetic properties to those
of fluids.
   3. Following Faraday, let us regard the field as occupied by
tubes of force whose section <r at each point is inversely as the
field, (rH=l. In other words, instead of representing the intensity
of the field by the number of lines of force per unit surface, let us
define it by the section of unit tube. The coefficient K may then
be written la ; this is the quantity of magnetism contained in the
section of unit tube, just as the temperature is the quantity of
heat contained in unit volume of a gas.
   Between the superficial density I and the susceptibility K there is
the same relation as between the cubical density d and the temperature
T of a fluid, a relation expressed by the formula of Van der
Waals. Given a fluid obeying this law,
If it is gaseous and very far from its point of saturation, it
virtually follows the law of Mariotte, and we may write 2>v=BT,
from which is deduced the approximate law of its expansion,
The expansion of unit volume is proportioual to the absolute
temperature. This expression leads us to Frohlich's law.
   Assume, in fact, that we can apply to magnetic phenomena the
same equation, in which we shall replace a by          T by K, and
v by i ; we shall have
                               KKH„       cp
    Admitting, in conformity with a well-known demonstration, that
the pressure exerted against the external medium on the surface is
 proportional to Ya, that is to say to KI, it will be seen that to
 write the equation p = EKI, is to express a law analogous to that
 of Mariotte. We deduce from this,

338            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
from which
                         „     1- eJ*-1
                         *=H       E Hm "
 This is Frohlich's formula.
    Now this formula holds very well with feebly magnetic bodies ;
 we may from this conclude that in this case the pressure p is
correctly valued. On the other hand, it does not agree with
strongly magnetic bodies, for which the value of the pressure p is
given by the formula of Van der Waals. From the known pro
 perties of this equation, the pressure corresponding to two values
 of I, corresponding to the same susceptibility K, is the same.
    4. For a fluid, in proportion as the temperature T decreases the
 density of the saturated vapour decreases cotemporaneously with
 the tension ; at the temperature at which the density becomes
 null, the tension is null also. Thus the second part of the equation
 of Van der Waals vanishes, and we deduce from it the value of
 the density of the liquid under the pressure null of its saturated
 vapour.
    Applying the same method to the example mentioned above, the
 parabola cuts the axis of abscissas at the point 4a-K=516 ; the
 corresponding value of I given by the equation of Van der Waals
 is 1=1260. The direct measurement on the parabola gives 1256.
 This is an almost absolute coincidence.
    5. From this point the equation of Van der Waals can no
 longer represent the phenomenon, for the fluid can no longer
 exist in the liquid state ; a change of state takes place, and the
 representative curve changes suddenly. This is also the case
 with magnetism ; it is from this point that the curve is no longer
 parabolic. There is a change of state corresponding to the passage
 from the liquid to the solid state.
    In fine, the phenomena of the magnetization of iron are ana
 logous to those presented by a saturated fluid, and might be
 calculated by the same formulas ; I propose to try if we can find
 experimentally a reduced equation independent of the magnetized
 body.
    Feebly magnetized bodies are subject to laws analogous to those
of liquids at a distance from their point of saturation. — Communi

 ON THE EXPEIUMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF THE ROTATIONAL
    COEFFICIENTS OF THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY. BY CH. SARET.
    In the very amiable and indulgent notice which the Archives
de Geneve has published of my Elemins de Crystallography
physique, M. Curie has proposed a method by which the existence

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             339
or absence of rotational coefficients of thermal conductivity in
crystals may be ascertained in a simple manner.
   I wish here to point out briefly the principle of an analogous
method which I was led to try some time ago, and which, as I have
subsequently learned, is identical with the method proposed by
Boltzmann for the investigation of Hall's phenomenon.
   If a point sufficiently distant from the edge of a thin crystallized
plate be heated, the isothermal curves obtained by Senarmont's
method are ellipses, whatever be the values of the coefficients of
rotation.
   If instead of working with a continuous plate the plate is split
by a straight saw-cut in the direction of a radius from the centre
of heating, the isothermal curves will be scarcely modified, and will
shorten on each side of the slit if the coefficients of rotation are
null, but will exhibit a break in the same region if the coefficients
are not null. In this case the flow from the centre tends to
follow a spiral line ; there should be an accumulation of heat on one
of the edges of the slit and a falling off on the other.
   The experiment may be made still more simply. Instead of
sawing the plate it is sufficient to heat a point of the rectilinear
edge. If the coefficients of rotation are not zero the isothermal
line must undergo a spiral modification, and the distances at
which it cuts the edge of the plate on the right and left of the
point heated are not equal.
   This method is not very certain : it is better to cut the plate by
a saw-cut in two halves, which are then adjusted in a suitable
support in their original position, leaving a slight interval between
the two edges of the slit. By heating a point of this the spiral
deformation should be separately produced on each piece, and the
isothermal will present discontinuities in the opposite direction at
the two points where it meets the slit.
   I have tried these various methods on plates of gypsum ; in no
case have I observed a discontinuity indicating an appreciable
spiroidal deformation of the isotherms. I hope to pursue these
experiments.
   What we have said applies to thin plates perpendicular to the
axis of rotation. It will be seen in like manner that on heating
by Jannettaz's method a /mint in a face cut in an unlimited crystal,
parallel to the axis of rotation, isotherms should be obtained which
are not symmetrical in reference to that diameter which is parallel
to this axis. The fact that this deformation has not hitherto been
noticed appears to prove that the coefficients of rotation are always
zero, or at any rate very small.—Bibliotheque Universelle, No. 4,

           MECHANICAL ENERGY OF MOLECULES OF GASES.
             To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine.
Gentlemen,
      Will you kindly allow me to ask, through the medium of your
' Philosophical Magazine,' whether there has ever been published a
statement of the Amounts of Mechanical Energy of the Molecules
of different Gases ? and if so, where it is to be found ?
   If there has been no such publication, I beg leave to say that by
calculating the mean mo)ecular velocities per second at 0° C. of a
considerable number of gases, simple and compound, from their
molecular weights and the square roots of those weights (or of the
specific gravities) in the usual manner, and multiplying the squares
of those velocities by the molecular weights, I have observed that
the resulting products are alike in amount, and therefore the
quantities of mechanical energy of the molecules of gases at the same
temperature and pressure are equal.
   As it is possible that this general truth has been already
observed and published (although during extensive reading on
cognate subjects I have not seen it), I make the above statement
with great diffidence.

XXXI. On the Electricity of Drops. By J. J. Thomson,
   M.A., D.Sc, Ftli.S., Cavendish Professor of Experimental
   Physics, Camliridge *.
DROPS offer many advantages for the investigation of
        electrical effects, especially of those which involve the
contact of dissimilar substances. Perhaps the greatest of these
advantages is that when the drops are formed they present a
perfectly clean surface to the gas by which thoy are sur
rounded ; so that the conditions are much more definite than
they can be where the surfaces have been long exposed, and
have had time to get contaminated by dirt or coated with films
of gas of unknown composition.
   rihe experiments described in this paper relate to the elec
trical effects which occur when a drop of liquid falls on to a
plate already coated with a film of the same liquid. It has
been known for a long time that peculiar electric effects
occur at the feet of waterfalls : at such places the normal
distribution of the atmospheric electric potential is disturbed
in such a way as to indicate a distribution of negative elec
tricity in the region at the foot of the fall. These effects cannot
be due to the waterfall acting like the falling drops in Lord
Kelvin's water-dropping electrophorus ; for they are found
to occur when the waterfalls are inside caves whose sides are
                    * Communicated by the Author.

  342                On the Electricity of Drops.
  dripping with moisture, in which cases the water would be
  falling inside an equipotential surface.
     The subject of the electrification produced by falling drops
 has been investigated by Lenard, who gives the results of his
 researches in a most interesting paper, entitled " Ueber die
 Electricitiit der Wasserfalle " (Wiedemann's Annalen, xlvi.
 p. 584). In this paper Lenard shows that when drops of
 distilled water fall on to a plate wetted by the water, the drops
 after striking the plate are positively electrified, while in the
 air around the place where the drops fall there is a distribu
 tion of negative electricity : that no electrical separation
 takes place until the drops strike against the plate : and that
 the electrical effect with drops of tap-water is very much less
 than with drops of distilled water.
     Lenard attributes these effects to the formation of a double
 coating of electricity over the surface of the drop, the drop
 itself being coated with positive electricity, while in the air
 close to the surface of the drop there is a coating of negative
 electricity. When the drop strikes against the plate some of
 this external coating gets knocked off, leaving the drop with
 a preponderating positive charge, the corresponding negative
 charge going off into the air near to where the drop strikes
 against the plate.
    Some phenomena I observed when an electric discharge
 was passing through an exhausted tube led me to the con
 clusion that bodies were covered with this double coating of
 electricity, but that its moment and even its sign depended
 very much on the nature of the gas surrounding the body on
 which the coating was situated. I was therefore led to make
 a series of experiments on the phenomena which accompany
 the splashing of drops, especially on the effect produced by
 altering the gas through which the drops fall and the liquid
 of which the drops are made.
    The methods I used are very similar to those employed by
Lenard; they are represented in figs. 1 and 2. The arrange
ment shown in fig. 1 was used to test the effect when different
liquids fell through air; that in fig. 2 when the drops fell
through gases other than air. A is an insulated funnel from
which the drops fall : the substance of which this funnel was
made was not found to produce any effect upon the results.
1 tried funnels of glass, lead, brass, iron, and silver : the
mouth of this funnel dips below the top of a metal tube
connected to earth. In fig. 2 the top of this tube is closed by
a paraffin stopper through which the funnel passes. The
drops fall on the plate B, and after striking against it fall
into the vessel C, which is insulated and connected to the
liquid in the funnel and to one pair of quadrants of the

344                Prof. J. J. Thomson on the
electrometer. The object of connecting the funnel to the vessel
in which the drops are received is to eliminate the effect of
any electrification that may be produced by the flow of the
liquid through the funnel, or any electrical separation taking
place when the drops fall from the spout of the funnel. It
was found, however, by connecting the funnel by itself to the
electrometer, that any effect of this kind was extremely small
compared with those observed when both the funnel and
receiver were connected with the electrometer. To prevent
the electricity which goes into the air from charging the
receiver, and thus neutralizing the opposite electrification
given to the receiver from the drops, different methods were
employed according as the drops fell through air, when the
experiments could be made in the open, or through other
gases, when the apparatus had to be enclosed in an air-tight
vessel. In the first case the separation of the two electricities
was effected by blowing a current of air across the plate on
which the drops fell ; the electrification in the air was by this
means blown against a metal plate connected with the earth,
and so discharged. The current of air was produced by a fan
worked by a water-motor. This method could not be used
when the apparatus had to be closed up so as to allow of gases
other than air being used. In this case the electrification in
the air Was discharged by placing over the plate a piece of
wire gauze connected with the earth : a hole was cut through
the gauze to allow of the drops falling through without touch
ing the gauze ; the gauze was separated from the plate by a
distance only just great enough to allow the drops to fall
into the receiver after rebounding from the plate without
striking against the gauze. Plates of various kinds were
tried, but i found, as Lenard observes, that the material of
which the plate is made exerts no influence provided it is
thoroughly wetted by the liquid which falls upon it. Irregu
larities occur if the plate is greasy, when the drops, instead
of spreading over the plate, roll off it, still retaining their
globular form.
   With either of these pieces of apparatus the effect dis
covered by Lenard, that after striking against the plate drops of
distilled water had a positive charge, could easily be observed.
   The first variation of the experiment which I tried was to
make the drops fall through water-vapour instead of air. For
this experiment water was boiled for several hours in a vessel
like that represented in fig. 2 until the steam had completely
expelled the air : the water used for the drops had been well
boiled so as to thoroughly expel the air from it. In this case no
electrical separation whatever was observed, though when air
wan blown into the vessel the normal effect at once reappeared.

   When the vessel was filled with hydrogen, the electrification
of the drops was reversed : the drops, after striking against
the plate, being negatively electrified, while there was a posi
tive charge distributed through the hydrogen. Lenard found
that the effect was considerably less in hydrogen than in air.
If care is taken to get rid of all traces of air, the effect is not
merely diminished but reversed.
   This and the experiment previously described seem to indi
cate that the effect is due to chemical action. This view is
confirmed by the very large effects produced by the addition
of small quantities of various foreign substances to the water
forming the drops.
   The results of experiments made upon a considerable variety
of substances are given below. In each case the deflexion
given is that produced when 100 cubic centim. of the sub
stance fall through the funnel. The deflexion is marked +
when it is in the same direction as that due to pure water
falling through air.

   In this case any addition of the substance diminishes the
electrical effect, and only requires a small qtiantity of HC1 to
make the solution neutral. When the solution has become
neutral it remains so in spite of the addition of more acid.
We shall see that other substances, such as zinc chloride,
oxalic acid, &c, show the same peculiarity.

    Thus chromium trioxide reverses the electrification on the
 drop, producing a very large negative electrification on the
 drops.
    Effects similar to those produced by chromium trioxide
 are also produced by hydrogen peroxide.

    Thus the addition of potassium permanganate produces a
 reversal of the electrification.
    Though the addition of mineral salts and acids produces a
 very decided effect on the electrification, this effect is not
 nearly so large as that produced by very dilute solutions of
 organic compounds. We have seen an instance of this already
in the case of phenol, which produced an enormous increase
in the electrification of the drops. An equally remarkable
effect is produced by methyl violet, but in this case the elec
trification of the drop is reversed : the merest trace of methyl
violet is sufficient to reverse the electrification, and in fact a
weak solution is much more effective than a strong one, a
very strong solution being almost neutral. The effect of
methyl violet is so great that when a funnel has been used
for this substance, many litres of water have to be run through
it before distilled water when running through it. gives the
normal effect. The following measurements show the large
effects produced by small quantities of methyl violet : the
standard solution mentioned below was distinctly, though not
deeply, coloured.

   Eosaniline also produces an effect of the same character as
methyl violet, though not quite to the same extent : thus, when
the distilled water gave a deflexion 200 + , a weak solution
of rosaniline gave a deflexion 370— ; stronger solutions

                          Electricity of Drops.                  349
produced much smaller effects. The effect of adding a small
quantity of rosaniline to water could be defected by the
alteration produced in the deflexion of the electrometer before
any colour was appreciable.
    Fluorescene and eosine produce very marked effects, but of
the opposite kind to those duo to methyl violet and rosaniline,
i. e., instead of reversing the water effect, they increase it. Thus
when water gave a deflexion 280 + , a weak solution of fluores
cene gave a deflexion 700 + ; and when water gave a deflexion
 200 + , a weak solution of eosine gave a deflexion 370 + .
As the solutions of eosine and fluorescene increase in strength
 the electrical effects get smaller, until with very strong
 solutions a small negative deflexion is obtained in both case*.
    When a solution has become electrically neutral, i. e. when
the drops do not produce any deflexion of the electrometer,
the addition of other reagents seems to produce very little
effect. Thus to 100 c. c. of a neutral eosine solution I added
12 drops of a rosaniline solution, and the solution still re
mained neutral, though the addition of the same quantity of
the rosaniline solution to 100 c. c. of distilled water produced
a change in the deflexion of the electrometer of 400 scale-
divisions.
    The effect produced by any reagent depends to a very large
 extent on the solvent in which it is dissolved. I tried the
 effect of dissolving rosaniline, methyl violet, fluorescene,
 eosine, and phenol in absolute alcohol as well as in methylated
 spirit : the electrical effects, however, were small, in no way
comparable to the enormous effects produced by these sub
 stances when dissolved in water.
                          Isomeric Substances.
    Dr. Ruheinann was kind enough to supply me with samples
of the three isomeric substances hydroquinone, pyrocatechin,
 and resorcin. The solutions of these were of the same strength,
 •5 gramme of the salt being dissolved in a litre of water. The
 results were as follows :—
               Substance.                        Deflexion.
                Water                              210+

                Hydroquinone                       255 +
Thus the hydroquinone is the only one of the three which
produces any appreciable effect on the electricity produced by
 the drops.

     The effect of temperature upon a solution of rosaniline is
 yery remarkable. At first increase of temperature produces
 an increase in the electrification, but on increasing the
 temperature still further the electrification diminishes and
 finally changes sign. The deflexions due to a rosaniline solu
 tion are given in the following table :—

         Effect of Altering the Gas surrounding the Drops.
    I have already alluded to the reversal of the electrifi
cation of drops of distilled water which takes place when
hydrogen is substituted for air. If in place of distilled water
we use dilute solutions of different substances, we find that the
effect of substituting hydrogen for air depends very much
upon the nature of the solution. Solutions such as those of
phenol, pyrogallic acid, fluorescene, whose drops are electrified
in the same way as those of distilled water, are affected by
hydrogen in the same way as the drops of water are affected;
i. e., the positive electrification which the drop possesses in air
is in hydrogen exchanged for a small negative electrification
On the other hand, the effect of substituting hydroo-en for air
in the case of substances like methyl violet, rosanilfne, potas
sium permanganate, whose drops show a negative electrifica
tion in air, is to increase this negative electrification, and the
deflexion of the electrometer is greater when the drops fall
through hydrogen than when they fall through air.

   When drops fall through sulphuretted hydrogen, the de
flexion of the electrometer is very small whatever be the
nature of the drop. I am inclined to attribute this to the
absorption of the gas by the water of the solution; the drops
absorb so much gas that they may be regarded as pretty
strong solutions of sulphuretted hydrogen, and it is consistent
with what we have seen of the behaviour of solutions of salts
or acids that a strong solution should be electrically neutral.
This explanation is supported by the fact that, whereas to get
the hydrogen effect it is necessary to take the greatest pains
to exclude the air, we can get the effect produced by sul
phuretted hydrogen when a good deal of residual air remains
in the gas surrounding the drops. I also found that when
water in which sulphuretted hydrogen had been dissolved fell
in drops through air, no electrical effect was produced.
   "When solutions of rosaniline and methyl violet fell through
chlorine, the drops had a slight positive charge; the same drops
when falling through air or hydrogen had a negative charge :
the solutions were quite bleached by the chlorine. When
chlorine water falls through chlorine, no electrification is
produced.
                         Discussion of the Results.
   The preceding experiments show that the electrification
developed by the drop depends (1) on the nature of the
gas surrounding the drop ; (2) on the nature of the drop
itself. On the drop side of the surface of separation of the
drop and the gas there is a coating of one kind of electricity

352                Prof. J. J. Thomson on tlie
close to this, but in the gas there is a coating of the opposite
kind of electric'ty. The quantity of positive electricity on
one coating is equal to the quantity of negative electricity on
the other. With an electro-negative gas like oxygen, the
negative layer of this double coating of electricity is in the
oxygen when the drop is formed of distilled water, or of a
solution of readily oxidizable substances, such as pyrogallic
acid, or phenol, or of dilute solutions of eosine and fluorescene.
If the oxygen is replaced by the electro-positive gas hydrogen,
then the positive layer of the coating is in the hydrogen, not
onlv for the drops mentioned above but also for all the drops
I have tried, with the exception of mercury. This sub
stance I have always found to be positively electrified
whether it fell through air or hydrogen. I hope, however,
to test this point further by trying still purer hydrogen.
When the drops are solutions of strongly oxidizing sub
stances, such as chromium trioxide, hydrogen peroxide,
potassium permanganate, or weak solutions of certain dyes,
such as rosaniline or methyl violet, the positive coating seems
always to be in the gas, whether this be oxygen or hydrogen;
the electrical effect is, however, greater in the latter case
than in the former. With chlorine, however, the negative
coating seems always to be in the gas. These results, together
with the fact that when water falls through its own vapour,
or when chlorine water falls through chlorine, no electrical
effect is produced, seem clearly to indicate that the electrifi
cation owes its origin to chemical processes. In fact the
phenomena point to the conclusion that over the surface of
the drop a substance is formed which is in a state intermediate
between that of complete chemical combination and complete
separation between the gas and the liquid forming the drop :
a stat3 in which the constituents have electrical charges of
the same sign as in actual chemical compounds, but in which
the connexion between the constituents is so loose that they
can easily be shaken apart. We must regard this state rather
as an attempt or tendency towards chemical combination than
the formation of a definite stable chemical compound, for we
could not suppose that such a compound would be split up
when the drop struck against a wet plate.
   The greatest electrical effect will occur when there is a
tendency towards chemical combination, though not of suffi
cient intensity to result, in the time taken by the drop to fall
from the funnel to the plate, in the formation of a definite
chemical compound. The influence of this tendency in in
creasing the electrical effect is shown by the experiments on
weak solutions of the three isomeric substances, resorcin,

                      Electricity of Drops.                 353
pyrocatechin, and hydroquinone. Of these the last was the
only one that increased the electrical effect of the drops
beyond that due to the water in which it was dissolved, and
hydroquinone is the only one of the three which has any
tendency to combine with oxygen.
   The difference between the magnitude of the changes pro
duced in the electrical effects when the same substances are
dissolved in water and alcohol, shows that the quasi-chemical
action which produces the electrification is greatly influenced,
if not altogether determined, by the solvent. Thus the small
 effect produced when phenol is dissolved in alcohol compared
 with that produced when it is dissolved in water, shows that
phenol by itself does not produce much electrical effect, but
that when a small quantity of it is dissolved in water, it is
 put into a state in which it can exert a chemical action which
 is accompanied by a vigorous electrical effect. The addition
 of a small quantity of a salt or acid to the water seems to
 deprive the water of the power of putting phenol into this
 state. Thus I made a weak solution of sodium chloride which
 was electrical neutral, and to this added a small quantity of
 phenol : the solution remained electrically neutral, the drops
 giving rise to no electrification. The phenol in this case pro
 duced no effect, though the same quantity of phenol, when
 added to pure distilled water, more than doubled the electric
 effect due to the water.
    The vigorous electric action of some organic substances is
 very striking, especially the fact that very dilute solutions
 produce much larger effects than strong ones : in this they
 resemble inorganic substances, as strong solutions of all the
 substances I have tried produce very little electrification.
This could be accounted for to some extent by the better
 electrical conductivity of the strong solutions, because this
 would make it more difficult for the electricity of opposite
 sign to that on the drop to escape into the air, as it would
 more readily get into the surrounding fluid : just as Lenard
 found that the electrification was diminished when the thick
 ness of the layer of water into which the drops fell was
 increased. We cannot, however, attribute the whole, or even
 the greater part of the diminution due to strong solutions to
 this cause, since the dimiiiution produced by increasing the
 strength of the solution is far greater than the increase in its
 conductivity.
    The conclusion to which I have been led by the study of
 those drops is that distilled water is a substance which is far
from being chemically saturated and inert, but that, on the
contrary, it can by its chemical action set up those chemical

354                  Prof. J. J. Thomson on tlie
changes in the gas by which it is surrounded or in substances
dissolved in it which give rise to the electrification. As,
however, the quantity of substance dissolved in the gas is
increased the mixture becomes more nearly chemically satu
rated or neutral, and more incapable of producing the requisite
chemical change in the surrounding gas, or of putting the
substance dissolved in it into a state in which it is chemically
active. At a certain stage the diminution in the chemical
activity of the water produced by the addition of more of the
substance, more than counterbalances the effect due to the in
crease in the number of molecules of the substance. When
this stage is reached, any increase in the strength of the
solution will diminish the electrical effect. We may put this
reasoning in a mathematical form : Suppose that A is the
measure of the electric effect due to the action of the dis
tilled water on the air, and that when m gramme molecules of
a salt are dissolved in a litre of water, the mixture becomes
more nearly chemically neutral, and its power of originating
the chemical change which produces the electrical double layer
is enfeebled, so that the electric effect is now only equal to
 Ae~Pm, where jS is some constant. Suppose, too, that the dis
tilled water could put a fraction B of the molecules of the salt
into the condition in which they are able to produce the
chemical changes which lead to electrification, but that the
solution is only capable of putting the fraction Be-*"1 into
this state. Suppose, too, that each molecule in this state
produces an electric effect represented by O/B. On these
 suppositions the electric effect of the drops, which is the sum
 of the effects of the water and the salt, will be proportional to
                          A.e-^ + Cme-^.
 If we represent this relation by a curve in which the ordinate
 represents the electric effect, the abscissa the strength of the
 solution, we get the curves of the type «, /3, y according as
 C is of the same sign as A, of the opposite sign, or zero (fig. 3).
    These curves represent the general behaviour of the sub
 stances I have examined. Curves of the type a represent
 the behaviour of solutions of phenol, eosine, fluorescene ;
 curves of the type # that of solutions of potassium perman
 ganate, chromium trioxide, hydrogen peroxide, rosaniline, and
 methyl violet ; and curves of the type y that of solutions of
 zinc chloride, hydrochloric and hydriodic acids.
    The measurement of the electrification developed by the
 drops does not enable us to find the potential difference
 between the drop and the surrounding gas ; it only shows
 that this difference is finite and enables us to determine its

                      Electricity of Drops.                 355
sign. Other considerations show, however, that this differ
ence cannot amount to anything like a volt, for otherwise the
difference between the surface-tension of distilled water and a
weak electrical neutral solution of, say, sodium chloride would
                                Fig. 3.
be far greater than it is. Let V be the difference of potential
between the drop and the air, S the area of the surface of the
drop, t the distance between the two coatings of electricity ;
then the two coatings may be regarded as the charged plates
of the condenser, whose potential energy is

   If V is equal to 1 volt and t to 10-8, this is about 44.
Thus, if we take the cases of distilled water and an electrically
neutral solution of sodium chloride, which is an exceedingly
weak solution ; then, if there were a difference of potential of
1 volt between distilled water and air, the apparent surface-
tension of the salUsolution would exceed that of pure water
by about 44. The effect of the electrification on the surface-
tension is proportional to the square of the potential-difference.
Thus for a potential-difference of one tenth of a volt the dif
ference between the surface-tension of distilled water and a
weak salt-solution from this cause would onty be about -44.
It is doubtful whether the measurements of surface-tension
could be trusted to detect differences as small as this; so that
all we can infer from the observations on the surface-tension
of solutions is that the difference of potential between distilled
water arid air cannot be much greater than one tenth of a
volt.
   There seems no reason for limiting the possession of this
double coating to liquids. It is possessed by liquids of the
most diverse characters, as is shown by the electrification
developed by drops of water, mercury, molten metals, tur
pentine, &c. If, however, we suppose that. solids possess such
a coating, it is evident that the rubbing off of part of one of
these coatings when two solids are rubbed together would show
itself as electricity developed by friction. Indeed it seems
quite possible that a large part, if not the whole, of the elec
tricity developed by friction may be due to this cause.
   Another phenomenon in which I am inclined to think this
double layer of electrification over the surface of bodies plays
an important part, is the electrification of metals and fluor
escent liquids when exposed to the influence of ultra-violet
light. These substances under such circumstances acquire a
charge of positive electricity, the negative electricity going to
the air. Now in mercury and molten liquids and solutions of
the fluorescent substances eosine and fluorescene the positive
layer of the double coating is next the metal or liquid, the
negative layer next the air. It seems quite possible tliat
when there is intense reflexion of light from the surface of
these substances, the outer coating may get partially dissi
pated, leaving the metal or liquid with a positive charge. A
solution of rosaniline also shows the same effect when
exposed to ultra-violet light, though the electrification of its
drops is at low temperatures of the opposite sign to that of

                         Electricity of Drops.                  357
 solutions of eosine or fluorescene. We have seen, however,
 that at high temperatures the electrification of a solution
 of rosaniline changes its sign ; and the state of the outer
 layers when exposed to intense light may very well be more
 analogous to that of the liquid at a high temperature than at
 a low one.
    Again, the formation of large drops of water by the impact
 of smaller ones is analogous to the splashing of the water-
 drops against a wet surface, and is likely to give rise to analo
 gous electrical effects on a smaller scale. If this is so, the
 large drops of rain which frequently accompany thunderstorms
 may be to some extent rather the cause than the effect of the
 storm. I believe that this has been suggested by Sir Gr. G.
 Stokes.
    The difference in the behaviour of different gases with
 reference to the two electricities is very conspicuous in these
 experiments, oxygen and chlorine acquiring a charge of
 negative electricity when under the same circumstances
 hydrogen acquires a positive charge. This suggests that the
 energy possessed by an atom of hydrogen, for example, when
 charged with a unit of positive electricity is not the same as
 that possessed by the same atom when charged with a unit of
 negative electricity ; or, as v. Helmholtz expresses it, the atoms
 of various substances attract the two electricities with different
 intensities. If the atoms possess this property they will tend
 to acquire definite atomic charges, and thus tend to have a
 definite valency. We can see this if we remember that the
 likelihood of the formation of a chemical compound is con
ditioned by the changes in the energy which accompany the
 formation of the compound. We shall for the sake of clearness
confine our attention to the changes which go on in the poten
tial energy. Any chemical change will tend to go on if it is
accompanied bya decrease in the potential energy,and will tend
to be reversed if it is accompanied by an increase in that energy.
Let us consider the case of an element the potential energy
of whose atom is diminished by Q when one unit of positive
electricity is communicated to it. If G is the electric capacity
of the atom, then, when the atom has a charge of n units of
positive electricity, its electric potential energy is
Thus the charging of the atom will result in a diminution of
the potential energy until, supposing the unit of electricity
to be indivisible, the charge on the atom is the integer just
less than CQ : when the charge exceeds this an increase in
   Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 37. No. 227. April 1894.         2 B

358                On the Electricity of Drops.
the charge will be accompanied by an increase in the potential
energy. Thus there will, on account of the property which
may be expressed as a specific attraction of the atom for
electricity, be a tendency for the atom to acquire the definite
charge CQ. If, however, the atom has a definite charge it
has a definite valency. We must remember, however, that
when chemical changes are going on, the charges gained by
one atom are lost by another ; and it is the total change
in the potential energy which determines whether the change
shall go forwards or backwards. Thus in some cases we may
have an atom charged to an extent which involved an increase
in its potential energy, because the abnormal charging of
this atom may have involved such a decrease in the potential
energy of some other atom as to more than compensate for the
increase in that of the atom under consideration. In this
case the atom would not have its normal valency.
   Tt would appear that if the atoms possess this specific
attraction for the two electricities, a large rotating body
ought to produce a magnetic field. For consider a substance
the atoms in whose molecules attract the two electricities
with different intensities, and suppose, for example, that
the electro-negative component is the more energetic of
the two : then, in consequence of the uncompensated at
traction of this atom for a negative charge, there will be
in the neighbourhood of the atom an electric intensity in
the same direction as that which would exist if the atom
had a positive charge. This effect may be inappreciable
at finite distance from the molecule and produce no ex
ternal electrostatic effects. When, however, the molecule is
set in motion, the specific attraction of the molecule would
make the positive electric tubes move in a different way to
the negative ones. This differential motion of the tubes would
produce a magnetic field of the same general character as
that due to a positive charge moving in the direction of the
molecule. In the case of a rotating sphere the maximum
magnetic force at the surface would be proportional to «oa2,
where w is the angular velocity of rotation, and a the radius
of the sphere. If we take the earth's magnetic force as an
index of the superior limit of the magnetic force due to a
rotating sphere of the size of the earth, we find that the mag
netic force due to a sphere 1 foot in radius rotating 100 times
a second would not exceed more than about one hundred
millionth part of the earth's magnetic force.
   I have much pleasure in thanking my assistant, Mr. E.
Everett, for the assistance he has given me in these expe
riments.

     XXXII. The Densities of Solutions of Soda and Potash.
           By Spencer Umfreville Pickering, F.R.S.*
 IT is somewhat remarkable that there exist no modern or
        exact determinations of the densities of solutions of soda
 or potash. Berthelot, it is true, made series of observations
 with both substances, but his results have no pretensions to
 accuracy, the values being given to the third decimal place
 only, and applying to temperatures varying from 10° to 15°.
 The tables which are generally reproduced in text-books, as
 well as in the works of Schiff and of Gerlach on densities,
 are those which Tiinnermann constructed as far back as 1827.
 These tables are based on half a dozen determinations at most,
 and on a theory which can scarcely be accepted at the present
 day ; they are fairly voluminous, and as Tiinnermann calcu
 lated the values for percentage strengths not expressed by
 round numbers, they seem to have been generally accepted as
 experimental instead of calculated values. They show errors
 extending up to a unit in the second decimal place, and when
 plotted out give figures bearing very little resemblance to
 the true ones. Dalton also made some determinations
 ('Elements,' ii. p. 315 t)> and possibly also Richter (Stdchio-
 metrie, iii. p. 332 t), but as 1 have failed in procuring his
 work (or Dalton's either) I am uncertain whether they were
 original determinations or not. In any case determinations
 of such a date could only be roughly approximate.
    Apart from the desirability for practical purposes of
 having accurate tables of the densities of such familiar sub
 stances as soda and potash, there were questions of theoretical
 importance which induced me to investigate their solutions.
 My work on Sulphuric Acid (Chem. Soc. Trans. 1890, pp. 64,
 331) had indicated the existence of numerous hydrates in
 solution, but beyond the indications afforded by the changes
 of curvature themselves there was very little independent
 evidence as to the particular hydrates indicated, one only
 had been known to exist in the solid condition, and one other
 was subsequently isolated. But in the case of soda, my recent
 work (Chem. Soc. Trans. 1893, p. 890) has shown that the
hydrates which can be crystallized from moderately strong

360            Mr. S. U. Pickering on the Densities
solutions are very numerous, and if it is established that the
properties of the solutions show changes of curvature at points
corresponding to these isolated hydrates, we shall have further
evidence of a very strong character in favour of the reality of
these changes, and of the view that they indicate the existence
of hydrates in solution.
                       The Determinations.
   The soda used was made from sodium, and the potash was
purified by crystallization from alcohol. The lumps were first
washed in well-boiled water to remove any adhering carbonate,
and were then dissolved to form solutions nearly saturated
at ordinary temperatures, and filtered through glass-wool.
These strong solutions were subsequently diluted to the required
strengths by the addition of accurately weighed quantities
of water. The solutions were made up twelve to twenty-four
hours before their densities were determined, specially stopped
bottles of common white glass being used for holding them
during this time. The same solution was never used twice.
In spite of every precaution the solutions could not be obtained
entirely free from carbonate : the presence of a little car
bonate, however, would have no appreciable effect on the
relative accuracy of consecutive observations, which is the
chief consideration in the present work.
   The strength of the stock solutions was determined by
titration, and was probably correct to 0-05 per cent, of the total
alkali present. The relative strength of the consecutive
solutions is dependent only on the balance error in diluting
them, and is therefore represented by a much smaller
quantity.
   The density-determinations were made in a precisely
similar manner as in the case of sulphuric acid, the tempera
ture, however, being 15° + '01. The various determinations
of consecutive strengths were not always made consecutively.
The results with soda, for instance, were made in five or six
different series, each extending throughout the whole range of
strengths investigated, and any changes which are noticed
cannot, therefore, be explained away by the suggestion of
there being a certain error affecting a certain day's work, and
not affecting that of another day.

                of Solutions of Soda and Potash.              361
              Examination of the Results xvith Soda.
   The results with soda are given in Table I. A considerable
number of the observations were repeated with solutions of
nearly the same strengths, and the means deduced from these
duplicates have been used for plotting purposes. From this
cause the mean experimental error is less than it was in the case
of my determinations with sulphuric acid ("000011, see Phil.
Mag. xxxiii. p. 136). The graphic method—which is based
on measuring the errors of every two alternate points as com
pared with arcs of circles drawn through three other alternate
points (Ber. d. deutsch. chem. Gesell. xxiv. p. 3332, xxv.
p. 1100)—gave -00000734 when applied to the whole series
of values ; but if there are any breaks in the figure it is
obvious tliat the arcs should not be applied so as to bridge
over a break, as the errors in its neighbourhood would thereby
be made to appear larger than they really are. When applied
so as to avoid bridging over the breaks which the figure
appears to show, the mean error was found to be #00000631 ;
and, as the following examination sufficiently establishes the
reality of these breaks, this value for the error has been
accepted. The general character of the results, however, it
must be noted, would not be altered if the higher estimate
were taken.
   The densities themselves, when plotted against percentage
composition, form a figure which shows that throughout
they increase with the strength at a decreasing rate. In
order that a scale might be adopted sufficiently open to
give the experimental error a visible magnitude, the differ
ences between the densities and a straight line (third column),
or between the densities and a simple parabola (fourth column),
have been used for the examination. The values given by the
former are preferable for determining the position of any
breaks, owing to the simpler character of the figure formed
by them ; those given by the latter are preferable for the
estimation of the errors of the drawings, owing to the more
open scale which can be used in plotting them. These latter
values are shown in the diagram, though the scale which has
necessarily been adopted there is too restricted for purposes
other than those of illustration.
   A glance at this figure will be sufficient to show that they
cannot be expressed by any single bent-lath curve ; and a
more careful examination of them with the lath indicates the
probable existence of as many as eight changes of curvature, as
shown in the diagram (p. 363). When the apparent errors of
 the points according to such a drawing are measured, the results

 362          Densities of Solutions of Soda and Potash.
 given in column A of Table II. are obtained*. In this case
 the total error is 1'6 times the known experimental error,
 but this comparatively small excess above what it should
 be is, as will be seen, due entirely to the magnitude of the
 et error, and might be caused by even one experimental
 point showing an accidentally large error. Very little weight
 ought therefore to be attached to it, and the drawing cannot
 be regarded otherwise than as agreeing very closely with
 the known experimental error ; indeed, the mean apparent
 error of the points (e{) agrees almost absolutely with the
 experimental error—-00000627 against -00000631.
    If the breaks shown by this drawing have no real existence,
 and if it is merely by some strange chance that the drawing
 has been made in precisely the right number of sections to
 produce this remarkable concordance between the apparent
 error of the points and the known experimental error, we
 ought to get a similar concordance with any other drawing of
 a similar degree of complexity independent of the particular
 positions at which the breaks are made to come. But this is
 not so. The results given in columns B show that if the
 breaks are made to come at points intermediate between those
 in the previous drawing, the apparent error is increased from
 1*6 to 6-6 times the experimental error, every one of the factors
 which make up the total error being in excess of what it
should be. Therefore the breaks shown by the A drawing must
be in reality singular points in the figure.
    In the B drawing, it must be noticed, it is necessary for the
 sake of fair comparison to omit the half sections which are left
at each extremity of the figure, and to deal only with the re
maining eight sections which are comparable in length, and in
 the number of experimental points on them, with the nine sec
tions in the A drawing. It will also be noticed that the sums
 of the + and — errors are not very equally balanced ; but in
this case, as in some others which have been investigated (see,
 for instance, Ber. xxv. p. 1593), a drawing which gave better
   * The situations of the experimental points are indicated sufficiently here
by the approximate values in the columns headed p. e1 is the mean apparent
error of the points, e, is the error due to the existence of apparent errors
of improbable magnitude, e3 that due to runs of errors with the same
sign; E, the total error, =e1x«,2Xe3, and the relative error is the
ratio of the total error to the experimental error, e. The relative error, of
course, in an acceptable drawing should be nearly unity, as also should
the e.j and e3 errors, while e, and E should be nearly equal to the experi
mental error. For further details see Ptiil. Mag. xxxiii. p. 437.


3G4           Mr. S. U. Pickering on the Densities
equality here increased, instead of diminished, the total error
by giving higher values for the ?3 and e3 errors.
    In columns C and D are given the results of making
drawings which obliterate every alternate one of the true
breaks. The errors of such drawings, as will be seen, are far
in excess of what they should be, being nearly 19 and 33
times greater respectively than the experimental error, and
this, too, in spite of the fact that many of the curves for the
various sections were much more complicated than those used
in the A drawing, the lath having had to be pulled or twisted
considerably so as to get even an approximate agreement.
This remark applies also, though to a less extent, to the B
drawing.
    In three cases the sections composing the A figure are
drawn so as not quite to meet, namely at 42, 35, and 4 per
 cent. The densities must, of course, be a continuous function
 of the strength, and in every perfect drawing the sections,
 therefore, must meet ; but apparent discontinuity might
 be produced if there were two breaks very close together,
 with an insufficient number of points to show the existence
 of both. There is strong evidence from an independent
 source, as will be mentioned below, to show that two such
 breaks do actually exist in the neighbourhood of 42 per
 cent., and in the face of such evidence it has been considered
 safer not to strain the drawing so as to make the sections
 meet in cases where the lie of the adjacent points seems
 strongly to favour their not doing so.
     In the case of the break at about 4 per cent., the first
 section certainly seems inapplicable beyond 3 per cent.,
 while the second section, extending to 12 per cent., does not
 seem to apply back beyond 4 per cent. ; and in this case the
 intermediate experimental point at 3*5 per cent, would lie on
 a short connecting curve, for the drawing of which there are
 not sufficient data ; it has, therefore, been omitted entirely
 in the examination of the drawing (column A, Table II.).
     It remains to be seen whether the breaks in the densities,
 which thus seem to be so well established, correspond or not
  with the composition of the hydrates of soda which have been
 isolated in the crystalline condition. The examination of the
 freezing-points of soda solutions (Chem. Soc. Trans. 1893,
  p. 890) showed that from solutions up to 20 per cent, strength
 water crystallized, after which various definite hydrates to the
 number of eight or nine separated, till a strength corresponding
 to NaOHHjO was reached, beyond which the investigations
 were not extended.

   The above list gives the positions of the eight breaks
established by the densities, and of these, it will be seen, six
certainly agree with six of the hydrates which have been
isolated in the crystalline condition; and, although the remain
ing two occur in the region of weak solutions where no
hydrates were actually isolated, still the freezing-points in
this region show two well-marked breaks (and these were the
only two shown here), and both of these agree well with
those in the density-figure.
    Such a thorough agreement between the breaks and the
hydrates isolated must, I think, settle definitely that these
breaks are really due to the hydrates present in solution.
    The first isolated hydrate mentioned in the above list is a
complex one, NaOH,3^ H20, or, as I pointed out at the time (loc.
cit. p. 894) , probably a molecular compound of 8(NaOH,3H20)
with NaOH, 4H20. But the existence of such a complex
necessitates also the existence of the hydrate NaOH, 3H20,
though it itself was not actually isolated, and it is this tri-
hydrate, and not the complex of it with the tetrahydrate,
which seems to be shown by the densities. The composition
of the trihydrate and its complex differs but little, and the
density-determinations could not possibly have shown a break
corresponding to each. It is probably due to the existence of
the undiscovered break here that the densities appear to be
slightly discontinuous.
    A similar explanation may hold good in the case of the
apparent discontinuity at the tetrahydrate : two hydrates of
about this composition were, as a matter of fact, isolated, and,
although the analytical numbers pointed to their being
   * The composition of this hydrate, as given by experiment, was
NaOH, 5T\H20, containing: 30-01 per cent. soda. This value agrees
better with the position of the density-break than does the pentabydrate
entered in the table. The freezing-points, however, were scarcely
sufficient to settle whether it was a pentahydrate or the more complex
hydrate mentioned.

 366           Mr. S. U. Pickering on the Densities
actually isomeric, yet they may not really be so, for the com-
fosition of such hydrates cannot be determined very exactly,
  t may be remarked that the break at the tetrahydrate can
be more easily bridged over than any of the others : that at
12 per cent, is also a comparatively feebly marked break.
    There was some doubt as to whether the nonohydrate was
really isolated or not : the crystallization of it, if it occurred,
took place just at a point where the freezing-point figure
undergoes a great general change, where the crystallization
of water ceases and that of the hydrates begins, and it is
interesting to notice that this is just the point at which the
irregularities of the density-figure begin to be very prominent.
The values for the densities minus (1 + 'OlObp) show this fact
rather more clearly than those plotted in the diagram.
    It might be expected that at the point where a break occurs,
and where there must be present a larger amount of the
hydrate of the composition indicated by the break than there
 is in a solution of any other strength, the volumes of the
solutions would show a comparative minimum, and the densities
a comparative maximum. But this is not necessarily the case,
 unless the formation of the hydrate is always accompanied by
contraction, and the present results show that contraction does
 not always occur : indeed, most of the breaks seem to occur
at points where the densities are at comparative minima (in
the diagram a relative increase in the densities will be shown
by the figure rising towards the top of the page).
    I have examined the first differences of the densities and
five the values for them in Table III., but they do not form a
   gure nearly so suitable for examination as those already
mentioned. This is in part due to the smallness of the differ
ences between many of the consecutive determinations. All
that can be said of the nature of the differential figure is that
it is rectilineal within the limits of experimental error between
any two breaks. In this it resembles the results with potash,
calcium chloride, and calcium nitrate, and confirms Men-
 deleefFs statement as to the general nature of densities ;
though it must be remembered that in the two cases on
which this statement was chiefly founded—sulphuric acid and
alcohol— the first differences are conspicuously rectilineal
 (see Mendeleeff, " Solutions," and Chem. Soc. Trans. 1887,
 p. 779 ; Pickering, Ohem. Soc. Trans. 1890, p. 79, and Zeit.
f.physikal. Chem. vi. p. 10). The theoretical considerations
 which led Mendeleeff to conclude that the first differences
 must be absolutely rectilineal are, no doubt, mistaken ; they

                of Solutions of Soda and Potash.           367
depended on the supposition that never more than two
hydrates coexisted in solution, whereas my results with the
freezing-points of soda solutions prove that at least four or
five hydrates may coexist (Chem. Soc. Trans. 1893, p. 897).
   Table IV. gives the densities of soda solutions for every
round value of percentage strength, as constructed from the
readings of a figure similar to that in the diagram, the values
having been differentiated and the differences plotted out in
order to detect any errors which may have been made in
taking the readings.
                       Results with Potash.
   The results with potash (Table V.) are much less interesting
than those with soda. They have been plotted out in a variety
of ways, and indicate the probable existence of four breaks ;
but none of these are by any means well marked, and they
would not repay the trouble of a more critical examination.
The probable positions of these breaks are :—
      43*2 per cent, corresponding to KOH + 4'05 Hs0.
      35-4       „       „      „       KOH-4-5-68 HsO.
      19-0       „       „      „       KOH + 13 H20.
       8-0       „       „      „       KOH + 36 H,0.
   The first of these agrees with the recently isolated tetra-
hydrate (Chem. Soc. Trans. 1893, p. 298), and the second
occurs at the point where water ceases to crystallize from
the solution and the tetrahydrate begins to do so—a so-called
cryohydric point in fact. In many cases it has been found
that such a change of crystallization occurs at a point corre
sponding to the composition of a hydrate existing, according
to independent evidence, in solution.
   It is noticeable that the densities in the case of potash
increase at an increasing rate with the strength, the reverse
being the case with soda. The sixth column in Table V.
gives the volume of unit weight of the potash in solution cal
culated on the assumption that the water present occupies
the same volume as it would do if it were free.
   Table VI. contains the values for round percentage numbers.

            XXXIII. "Densities in the Earth's Crust."
                 By Rev. 0. Fisheu, M.A., F.G.S*
IN a letter which appears under the above heading in the
      February number of this Magazine, Mr. Jukes-Browne
expresses a wish that I would either admit or deny the value of
Professor Blake's criticism f upon my conclusions concerning
the comparative densities and thicknesses of the layers of the
earth's crust beneath the oceans and continents respectively.
   I do not feel much doubt about the correctness of my work
upon this subject, because it was under very careful con
sideration for several weeks, not only by myself but also by
Mr. Brill, whose mathematical ability is unquestionable ; and
I think Mr. Blake has thrown it aside as unworthy of his
consideration rather too hastily.               If he had more fully
mastered my results, he would not have stated in his first
paragraph that " the argument about the underlying layers
of the crust seems to depend on the greater density of the
superficial layer in continental than in oceanic areas "—which
is the exact opposite to the conclusion at which I have

arrived I * Mr. Blake does not appear to have realized the
argument from cap sectors, because he writes of a cap sector
beneath the ocean " and another cap sector beueath the land."
This was not the idea which I tried to work out.
     The subject will be made more intel
ligible by means of a diagram. The defi
nition of a cap sector was borrowed from
the fifth volume of the 'Account of the
 Great Trigonometrical Survey of India/
where approximate expressions for the ver
tical attraction at the apex A of a sector
 will be found. In my work a cap sector
 under consideration may be supposed to
be partly in the oceanic area and partly
 in the land ; the object being to de
 termine what different arrangements in
 regard to density and thickness of the
 layers in any part of it would have equal effects in contri
 buting to gravity at the point A, it being known from
 M. Faye's investigations t that, when A is on the ocean,
 gravity will be the same for all positions of A.
     The exact expression for the attraction at A for a complete
 circular cap is given in Pratt's ' Figure of the Earth,' 4th ed.
  § 6b ; and to alter it to the case of a sector it is only needful
 to replace 2tt by the sector angle *.
      His expression is of course obtained for the Newtonian
 law of attraction, and it would be absurd for the case of
 nature to assume any other J. Putting a for the sector angle
 instead of 2-tr, r for the density of the sector, t for its thickness,
  and a for the radius 0 A, it can obviously be expanded in a
 series so that
      vertical attraction at A

  where /(d), <f>(0), ^{8), &c. are (not "unknown" but) known
  functions of 6.

      I In tact the ocean could not be in equilibrium unless the spherical
   shells attracted to their common centre, which could only be in the cases
   of the laws of the direct distance and of the inverse square.

   This answers Mr. Blake's objection that " the definite point
 where the [supposed] fallacy comes in is the assumption that
/(e), <f>(6), yfr(e), &c. are independent." They are not inde
pendent, but are all functions of the same variable.
   I will now prove my proposition in a slightly different
form from that given in my book, out of regard to Mr. Blake's
remark that the method is independent of the law of gravi
tation.
   If we are at liberty to assume any other law than the New
tonian, it will be necessary to introduce a factor C to make
the dimensions right. Then the vertical attraction of a cap
sector, of density t and thickness t, may with this addition
be expressed in the above form. Let this be overlapped by
another cap sector, of thickness ts and density ra, or by any
number m of cap sectors. Then the vertical attraction of the
composite cap sector at A will be
   C { Zm(rt)/(6) + 2„(t£)#0) +tj(r£)+(e) + Ac. } .
   Now suppose this composite cap sector to be replaced
by another of the same areal dimensions with n layers of
thicknesses tf &c. and densities t7 &c. The vertical attraction
of this other cap sector at A would be
  C« { 2„(tV)/(*) +2,(T'^(tf) ¦+ 2 (^W+ic.},
and the difference between the vertical attractions which the
two sets of layers would produce would be
C«{ (2„(T<)-S»(Tr))/(0) +(lm(T^-tn(T'n)^ +&C. },

378                      Rev. 0. Fisher on
   If the attractions are the same in the two cases for any length
whatever of the sector, i. e. for any number of different
assumed values of 0, the coefficients of the several functions
of the variable must be separately zero. Therefore
                         &c. =    Ac.
 Hence what Mr. Blake says appears to be true, that if the
 vertical attraction at the aj>ex of a cap sector in the case of
 any assumed law of attraction can be expanded in the above
 form, the same proposition regarding the thicknesses and
 densities will hold good. This will be a remarkable
 property of the sphere, but it will by no means invalidate any
 conclusion we can draw from it in the case of the Newtonian
 law.
     Mr. Blake's second objection is that "the same form of
 equation would result if we had expressed the same supposed
 arrangement of layers differently, e.g. if we had taken them
 as non-overlapping, or if we had divided one into two, each
  of half the thickness." This remark shows that my critic
  has not appreciated the idea correctly. The quantity a in the
  expression is the radius to the outside of each layer, and this
  being the same for them all, they must overlap.
     The third objection is, that " it is necessary to assume the
  equality of the two sides to the same degree of approximation
  as there are layers in the crust." Not at all! I have
  deduced from the equality that two equal and similar areas
  (or " patches ") of any form, of which the layers, whether
  the same in number or not, and densities are so related, will
  produce the same gravitational effect at any place, one as the
  other. Now since gravity is known to be the same all over
  the ocean, we must nave the gravitational effect of an area of
  flat land the same as that of an oceanic area of the same size
  and form, and consequently the layers in these two areas
  must be related, as shown by the equations (A), no hypothesis
  as to equality in the numbers of layers being made. For
  example, let there be an area of land at P, and a similar one of
  ocean at Q. Take a point R in the ocean equidistant from P
  and Q ; then, remembering that the layers are understood
  to be underlaid by a centrobaric nucleus, the contribution of P

               " Densities in the Earth's Crust."            379
to gravity at R must be equal to that of Q to gravity at R :
otherwise gravity at R would not have its normal value.
Hence the layers in the area P must be related to those in Q
in the manner proved. But it is not by any means necessary
that the number m at P should be the same as the number n
at Q ; and in the particular case which I have shown to be
admissible at p. 244, there are at P on the land side two layers,
viz. the crust and the substratum, and at Q in the ocean four,
namely, the water, two in the crust, and the substratum.
   Mr. Blake further objects that the equations may be inde
terminate. If they are so, it does not follow that no conclusions
can be drawn from tbem, because some of the unknown
quant'ties may lie within known limits, which will give limiting
values for the others ; and this is the method which I have
followed. But for the full understanding of the subject
reference must be made to chapter xvii. of my book and to
chapter xxvi. (Appendix).
   Seeing that a further investigation of my equations, sug
gested by a letter from Mr. Jukes-Browne in ' Nature '*, led
me to modify the conclusions given in chap, xvii., I think it
will be as well to state the resuUs here, lest any of your
readers, not having seen the Appendix, should take the results
as stated in chap. xvii. as final :—
   " (1) The suboceanic crust dips less deeply into the sub
        stratum than does the continental crust at the sea
        board.
   " (2) The suboceanic crust is less dense in the lower than in
        the upper portion.
   " (3) The lower portion of that crust is also less dense than
        the substratum beneath it.
   " (4) The upper layer of the suboceanic crust is of high
        density, and quite thin when compared with the whole
        thickness.
   " (5) The substratum beneath the ocean is less dense than
        beneath the seaboard.
   " (6) The continental crust at the seaboard is of uniform
        density throughout, or, if it does consist of two layers
        of different density, one of them must be too thin to
        sensibly affect the gravitational phenomena."

XXXIV. Experiments on a Fundamental Question in Electro-
   Optics : Reduction of Relative Retardations to Absolute.
   By John Kerr, LL.D., F.R.S., Free Church Training
   College, Glasgow*.
TO prepare the way, I begin by recalling these well-known
       facts : that when light passes through an electro
statically strained medium in a direction perpendicular to the
line of electric force, it undergoes a uni-axal double refraction,
the optic axis coinciding with the line of force : that with
reference to this action, dielectrics are divisible into two
classes, the positive f and the negative %, which are optically
related to each other in the same way as the positive class of
crystals to the negative : that the intensity of the action, or
the quantity of optical effect per unit thickness of the dielec
tric, is measured by the product CF2, where C is a constant
which is characteristic of the medium, and F is the value of
the resultant electric force : that the effects are generally
 observed and examined still, as they were discovered first, by
 simple experiments with a pair of Nicol's prisms and a slip of
 strained glass or other phase-difference compensator.
    In every such experiment, the effect specified by the com
 pensator is a difference of phases, or a relative retardation ;
 and we may therefore view it as a resultant effect—that is
 to say, as the resultant, or the difference, of electrically
 generated absolute retardations of two component lights
 whose planes of polarization are parallel and perpendicular to
 the line of electric force. What, then, are the values of these
 two absolute retardations in any given case ? What are the
 two absolute components of any electrically generated relative
 retardation ? Such is the question here proposed for solution
 by experiment.
    As long ago as 1882, and several years following, I was
 much occupied at intervals with this interesting question.
 In the summer of 1885, in some experiments with the dielec
 tric CS2, I obtained results as decisive as could be desired.
 Other dielectrics, both solid and liquid, were tried after
 wards, but only with partial success, the experimental diffi
 culties being—in some cases—too much for my methods and
 time. To these cases I shall make no further reference, as I
 will keep to the one line of experiment, and to those experi
 ments in particular in which the indications were quite

          On a Fundamental Question in Electro- Optics.        381
regular and unmistakable. With these limitations, the
induction extends to four liquid dielectrics, two positive and
two negative : and all the experiments point clearly in one
direction.
    General Result.—It appears that the proper and immediate
optical effect of electric strain is a positive or negative retard
ation of the one component light whose plane of polarization
is perpendicular to the line of force, the sign of the retarda
tion being, of course, the same as the nominal sign of the
dielectric.    Therefore, of two vibrations which are (on
Fresnel's hypothesis) perpendicular and parallel respectively
to the line of force, it is only the latter that is immediately
affected by the electric strain, this vibration along the line of
force having its velocity of transmission retarded or accelerated
according as the dielectric is of the positive class or the
 negative.
    I venture to regard this result as a General Law of double
refraction in Electro-Optics, though the proof extends only
to four different dielectrics. As the best proof that I can
offer, I will merely give a condensed historical sketch of the
 experiments. It will be seen in this way how the law was
 first suggested and then confirmed by the phases of a new
 electro-optic effect. It will be seen also that the proof of the
 law is independent of all hypotheses, independent even of
 everything previously known in electro-optics.
    The Plate Cell is a piece used in all the experiments.

 arranged face to face in one block. The inner rectangle
 represents a tunnel (5f by 3^) which passes right through
the block. Inside are shown the conductors with supporting
frame, the shaded pieces being of brass and the unshaded
of plate glass. The lengths of the conductors, at right angles
to the plane of the figure (and parallel to the light), are 6^
and 7£ inches, the thickness of the cell being nearly 8 inches.
 By means of wires which pass through the wall of the cell,
 the internal conductors are connected with prime conductor
and earth, as indicated in the figure. It is understood, of
course, that the surfaces of the two conductors are well planed
and polished, all corners and edges rounded off, and the two
 fronting faces accurately parallel. The cell is closed in the
usual way, by panes of plate glass laid against the ends ; and
the whote block is kept together by a screw-press. Two
borings in one of the plates provide for the filling and
emptying. When the cell is put in order and charged with
CS2, and examined according to the old method, with a pair
of crossed nicols, it gives a very pure double refraction, and
acts well in all respects, except that (from deficiency of insu
lation) the largest effect is less than might be expected, hardly
amounting to one average wave-length of relative retardation.
But this defect is of no great consequence.
    The First Experimental Arrangement is shown in the next
diagram, in horizontal section through the lamp L and the
observer's eye E, but without strict regard to scale.

The plates are therefore parallel-surfaced, and of accurately
equal thickness, and are silvered on the back as mirrors ; and
in their working positions they are almost exactly vertical
and parallel, and at 45° to the light. A pencil of light LB,
which passes through a vertical slit in front of the lamp, is
incident on the first plate at B, and is divided, in the manner
shown in the diagram, into two pencils BDCG and BFHG ;
and from G the light proceeds anew as one pencil, and passes
through a narrow circular diaphragm *, which is fixed at E
in front of the observer's eye. The result of the arrangement
is, that when the p'eces are properly placed, the bright
vertical slit L, as seen from E in the direction EG, is crossed
by a set of interference-fringes. These are well defined in
position by reference to a constant black line, the image of a
fine wire which is fixed across the slit L. It may be assumed
without argument, that any small increase or decrease of
velocity of one of the pencils BF, CG, will produce a positive
or negative displacement of the fringes, at the rate of one
fringe-width of displacement for every wave-length of rela
tive retardation. As far as the assumption is required, it is
easily verified by the introduction of thin plates of glass into
the course of the light, anywhere between the two thick
plates ; and I find in this way, definitely, that (as the pieces
actually stand in the diagram and in all the experiments)
an ascent of the fringes indicates a relative retardation of the
pencil BF.
    There are two essential pieces that remain to be noticed, of
which the first is the electro-optic cell. It is shown in the
diagram how the laterally separated component pencils pass
 through the cell, BF through the electric field, and CG
 through the space electrically screened by the second con
 ductor, this conductor being always to earth. The last piece
 is a Nicol's prism N, which is placed in the path of either of
 the single pencils GE, LB, with its principal section laid (1)
 horizontally and (2) vertically. The design of the apparatus
 will now be apparent, which is, to give the means of detecting
 electrically generated changes of velocity of the light BF in
 two successive cases, when the plane of polarization is (1)
 perpendicular to the lines of force and (2) parallel to the lines
 of force. But in actual experiment there is a difficulty en
 countered at once, which appears at first sight to be insur
 mountable.
    Disturbance of the Fringes.—Suppose all the pieces placed as
 in the diagram, the cell nearly filled with carbon disulphide,
 the second internal conductor put permanently to earth, and
                  * Or otherwise, through a telescope.

384            Dr. John Kerr on a Fundamental
the fringes obtained in good form and position. When con
nexion is made between the first internal conductor and the
knob of a charged Leyden jar whose outer coating is to earth,
there is an immediate disturbance of the fringes, a set of large
and irregular movements, with deformations, ending in the
disappearance of the whole system in one or two seconds.
The effects are seen better when the first internal conductor
is connected permanently with the prime condnctor and an
attached Leyden jar ; for the potential can then be raised
regularly and very slowly from zero, and the full course of
the disturbance takes a longer time ; but in other respects
thephenomena are the same as before.
   When the fringes have been extinguished in this way by
the electric action, it is easy to recover them, either by putting
the prime conductor to earth, or by keeping the potential at a
sensibly constant value high or low for a little time. If with
this view the machine be kept working at a constant rate
throughout the experiment, the extinguished fringes return
gradually into the optical field, and in a little time (20 to 80
turns of the plate) they are as clearly visible as they were
before disturbance ; their forms also are good, and their
positions approximately constant, though they do not often
continue quite motionless in such circumstances even for a
fraction of a second. If the prime conductor be now put to
earth for a little, and the experiment be then repeated, the
disturbance passes through all the same phases as before,
though it is more violent at starting as the preceding interval
of rest is longer. All these effects come out equally well with
common light and with light polarized in the two principal
planes.
   This optical disturbance is evidently a remote effect of the
electric action, produced immediately—not by electric strain
—but by irregular changes of density in the medium. We
know that in the present cell, as in every like arrangement,
 the electric action throws the liquid into currents, which per
vade all parts of the cell and are very intense at high potential.
These material currents explain the changes of density ; for,
at starting, they give rise to a rapid process of mixture,
forcing denser masses upwards into the course of the light,
&c. ; and, afterwards, when the mixture is completed, they are
still accompanied by irregular variations of pressure in the
liquid. It should be easy therefore to imitate the effects by
means purely mechanical ; and of this I can give an example
from actual observation.
   A plate cell, about an inch thick and open at the top, was

                      Question in Electro- Optics.               385
charged with water, and placed in the course of the pencils
BFjOG, immediately behind the electro-optic cell ; and the
fringes were obtained in good form and position. The stirring
of this water gave a set of optical effects that could not be
distinguished from the former disturbance. And when the
fringes, extinguished in this way mechanically, were well
restored and made moderately steady by regular stirring kept
up for a time, I found that a disturbance of the same kind
could be obtained at pleasure, either by an interval of rest
 (the longer the better) , or by the addition of a little warm
water. But leaving this and returning to the electro-optic
experiment, I proceed to show how, in spite of these irregular
 movements of the fringes, and in the midst of them all, it is
possible to obtain a steady effect which corresponds perfectly
 to the known birefringent action of the medium.
    Regular Dislocation of the Fringes.—The electric arrange
 ments are the same as formerly, the two internal conductors
 being connected permanently, the first with the prime con
 ductor and the second with earth. There is only one change
 made in the apparatus : the nicol N is withdrawn, and a
 small rhomb of Iceland spar (about 3 centim. long) is put in
 its place at E, with principal section horizontal. In this wajr,
  the two systems of fringes which were given by the nicol N
  in succession are now given simultaneously, side by side, and
  each the exact prolongation of the other : the successive
  systems (a) of the next diagram are changed into the double
  system (£,7).
     The machine is now set in motion. The system (£, 7) is
 disturbed as was the system (a) formerly ; but in the midst
  of the disturbance, and as long as the fringes are clearly

  visible, the sets (/3) and (7) are seen to be relatively displaced,
  the system (/8, y) being changed into the system (8, e). The
  extent of the dislocation increases as the potential rises : that

386            Dr. John Kerr on a Fundamental
shown in the diagram, which is about three fourths of the
fringe-width, is not much below the highest that can be got
with the apparatus. The direction of the dislocation is con
stant, and indicates a relative retardation of that vibration in
the electric field which is parallel to the line of force ; and
this agrees with the known character of the medium CSj as
a positive dielectric.
   It is very interesting to watch the two sets of fringes (S)
and (e), and to see them sometimes moving rapidly and
very fitfully, but moving always as one system, with its two
parts dislocated unchangingly, except so far as the extent of
the dislocation varies with varying potential. It is equally
interesting to see the effect of spark-discharge of the prime
conductor, especially from high potential. At the instant of
the spark there is a sudden disappearance of the dislocation,
an extremely quick jump of the fringes into line with each
other, and this without perceptible check or sudden change of
any kind in the disturbance—motion common to the two sets
at the time. The best way of observing the effect is to take
sparks from prime conductor to earth at stated intervals,
while the machine is kept working at some constant rate.
The dislocation then reappears immediately after each of the
sparks, increasing regularly from zero as the potential rises,
and then increasing and decreasing quickly or slowly as the
potential rises and falls quickly or slowly. Even when the
potential falls most rapidly, as in spark-discharge, the direction
of the backward jump is always evident to the eye, otherwise
the disappearance of the dislocation in that case is so very
quick that one would call it instantaneous.
   Very little need be said upon the optical theory of these
phenomena. What must be remembered is, that each of the
sets of fringes (8) and (e) is due to the interference of two
such pencils as BF and CGr reunited in GE, the vibrations
being horizontal in one pair of interfering pencils, and vertical
in the other pair. With regard to changes of refringent
power which are due to mechanical disturbance, it may be
assumed that theses are independent of the direction of the
vibration : both pairs of pencils are therefore similarly and
equally affected at each instant, and the corresponding dis
placements of the two sets of fringes are at each instant similar
and equal, however irregularly they may vary from one instant
to another. It is otherwise with the birefringent action of
the medium ; for here the two pairs of pencils are differently
affected at each instant, and the difference is determined solely
by value of potential, so that the corresponding effect comes
out steadily in the midst of all the irregular changes which are
produced by mechanical disturbance of the dielectric.

                   Question in Electro-Optics.              387
   I think it must be admitted, that in this regular dislocation
of the fringes, there is a new and clear presentment of the
double refraction which is produced by electric strain. I
think also that the new effect is made all the more suggestive
by the regularity and perfect steadiness with which it comes
out in the midst of the disturbance.
   First appearance of the Law.—Before leaving the present
experiments I must notice one or two facts observed, but not
yet mentioned, that go towards a solution of the question
with which we started. The phenomena to which I refer were
seen clearly enough in some of the earlier experiments ; but it
was only at a later stage that they were well understood, and
they were then obtained more regularly.
    Beginning with the last form of the experiment, that with
the rhomb of Iceland spar as eyepiece. The spar, I should
mention, was always so placed that the plane of polarization
in the set of fringes (e) was vertical. What I have to notice
now is a peculiar feature of the jump of the fringes at the
instant of discharge. To a carefully strained, as to an un
strained attention, this jump appeared as a movement of the
 set of fringes (e) down to the level of the set (S), never as
a movement of the set (8) up to the level of the set (e). I
 must say, however, that the accuracy of this perception or
judgment was to myself in some degree doubtful, not because
 of any expectation that could have led to it, but because of
the very fugitive character of the phenomenon, and its partial
 obscuration in many cases by disturbance.
    Returning, therefore, to the first form of experiment, that
with the nicol N as eyepiece. When the principal section
 of N was horizontal, and the vibration directed therefore
along the line of force, there was a perfectly regular jump of
the fringes downwards at the instant of discharge : and at
high potential the effect was large and strikingly distinct.
When the principal section was vertical, there was nothing
regular of this kind seen in any of a large number of observa
tions : there were disturbance-movements at or about the
instant of discharge, as before and after, but nothing that
 could be accepted as a regular jump of the fringes at that
instant, always in one direction or always in the other. The
interpretation of these results is obvious. I have already
stated as a matter of observation, that a rise of the fringes
indicates a relative retardation of the pencil BF which passes
through the electric field. From the downward jump of the
 fringes in one of the two cases, we infer therefore that the
 pencil BF is in that case relatively accelerated in consequence
of discharge. But in the present experiment, and with reference
to the pencil BF in relation to the pencil OG, it is evident

388            Dr. John Kerr on a Fundamental
that relative acceleration and absolute are equivalent ; because
it is only in that division of the cell through which the pencil
BF passes that there is any sudden physical change at the
instant of discharge. It appears therefore, that to relieve the
liquid of electric strain is to relieve one of the vibrations
(that along the line of force) of an absolute retardation,
leaving the perpendicular vibration unaffected.
   In several of the later sets of these experiments with CS3
as dielectric, and with nicol N as eyepiece, I got what
appeared to be a perfectly clean liquid. The potential also
was made to vary regularly and very slowly; and from both
causes the disturbance was very much reduced. The effects
then were these :—Principal section of N horizontal : a slow
ascent of the fringes during the process of charge, pretty
regular, but often obscured and sometimes overpowered by
disturbance ; the contrary jump seen always at the instant of
discharge. Principal section of N vertical : irregular and
generally very small oscillations of the fringes during the
process of charge ; but no regular motion in one direction or
the other exclusively, either during the process of charge, or
at the instant of spark-discharge from high potential.
    From all these experiments with CSg, it seems to follow
that of the two principal vibrations, the only one immediately
and regularly affected by electric strain is that along the line
of force. This conclusion requires and well deserves to be
verified ; and I proceed to verify it by another method, or
rather by the use of new means.
    Tlie Second Experimental Arrangement.—The optical instru
ment here used is known as Jamin's Interference Refractor
for Polarized Light. For a description of it 1 might refer to
a paper already published * ; but I think I ought rather to
describe the apparatus here again. The essential pieces are
shown in horizontal section in the following diagram.

    Rand.S are large blocks of Iceland spar, of equal thickness,
their principal sections horizontal, and their faces parallel. A
pencil of light from a vertical slit L, passes through a Foucault's
prism H, and is polarized by it at 45° to the vertical, and
then enters the rhomb R. The two pencils emergent from R

pass immediately through a half-wave plate P, so placed as to
interchange the two planes of polarization. Ordinary pencil
and extraordinary in the crystal R become thus extraordinary
and ordinary in S, and the birefringent action of R is
neutralized by that of S. The light enters R and leaves S as
a single pencil ; but between P and S it passes as a couple of
pencils BF and CG, about 14 millim. apart, and polarized in
planes vertical and horizontal. The pencil emergent from S
is received at E through a Nicol's prism N, which is laid as
for extinction with the Foucault H. When all the pieces
have been properly placed, the slit L is seen crossed by a set
of interference-fringes ; and these are modified at pleasure by
fine screw-movements of the spar S.
   The electro-optic cell is not given in the diagram. It is
the same piece as that shown in the diagram of the First
Arrangement, and is placed here exactly as there, so that the
two laterally separated component pencils pass normally
through it, BF through the electric field, and CG behind the
second conductor.
   The only other optical piece employed in the experiments
is a Jamin's glass compensator*, which is placed immedi
ately in front of the spar S : it enables the observer to specify
small differences of retardation of the pencils BF and CG.
   The results obtained formerly (with nicol N as eyepiece)
were fully verified with the new apparatus. The method
finally adopted as the best was so similar to the former, and
the effects also, that any long description of the experiments
would be superfluous. But to give a fair view of the results,
I will describe one day's work.
   Final Experiments with CSS. —The first internal conductor
connected permanently with prime conductor without Leyden
jar, the liquid quite clean, and the conditions of electric work
perfect all day. The observations were taken in five succes
sive sets.
   First Set.—Plane of polarization of the pencil BF (through
the electric field) vertical, or perpendicular to fine of force ;
rise of fringes indicates relative retardation of that pencil.
When the fringes were obtained in good form and position,
the machine was started, and kept working at a constant rate
throughout the experiment. As before, the first effect was
a large disturbance, the fringes being displaced and deformed,
and disappearing altogether at the second or third turn of the
plate ; but in a little time (30 or 40 turns) they reappeared
in good form and approximately constant position. For
distinctness of effect, the central fringe was brought back to
               * Preston's ' Theory of Light,' p. 169.

390             Dr. John Kerr on a Fundamental
the line of reference (generally downwards) by a small screw-
movement of the spar S ; and then, at every spark from
 prime conductor to earth, there was a quick downward jump
 of the fringes, the effect being as distinct as possible from the
 irregular and slow and generally small movements that went
 on before and after the spark. As the experiment proceeded,
 the liquid was more thoroughly mixed, the disturbance de
 creased, and the effect came out much more purely. Sparks
 were taken repeatedly at every 3rd, 5th, 10th, 15th turn of
 the plate ; and the jump was there in every instance, and
 beautifully distinct. The extent of the jump varied from
 about $ of the fringe-width at every 5th turn of the plate, to
 about f at every 10th turn. I should add that the disturb
 ance-movements, though they were greatly reduced at last,
 were still such as to prevent any good static observation of
 the fringes.
    It is proved clearly by this set of observations, that when
 the plane of polarization is perpendicular to the line of force,
 the light is absolutely retarded by electric strain. The spars
 R and S were now turned round LE through 180°, and the
pieces were moved across the optic bench into good position.
    Second Set.—Plane of polarization of the pencil BF (through
the electric field) horizontal : rise of the fringes indicates a
relative retardation of that pencil. The method was the same
as in the first set, sparks being taken from prime conductor
to earth at regular intervals long and short. When the
initial disturbance was over, movements of the fringes were
still seen, sometimes in one direction and sometimes in the
other, but not exclusively or specially at the instant of dis
charge. These disturbance-movements were slow and gene
rally small ; and as the experiment proceeded they became
very faint, and were occasionally not seen at all for a little
time. As to the effect specially looked for, I need only say,
that in several scores of observations, taken at different poten
tials high and low, there was not a trace observed of a regular
jump of the fringes at the instant of discharge. It appears,
therefore, that when the plane of polarization is parallel to
the line of force, the light is neither retarded nor accelerated
by electric strain. The spars R and S were now turned back
through 180°.
    Third Set, the same again as the first. Many observa
tions were taken, and the former effects were obtained regu
larly ; but they were now more striking, because of the strong
contrast with the negative results of the set of observations
immediately preceding. The action appeared also to be
stronger than before, probably because of improved insulation.

                    Question in Electro- Optics.               391
The extent of the jump, taken at every 5th turn of the plate,
was now £ the fringe-width ; and at every 10th or 1 5th
turn, it was clearly £. I find in my notes that this large
jump of the fringes impressed me here, again and again, as a
thing peculiarly beautiful.
   Fourth Set, the same again as the second. The only ques
tion in this case was, whether it might still be possible, by the
most careful work and under the best conditions attainable,
to detect a very small jump of the fringes at the instant of
discharge. Many observations were taken at high potential,
some at the highest, but without a trace of effect of that
kind.
   Fifth Set, the same again as the first. The results of first
and third sets were recovered regularly. Sparks were then
taken, sometimes at every turn of the plate, sometimes oftener.
At every spark there was a very small downward jump of the
fringes, so small sometimes as to be barely caught, but quite
regular and beautifully distinct.
   Remarks.—The jump of the fringes was chosen as the
principal object of observation, because it was never quite
concealed, nor even much obscured, by the mechanical dis
turbance of the liquid ; but I should add that the contrary
motion, the gradual ascent of the fringes during the process
of charging, was generally evident enough in the experiments,
though not often undisturbed or quite regular in its course.
   The best observations were got when the fringes happened
to continue at rest through a sensible interval of time, including
the instant of discharge. The contrast between the two cases
was then very remarkable, especially at high potential : in the
one case, the beautifully clear jump so often mentioned ; in
the other case, no trace of a jump in either direction, generally
not even a perceptible shiver of the fringes at the instant of
strongest discharge. Instances of this kind occurred not very
rarely in the experiments; and there could be no contrast more
striking than that between the phenomena in the two cases.
   From what I know of the apparatus and its performance,
I am sure that no regular and abrupt retardation or accelera
tion amounting to as much as the hundredth part of an average
wave-length could have escaped observation in the experiments.
It will be remembered also that the jump of the fringes at
high potential extended to four fifths of the fringe-width.
With reference, therefore, to the dielectric CS2, and the two
principal vibrations parallel and perpendicular to the line of
force, it appears that the regular effect of the electric strain
upon one of the vibrations is a positive retardation, while
upon the other vibration there is very probably no effect

392             Dr. John Kerr on a Fundamental
 whatever, and certainly no effect as large as the eightieth part
 of the former.
    Second positive dielectric : a paraffin oil, specific gravity
 '845. This liquid was far inferior to CS2 electrically and also
 as an optical medium. The method of experiment finally
 adopted as the best was a little different from that with CSS.
 The prime conductor had its capacity enlarged by connexion
 with a Leyden jar ; the machine was kept working at a
 constant rate,and the prime conductor was partially discharged,
 at short and regular intervals, by spark upon the knob of the
 first internal conductor, which was of course discharged in
 each interval. The phenomenon looked for was a quick
 motion of the fringes at the instant of the spark ; that is, at
 the instant of electric charging of the liquid.
     (1) Plane of polarization of the pencil BF (through the
 electric field) vertical : rise of fringes indicates relative
 retardation of this pencil. At the instant of the spark there
was a quick upward jump of the fringes through something
like £ of the fringe-width, generally followed by a set of large
and comparatively slow disturbance-movements. In most
cases also, immediately after the spark, the observer was able
to detect the contrary jump quite clearly, by laying his finger
on the knob of the first conductor. Through a long set of
observations taken at different potentials, the upward jump of
the fringes at the instant of charging was obtained with
perfect regularity ; and—amplitude excepted—the effect was
not inferior to that in CS2.
    (2) Plane of polarization of the pencil BF horizontal :
rise of fringes indicates relative retardation of BF. Many
observations were taken at different potentials, high and low.
There were sluggish and irregular disturbance-movements,
great and small, but no trace of a regular jump of the fringes
in one direction or the other at the instant of the spark.
There could be no doubt as to the true meaning of these
results. In this positive dielectric, as in CSS, the vibration
along the line of force is retarded by electric strain, and the
perpendicular vibration is unaffected.
   First negative dielectric : oil of colza. This liquid also was
far inferior to CS2, especially as an optical medium. The
method of experiment followed with paraffin was retained
hero as the best : the first internal conductor was charged by
spark from the prime conductor at regular intervals, and was
put to earth for a moment in each interval.
    (1) Plane of polarization of the pencil BF vertical : rise
of fringes indicates relative retardation of BF. The fringes
were generally curved and very imperfect at the beginning

                    Question in Electro- Optics.               b„6
of an experiment ; but a few successive charges brought them,
after some disturbance, into permanently good form , and then
there was a quick downward jump seen always at the instant
of the spark. And, as in the contrary case of paraffin, this
jump was a thing as distinct as possible from the sluggish and
irregular disturbance-movements by which it was generally
followed. When the spark was taken at every 10th turn of
the plate, the potential was about as high as the liquid could
bear, and the extent of the jump was fully £ of the fringe-
width. In the course of a long set of observations, this
downward jump of the fringes at the instant of charging was
seen with perfect regularity, and always distinctly. In this
case, therefore, the regular optical effect of electric strain was
an acceleration.
   (2) Plane of polarization of the pencil BF horizontal :
rise of fringes indicates relative retardation of BF. When
the fringes were imperfect at starting, the effects of a few
successive charges were the same as in the first case, irregular
displacements and changes of inclination, the fringes generally
rising and falling in their lower and higher parts till they
came into permanently good form. Afterwards there were
smaller disturbances always present in this case as in the
former ; but neither there nor here were they such as to
interfere ultimately with exact observation. The experiment
was carried on for some time till the liquid was well mixed
and the fringes good. Many observations were then taken,
some of them at highest potential ; but there was no trace of
a jump ever seen at the instant of the spark. In this liquid,
therefore, as in carbon disulphide and paraffin, the only one
of the two principal vibrations which is affected by electric
strain is that along the line of force ; but as the present
dielectric is of the negative class, the retardation produced is
negative.
   Second negative dielectric : seal oil. From want of homo
geneity this liquid was very defective optically, the image of
the slit L being much deformed and sometimes broken by
streaks. The defect was remedied in a good degree by strong
charges given to the liquid on both sides of the second con
ductor. The method of experiment was the same as with oil
of colza.
   (1) Plane of polarization of the pencil BF vertical : rise
of fringes indicates relative retardation of BF. At first, the
electricity produced very large displacements and deformations
of the fringes, in the midst of which there was no regular
effect to be seen ; but as the experiment went on, and the
medium improved, -the expected effect came out distinctly,

394     Mr. E. C. Bimington on an Air-Core Transformer
a quick downward jump of the fringes at or immediately after
the instant of the spark. Under good optical conditions, and
at potentials high and low, the effect was perfectly regular,
and was as distinct and pure as that in oil of colza, though
apparently not quite so large.
    (2) Plane of polarization of the pencil BF horizontal :
rise of fringes indicates relative retardation of BF. The
disturbance of the fringes was greatly reduced as the experi
ment went on, till at last there was nothing left but a set of
slow movements, very irregular and very small, sometimes
invisible. In the midst of these as in their absence, and in a
long set of observations taken at different potentials from low
to highest, there was no trace ever seen of a jump of the
fringes at the instant of the spark. It appears, therefore, that
in this negative dielectric, as in oil of colza, the total optical
effect of electric strain is an acceleration of the vibration
 which is directed along the line of force.
    The conclusion to be drawn from the preceding experiments
has been stated already by anticipation ; but I repeat it finally
in other terms as follows :—
    If light jmss through an electrostatically strained medium at
right angles to the lines offorce, and be represented by two com
ponent lights whose planes of polarization are respectively
parallel to the lines offorce and perpendictdar, then the proper
and immediate optical effect of the electric strain is a change of
velocity of the latter component *.
    The use of the words proper and immediate in this state
ment may be thought objectionable ; but some such words are
required for the purpose here chiefly intended, which is, to
exclude those undoubtedly remote effects of electric action
that appeared as disturbances in all the experiments.

closing the secondary, since, when the latter is open

III (Plate X.) when there is no leakage, and A comes midway
between 0 and B, so that 0A=±0B; also 06=^2 = 1414,
OA = *707,and, if the point 0 represent 100 divisions, AC =15^
divisions.
   The curve OCB' represents the critical part when fi — 'l;
0B' = 1-002 and OA' = -578 = "577 OB'; also A'C'=-12
division. Hence we see that the effect of magnetic leakage

     when the Frequency is below a certain Critical Value.  405
is to shift the point A' corresponding to the maximum value
of j- from midway between 0 and B' and towards B'.
   The author was enabled, through the kindness of Dr.
Fleming, to try an experiment in the meter-testing room of
the Electric Supply Company, using a Kelvin balance for
measuring the currents through the primary coil. The alter
nating P.D. was obtained from the terminals of a transformer
capable of giving over 100A ; and as the maximum current
ever taken was 6|A about, the P.D. may be assumed constant.
The frequency was 83*3.
   The air-core transformer used for the experiment consisted
of two coils wound one inside the other, and of No. 20 B.W.Gr.
cotton-covered wire. The inner coil was used as primary
and the outer as secondary.
   Each coil consisted of 5 layers, of 125 turns per layer.
   Calculating the time-constants or values of g for the coils
by Perry's approximate formula, they worked out as '00121
for the inner coil or primary, and "00152 for the outer coil or
secondary
                     P=2ttx 83-3 = 523.
Hence
                  «!= -00121x523= -633,
                  «2=-00152x523 = -7y5.
   The values of ax and a2 were probably smaller than these
values, as the coils became fairly warm from working ; more
over the primary had the leads and the resistance of a Kelvin
balance in series with it.
   Take, then, «x as '5, and «2 as '7.
   The observed value of      was T032.
   Substituting these values in equation (13) makes /3='57,
or a magnetic leakage of 43 per cent., if the P.D. were a true
sine function. This seems a rather large value for the leak
age ; and it is probable that the leakage was considerably less
than this, but that the P.D. was not a pure sine function, and
on this account the ratio j- was less than it otherwise would
have been.                  1
   The above experiment was only a rough one, but it showed
an increase of 3-2 per cent, in the impedance of the primary
on closing the secondary : moreover the time-constants of the
coils were not suited for giving the best effect with the

frequency employed ; but, as is seen from the previous theo
retical investigation, by employing a primary and a secondary
having equal time-constants suitably related to the frequency,
and a pure sine function P.D., an increase of impedance of
from 10 to 12 per cent, ought to be obtained; 15£ per cent,
increase could never be obtained in practice, as there must
always be some magnetic leakage.
   In transformers with iron cores this effect would never be
likely to escape notice as the values of ^ would be so large
that the critical frequency would be very small, so that for all
frequencies employed in practice the impedance of the primary
would diminish on closing the secondary. The iron core
would also distort the current from a pure sine function.
XXXVI. Graphic Representation of Currents in a Primary
   and a Secondary Coil. By Prof. G. M. Minchin, M.A.*
IN this short paper is contained a solution of the following
      problem :— A primary and a secondary coil occupy given
positions ; an alternating E.M.F., expressed by a sine function
of the time, being applied to the primary, it is required to
represent graphically the impedances and phases of the primary
and secondary currents for all speeds of alternation. (No iron
cores employed.)
   The occasion of this communication was a paper read
to the Physical Society on the 27th of October, 1893,
by Mr. Rimington, in which the subject was presented in a
different manner.
   Adopting the notation of Mr. Rimington 's paper, let L, M,
N, rlf r2 be, respectively, the coefficient of self-induction of
the primary coil, the coefficient of mutual induction, that of
self-induction of the secondary, and the resistances of the
primary and secondary. Also let n be the frequency of the
alternation, i. e. the number of alternations per second ;
p = 2irn; E = maximum value of the impressed E.M.F.
Then, if the secondary coil is open (or r2 = oo ), the impedance,
I, of the primary is given by the expression
                         l^VVf + U?.

                      b=(Hrl + hr2)
Then, assuming that the E.M.F., namely e, applied to the
primary is at any time, t, given by the equation
                         e=E sin (p< + </>),
the periodic parts, cx and c2, of the currents at this time in
the primary and secondary, respectively, are given by
                       Ci =      .      sin pt,

                4>=ir ~X> wnere tan ir=~'
It thus follows that the actual impedances, I, I', of the pri
mary and the secondary coil during the working of both are
given by

   To represent I, I', and the phase-angles 9 and <j> graphically
is the problem in hand. Take two rectangular axes, Ox, Oy,
and along the first lay off the numerical values of p* ; then,
taking Iry to represent the value of P corresponding to any
value of p (or x) , where F is any constant which (according
to the numerical values of L, M, N, &c.) may be required
to confine the figure to any convenient size, we have

It is easily seen that both hyperbolas cut the axis of x in the
same two points. These points are at the left of 0 and not
shown, since negative values of x (i. e. p2) do not belong to
the physical problem. Moreover, the x of H is the geo
metric mean between the intercepts of the hyperbola on Ox.
    Again, the centre of the hyperbola (0) is at the point C
whose coordinates are

tion is easily known, since the tangent of its inclination to
Ox is OT-
    Hence we have at once the asymptotes, Cy, CS and one
 point, H, of the hyperbola, from which the curve is rapidly
 drawn by the well-known rule that the parts intercepted
 between the curve and its asymptotes on every line drawn
 through H are equal. The other branch of this hyperbola is
 not represented, as it is irrelevant.
    We shall now show that the primary hyperbola can be
 drawn from the secondary. Representing the values of 1^
 and 1/ for all values of x by ordinates, so that Pyi=Ii2,
 A-2y2=I22, we see that
                         tfy^Ux + rf,                           (7)

 so that the impedances are now represented by two right
 lines, AL and A'L'. (These are the impedances of the coils,
 each treated separately, as before explained.)
     The primary line (7) passes, of course, through A, and
 always intersects the primary hyperbola in a point, Q, having
 a positive abscissa, viz.,
                             2LN-M''
  which is < twice abscissa of H. Hence for some speed less than
  that represented by the abscissa of Q the ratio =r- attains a

  value is easily found ; for, no matter what curve AQP may
  be, if y is the ordinate of a point on it, and yx the correspond

then, taking any value, ON, of x, draw the ordinate NP, and
we have
          y=FN; y2=R'N; y=PN;i; = VN.

which shows that the point P on the primary hyperbola is
deduced from the point P' on the secondary by the simple
 construction or calculation of a fourth proportional. (Though
not belonging to the physical problem, it may be noted that
 one asymptote of the primary hyperbola is the parallel to Oy

XXXVII. An Apparatus to show, simultaneously to several
   hearers, the Blending of the Sensations of Interrupted
   Tones. By Alfked M. Mayer, Ph.D.*
IN the March number of this Journal, of the current year,
      I described several forms of apparatus used in my ob
servations on the frequency of the interruptions of simple
sounds required to blend these sounds and obtain from them
continuous and uniform sonorous sensations. These experi
ments gave the data for the law connecting the pitch of a
sound with the duration of its residual sensation.
   The various apparatus described in that paper are, how
ever, unsuited to exhibit the phenomena to more than one
hearer at a time. To enable many hearers to observe the
phenomena simultaneously, I have devised the apparatus
shown in the figure.
                b
   A brass tube, T, of 1*25 centim. interior diameter and 1*8
centim. long, is cemented in a hole in the bottom of the glass
                  • Communicated by the Author.

412       Blending of the Sensations of Interrupted Tones.
flask A ; which is a common form of flask, used by chemists.
When "the tube T is closed the air in the flask resounds
powerfully to the sound of an UT3 fork, F ; but when this
tube is open, the resonator resounds so feebly as to be just
audible at the distance of several feet from the flask.
    If the tube be closed and opened several times in a second,
we shall have loud explosions with faint interposed sounds.
The opening and closing of the tube is effected by a per
forated disk, D, revolving on a rotator, R. The tube T is
placed in the circular path of the 16 holes which perforate
the disk, with the mouth of the tube quite close to the surface
of the disk. A short tube B, with flanges on it, slides neatly
over the tube T, and the flange of B is pressed against the
surface of the disk D by the helical spring S.            By this
arrangement the tube T is fully opened when a hole in the
disk coincides with the opening of the tube, and is entirely
closed when the flange of B is between the holes in the disk
and gently pressing against its surface.
    On slowly rotating the disk, while the fork is kept in
vibration by an electromagnet, we have the perception of
powerful beats which become more and more frequent as the
velocity of rotation of the disk is increased till, with a certain
velocity, the beats blend into a smooth continuous sound,
which is that given by the fork when held near its proper
resonator. This sound of UT3 as given by the blending of
its interrupted sounds is, however, accompanied by another
and graver sound ; but the existence of this additional sound
 does not interfere with the clear perception of the blending
 of the interrupted sounds of UT3. With this apparatus the
 blending of interrupted sounds has been shown to the entire
 satisfaction of a large audience.
    To enable one readily to make the apparatus, the following
 dimensions are given. The diameter of opening of mouth of
 flask is 3 centim. Depth of flask, 16"25 centim. Capacity of
 flask, including tube T, 483 cubic centim.
    In the figure the rotator, R, is shown driven by a cord. It
 is necessary, if an accurate determination is to be made of the
 duration of the residual sensation, to drive the disk by gearing
 as is done in the apparatus 1 have used. When the disk is
 driven by a cord one can show the blending of the interrupted
 sounds, but an accurate determination of the duration of the
 residual sensation is prevented by the friction which exists
 between the flange of B and the disk, though these surfaces
 are coated with a film of oil.

The Mean Density of the Eabth : an Essay to which the Adams
   Prize was adjudged in 1893 in the University of Cambridge. By
   J. H. Potnting, Sc.D., F.R.S. (Charles Griffin and Company.)
THE study of this work of Professor Poynting will be of the
       utmost value not only to anyone who proposes to engage on
the special subject with which it deals, viz., the combined mathe
matical and experimental determination of the constant of gravita
tion—but also to the fairly large class of investigators who, in other
experimental researches, have to deal with the measurement of ex
tremely small quantities and with the action of disturbing influences
both small and great. The chief value, indeed, of the Essay consists
in the help which it affords in anticipating and allowing for such
disturbances, and in the fairly complete historical resumeoi the work
which has been done, with the same object, by previous investigators.
    A work of this kind would lose much of its value if it did not
contain a fair record of failures as well as of successes ; and the
author has not omitted to point out the defects which experiment
from time to time revealed in his originally projected methods—
as, for example, when in 1888, after he had supposed that the
work was finished, he was led to suspect the existence of a tilting
of the whole floor of the room in which his balance was placed by
the moving of the large attracting mass from one position to
another; an unfortunate circumstance which necessitated the
employment of a second attracting mass whose action was such as
to diminish the effects which were to be observed.
    The author is to be congratulated on the strictly scientific title
under which he describes his work—" The Determination of the
Mean Density of the Earth," or " The Determination of the Con
stant of Gravitation," instead of the utterly unmeaning " Deter
mination of the Weight of the Earth," which is found in even such
a work as Arago's ' Popular Astronomy,' and which is a characteristic
of too much of our modern popular science a la mode. Have we
not seen in some old and popular treatise a picture of " the room
in which Mr. Baily weighed the Earth " ? It is to be hoped that
 some day our leading authorities will be induced to abandon that
fatal dogma which is still, unfortunately, " of great emolument"—
that Science, to be pojmlar, must, above all things, be inaccurate.
    "We have said above that the chief value of the work consists in
 its helpfulness and suggestiveness, although it is tolerably certain
that, with all the precautions which the author has taken to ensure
 success, the value which he has found for the mean density (viz.
 5-493) must be very near the truth. He himself points out (p. 107)
 that with all apparatus the greater the size the greater are the
 errors produced by air-currents, a fact of which he was unaware
 when his apparatus was designed ; and that, if he were to start
 with a new design, he would certainly make the whole arrange
 ment on a smaller scale—a great change which was advocated and
 justified by Professor Boys in a preliminary paper on the Cavendish
 experiment, read before the Royal Society in May 1889. There

414                 Notices respecting New Books.
is something amusing in the contrast between the dimensions of
the apparatus used by Professors Poynting and Boys. Thus, the
former uses two attracted spheres made of an alloy of lead and
antimony, the masses (not quite equal) being each over 21 \ kilo
grammes with diameters each nearly 10 centimetres, while one
large attracting sphere has a mass of over 153 kilogrammes with
a diameter of 30£ centimetres, the other being of half the size ;
while of Professor Boys's apparatus it is sufficient to say that it is
of the " waistcoat pocket " order of magnitude.
   The author very justly summarizes his account of the previous
methods for the determination of the mean density (those depend
ing on plumb-line experiments, involving the calculation of the
attraction of mountain masses, &c.), when he says (p. 39), " All this
tends to confirm the conclusion that our knowledge of the dis
tribution of the terrestrial matter is not yet sufficiently exact to
enable us to obtain good values of the mean density of the Earth
from the observed attraction of terrestrial masses. Bather must
we assume the mean density from laboratory experiments, . . . ; "
and of this latter kind are his own and those of Professor Boys.
The former, or " Common Balance Method," may be roughly
described as consisting in the suspension of two nearly equal
heavy spheres from the ends of the arms of a common balance,
while a very large attracting sphere is brought close under each of
the former spheres successively, its attraction (chiefly on the sphere
just above it) altering the position of equilibrium of the balance.
    Incidentally (p. 78) Professor Poynting does a service to experi
mentalists in advocating the great value of what he calls " the
double-suspension mirror method" of measuring small deflexions,
as compared with the method of attaching the mirror to the
moving needle commonly employed in electrometers and galvano
meters, the latter multiplying the angular deflexion by 2 only,
 while the former, as employed by Professor Poynting, multiplied
the angular deflexion of the balance by 150.
   With a view to a second edition of this Essay, it may be well to
point out a few things that might be altered with advantage.
Doubtless, from the author's long familiarity with his symbols, he
has not thought it worth while to notice that the symbols M and A
in the mathematical investigation (pp. 109 &c.) are used each in
two senses even in the same equation : at first they are, re
spectively, the mass of the large attracting sphere and the mass
of one of the attracted spheres with a narrow diametral cylinder
removed ; while immediately afterwards (and in the same equation,
                                 M
end of p. 112) A stands for tt , where now M means the "mass
deflexion," and B the " rider deflexion." This is, for a time,
somewhat confusing. Fiually, a few misprints may be noted:
line 16, p. 109, for n read n'; line 14, p. 110, for fig. 1 read
fig. 17; line 1, p. Ill, for 1— g- read I— „-; line 3, p. 115
brackets omitted in denominator at left side ; together with a few
others too obvious to escape notice.

For. Memb. Geol. Soc.
    In previous communications the author has maintained that the
different masses of eruptive rock which occur within the sunken
tract of country lying between Lake Mjoseu and the Langesunds-
fjord are genetically connected, and have succeeded each other in a
regular order. The oldest rocks are the most basic, the youngest
(except the unimportant dykes of diabase) are the most acid, and
between the two extremes he has found a continuous series.
    He is now preparing a detailed monograph on this series of
eruptive rocks, and in the present communication he gives an
 account of the results of his work on the oldest members.
    Several bosses of basic plutonie rock, now forming a series of
dome-shaped hills, lie along a north-and-south fissure-line. The
most northerly is that of Brandberget in the parish of Gran, about
50 or 60 kilometres N.N.W. of Christiania, and the most southerly
occurs at Dignaes on Lake Tyrifjord, about 35 kilom. W.N.W. of
the same town. The prevailing rock in these bosses is a medium
or coarse-grained olivine-gabbro-diabaso ;' but pyroxenites, horn-
blenditos, camptonites, labrador-porphyrites, and augite-diorites also
occur. Analyses of the typical rocks from three localities on
the north-and- south line are given, and tho conclusion is reached
that the average basicity of the rocks forming different bosses
decreases from north to south.
    The contact-metamorphism is referred to ; and tho presence of
hypersthene in the altered Ogygia-shales, coupled with its absence
from the same shales where they have been affected by quartz-
syenite, leads the author to the conclusion that the chemical nature
of the intrusive rock does, in certain cases, produce an influence on
the character of the metamorphism.
    Innumerable dykes and sheets of camptonite and bostonite are
associated with tho above-mentioned plutonie bosses. These are
regarded by the author as having been produced by differentiation
from a magma having the composition of the average olivine-gabbro-
diabase. Analyses are given, and it is proved that a mixture of nine
parts of the average camptonite and two of the average bostonite
would produce a magma having the composition of the average
olivine-gabbro-diabase. The petrographical variations, such as the
occurrence of pyroxenites and augite-diorites, in the plutonie masses
themselves are described, and attributed to differentiation under

416                      Geological Society :—
 physical conditions unlike those which gave rise to the camptonites
 and bostonites.
    In discussing the general laws of differentiation the author
 points out that it must have taken place before crystallization to
 any extent had occurred, because there is a marked difference in
 mineralogical composition between the rocks occurring as bosses and
 those occurring as dykes ; and, further, that it is dependent on the
 laws which determine the sequence of crystal-building, in so far as
 the compounds which, on given conditions, would first crystallize
 are those which have diffused to the cooling margin, and so produced
 a contact-stratum, of peculiar chemical composition, before any
 crystallization had taken place.
    2. ' On the Sequence of Perlitic and Spherulitic Structures (a
Rejoinder to Criticism).' By Frank Rutley, Esq., F.G.S.
    This paper relates to the order in which the perlitic and spheru
litic structures have been developed in a felsitic lava of Ordovician
age from Long Sleddale, Westmoreland. The author having de
scribed this rock in a paper, published in the Quarterly Journal of
the Society in 1884, and the accuracy of the views then expressed
having been questioned, now endeavours to confirm his original
statements, adducing in support fresh observations made upon this
and other rocks of a similar kind.
    3. 'Enclosures of Quartz in Lava of Stromboli, etc., and the
Changes in Composition produced by them.' By Prof. H. J.
Johnston-Lavis, M.D., F.G.S.
   The author describes the existence of enclosures of quartz in a
lava-stream at the Punta Petrazza on the east side of Stromboli,
and also in the rock of the neck of Strombolicchio. He describes the
effects of the rocks upon the enclosures, concluding that the quartz
has undergone fluxion but not fusion, and has supplied silica to the
containing lavas, thus causing an increase in the amount of pyroxene
and a diminution in the amount of magnetite in the portions of
those lavas that surround the inclusions and raising the percentage
of silica. He suggests that such a process at greater depths and
higher temperaturo may, under certain conditions, convert a basic
rock into a more acid one, so that possibly the andesite of Strombo
licchio may have been of basaltic character at an earlier period of
its progress towards the surface. He offers the suggestion that
other rocks or minerals once associated with the quartz have been
assimilated by the magma.

   1. 'The Purbeck Beds of the Vale of Wardour.' By the Rev. W.
R. Andrews, M.A., F.G.S., and A. J. Jukes-Browne, Esq., B. A., F.G.S.
   The authors have obtained better evidence than previously

                Picrite and other Associated Rocks.               417
existed for calculating the thicknesses of the several parts of the
Pnrbeck series in the Vale of Wardour, and comparing the different
subdivisions as developed in that Vale with those exposed in other
localities. Putting together 22-24 feet of basement-beds of the
Lower Purbeck strata seen in the Wockley section, 21 feet in Bidge
Quarry, and 17 feet in Teffont Quarry, more than 60 feet of Lower
Purbeck Beds are actually seen, and allowing for the gap between the
Wockley and Bidge sections, 70 feet seems a fair estimate of the
average thickness of the Lower Purbeck strata.
   In the Teffont and Chicksgrove quarries, a little over 12 feet may
bo measured between the basal clay of the Middle Purbeck Beds and
the Cinder Bed ; while the great cutting on the Teffont line shows
19 feet of strata above the Cinder Bed, and the beds of Dinton
cutting may be all on a higher horizon ; so that an estimated
thickness of 32 feet for the Middle Purbeck Beds is probably below
the mark.
   The clay and sand in the Dinton cutting must be 18-20 feet
thick, and between its summit and the top of the second seam of
calcareous grit there is a thickness of at least 8 feet. This grit
forms the floor of Dinton Well, about 40 feet deep ; hence there is
a thickness of at least 66 feot of Upper Purbeck strata, and probably
more than 2 and less than 12 feet in addition.
   A comparison is instituted between the Purbeck Beds of the Vale
of Wardour and those of the Dorset coast, etc., and some remarks
are made upon the physical conditions under which the beds were
deposited.
   2. ' On a Picrite and other Associated Bocks at Barnton, near
Edinburgh.' By Horace W. Monckton, Esq., F.L.S., F.G.S.
   The object of this paper is to describe a cutting on a new railway
in Barnton Park, where there is an excellent exposure of picrite.
It consists of sorpentinized olivine, augite, mica, iron oxide, and a
littlo plagioclase-felspar, with a variable amount of interstitial
matter. In many respects it comes very near to the picrite of
Inchcolm, which island is 4| miles north of Barnton cutting. It
differs from the picrite of Bathgate, and the probability is that the
Barnton rock is an offshoot from the same magma as that which
supplied the Inchcolm rock.
   Besides the picrite other igneous rocks from the same cutting are
described—in particular, a rock with porphyritic crystals of a green
mineral replacing olivine, or more probably augite, and a great
quantity of brown mica in small flakes and crystals. It is suggested
that the name of mica-porphyrite might be given to this rock.

   The following communications were read :—
   1. ' On the Stratigraphical, Lithological, and Paloeontological
Features of the Gosau Beds of the Gosau District, in the Austrian
Sal/.kammergut.' By Herbert Kynaston, Esq., B.A.
   This paper, after referring to the previous literature of the
subject, treats of the situation and physical aspects of the Gosau
Valley, the distribution of the Gosau Beds, their stratigraphy, palae
ontology, and geological horizon, and the physical conditions under
which they wore deposited, and a comparison is instituted between
the Gosau Beds and the equivalent beds of other areas. The author
shows that Hippurites occur at two horizons in the Gosau Beds,—a
hippurito-limestone immediately above the basement-conglomerate
boing characterized essentially by Hij>pwites cornu-vaccinum, which
is overlain by ActceonelUi- and A'm'/i«a-limestones and an estuarine
series, ana above these is a second hippurite-limestone characterized
essontially by Hippurites organimns. It is pointed out that Toucas
similarly distinguishes two hippurite-zones in Southern France ; the
lower, characterized essentially by //. cornu-vaccinum, being placed
by him at the top of the Turoniau System, whilst the second, with
H. organising, is referred to the summit of the Senonian ; and the
author gives reasons for regarding the Gosau zones as the equiva
lents of those of the South of France, in which case the Gosau Beds
will represent the uppermost Turonian and the whole of the Seno
nian, i. e., the zones of Holaster jrfaniig, Micragter, MarsH/ntes, and
Belemnitella mucronata in England, whilst the upper unfossiliferous
beds may be the equivalents of the Danian Beds.
   The strata are, on the whole, of shallow-water origin, and were
deposited in shallow bays in the Upper Cretaceous sea of Southern
and Central Europe, on the northern flanks of the Eastern Alps.
Probably towards the close of Upper Cretaceous times the southern
area of the Gosau District was cut off from the sea to form a lake-
basin in which the upper unfossiliferous series was deposited.

   3. ' Boring on the Booysen Estate, Witwatersrand.' By D.
Telford Edwards, Esq.
   An account is given of a boring on the Booysen estate, situated
about 2 miles from Johannesburg, and about 5000 feet south of the
nearest point of outcrop of the ' Main Reef of the Witwatersrand.
The 'Bird-Reefs' crop out generally at a distance of 4000 feet
south of the Main Reef.
   The borehole, 1020 feet deep, passed through sandstones (often
micaceous), quartzites, and conglomerates, the last-named having a
collective thickness of 91 feet 7 inches, the two thickest reefs
being respectively 26 and 22 feet thick. The dip of the beds
was 35°. Traces of gold were obtained. All the reefs wero
highly mineralized, principally with iron-pyrites, and belonged to
the ' Bird-Reef ' series which overlies the Main Reef.

                  MOLECULAR ENERGY OF GASES.
             To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine.
      Gentlemen,
TT is a pity that Dr. Gore did not notice that the entries in the
¦*- column on page 340, which he calls "square of molecular
velocity," are nothing but a certain number (probably intended for
3395175) divided by the molecular weight of successive substances,
and that when he multiplies the numbers in this column by the
respective molecular weights again, the only ground for surprise is
that the results do not come out identical. The numbers in his
last column would in fact be all precisely the same were it not for
a few arithmetical errors in the workiug.
   Agreement to 4 figures (or to 7 for that matter) should always
be suspected, especially since molecular weights themselves are
not known accurately to 3 places. If Dr. Gore is still inclined to
attribute importance to his figures, he may convince himself by
inventing hypothetical substances with comic molecular weights
and finding that they obey his law equally well.
   As I understand him, however, he writes to request information
as to what is known about molecular kinetic energy. A good deal
is known ; for instance the following :—
   The mean square of molecular velocity is given for perfect
gases by
and since p varies as the molecular weight, for different gases at
the same temperature, it follows that the average kinetic energies
of the molecules of all permanent gases at the same temperature
and pressure are the same.
   But this statement does not hold for imperfect gases or vapours,
because for them the external or applied pressure is not expressible
so simply in terms of velocity, but is something more like

420           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
where the last term depends upon intermolecular forces, or what
Clausius called the Virial, and Laplace denoted by K.
   Besides this simple matter of separate gases, a much more
interesting thing about mixed gases was discovered by Clerk
Maxwell in 1860 (January, Phil. Mag.)—namely, that when a
number of independent gases are thoroughly mixed in the same
 box, the average molecular kinetic energy of every variety of mole
cule is the same. This he found by direct mechanical reasoning,
for he showed that at every encounter of unequal elastic spheres
any initial or outstanding difference of energy was diminished by
the collision ; whence, since there are millions of collisions per
second in ordinary gases, a condition of average uniformity of
distribution of energy is soon attained.
   From this law of Maxwell's the law of Avogadro, or a slight
extension thereof, immediately follows ; viz., that in any given
volume of such a mixture, the number of molecules of each gas is
proportional to that gas's individual pressure.
   The proof is as follows:—j> = ^ji»iu2, mu1 = const., therefore n
varies with p ; and this holds for every gas separately, provided
that there are no intermolecular forces, chemical or other.
                                I am, Gentlemen,
                                         Your obedient servant,

      AN EXPERIMENT TO PHOTOGRAPH THE SPECTRUM OF
                     LIGHTNING. BY G. MEYER.
   In taking a photograph of the spectrum of lightning by means
of a spectroscope provided with a slit, the difficulty is met with
that, in order to obtain a satisfactory result, the lightning must be
exactly in the prolongation of the optical axis of the apparatus.
By the following arrangement this limitation may be removed.
In front of the object-glass of the photographic apparatus arranged
for parallel rays, a glass refraction-grating is fixed. An image
of the lightning is then obtained on the plate, produced by
the rays which traverse the grating without change of direction,
and, on each side of this, images which owe their origin to the rays
forming the lateral spectra. The number of images in each
lateral spectrum is equal to the number of bright lines occurring
in the spectrum of the lightning. During a storm at night in
May of this year (1893) I made an experiment of this kind, for
which a small hand camera was used ; in front of the object-glass
(an ordinary landscape-lens of 10 cm. focal distance) a glass grating
of 0*0256 mm. breadth of grating, was fixed. Two plates were
exposed. The first shows two flashes, and right and left of each
of them an image which corresponds to the lateral spectrum of
the first order. In the present case this only contains one line.
On the second plate were more flashes, and in the immediate
neighbourhood of the horizon, above which projected roofs of houses
with various chimneys. Between the chimneys a stroug flash is to
be observed, with its two lateral spectra. I measured the angle

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             421
between the edges of two chimneys and the photographic apparatus,
and found it to be 2° 46' 55". By means of a cathetoineter the
distance of corresponding parts of the flash and of the lateral
spectra, and the distance of the edges of the chimneys, were mea
sured. The first magnitude was 1-6 mm. and the second 5-2.
Yrom these data the angle of diffraction is calculated at (T-850,
and the wave-length at 382 . 10-6 mm. The determination of the
angle of diffraction is independent of a knowledge of the focal
distance of the object-glass, and of possible misdrawing.
    This measurement is not accurate enough to determine to what
body this line belongs ; it can only be concluded from this that
that portion of the light which is chiefly effective in photographing
lightning-flashes has approximately the wave-length 382 . lO-6.
    This communication has been made with a view of inciting other
 observers, who have at their disposal better apparatus and can more
 frequently observe storms, to make experiments by this method.
 It is possible that additional ultra-violet lines may be established
 if we succeed in photographing flashes at several hundred metres
 distance, for in the present case the distance of the storm was
 more than 10 km.
    Measurements of the wave-lengths of lines of the spectrum of
 lightning have been made by Vogel and by Schuster, by means
 of a spectrum apparatus provided with a slit. The following
 table gives the wave-lengths arrived at in their experiments :—

                ON THE MAGNETIZATION OF SOFT IRON.
                              BY M. P. JOUBIN.
     In a note in the number of this Journal for last month 1 have
  shown that we may expect to find a characteristic equation of the
  intensity of magnetization of strongly magnetic bodies as a func
  tion of the susceptibility, and I proposed to verify this conclusion
  experimentally. But the experiments of Eowland * solve this
  question, at any rate for the bodies investigated by him, and which
  comprise different varieties of iron, steel, and nickel.

   There is a cliaracterisiic equation with coefficients independent of
the nature of the body ; consequently, the theorem of corresponding
states applies to magnetism.
   Let us imagine an ideal magnetic body for which the suscepti
bility corresponding to an infinitely small field vanishes, and for
which the maximum intensity of magnetization Im is exactly equal
to three times the critical intensity Ie. The curve representing
the intensity I as a function of K is a parabola, and by referring
the variables to their critical values I„ and K,., the reduced equation
of the parabola may be written, as is readily seen,
                            /I            K\

                   *=i + i(i-y) ±f Vi-i/.
   This is an ideal case, for :—
   I. The susceptibility has a finite value K0 when the field
vanishes :
   II. The value I„ of I corresponding to K0 is not equal to 3IC.
   But to obtain the same conditions, let us measure the suscep-
                                                                rr  T£

If we construct curves for Kowland's experiments, it will be
 seen that =a is very appreciably constant for all substances and is
 equal to 2-66. It follows from this by a simple calculation that
 the characteristic equation is
                           /I                -K„

Gentlemen,
      In the February number of the Philosophical Magazine,
Professors Ramsay and Young have published a short paper on
the thermal behaviour of liquids, in which the results of some of
my experiments are attacked. In the interest of true knowledge
I cannot leave these remarks unnoticed, as I consider they
rest on an insufficient foundation.
   The principal remark concerning the defectiveness of the arrange
ments employed to obtain constant high temperatures does not
apply to me, as the authors of the above-named paper may easily
see. In my article (Wied. Ann. 1. p. 529, 1893) 1 expressly and
clearly state that in the glycerine bath which contained the
experimental                                     perfectly uniform and
could be maintained constant for hours. This I proved by repeated
experiments.
   The conclusions arrived at by the authors and stated on p. 207
(Phil. Mag. vol. xxxvii. 1894) are in accord with my own observa
tions, for I also found that when the experimental tubes were
uniformly heated in the glycerine bath no strise were visible, but
only a rusty appearance. As regards the purifying of the liquid
from air, the authors may see what particular pains were taken by
referring to p. 530 of my article.                       B. Galitzine.

 Gentlemeit,
       In the February number of this Journal Messrs. Ramsay and
 Young have published a note on the critical temperature in which
 a statement appears of which, in the interests of science, I am
 compelled to ask them for an explanation ; they have characterized
 as "very inaccurate" a paper on the same subject by myself*.
 This w ould not be of much importance if my work had not attracted
 the attention of many physicists and especially of M. Galitzine,
 who would thus have been led into error by my mistake.
    To avoid this 1 venture respectfully to request Profs. Rauisay
 and Young to point out the errors of reasoning and of experiment
 ation that I have made in the demonstration of my fundamental
 proposition :—" The volume of a Jfttid is not always defined by the
 temperature and pressure only;" thus fluids of different density can
 correspond to the same temperature and pressure. On this pro
 position all my deductions rest.
    It would also be of service to show the error committed by
 M. Galitzine in his demonstration.
    I may also point out to Profs. Ramsay and Young that before
 1880 I had arrived at the conclusion that the particles that con
 stitute liquids have a different volume from the particles of vapour.
 It was by this means that I explained the maximum density of
 water t.
    Profs. Ramsay and Young think with M. Gouy that the only
 variation of density produced in liquids confined in a tube results
 from the variation of hvdrostatical pressure ; the great compres
 sibility of fluids near the critical point would cause very con
 siderable variations of density. The ingenious interpretation of
 M. Gouy, which w ould explain very simply an anomaly that at first
 had a paradoxical appearance, cannot now unhappily be admitted.
 If it were correct there should be produced immediately, at the
 critical temperature, a stable equipoise in a pipe vertically fixed.
 The experiments I published last year show that this is not the
 case ; thus the mode of distribution of substance is different a
 little after the disappearance of the meniscus and twenty-four
 hours after J.

    T has long been observed that certain species of birds
I     maintain themselves indefinitely in the air by " soaring,"
without any flapping of the wing or any motion other than
a slight rocking of the body ; and this, although the body in
question is many hundred times denser than the air in which
it seems to float with an undulating movement, as on the
waves of an invisible stream.
    No satisfactory mechanical explanation of this anomaly has
been given, and none would be offered in this connexion by
the writer, were he not satisfied that it involves much more
than an ornithological problem, and that it points to novel
conclusions of mechanical and utilitarian importance. They
are paradoxical at first sight, since they imply that under cer
tain specifiod conditions very heavy bodies entirely detached
from the earth, immersed in, and free to move in, the air, can
be sustained there indefinitely, without any expenditure of
energy from within.
    These bodies may be entirely of mechanical construction,

4:46                 Prof. !S. P. Langley on the
as will be seen later, but for the present we will continue to
consider the character of the invisible support of the soaring
bird, and to study its motions, though only as a pregnant
instance offered by nature to show that a rational solution of
the mechanical problem is possible.
    Recurring, then, to the illustration just referred to, we may
observe that the flow of an ordinary river would afford no
explanation of the fact that nearly inert creatures, while free
to move, although greatly denser than the fluid, yet float upon
it ; which is what we actually behold in the aerial stream, since
the writer, like others, has satisfied himself by repeated obser
vation that the soaring vultures and other birds appear as if
sustained by some invisible support, in the stream of air, some
times for at least a considerable fraction of an hour. It is
frequently suggested by those who know these facts only from
books, that there must be some quivering of the wings, so
rapid as to escape observation. Those who do know them
from observation are aware that it is absolutely certain that
nothing of the kind takes place, and that the birds sustain them
selves on pinions which are quite rigid and motionless, except
for a rocking or balancing movement involving little energy.
    The writer desires to acknowledge his indebtedness to that
most conscientious observer, M. Mouillard *, who has described
these actions of the soaring birds with incomparable vividness
and minuteness, and who asserts that they, under certain
circumstances, without flapping their wings, rise and actually
advance against the wind.
    To the writer, who has himself been attracted from his
earliest years to the mystery which has surrounded this action
of the soaring bird, it has been a subject of continual surprise
that it has attracted so little attention from physicists. That
nearly inert bodies, weighing from 5 to 10, and even more,
Eounds, and many hundred times denser than the air, should
  e visibly suspended in it above our heads, sometimes for
hours at a time, and without falling,—this, it might seem, is,
without misuse of language, to be called a physical miracle ;
and yet the fact that those whose province it is to investigate
nature have hitherto seldom thought it deserving attention
is perhaps the greater wonder.
    This indifference may be in some measure explained by the
fact that the largest and best soarers are of the vulture kind,
and that their most striking evolutions are not to be seen in
those regions of the Northern Temperate Zone where the
majority of those whose training fits them to study the sub-

ject are found. Even in Washington, however, where the
writer at present resides, scores of great birds may be seen at
times in the air together, gliding with and against the wind,
and ascending higher at pleasure, on nearly motionless wings.
" Those who have not seen it," says M. Mouillard, " when they
are told of this ascension without the expenditure of energy,
are always ready to say, ' but there must have been move
ments, though you did not see them;' " "and in fact," he adds,
 " the casual witness of a single instance, himself, on reflection,
feels almost a doubt as to the evidence of his senses, when
thev testify to things so extraordinary."
    Quite agreeing with this, the writer will not attempt any
 general description of his own observations, but as an illus
tration of what can sometimes be seen, will give a single one,
 to whose exactness he can personally witness. The common
 " Turkey Buzzard" (Cathartes aura) is so plentiful around the
 environs of Washington that there is rarely a time when some
 of them may not be seen in the sky, gliding in curves over
 some attractive point, or, more rarely, moving in nearly straight
 lines on rigid wings, if there be a moderate wind. On the
 only occasion when the motion of one near at hand could
 be studied in a very high wind, the author was crossing the
 long " Aqueduct Bridge " over the Potomac, in an unusually
 violent November gale, the velocity of the wind being prob
 ably over 35 miles an hour. About one third of the distance
 from the right bank of the river, and immediately over the
 right parapet of the bridge, at a height of not over 20 yards,
 was one of these buzzards, which, for some object which was
 not evident, chose to keep over this spot, where the gale, un
 disturbed by any surface irregularities, swept directly up the
  river with unchecked violence. In this aerial torrent, and
 apparently indifferent to it, the bird hung, gliding in the usual
  manner of its species, round and round, in a small oval curve,
  whose major axis (which seemed toward the wind) was not
  longer than twice its height from the water. The bird was
  therefore at all times in close view. It swung around repeat
  edly, rising and falling slightly in its course, while keeping,
  as a whole, on one level, and over the same place, moving
  with a slight swaying, both in front and lateral direction, but
  in such an effortless way as suggested a lazy yielding of itself
  to the rocking of some invisible wave.
     It may be asserted that there was not only no flap of the
  wing, but not the quiver of a wing-feather visible to the
  closest scrutiny, during the considerable time the bird was
 under observation, and during which the gale continued. A
  record of this time was not kept, but it at any rate lasted until
                                2G2

428                Prof. S. P. Langley on the
the writer, chilled by the cold blast, gave up watching and
moved away, leaving the bird still floating about, at the same
height in the torrent of air, in nearly the same circle, and
with the same aspect of indolent repose.
   If the wind is such a body as it is commonly supposed to
be, it is absolutely impossible that this sustention could have
taken place iu a horizontal current any more than in a calm,
and yet that the ability to soar is, iu some way, connected with
the presence of the wind, became to the writer as certain as
any fact of observation could be, and at first the difficulty of
reconciling such facts (to him undoubted) with accepted laws
of motion seemed quite insuperable.
   Light came to him through one of those accidents which
are commonly found to occur when the mind is intent on a
particular subject, and looking everywhere for a clue to its
solution.
   In 1887, while engaged with the "whirling-table" in the
open air at the Allegheny Observatory, he had chosen a quiet
afternoon for certain experiments, but in the absence of the
entire calm, which is almost never realized, had placed one of
the very small and light anemometers made for hospital use
in the open air, with the object of determining and allowing
for the velocity of what feeble breeze existed. His attention
was called to the extreme irregularity of this register, and he
assumed at first that the day was more unfavourable than he
had supposed.       Subsequent observations, however, showed
that when the anemometer was sufficiently light and devoid
of inertia, the register always showed great irregularity,
especially when its movements were noted, not from minute
to minute, but from second to second.
   His attention once aroused to these anomalies, he was led
to reflect upon their extraordinary importance in a possible
mechanical application. He then designed certain special
apparatus hereafter described, and made observations with it
which showed that " wind " in general was not what it is
commonly assumed to be—that is, air put in motion with an
approximately uniform velocity in the same strata ; but that,
considered in the narrowest practical sections, wind was
always not only not approximately uniform, but variable and
irregular in its movements beyond anything which had been
anticipated, so that it seemed probable that the very smallest
part observable could not be treated as approximately homo
geneous, but that even here there was an internal motion to
be considered, distinct both from that of the whole body and
from its immediate surroundings. It seemed to the writer
to follow as a necessary consequence, that there might be a

                     Internal Work of the Wind.                         42!)
 potentiality of what may be called " internal work " * iu the
wind.
    On further study, it seemed to him that this internal work
 might conceivably be so utilized as to furnish a power which
 should not only keep an inert body from falling, but cause it
 to rise, and that while this power was the probable cause of the
 action of the soaring bird, it might be possible through its
 means to' cause any suitably disposed body, animate or in
animate, wholly immersed in the wind and wholly free to
move, to advance against the direction of the wind itself.
By this it is not meant that the writer then devised means for
doing this, but that he then attained the conviction both that
such an action involved no contradiction of the laws of motion,
and that it was mechanically possible (however difficult it
might be to realize the exact mechanism by which this might
be accomplished).
    It will be observed that in what has preceded it is intimated
that the difficulties in the way of regarding this even in the
light of a theoretical possibility may have proceeded, with
others as with the writer, not from erroneous reasoning, but
from an error, in the premisses, entering insidiously in the
form of the tacit assumption made by nearly all writers, that
the word " wind " means something so simple, so readily intel
ligible, and so commonly understood, as to require no special
definition ; while, nevertheless, the observations which are
presently to be given show that it is, on the contrary, to be
considered as a generic name for a series of infinitely complex
and little-known phenomena.
    Without determining here whether any mechanism can be
actually devised which shall draw from the wind the power
to cause a body wholly immersed in it to go against the wind,
the reader's consideration is now first invited to the evidence
that there is no contradiction to the known laws of motion,
and at any rate no theoretical impossibility in the conception
of such a mechanism, if it is admitted that the wind is not
what it has been ordinarily taken to be, but what the following
observations show that it is.
    What immediately follows is an account of evidence of the
complex nature of the " wind," of its internal movements, of
   * Since the term " internal work " is often used in thermodynamics to
signify molecular action, it may be well to observe that it here refers not
to molecular movements, but to pulsations of sensible magnitude, always
existing in the wind, as will be shown later, and whose extent and extra
ordinary possible mechanical importance it is the object of this research
to illustrate. The term is so significant of the author's meaning, that he
permits himself the use of it here, in spite of the possible ambiguity.

430                  Prof. S. P. Langley on the
the resulting potentiality of this internal work, and of attempts
which the writer has made to determine quantitatively its
amount by the use of special apparatus, recording the changes
which go on (so to speak) tcithin the wind in very brief
intervals. These results may, it is hoped, be of interest to
meteorologists, but they are given here with special reference
to their important bearing on the future of what the writer
has ventured to call the science of Aerodromics *.
    The observations which are first given were made in 1887
at Allegheny, and are supplemented by others made at
 Washington in the present year !•
    What has just been said about their possible importance
will perhaps seem justified, if it is remarked (in anticipation
of what follows later) that the result of the present discussion
implies not only the theoretical, but the mechanical possibility,
that a heavy body wholly immersed in the air, and sustained
 by it, may without the ordinary use of wind, or sail, or steam,
and without the expenditure of any power except such as
may be derived from the ordinary winds, make an aerial
voyage in any direction, whose length is only limited by the
occurrence of a calm. A ship is able to go against a head
wind by the force of that wind, owing to the fact that it is
partly immersed in the water which reacts on the keel, but it
is here asserted that (contrary to usual opinion and in oppo
sition to what at first may seem the teachings of physical
science) it is not impossible that a heavy and nearly inert
body icholly immersed in the air can be made to do this.
    The observations on which the writer's belief in this
 mechanical possibility are founded will now bo given.

   t It will be noticed that the fact of observation here is not so much
 the movement of currents, such as the writer has since learned was
 suggested by Lord Rnyleigh so long ago as 188:5, still less of the move
 ment of distinct currents at a considerable distance above the earth's
 surface, but of what must be rather called the effect of the irregularities
 and pulsations of any ordinary wind, within the immediate field of ex
 amination, however narrow.
   See the instructive article by Lord Rayleigh in ' Nature,' April 5, 1863.
Lord Rayleigh remarks that continued soaring implies " (1) that the
course is not horizontal, (2) that the wind is not horizontal, or (3) that
the wind is not uniform." " It is probable," he says, " that the truth is
usually represented by (1) or (2) ; but the question I wish to raise is
whether the cause suggested by (•')) may not sometimes come into
operation."

   Part II.— Experiments ivith the use of special apparatus.
   In the ordinary uses of the anemometer (let us suppose
it to be a Eobinson's anemometer, for illustration) the re
gistry is seldom taken as often as once a minute ; thus, in
the ordinary practice of the United States Weather Bureau,
the registration is made at the completion of the passage of
each mile of wind. If there be very rapid fluctuations of the
wind, it is obviously desirable, in order to detect them, to
observe the instrument at very brief intervals, c. g. at least
every second, instead of every minute or every hour, and it is
equally obvious that in order to take up and indicate the
changes which occur in these brief intervals, the instrument
should have as little inertia as possible, its momentum tending
to falsify tbe facts, by rendering the record more uniform than
would otherwise be the case.
   In 1887 I made use of the only apparatus at command—
an ordinary small Robinson's anemometer, having cups 3
inches (7"5 centim.) in diameter, the centres of the cups being
6f inches (16f centim.) from the centre of rotation. This
was placed at the top of a mast 53 feet (16-2 metres) in height,
which was planted in the grounds of the Allegheny Obser
vatory, on the flat summit of a hill which rises nearly 400 feet
(122 metres) above the valley of the Ohio River. It was,
 accordingly, in a situation exceptionally free from those ir
 regularities of the wind which are introduced by the presence
 of trees and of houses, or of inequalities of surface.
    Every twenty-fifth revolution of the cups was registered by
closing an electric circuit, and the registry was made on the
chronograph of the Observatory by a suitable electric con
nexion, and these chronograph sheets were measured and the
results tabulated. A portion of the record obtained on July
 16, 1887, is given on Plate V., the abscissa? representing time,
and the ordinates wind velocities. The observed points re
present the wind's velocities as computed from the intervals
between each successive electrical contact, as measured on
the chronograph sheets, and for convenience in following the
succession of observed points they are here joined by straight
lines, though it is hardly necessary to remark that the change
in velocity is in fact, though quite sharp, yet not in general
discontinuous, and the straight lines here used for con
venience do not imply that the rate of change of velocity is
uniform.
   The wind velocities during this period of observation ranged
from about 10 to 25 miles an hour, and the frequency of
measurement was every 7 to 17 seconds. If, on the one hand,

432                 Prof. S. P. Langley on the
owing to the weight and inertia of the anemometer, this is far
from doing justice to the actual irregularities of the wind, on
the other it equally shows that the wind was far from being a
body of even approximate uniformity of motion, and that
even when considered in quite small sections, the motion was
found to be irregular almost beyond conception—certainly
beyond anticipation ; for this record is not selected to repre
sent an extraordinary breeze, but the normal movement of an
ordinary one.
   By an application of these facts, to be presented later, I
then reached by these experiments the conclusion that it was
theoretically possible to cause a heavy body wholly immersed
in the wind to be driven in the opposite direction, e. g. to
move east while the wind was blowing west, without the use
of any power other than that which the wind itself furnished,
and this even by the use of plane surfaces, and without taking
advantage of the more advantageous properties of curved ones.
   This power, I further already believed myself warranted by
these experiments in saying, could be obtained by the move
ments of the air in the horizontal plane alone, even without
the utilization of currents having an upward trend. But I
was obliged to turn to other occupations, and did not resume
these interesting observations until the year 1893.
   Although the anemometer used at Allegheny served to
illustrate the essential fact of the rapid and continuous fluctua
tions of even the ordinary and comparatively uniform wind,
yet owing to the inertia of the arms and cups, which tended
to equalize the rate (the moment of inertia was approximately
40,000 gr. cm.2), and to the fact that the record was only
made at every twenty-fifth revolution, the internal changes
in the horizontal component of the wind's motion, thus re
presenting its potential work, were not adequately recorded.
   In January 1893 I resumed these observations at Washing
ton with apparatus with which 1 sought to remedy these
defects, using as a station the roof of the north tower of the
Smithsonian Institution building, the top of the parapet being
142 feet (43*3 metres) above the ground, and the anemo
meters, which were located above the parapet, being 153 feet
(46*7 metres) above the ground. I placed them in charge
of Mr. George E. Curtis, with instructions to take observa
tions under the conditions of light, moderate, and high winds.
The apparatus used was, first, a Weather Bureau Kobinson
anemometer of standard size, with aluminium cups. Diameter
to centre of cups 34 cm.; diameter of cups 10*16 cm.; weight
of arms and cups 241 grams; approximate moment of inertia
40,710 gr. cm.*

                  Internal Work of the Wind.                  433
   A second instrument was a very light anemometer, having
paper cups, of standard pattern and diameter, the weight of
arms and cups being only 74 grams, and its moment of inertia
8604 gr. cm.2
  With this instrument a number of observations were taken,
when it was lost by being blown away in a gale. It was
succeeded in its use by one of my own construction, which
was considerably lighter. This was also blown away. I
afterwards employed one of the same size as the standard
pattern, weighing 48 grams, having a moment of inertia of
11,940 gr. cm.2; and, finally, I constructed one of half the
diameter of the standard pattern, employing cones instead
of hemispheres, weighing 5 grams, and having a moment of
inertia of but 300 gr. cm.2
   In the especially light instruments the electric record was
made at every half revolution, on an ordinary astronomical
chronograph, placed upon the floor of the tower, connected
with the anemometer by an electric circuit. Observations
were made on January 14, 1893, during a light wind having
a velocity of from 9 to 17 miles an hour ; on January 25 and
26 during a moderate wind, having a velocity of from 16 to
28 miles an hour ; and on February 4 and 7, during a
moderate and high wind ranging from 14 to 36 miles an
hour. Portions of these observations are given on Plates VI.,
VII., and VIII. A short portion of the record obtained with
the standard Weather Bureau anemometer during a high
north-west wind is given on Plate IX.
   A prominent feature presented by these diagrams is that
the higher the absolute velocity of the wind, the greater the
relative fluctuations which occur in it. In a high wind the
air moves in a tumultuous mass, the velocity being at one
moment perhaps 40 miles an hour, then diminishing to an
almost instantaneous calm, and then resuming *.
   The fact that an absolute local calm can momentarily occur
during the prevalence of a high wind was vividly impressed
upon me during the observations of February 4, when,
chancing to look up to the light anemometer, which was
revolving so rapidly that the cups were not separately dis
tinguishable, I saw them completely stop for an instant, and
then resume their previous high speed of rotation, the whole
within the fraction of a second. This confirmed the suspicion
that the chronographic record, even of a specially light ane
mometer, at most but imperfectly notes the sharpness of these
  * An example of a very rapid change may be seen on Plate VIII. at
12.23 p.m.

434                 Prof. R. P. Langley on the
internal changes. Since the measured interval between two
electric contacts is the datum for computing the velocity, an
instantaneous stoppage, such as I accidentally saw, will
appear on the record simply as a slowing of the wind, and
such very significant facts as that just noted will be neces
sarily slurred over, even by the most sensitive apparatus of this
kind.
    However, the more frequent the contacts the more nearly
an exact record of the fluctuations may be measured ; and I
have, as I have stated, provided that they should be made at
every half revolution of the anemometer, that is, as a rule,
several times a second *.
    I now invite the reader's attention to the actual records of
rapid changes that take place in the wind's velocity, selecting
as an illustration the first .H minutes of the diagram plotted
on Plate VII.
    The heavy line through points A, B, and C represents the
ordinary record of the wind's velocity as obtained from a
standard Weather Bureau anemometer during the observations
recording the passage of two miles of wind. The velocity,
which was, at the beginning of the interval considered, nearly
 23 miles an hour, fell during the course of the first mile to a
little over 20 miles an hour. This is the ordinary anemometric
record of the wind at such elevations as this (47 metres) above
the earth's surface, where it is free from the immediate
vicinity of disturbing irregularities, and where it is popularly
supposed to move with occasional variation in direction, as the
weather-cock indeed indicates, but with such nearly uniform
movement that its rate of advance is, during any such brief
time as two or three minutes, under ordinary circumstances,
approximately uniform. This, then, may be called the "wind;"
 that is, the conventional " wind " of treatises upon aerody
namics, where its aspect as a practically continuous flow is
   * Here we may note the error of the common assumption that the
ordinary anemometer, however heavy, will, if frictionless, correctly
measure the velocity of the wind, for the existence of " vis inertia? " it is
now seen, is not indifferent, but plays a most important part where the
velocity suffers such great and frequent changes as we here see it does,
and where the rate at which this inertia is overcome, and this velocity
changed, is plainly a function of the density of the fluid, which density
we also see reason to suppose itself varies incessantly, and with great
rapidity. Though it is probable that no form of barometer in use does
justice to the degree of change of this density, owing to this rapidity, we
cannot, nevertheless, suppose it to exceed certain limits, and we may
treat the present records, made with an anemometer of such exceptional
lightness, as being comparatively unaffected by these changes in density,
though they exist.

                  Internal Work of the Wind.                  435
alone considered. "When, however, we turn to the record
made with the speoially light anemometer, at every second,
of this same wind, we find an entirely different state of things.
The wind, starting with the velocity of 23 miles an honr, at
12" 10m 18s rose within 10 seconds to a velocity of 33 miles
an hour, and within 10 seconds more fell to its initial speed.
It then arose within 30 seconds to a velocity of 36 miles an
hour, and so on, with alternate risings and fallings, at one
time actually stopping ; and, as the reader may easily observe,
passing through 18 notable maxima and as many notable
minima, the average interval from a maximum to a minimum
being a little over 10 seconds, and the average change of
 velocity in this time being about 10 miles an hour. In the
lower left-hand corner of Plate VII. is given a conventional
 representation of these fluctuations in which this average
 period and amplitude is used as a type. The above are facts,
 the counterpart of which may be noted by any one adopting
 the means the writer has employed. It is hardly necessary
 to observe, that almost innumerable minor maxima and
 minima presented themselves, which the drawing cannot
 depict.
    In order to ensure clearness of perception, the reader will
 bear in mind that the diagram does not represent the velocities
 which obtained coincidently, along the length of two miles of
 wind represented, nor the changes in velocity experienced by
 a single moving particle during the interval, but that it is a
 picture of the velocities which were in this wind at the suc
 cessive instants of its passing the fixed anemometer ; which
 velocities, indeed, were probably nearly the same for a few
 seconds before and after registry, but which incessantly passed
 into, and were replaced by, others, in a continuous flow of
 change. But although the observations do not show the
 actual changes of velocity which any given particle experiences
 in any assigned interval, these fluctuations cannot be materially
 different in character from those which are observed at a fixed
  point, and are shown in the diagram. It may, perhaps, still
  further aid us in fixing our ideas, to consider two material
  particles as starting at the same time over this two-mile
  course : the one moving with the uniform velocity of 22-6
  miles an hour (33 feet per second), which is the average
  velocity of the wind as observed for the interval between
  12h 10m 18s and 12" 15m 458 on February 4; the other, during
  the same interval, having the continuously changing velocities
  actually indicated by the light anemometer, as shown on
  Plate VII. Their positions at any time may, if desired, be
  conveniently represented in a diagram where the abscissa of

 436                   Prof. S. P. Langley on the
  any point represents the elapsed time in seconds, and the
  ordinates show the distance, in feet, of the material particle
  from the starting-point. The path of the first particle will
  thus be represented by a straight line, while the path of the
 second particle will be an irregularly curved line, at one time
 above, and at another time below the mean straight line just
 described, but terminating in coincidence with it at the end
  of the interval. If, now, all the particles in two miles of
 wind were simultaneously accelerated and retarded in the
 same way as this second particle, that is, if the wind were an
 inelastic fluid and moved like a solid cylinder, the velocities
 recorded by the anemometer would be identical with those
 that obtained along the whole region specified. But the
 actual circumstance must evidently be far different from this,
 since the air is an elastic and nearly perfect fluid, subject to
 condensation and rarefaction. Hence the successive velocities
 of any given particle (which are in reality the resultant of
 incessant changes in all directions) must be conceived as
 evanescent, taking on something like the sequence recorded
 by these curves a very brief time before this air reached the
 anemometer, and losing it as soon after.
    It has not been my purpose in this paper to enter upon
 any inquiry as to the cause of this non-homogeneity of the
 wind. The irregularities of the surface topography (including
 buildings and every other surface obstruction) are commonly
 adduced as a sufficient explanation of the chief irregularities
 of the surface wind ; yet I believe that at a considerable dis
 tance above the earth's surface (e. g. one mile) the wind may
 not even be approximately homogeneous, nor have an even
 flow ; for while, if we consider air as an absolutely elastic and
 fVictionless fluid, any motion impressed upon it would be
 preserved for ever, and tbe actual irregularities of the wind
 would be the results of changes made at any past time, how
 ever remote ; so long as we admit that the wind, without
 being absolutely elastic and frictionless, is nearly so, it seems
to me that we may consider that the incessant alternations,
which it here appears make the " wind," are due to past im
pulses and changes which are preserved in it, and which die
away with very considerable slowness. If this be the case,
it is less difficult to see how even in the upper air, and at
every altitude, we might expect to find local variations, or
pulsations, not unlike those which we certainly observe at
minor altitudes above the ground *.

of Helmholtz on Atmospheric movements, Sitzungsberichte, Berlin, 1888
-1889.

                    Part III.—Application.
   Of these irregular movements of the wind, which take place
up, down, and on every side, and are accompanied of necessity
by equally complex condensations and expansions, it will be
observed that only a small portion, namely, those which occur
in a narrow current whose direction is horizontal and sensibly
linear, and whose width is only the diameter of the anemo
meter, can be noted by the instruments I have here described,
and whose records alone are represented in the diagram.
However complex the movement may appear as shown by the
diagram, it is then far less so than the reality, and it is prob
able, indeed, that anything like a fairly complete graphical
presentation of the case in impossible.
   I think that on considering these striking curves (Plates
V., VI., VII., VIII., and IX.), we shall not find it difficult to
admit, at least as an abstract conception, that there is no
necessary violation of the principle of the conservation of
energy implied in the admission that a body wholly immersed
in, and moving with such a wind, may derive from it a force
which may be utilized in lifting the body, in a way in which
a body immersed in the " wind " of our ordinary conception
could not be lifted, and if we admit that the body may be
lifted, it follows obviously that it may descend under the
action of gravity from the elevated position, on a sloping path,
to some distance in a direction opposed to that of the wind
which lifted it, though it is not obvious what this distance is.
   We may admit all this, because we now see (I repeat) that
the apparent violation of law arises from a tacit assumption
which we, in common with all others, may have made, that
the wind is an approximately homogeneously moving body,
because moving as a whole in one direction. It is, on the
contrary, ahcays as we see here, filled (even if we consider
only movements in some one horizontal plane) with amazingly
complex motions, some of which, if not in direct opposition to
the main movement, are relatively so, that is are slower, while
others are faster than this main movement, so that a portion
is always opposed to it.
   From this, then, we may now at least see that it is plainly
within the capacity of an intelligence like that suggested by
Maxwell, and which Lord Kelvin has called the " Sorting
Demon," to pick out from the internal motions those whose
direction is opposed to the main current, and to omit those
which are not so, and thus, without the expenditure of energy,
to construct a force which will act against the main current
itself.

    But we may go materially further, and not only admit that
it is not necessary to invoke here, as Maxwell has done in the
case of thermodynamics, a being having power and rapidity
of action far above ours, but that, in actual fact, a being of a
lower order than ourselves, guided only by instinct, may so
utilize these internal motions.
    We might not, indeed, have conceived this possible, were
it not that nature has already, to a large extent, exhibited it
before our eyes in the soaring bird*, which sustains itself
endlessly in the air with nearly motionless wings, for without
this evidence of the possibility of an action which now ceases
to approach the inconceivable, we are not likely, even if ad
mitting its theoretical possibility, to have thought the mecha
nical solution of this problem possible.
    But although to show how this physical miracle of nature
is to be imitated, completely and in detail, may be found to
transcend any power of analysis, I hope to show that this may
be possible without invoking the asserted power of " aspira
tion " relative to curved surfaces, or the trend of upward
currents, and even to indicate the probability that the me
chanical solution of this problem may not be beyond human
skill.
    To this conclusion we are invited by the following consider
ation, among others.
   * " When the condors in a flock are wheeling round and round any
spot, their flight is beautiful. Except when rising from the ground, I do
not recollect ever having seen one of these birds flap its wings. Near
Lima I watched several for nearly half an hour without once taking off
ray eyes. They moved in large curves sweeping in circles, descending
and ascending without once flapping. As they glided close over my head,
I intently watched, from an oblique position, the outlines of the separate
and terminal feathers of the wing ; and if there had been the least vibra
tory movement these would have blended together, but they were seen
distinct against the blue sky. The head and neck were moved frequently
and apparently with force, and it appeared as if the extended wings
formed the fulcrum on which the movements of the neck, body, and tail
acted. If the bird wished to descend, the wings for a moment collapsed ;
and then, when again expanded, with an altered inclination, the momentum
gained by the rapid descent seemed to urge the bird upwards, with the
even and steady movement of a paper kite. In the case of any bird
soaring, its motion must be sufficiently rapid so that the action of the
inclined surface of its body on the atmosphere may counterbalance its
gravity. The force to keep up the momentum of a body moving in a
 Horizontal plane in that fluid (in which there is so little friction) cannot
 be great, and this force is all that is wanted. The movement of the neck
and body of the condor, we must suppose, is sufficient fortius. However
this may be, it is truly wonderful and beautiful to see so great a bird,
hour after hour, without any apparent exertion, wheeling and gliding over
mountain and river."—Darwin's Journal of the Various Countries Visited

                    Internal Work of the Wind.                      439
    We will presently examine the means of utilizing this po
tentiality of internal work in order to cause an inert body
wholly unrestricted in its motion and wholly immersed in the
current, to rise ; but first let us consider such a body (a plane)
whose movement is restricted in a horizontal direction, but
which is free to movo between Motionless vertical guides.
Let it be inclined upward at a small angle towards a horizontal
wind, so that only the vertical component of the pressure of
the wind on the plane will affect its motion. If the velocity
of the wind be sufficient, the vertical component of pressure
will equal or exceed the weight of the plane, and in the latter
case the plane will rise indefinitely.
    Thus, to take a concrete example, if the plane be a rect
angle whose length is six times its width, having an area of
2-3 square feet to the pound, and be inclined at an angle of
7°, and if the wind have a velocity of 36 feet per second,
experiment shows that the upward pressure will exceed the
weight of the plane, and the plane will rise, if between ver
tical nearly frictionless guides, at an increasing rate, until it
has a velocity of 2" 52 feet per second *, at which speed the
weight and upward pressure are in equilibrium. Hence
there are no unbalanced forces acting, and the plane will
have attained a state of uniform motion.
     For a wind that blows during 10 seconds, the plane will
therefore rise about 25 feet. At the beginning of the motion,
the inertia of the plane makes the rate of rise less than the
uniform rate, but at the end of 10 seconds the inertia will
cause the plane to ascend a short distance after the wind has
ceased, so that the deficit at the beginning will be counter
balanced by the excess at the end of the assigned interval.
     We have just been speaking of a material heavy plane per
manently sustained in vertical guides, which are essential to
 its continuous ascent in a uniform wind, but such a plane
 will be lifted and sustained momentarily even if there be no
 vertical guides, or, in the case of a kite, even if there be no
cord to retain it, the inertia of the body supplying for a
 brief period the office of the guides or of the cord. If suit
 ably disposed, it will, as the writer has elsewhere shown,
 under the resistance to the horizontal wind, imposed only by
 its inertia, commence to move, not in the direction of the
 wind, but nearly vertically. Presently however, as we recog
 nize, this inertia must be overcome, and as the inclined plane
 takes up more and more the motion of the wind, the lifting
 effect must grow less and less (that is to say, if the wind

 Contribution to Knowledge,' 1891.

 440                Prof. S. P. Laugley on the
be the approximately homogeneous current it is commonly
 treated as being), and finally ceasing altogether, the plane
 must ultimately fall. If, however, a counter-current is sup
 posed to meet this inclined plane,
 before the effect of its inertia is ex
hausted, and consequently before it
 ceases to rise, we have only to suppose
the plane to be rotated through 180°
about a vertical axis, without any other
call for the expenditure of energy, to
see that it will now be lifted still
higher, owing to the fact that its
inertia now reappears as an active
factor. The annexed sketch (fig. 1)
shows a typical representation of what
might be supposed to happen with a
model inclined plane freely suspended          jfy.i.
in the air, and endowed with the power
of rotating about a vertical axis so as to change the aspect
of its constant inclination, which need involve no (theoretical)
expenditure of energy, even although the plane possess
inertia. We see that this plate would rise indefinitely by
the action of the wind in alternate directions.
    The disposition of the wind which is here supposed to
cause the plane to rise appears at first sight an impossible
one, but we shall next make the important observation that it
becomes virtually possible by a method which we shall now
point out, and which leads to a practicable one which we may
actually employ.
    Figure 2 shows the wind blowing in one constant direction,
but alternately at two widely varying velocities, or rather
 (in the extreme case supposed in illustration) where one of
the velocities is negligibly small, and where successive pul
sations in the same direction are separated by intervals of
calm.
    A frequent alternation of velocities, united with constancy
of absolute direction, has previously been shown here to be
the ordinary condition of the wind's motion ; but attention
is now particularly called to the fact that while these unequal
velocities may be in the same direction as regards the surface
of the earth, yet as regards the mean motion of the wind they
are in opposite directions, and will produce on a plane, whose
inertia enables it to sustain a sensibly uniform motion with
the mean velocity of this variable wind, the same lifting
effect as if these same alternating winds were in absolutely
opposed directions, provided that the constant inclination of

the plane alternates in its aspect to correspond with the
changes in the wind.
    It may aid in clearness of conception, if we imagine a set
of fixed coordinates X Y Z passing
through 0, and a set of movable
coordinates x y z, moving with the
velocity and the direction of the
mean wind. If the moving body
is referred to these first only, it
is evidently subject to pulsations
 which take place in the same
directions on the axis of X, but it
must be also evident that if re
 ferred to the second or movable
 coordinates, these same pulsations
 may be, and are, in opposite direc
 tions. This, then, is the case we
 have just considered, and if we
 suppose the plane to change the
 aspect * of its (constant) inclina
 tion as the direction of the pulsa
 tions changes, it is evident that
 there must be a gain in altitude                           T&S.
 with every pulsation, while the
 plane advances horizontally with the velocity of the mean
 wind.
    During the period of maximum wind velocity, when the
 wind is moving faster than the plane, the rear edge of the
 latter must be elevated. During the period of minimum
 velocity, when the plane, owing to its inertia, is moving faster
 than the wind, the front edge of the plane must be elevated.
 Thus the vertical component of the wind pressure, as it strikes
 the oblique plane, tends in both cases to give it a vertical
 upward thrust. So long as this thrust is in excess of the
 weight to be lifted, the plane will rise. The rate of rise will
 be greatest at the beginning of each period, when the relative
 velocity is greatest, and will diminish as the resistance pro
 duces " drift;" i, p.. diminishes relative velocity. The curved
 line 0 B in the vignette represents a typical path of the plane
 under these conditions.
     It follows from the diagram (fig. 1) that, other things being
 equal, the more frequent the wind's pulsations, the greater
 will be the rise of the plane; for since during each period of
    * We do not for the moment consider how this change of aspect is to be
 mechanically effected ; we only at present call attention to the fact that
 it involves, in theory, no expenditure of energy.

442                  Prof. S. P. Langley on the
steady wind the rate of rise diminishes, the more rapid the
pulsations, the nearer the mean rate of rise will be to the
initial rate. The requisite frequency of pulsations is also
related to the inertia of the plane, as the less the inertia, the
more frequent must be the pulsations in order that the plane
shall not lose its relative velocity.
    It is obvious that there is a limit or weight which cannot
be exceeded, if the body is to be sustained by any such fluctua
tions of velocity as can be actually experienced. Above this
limit of weight the body will sink. Below this limit the
lighter the body is the higher it will be carried, but with
increasing variability of speed. That body, then, which has
the greatest weight per unit of surface will soar with the
greatest steadiness, if it soar at all, not on account of this
weight per se, but because the weight is an index of its
inertia.
    The reader who will compare the results of experiments
made with any artificial flying models, like those of Penaud,
with the weights of the soaring birds as given in the tables by
M. Mouillard, or other authentic sources, cannot fail to be
struck with the great weight in proportion to wing-surface
which nature has given to the soaring bird, compared with
any which man has yet been able to imitate in his models.
    This fact of the weight of the soaring bird in proportion to
its area has been again and again noted, and it has been fre
quently remarked that without weight the bird could not
soar, by writers who felt that they could very safely make
such a paradoxical statement, in view of the evidence nature
everywhere gave that this weight was indeed in some way
necessary to rising. But these writers have not shown, so
far as I remember, how this necessity arises, and this is what
I now endeavour to point out*.
    It has not here been shown what limit of weight is im
posed to the power of an ordinary wind to elevate and sus
tain, but it seems to me, and I hope that it may seem to the
reader, that the evidence that there is some weight which the
action of the wind is sufficient to permanently sustain under
these conditions in a free body, has a demonstrative character,
although no quantitative formula is offered at this stage of
the investigation. It is obvious that, if this weight is sus-
   * It is perhaps not superfluous to recall here that, according to the
researches of Rankine, Froude, and others, a body moulded in wave-line
curves would, if frictionless, continue to move indefinitely against an
opposed wind, in virtue of inertia and once acquired velocity, and also to
recall how very small the effect of fluid friction in the air has been shown
to be (by the writer iu a previous investigation).

                      Internal Work of the Wind.                      443
tainable at any height, gravity may be utilized to cause the
body (which we suppose to be a material plane) to descend
on an inclined course, to some distance, even against the
wind.
   I desire, in this connexion, to remark that the preceding
experiments and deductions, showing that a material free
plane *, possessing sufficient inertia, may in theory rise in
definitely by the action of an ordinary wind, without the
expenditure of work from any internal source (as well as
those statements which follow), when these explanations are
once made, have a character of obviousness, which is due to
the simplicity of the enunciation, but not, I think, to the
familiarity of the explanation, for though attention is be
ginning to be paid by meteorologists to the rapidity of these
wind fluctuations, I am not aware that their effects have
been so exhibited, or, especially, that they have been pre
sented in this connexion, or that the conclusions which follow
have been drawn from them.
   We have here seen, then, how pulsations of sufficient
amplitude and frequency, of the kind which present them
selves in nature, may, in theory, furnish energy not only
sufficient to sustain, but actually to elevate, a heavy body
moving in and with the wind at its mean rate.
    It is easy now to pass to the practical case which has been
already referred to, and which is exemplified in nature,
namely, that in which the body (e.g. the bird soaring on rigid
wings, but having power to change its inclination) uses the
elevation thus gained to move against the wind, without
expending any sensible amount of its own energy. Here
the upward motion is designedly arrested at any convenient
stage, e. g. at each alternate pulsation of the wind, and the
height attained is utilized so that the action of gravity may
carry the body by its descent in a curvilinear path (if
necessary) against the wind. It has just been pointed out
that if some height has been attained, the theoretical possi
bility of some advance against the wind in so falling hardly
needs demonstration, though it may not unnaturally be sup
posed that the relative advance so gained must be insignificant,
compared with the distance travelled by the mean wind while
  » I use the word " plane," but include in the statement all suitable
modifications of a curved surface.
   I desire to recall attention to the paragraph in " Experiments in Aero
dynamics," in which I caution the reader against supposing that by
investigating plane surfaces I imply that they are the best form of sur
face for flight ; and I repeat here that, as a matter of fact, I do not
believe them to be so. I have selected the plane simply as the best form
for preliminary experiment.

444              Prof. S. P. Langley on the
the body was being elevated, so that on the whole the body
is carried by the wind farther than it advances against it.
   This, however, probably need not be in fact the case, there
being, as it appears to me from experiment and from dednction,
every reason to believe that under suitable conditions the
advance may be greater than the recession, or that the body
falling under the action of gravity along a suitable path may
return against the wind, not only from Z to 0, the point of
departure, but farther, as is here shown.
   I repeat, however, that I am not at the moment undertaking
to demonstrate how the action is mechanically realizable in
actual practice, but only that it is possible. It is for this
purpose, and to understand more exactly that it can be
effected, not only by the process indicated in the second
illustration (fig. 2) but by another and probably more useful
one (and nature has still others at command), that I have
considered another treatment of the same conditions, of wind-
Eulsations always moving in the same horizontal direction,
  ut for brief periods, interrupted by equal intervals of calm.
In this third illustration (fig. 3) we suppose the body to use
the height gained in each pulsation, to enable it to descend
after each such pulsation and advance against the direction
of the wind.
                                  Tig. 3.
   The portion AB of the curve represents the path of the
plane surface from a state of rest at A, where it has a small
upward inclination toward the wind. If a horizontal wind
blow upon it in the direction of the arrow, the first movement
of the plane will not be in the direction of the wind, but, as is
abundantly demonstrated by the writer in " Experiments in
Aerodynamics," it will rise in a nearly vertical direction, if
the angle be small. The wind, continuing to blow in the same
direction, at the end of a certain time, the plane, which has
risen (owing to its inertia, and in spite of its weight) to the
successive positions shown, is taking up more and more of the

                   Internal Work of the Wind.                 445
horizontal velocity of the wind, and consequently opposing
less resistance to it, and therefore moving more and more
laterally, and rising less and less, at every successive instant.
   If the wind continued indefinitely, the plane would ulti
mately take up its velocity, and finally, of course, fall, when
this inertia ceased to oppose resistance to the wind's advance.
I have supposed, however, the wind pulsation to cease at the
end of a certain brief period, and, to fix our ideas, let us
suppose this period to be five seconds. At this moment the
period of calm begins, and now let the plane, which is sup
posed to have reached the point B, change its inclination
about a horizontal axis to that shown in the diagram, falling
at first nearly vertically, with its edge on the line of its
descent, so as to acquire speed, and this speed acquired, by
constantly changing its angle, glide down the curve B/>C,
so that the plane shall be tangential to it at every point of its
descending advance. At the end of five seconds of calm it
has reached the position C, near the lowest point of its
descent, which there is no contradiction to known mechanical
laws in supposing may be higher than A, and which in fact,
according to the most accurate data the writer can gather,
is higher, in the case of the above period, and in the case of
such an actual plane as has been experimented upon by him.
   Now, having reached C, at the end of the five seconds' calm,
if the wind blow in the same direction and velocity as before,
it will again elevate the plane on the latter's presenting the
proper angle, but this time under more favourable circum
stances, for at this time the plane is already in motion in a
direction opposed to that of the wind, and is already higher
than it was in its original position A. Its course, therefore,
will be nearly that along the curve CD, during all which
time it maintains the original angle a or one very slightly
less. Arrived at D, and at the instant when the calm begins,
it falls, with varying inclination, to the lowest position E
 (which may be higher than C), which it attains at the end of
the five seconds of calm, then rises again (still nearly at the
angle a) to a higher position, and so on ; the alternation of
directions of motion, at the end of each pulsation, growing
less and less sharp, and the path finally taking the character
of a sinuous curve. We have here assumed that the plane
goes against the wind and rises at the same time, in order
to illustrate that this is possible, though either alternative
may be employed, and the plane, in theory at least, may
maintain on the whole a rapid and nearly horizontal, or a slow
and nearly vertical course, or anything between.
   It is not meant, either, that the alternations which would be

446                    Prof. S. P. Langley on the
observed in nature are as sharp as those here represented,
which are intentionally exaggerated, while in all which has
just preceded, by an equally intentional exaggeration of the
 normal action, the wind-pulsations have been supposed to
 alternate with absolute calm. This being understood, it is
 scarcely necessary to point out that if the calm is not absolute,
 but if there are simply frequent successive winds or pulsa
 tions of wind of considerably differing velocity (such as the
 anemometer observations show are realized in nature), the
 same general effect will obtain*, though we are not entitled
 to assume from any demonstration thus far given that the
 total advance will be necessarily greater than that of the
 whole distance the mean wind has travelled. It may also be
  observed that the actual actions of the soaring bird may be,
  and doubtless are, more complex in detail than those of this
  diagram, while yet in their entirety depending on the prin
 ciples it sets forth.
     The theoretical possibility at least will now, it is hoped, be
 granted, not only of the body's rising indefinitely, or of its
 descending in the interval of calm to a higher level C than it
 rose from at A, but of its advancing against the calm or light
 wind through a distance BC, greater than that of AB, and so
 on. The writer, however, repeats that he has reason to suppose,
  from the data obtained by him, that this is not only a theor
  etical possibility, but a mechanical probability under the con
  ditions stated, although he does not here offer a quantitative
  demonstration of the fact, other than by pointing to the
  movements of the soaring bird and inviting their recon
  sideration in the light of the preceding statements.
      The bird, by some tactile sensibility to the pressure and
  direction of the air, is able, in nautical phrase, to " see the
  wind " t and to time its movements so that, without any
  reference to its height from the ground, it reaches tbe lowest
  portion of its descent near the end of the more rapid wind-
  pulsation ; but the writer believes that to cause these adaptive
     * The rotation of the body about a vertical axis so as to change the
  aspect of the inclination, as in the first figure, may be illustrated by the
  well-known habit of many soaring birds, of moving in small closed curves
  or spirals, but it may also be observed, in view of the fact that even in
  intervals of relative calm during which the body descends, there is always
  some wind,—that in making the descents, if the body, animate or in
  animate, maintain its direct advance, this wind tends to strike on the
  upper side of the plane or pinion. Mr. G. E. Curtis offers the suggestion
   that the soaring bird avoids such a position when possible, and therefore
   turns at right angles to, or with, the wind, and that this may be an
   additional reason for its well-known habit of moving in spirals.

changes in an otherwise inert body, with what might almost
be called instinctive readiness and rapidity, does not really
demand intelligence or even instinct, but that the future
aerodrome may be furnished with a substitute for instinct, in
what may perhaps allowably be called a mechanical brain,
which yet need not, in his opinion, be intricate in its character.
His reasons for this statement, which is not made lightly,
must, however, be reserved for another time.
    It is hardly necessary to point out that the nearly inert
body in question may also be a human body, guided both by
instinct and intelligence, and that there may thus be a sense
in which human flight may be possible, although flight de
pending wholly upon the action of human muscles be for ever
impossible.
    Let me resume the leading points of the present memoir
in the statement that it has been shown :—
    (1) That the wind is not even an approximately uniform
moving mass of air, but consists of a succession of very brief
pulsations of varying amplitude, and that, relatively to the
mean movement of the wind, these are of varying direction.
    (2) That it is pointed out that hence there is a potentiality
of " internal work " in the wind, and probably of a very great
amount.
     (3) That it involves no contradiction of known principles to
 declare that an inclined plane, or suitably curved surface,
heavier than the air, freely immersed in, and moving with the
 velocity of the mean wind, can, if the wind-pulsations here
 described are of sufficient amplitude and frequency, be sus
 tained or even raised indefinitely without expenditure of
 internal energy, other than that which is involved in changing
 the aspect of its inclination at each pulsation.
     (4) That since (A) such a surface, having also power to
 change its inclination, must gain energy through falling during
 the slower, and expend energy by rising during the higher,
 velocities ; and that (B) since it has been shown that there is
 no contradiction of known mechanical laws in assuming that
 the surface may be sustained or may continue to rise in
 definitely, the mechanical possibility of some advance against
 the direction of the wind follows immediately from this
 capacity of rising. It is further seen that it is at least
 possible that this advance against the wind may not only be
 attained relatively to the position of a body moving with the
 speed of the mean wind, but absolutely, and with reference to
  a fixed point in space.
      (5) The statement is made that this is not only mechanically
  possible, but that, in the writer's opinion, it is realizable in
  practice.

448                Mr. Thomas H. Blakesley on
   Finally, these observations and deductions have, it seems to
me, an important practical application not only as regards a
living creature like the soaring bird but still more as regards
a mechanically constructed body, whose specific gravity may
probably be many hundred or even many thousand times
that of the atmosphere. We may suppose such a body to be
supplied with fuel and engines, which would be indispensable
to sustain it in a calm, and yet which we now see might be
ordinarily left entirely inactive, so that the body could sup-
posably remain in the air and even maintain its motion in
any direction without expending its energy, except as regards
the act of changing the inclination or aspect which it presents
to the wind, while the wind blew.
   The final application of these principles to the art of aero-
dromics seems then to be, that while it is not likely that the
perfected aerodrome will ever be able to dispense altogether
with the ability to rely at intervals on some internal source of
power, it will not be indispensable that this aerodrome of the
 future shall, in order to go any distance—even to circum
 navigate the globe without alighting,—need to carry a weight
 of fuel which would enable it to perform this journey under

                XLII. A new Electrical Theorem.
               By Thomas H. Blakesley, M.A.*
THE very short paper which I shall read to the Society
       contains the account of a Theorem which, though ad
mitting of easy proof, appears, so far as my inquiries have
gone, to have hitherto escaped notice.
   In order to state the matter briefly, it will be well to adopt
the following definition :—
   If in any system of conductors, however reticulated, two or
more modes of disposition of sources of electromotive force
produce in every part of the network the same current, such
systems of disposition are called equivalent systems. Then
the theorem is as follows :—In any system of conductors,
possessing seats of electromotive force at any number of
points, if any of these sources be supposed to move con
tinuously along the various bars of the conducting system,

and, where a point of junction is encountered, each to become
a seat of the name electromotive force in each of the newly
encountered bars (of course leaving the resistance of the
source behind), then the disposition at any moment is equi
valent to that at any other moment, and therefore to the
original disposition. [Of course the direction of the electro
motive force must be carefully maintained the same : if it is
towards the knot before crossing it, it must be away from the
knot after passing it.] The proof need only refer to the
passing of a knot point, for no one will doubt that if the
sources only move in an unbranching portion of the conductor
the currents in different parts of the system will remain the
same.
                             4
   Let therefore the source e approach the point A at which its
 path splits into n other ways. In each of the n bars suppose
 a source e inserted as directed, then these n alone must be
 equivalent to the single source before reaching A ; for if the
 n sources are reversed, the current due to these sources in
 every portion of the system is reduced to zero. The reversed
 n sources would therefore alone produce currents in the system
 equal numerically, but opposite in direction, to those produced
 by the single source. Hence it follows that the n sources
 (not reversed) will produce the same current as the single
 source.
    The principle of the superposition of currents enables us to
 apply this result to each source of the system, and therefore
 to prove the truth of the theorem in its complete generality.
    In equivalent systems, since the current in every part
 remains the same, the total power expended remains the
 same ; and equivalent systems might have been defined as
 those which produce the same expenditure of power in each
 part ; and therefore the total power of the sources remains
 the same.
    From the point of view of KirchhofFs theorem 2e=2.rc
 for any closed path in a network, the above general theorem
 may seem to some minds even plainer and more easily proved
 than on the method of demonstration which I have employed.

450                 A new Electrical Theorem.
For it is plain from the method of derivation, that if a seat of
electromotive force exists in any closed KirchhofF path it can
never leave it ; and if in the movement of the sources one of
 them approaches the closed path under consideration, at the
encounter it becomes in that path two equal sources acting in
opposite directions.
   If, therefore, %e remains the same for any path and r remains
the same for every part, then obviously c must remain the
same for any portion of that path, and therefore for every
part of the network.
   The following propositions flow immediately from the main
proposition :—
    (1) If a closed continuous surface contains any region of
any network, and some bar which cuts the surface contains, or
by derivation as above can be made to contain, the seat of an
electromotive force, then that source can be done away with
without disturbing the currents in any portion of the system
provided tbat in the other bars which cut the surface sources
of electromotive force be inserted of equal value but of
opposite direction as regards inside and outside of the sur
face ; for it is clear that such sources would result from the
 migration of sources in one direction.
    (2) If two systems of electromotive forces are equivalent,
 one may be derived from the other. For if system A is equi-
 valent to system B, and we suppose - to represent a distribu
 tion identical with A as regards positions, but of half the
                                         A B
 electromotive force in any case, then ^ + ^ is equivalent to
 A or B alone.       Now if any KirchhofF path containing a
 source from -r- does not also contain a source from        then
 KirchhofFs law would be outraged ; for the sum of the electro
 motive forces in that path would be only half what they are
 from A alone, whereas the currents and resistances remain
 the same. Hence for every Kirchhoff path there must be
 equal sources from each system. Either system may now
 have its elements moved up to those of the other system ;
 any resulting side branchings will be the same (though dif-

 must necessarily produce no effect by themselves, because if

                XLIII. The Viscosity of Liquids.
                By Owen Glynne Jones, B.Sc*
THE object of this paper is to point out a method for the
       accurate determination of the viscosity of highly viscous
liquids. The author would prefer to delay the publication of
most of his results till the experiments are completed. The
advantages and disadvantages of the method, and its applica
bility to the determination of viscosities such as those of
alcohol and water, are not yet entirely ascertained, but such
of these points as have already suggested themselves will be
noticed at the end of the paper.
    Sir G. Stokes has long since shown that if a sphere
moves vertically in an infinite liquid under the action of
gravity only, it in course of time assumes a constant speed :
where a is the radius of the sphere, a its density, pthat of the
liquid in which it moves, and fi the viscosity of the liquid.
The equation assumes that there is no slipping at the surface
of the sphere, i. e., that the coefficient of sliding-friction is
infinite. The effect of such sliding-friction would be to
modify the equation thus :
 where /9 is the coefficient of sliding-friction.
    The method employed by the author consists in the mea
 surement of the downward speed of a sphere of mercury
 through the viscous liquid. The amount of mercury used is
 taken sufficiently small to render possible the measurement,
 correct to '1 per cent., of the time taken to pass through a
 distance of about 25 centim. This also renders legitimate
 the assumptions that the mercury remains spherical during
 its motion, and that the liquid in an ordinary burette about
 1*5 centim. internal diameter is for purposes of calculation
 of infinite extent, the motion of such a sphere falling down
 the burette along its centre line being unaffected by the sides
 of the vessel.
    The burette is jacketed with water kept as nearly as
 possible at constant temperature. The temperature of water
 direct from the main was observed last autumn to vary to an

452                 Mr. Owen Glynne Jones on
extent of only "03° C. in an hour and a half, and good results
were then obtained for the viscosity of glycerine. Within
the last fortnight the main temperature has not been nearly
 so constant, and more has been learnt concerning the varia
 tion of viscosity -with temperature than the absolute value of
 viscosity for any definite liquid.
    The mass of a sphere of mercury suitable for glycerine
would be between -003 and -010 grin. This is too small to
 be determined with sufficient accuracy by direct weighing,
 with a balance estimating to one tenth of a milligramme.
 But there is no necessity to determine such a mass directly.
    Let a mass of mercury weighing about "1 grin, be taken
 and weighed carefully. Let it be divided into about 12 parts,
 approximately equal to each other. Let the speed of each
 through a column of very viscous liquid, such as glycerine or
 clear castor-oil, be determined. Then, using Stokes's result,

   Hence                    Sm = ASr*.
   But Sm = M, the whole mass of mercury, and 2t$= V», the
speed that the whole mass would have if it fell as a sphere
through the infinite liquid. Perhaps taken as a whole the
mercury would not fall as a sphere, and the liquid in the
burette would not be as of infinite extent ; but by this sub
division such errors are avoided.
   We thus get the speed V corresponding to the mass M,
and these values can be applied at once in the equation

Moreover the mass of each of the smaller spheres may be
easily estimated, since

and
    The author has been able in this way to determine the mass
 of a small sphere (and hence its radius) weighing about
 •003 grm., correct to four significant figures. Having thus
 determined its dimensions, it may be employed for other
 liquids than that by which these dimensions were obtained.
    But the important question suggests itself whether fi is
 simply inversely proportional to the speed of the falling
 sphere, or whether, as some maintain, there is a finite coeffi
 cient of sliding-friction, and a definite amount of slipping at
 the surface, which will render the connexion between v and
 in much more complicated.
    This may be tested in a simple manner by observing the
 speed V for a small mass, dividing it into two parts, and
 observing the speeds »j and v2 for each part in the same
 viscous liquid at the same temperature. If there be no
  sliding-friction,
  If sliding-friction exists the effect will be to render the V
 calculated in the above equation from vx and t>s greater than
 the observed speed for the undivided mass, the divergence
  being most clearly shown when the two parts are as nearly
  as possible equal to each other.
     For let us assume that the whole is divided into two equal
  parts, and that the two speeds observed are V and t^, corre
  sponding to the two radii A and a.
     Now A3 = 2a3, and A is therefore =%$a.

                      /9a+2/* ' l-26/Sa + o>"
Since all the quantities involved are positive, this ratio is
evidently greater than unit}-. As ft varies from oo to zero,
the value of the ratio increases from 1 to a maximum l+k,
and then diminishes to 1 again. Thus the divergence be
tween the calculated and the observed speeds does not become
greater as the coefficient of sliding-friction diminishes, al
though this divergence is actually due to the sliding.
   Taking the value *04 centim. for the radius of the sphere,
the maximum value of k will be j-, the divergence thus
amounting to about 2£ per cent.       The ratio ^ that gives this
result is ^or /9=55/a.
    If we assume ~ to have the same value for glycerine that
                    p
Helmholtz assigns to water, the difference between the ob
served and the calculated speeds will amount to about 1 in 144
for such spheres (a = '04 centim.) as were employed in the
investigation.
   Various experiments were recently made by the author to
test these results ; considerable difficulty was experienced in
keeping tho temperature constant, except when this was 0° C.
The tests hitherto made are not regarded as final, and the
author would prefer to defer their publication until the series
of experiments is complete. But the divergences from the
simple law as at first assumed are in all cases within the limits
of experimental error, and the method of determining viscosity
is not shown to be defective by those test experiments. The
temperature difficulty is not so serious in the case of colza-
oil, which is one of the liquids experimented upon. The
error involved with speeds not exceeding 2 centim. per second
through that liquid did not range beyond +0'2 per cent.,
and it was as usual to get positive errors as to get negative.
Times were estimated only to the same degree of accuracy.
   It is possible that sliding may occur if the speed of the

                      the Viscosity of Liquids.               455
sphere M exceeds a certain limiting value. This also is
obviated by determining its speed indirectly as (2-v*)*, since
each individual portion travels so much more slowly.
   There is another reason why better results may be expected
by this process of subdivision. Mercury is liquid, and a
sphere would be deformed if it passed rapidly through the
viscous medium. Its speed would be diminished, and it could
not be dealt with directly by the fundamental equation con
necting fi and V. But by subdivision the masses and speeds
dealt with are reduced to such an extent that we may con
fidently assume the shapes to remain spherical. If the
deformation thus produced were appreciable, it could again
be manifested by the application of the formula
                            V*=S(rl).
The calculated V would be greater than the observed V, the
error being of the same sign as that produced by the neglect
of any possibly existing sliding-friction.
   The error produced by the sides of the burette, which may
be so near as to retard the downward motion, is also diminished
by the subdivision of the original mass. This also would
have the same sign as the other errors specified. The simplest
way of testing its existence is to insert into the upper portion
of the burette-tube a thin glass cylinder of smaller diameter,
and to send down a sphere along the axis of these two con
centric cylinders. In the upper portion of its path the sphere
is at a smaller distance from the boundary of the liquid than in
the lower portion. If the sides actually affect the motion,
the speed of the sphere will suddenly change when it enters
into the wider portion of the liquid column. If the change
of speed is not appreciable, it may be assumed that the
diameter of the burette is sufficiently large.
   It has hitherto been assumed that we have the means of
keeping the temperature of the liquid constant. This is of
the utmost importance, inasmuch as the temperature-variation
of viscosity is rarely inconsiderable. The viscosity of glycerine
changes from 45 to 8 in the range of 16° from 4° to 20° 0.
At a temperature of 15° C. there is a 10-per-cent. variation
per degree change. This implies that to get the viscosity
correct to four significant figures the thermometers employed
should read to -01° C.
   In the case of olive-oil, using Osborne Reynolds's empirical
formula for the viscosity at any temperature between 15° and
50c C,
                         fjL=S-265e~omi.

45(3                Mr. Owen Glynne Jones on
Any such equation, u = Ae~tt, means that the percentage
variation per degree is constant, since its differential equa
tion is
                          da
                          —~ = constant.
                         a at
   For olive-oil this constant is '0123 and the percentage
variation is 1*23 for any temperature within the given limits—
about one ninth of the change in the viscosity of glycerine
per degree. In this case the thermometer should read to -^
of a degree. It is useless to calculate the viscosity of gly
cerine beyond the fourth significant figure unless there be
means for the accurate determination of temperature correct
to at any rate -001° C.
   The liquids experimented upon are all bad conductors of
heat, and though this is advantageous in that the change of
temperature during the course of an observation is not likely
to be great, it is a disadvantage in that it takes a long time for
the temperature to become uniform throughout the length of
the column of liquid. It is quite possible for a difference of
temperature of "10C. to exist at points in the liquid 1 dcm.
apart even though the water has been circulating in the jacket
for some minutes.
   The temperature can only be expected to be uniform when
the circulation has been of constant temperature for about
20 minutes.
   But it is of importance to note that small variations in the
temperature of the liquid at different points along the path of
the falling sphere need not trouble us much if the mean
temperature be known. And, similarly, small changes in
the mean temperature of the whole during the course of an
experiment may be harmless if the mean temperature during
the interval be known.
   For it can be proved that the speed of flow of a body is
the speed corresponding to the mean temperature, however
the temperature may vary along the length, if the speed be
small and if the temperature-variation be small. Both these
conditions are satisfied in the actual experiments undertaken.
The inertia of the body is so small that it almost instantly
assumes the limiting speed corresponding to the temperature
of that part of the liquid through which it is moving.
   Let the temperature vary from 0X at one end to 0a at the
other end of the column of length I. Let the corresponding
viscosities be ^ and fa ; and let 6 and a be the temperature
and viscosity at a point at distance x from the top of the
 column.

Hence                   T = t.
   It therefore is only necessary to determine the mean tem
perature during the interval, and even this is unnecessary if
our object is to compare two masses of mercury by their
speeds, if they are made to follow each other sufficiently
rapidly for the mean temperatures to remain constant in the
two cases.
   If a variation in temperature along the tube be suspected,

458               Mr. Owen Glynne Jones on
the test is simply to send down a minute sphere and observe
its speed for short lengths all along the tube. This speed is
constant if the temperature is uniform. In accurate esti
mations of absolute viscosity the variation in speed should not
exceed 1 in 1000 along the tube.
   It is probably preferable to read the temperature by a
thermometer inserted in the viscous liquid, using a burette
of sufficient bore to render the insertion safe. But good
results have been obtained with the thermometer in the
water-jacket, tied close to the inner tube ; this arrangement
serves quite well when the water-jacket is fairly constant
in temperature.
   An observation with glycerine cannot be called good if the
temperature-variation exceeds '03° C, and any that are made
with greater variation must be discounted. This conclusion
is forced upon one when the periods of falling are taken for
the same sphere twenty or thirty times in succession. The
curve plotted, connecting the temperature with the time of
falling, is a straight line within a range of 1° C, and it is
generally found that the points farthest from the straight line
correspond to the greatest variation of temperature during the
fall. Such a curve supplies us with the means of determining
the correction necessary to reduce a speed at one temperature
to that at another.
   To ensure that the falling sphere shall remain in the axis of
the burette, the burette and its jacket are mounted vertically
on a stand fitted with levelling-screws, such as that of an
ordinary Jolly's balance. The mercury is let down into the
burette by a small funnel. The speed is determined by
observing the time taken to pass from one mark to another.
The distance taken was generally about 50 centim., measured
correct to | millim., the time taken to traverse that distance
being from 100 to 200 seconds. The time was measured
with an ordinary watch beating fifths-seconds, or more
recently with a Siemens chronograph. In either case the
masses of mercury were so chosen that the probable error iu
a single observation was 1 in 1000.
   The following results are for glycerine at temperatures of
18°'28 and 40,i*5 C. The former agrees closely with a value
obtained by interpolation from Schottner's results. The
latter would appear to be considerably higher than the
corresponding interpolation.

                           V* = -85434,
which agrees fairly well with the above result.
   The temperature-variation of viscosity is considerable. It
is of practical importance in certain applications, as, for
example, in the use of viscous liquids for lubricating pur
poses. A special piece of apparatus was used by the author
to investigate this variation for different liquids.
   It consists of a glass tube closed at each end, with a lateral
tube fixed at right angles to its middle portion and forming
an outlet. The vessel is filled with the liquid and a very
minute sphere of mercury is inserted. A thermometer passes
through a stopper that encloses the liquid, the bulb of the
thermometer reaching just up to the main tube. The vessel
is immersed in a copper water-bath so that the main tube is
vertical and the thermometer horizontal. The thermometer
passes out of the bath through a small stuffing-box on one
side. A window of glass is inserted in the opposite side of
the bath through which the motion of the mercury may be
observed. As soon as the mercury has fallen to one end of
the tube, it is reversed and the mercury allowed to fall down
to the other end again.
   The thermometer reads the temperature of the viscous
liquid at its middle, this being very nearly the mean tem
perature. The bath is heated slowly to about 50° and then

                       the Viscosity of Liquids.             461
allowed to cool, during both of which operations the times of
descent of the mercury from one fixed mark to another are
carefully noted through the window, the water being stirred
constantly. The times of descent are proportional to the
viscosities, if a slight correction be made in each case for the
variation in the densities of the mercury and the liquid, with
change of temperature.
    To illustrate the nature of this correction let us take the
case of glycerine,
                                   <7»
where T is the time of falling, and a and p are the densities
of mercury and glycerine respectively.
    If « and r are the corresponding coefficients of expansion,
This is approximated by taking s=              and r= .  »,
                      /* = K(12-34 + -0002<)T.
The correction is therefore unnecessary between 0° and '60°,
and is only 1 in 1200 from 30° to 70°. For ordinary tem
 peratures it may therefore be neglected.
    With a relative viscosity-curve thus obtained, and with one
 good absolute determination, we have the means of calculating
 the absolute viscosity at any temperature along the range.
    Conversely, we have the means of estimating small masses
 of mercury by their speed of flow through glycerine or any
 other known liquid at a known temperature, or of estimating
 the mean temperature of the liquid.
     For example, if a column of liquid be heated from above
 till its state of temperature becomes constant without the aid
 of convection, we can here determine the temperature-curve
 along its length, and in fact employ Forbes's method to
 determine the thermal conductivity of the liquid at various
 temperatures.
     In concluding this description of the methods now being
 employed for the determination of absolute and relative
 viscosities, it may be well to remark on the advantages and
 disadvantages of these methods that have already manifested
 themselves. In the first place we are dealing with steady
 motions, and are able to investigate the phenomena attending

41)2                On the Viscosity of Liquids.
a constant rate of shearing in the liquid much more satisfac
torily than if we observe an oscillating motion such as that
of Coulomb's disk or Helmholtz's sphere. The existence of
sliding-friction can be directly tested, not only between mer
cury and the more highly viscous liquids, but also between
any two liquids that do not dissolve each other. Thus spheres
of water may be used with nearly all the fixed oils, and
spheres of oil of cloves (density l-0475) or of oil of myrrh
(density l"018y) may be used with water.
   The apparatus is simple and inexpensive ; results may bo
rapidly obtained when a few standard mercury spheres are
preserved. They should be kept in a sample of the viscous
liquid to be tested. If a sphere breaks, the pieces should be
washed in water and reunited on hard pressed blotting-paper.
The quality of oils is often tested by their viscosity, and
special viscosimeters on the capillary-tube principle of
Poiseuille are used for the purpose. A time-reading through
a sample of the oil with a standard mercury sphere offers ar:
expeditious way of testing. If the oil is thin and the mercury
falls too fast, a calibrated water sphere may be used instead.
A sphere of water of 1 millim. radius, coloured with eosin to
be clearly visible, travels at the rate of one inch per hour in
castor-oil at 8° C. ; and here in parenthesis it may be added
that we have by far the simplest method of observing the
time-integral of temperature for small ranges.
   The general method cannot be employed for opaque liquids,
as we wish to observe the falling sphere ; but it is probable
that with a little ingenuity this difficulty could be overcome
if the opaque liquid presented itself for examination. The
small inertia of the falling sphere, advantageous as it is in
exhibiting the slightest variations of temperature, is a serious
objection if small solid particles are held in suspension in the
liquid. As a rule these particles will avoid the small sphere
and not touch it ; but in the event of contact occurring
there is the likelihood of a permanent union between the two
and of the particle being dragged down with the sphere, with
consequent loss of speed of the latter. Hence clear liquids
must be used.

Ilenrici for very kindly rendering available the apparatus of

           XLIV. The Attachment of Quartz Fibres,
              By 0. V. Boys, A.R.S.M., F.R.S.*
MEMBERS of the Physical Society may remember that
         in 1887 f I described a method of making fine fibres
of glass and other materials, but especially of melted quartz,
which latter had properties of great value, rendering them
more suitable for experimental work of combined delicacy
and accuracy than those of other known materials. Experi
ments made since by others as well as myself have further
shown that for delicate work of the highest degree of accuracy
they are essential.
   Tbe method of fastening them, however, at their ends to
the pointed end of the torsion-pin at the top or of the
suspension below by shellac varnish, or better by melted
shellac, is apt to give rise, more especially if the fibre is
unskilfully laid in place so that it is twisted round the
point, to a slow creeping of the point of rest due to slow
changes in the shellac. This, except for the first few days,
can hardly ever be of an amount to seriously affect any ob
servations ; in fact I have made many observations of tbe
effect of gravitation between small masses with fibres so
fastened of a great degree of accuracy, besides those with the
radiomicrometer, pocket electrometer, &c, without any incon
venience, yet I have felt that some method of attaching them
which would be less likely to hold the fibre by a part in a
state of torsional strain or of flexure would be preferable. If
the part of the fibre held could certainly be in its natural
position and state with respect to the rest, then, even if the
fastening should fail to be as perfect as a true weld, any
resulting change of zero should be small compared to that
observed where the portion held is twisted or much bent.
   The process of silvering, electro-coppering, and soldering is
an obvious one, but it is not so easily carried out with a fair
degree of certainty and in a manner which is convenient of
application, as might be expected. My experience of last
autumn has enabled me to perform the process in a series of
operations, each simple enough, and, as far as I am able to
test it in the apparatus with which I am now measuring the
Newtonian constant of gravitation (which I may say is of
unusual delicacy), with perfect success. In this case the fibre
is necessarily stretched to not far from its breaking weight,

464                  Mr. C. V. Boys on the
and it is in such cases that the stability of the fastening is
most severely tried.
   The first thing I found was that it was a mistake to solder
the fibre to the torsion-rod and to the suspension directly.
The difficulty of the manipulation is great and a change of
fibre is very troublesome. The preferable plan is to solder
the ends of the fibre to little tags of metal so small and
light that they may be picked up by the fibre from any
thing on which they rest without risk of snapping the fibre
at the point of junction. These tags, which are conveniently
made of copper-foil, five millimetres long and one millimetre
wide about at the wide end, tapering nearly to a point, can
afterwards be fastened to the torsion support and the sus
pension by shellac varnish or by melted shellac, and now the
enormous surface and the stiffness of the foil is sufficient to
prevent any trouble from the causes to which reference has
already been made.
   These tags might also for some purposes, either or both of
them, be made of T-form to hang in a pair of V's, and so
dispense with cement altogether, and allow of the easy inter
change of suspensions or of fibres, but 1 have not myself
employed such a form.
   The following operations are those which I have found to
answer :—
   1. Select a fibre of the right diameter to give the desired
torsion. Since the torsion depends on the fourth power of
the diameter, a small change in the diameter makes a four
fold change in the torsion, and great accuracy of measurement
is needed where an exact torsional rigidity is required. Cut
off a piece from two to three centimetres longer than will
ultimately be required.
   2. Fasten to the extreme ends of the fibre, with melted
shellac, little weights of gold or platinum heavy enough to
pierce a liquid surface.
   3. Hang the fibre over a fixed round horizontal rod of
wood, 1 centimetre in diameter or thereabouts, so that the
little weights hang side by side, and lift up from below a little
glass of strong nitric acid, so as to wet and clean the fibre
well above the final points of attachment. The vessel mast
be wide enough to prevent capillarity from drawing the
fibres to one side, or it must be brimful so that the surface
is convex, which with nitric acid is objectionable.         The
vessel must be moved both upwards and downwards past
the place at which the weights pass through the surface very
rapidly, practically with a jerk; otherwise the weights will be
drawn together by capillarity, and the fibres will get twisted.

                   Attachment of Quartz Fibres.             465
or capillarity will give trouble somehow. With the rapid
movement the little weights hardly acquire any pendular
motion.
    4. After a minute or two do the same, but to a slightly
greater depth, with water which may be distilled.
    5. When the acid may be supposed to be washed off, im
merse in the same way in Rochelle salt silvering-solution
 (Kohlrausch, ' Physical Measurements/ p. 115).
    6. Wash as in 4.
    7. Fill a glass with the copper solution that is employed in
electrolytic measurements of current, t. e. not saturated, and
slightly acid. Dip the extreme point of the positive wire from
a single cell into the liquid, and with a clean smooth negative
wire take the hanging ends, one at a time, and having made
the contact outside the glass by resting the upper part of the
silver coat upon the wire, let down into the solution, keeping
the fibre in gentle movement on the wire and making it dip
 more and less in the liquid. In a few seconds the little
 weight will be bright red, and the immersed portion of the
 silvered coat will be bright red also. The silver coat has
 sufficient resistance to prevent unduly rapid deposition. Do
 the same to the other end.
     8. Cut off to length, allowing about 5 millimetres at each
 end for the junction. Take tags of copper-foil three or four
 centimetres long and three or four millimetres wide, tapering
 to a point, and having tinned the pointed end of each with
 the minimum of solder, again wet with chloride-of-zinc
 solution. On the wet surface lay the coppered end, taking
 care that it points in the right direction. Capillarity will
 now hold it. Rapidly heat the copper to the melting-point
 by holding a point about one centimetre from the narrow end
 over a minute flame. The solder will flash and envelope the
 coppered fibre. Cut off the tag of the desired length, holding
 the metal by the tag with a pair of pliers and not by the
 heavy end.
     9. Wash in boiling water as in 4 to remove chloride of
 zinc. The fibre is now attached, but the protruding silver
 and copper give a want of definiteness in the place of
 attachment.
      10. Dip up to the point of the tag in melted beeswax,
  following the precautions given in 3, Dut the two tags may
 be more conveniently dipped separately.
      11. Dip up to the top of the copper and silver in strong
  nitric acid.
      12. Wash in boiling water, which removes acid and bees
  wax and leaves the fibre ready for use.

4(JG             Tlu Attachment 0/ Quartz Fibres.
    13. If it is required to conduct electricity, as for instance
to keep the needle of a quadrant electrometer electrically
connected with a buttery, the whole may now be silvered in
a long tube and washed, otherwise it will insulate most
perfectly. It may be mentioned here that for the most
delicate possible electrometer, as I found in my experiments
on the pocket electrometer, it is useless to expect to find any
stability where a liquid surface is pierced. The only method
of communicating with the needle is through a silvered
quartz fibre. Owing to the insulating quality of a clean
quartz fibre, delicate experiments are apt to be disturbed by
unintended electrification of the suspension, and this may
still remain after means have been employed to prevent it,
for mere metallic contact between different metals leaves the
surfaces in effect at different potentials, depending on the
metals used, and, as I showed, in an idiostatic instrument
the disturbance due to platinum and zinc is many hundred
times the least that can be detected.
   I have sought to reduce this form of error by either or
both of two methods. In the first I make the inside of the
chamber surrounding the suspension a figure of revolution,
the axis being the line of the fibre; in the other, when possible,
I make the surfaces of the suspension and of the enclosure
one and the same, preferably electro-gilt.
   The first method in very small instruments also in the
main avoids what can no longer be safely neglected, as it has
hitherto nearly always been, viz. gravitational attraction.
   There is one more point which may be of some interest.
If an unsilvered quartz fibre is threaded through a small hole
in n thin metal plate, stretched by a suspended weight, and
the hole is then wetted with chloride of zinc and soldered up,
the fibre will, after washing off the fused chloride of zinc,
pull out, leaving a hole fine and beautifully circular.
   It is unnecessary to say more than I have already done, on
more than one occasion, on the necessity for making the free
space round a suspension in any instrument of extreme
delicacy as small as possible and enclosing it by massive
metal, itself protected from outside heating and cooling by a
non-conducting cover, such as I have in the radio-micrometer ;
otherwise the convection currents set np in the free space will
blow the suspension about, and produce vagaries which might
be easily attributed to the fibre or its attachment. The dis
turbances due to this cause are apt to be much greater than
anyone would at first imagine, and the small trouble spent in
avoiding them in the manner indicated is well rewarded.
   With regard to the manipulation with fine fibres, I have

     Method offinding the Refractive Index of a Liquid.          407
already pointed out that the darkness inside a drawer just
pulled out, if the operator is sitting at a table in front of a
window with a good light, is such that fine fibres can readily
be seen upon it as a background. No velvet or smoked surface
or artificial blackness of any kind is comparable with it. On
such backgrounds fine fibres are to all intents and purposes
invisible. What is in many respects preferable to the dark
background, at least in certain operations, is a plain looking-
glass lying on the table. Fibres resting upon it become
intensely brilliant and visible, provided the eye is so placed
as not to sec the sky light itself reflected from the mirror.
One method of making the fibres very easily visible without
influencing their torsion, is to smoke them with burning
magnesium or arsenic. I do not suggest arsenic, but I men
tion it because of the very beautiful effect I once observed,
after destroying all life in a small hot-house by burning a
large quantity of bengal fire in which orpiment is a con
siderable constituent. All the spider-webs remained perfect
with the spiders in their places as though alive, and the webs
were of a dazzling white but perfect in form, undragged by
the weight of the white arsenic upon them, thus contrasting
strongly with the catenary distorted webs so much admired
in frosty weather. It was this observation that suggested the
magnesium smoking.
   These last few points hardly come directly under the title
of this paper, but I thought them worth adding as bearing
upon the successful design of apparatus in which the full
limit of delicacy and accuracy obtainable by the quartz fibre
may be obtained, and upon the practical details of its
treatment.

                      Apparatus required.
THE chief piece of apparatus required for the method is a
     telescope with fixed wires in the eyepiece, arranged so as
to be capable of motion along a horizontal scale, without
changing its inclination to the vertical. The horizontal
motion can be measured either by a vernier or by a micro
meter-screw.

   The liquid whose refractive index is to be determined is
placed in a glass vessel about 3 feet away from the telescope,
and with its level slightly below that of the telescope.
   A scale of glass (or some material not acted on by the
liquid) is placed vertically in the liquid and illuminated by
monochromatic light. The position of the telescope on the
horizontal scale is then taken when observing the various
divisions on the vertical scale. From these readings the
index of refraction can be ascertained.

   The liquid is supposed to have the same density at the same
depth, which must be the case if it is at rest. The path of
the axis of the pencil of light from any point on the scale
which enters the telescope must be a curve.
   Suppose Pi, P2, P3 various points on the vertical scale, and
Ax, A2, A3 the corresponding positions of the inclined tele
scope when observing them. Suppose M,, Ms, M3 are the
points where the axis of the pencil cuts the surface of the
liquid, and draw PSN,, P3N3 parallel to the surface. Then it
is clear that, since MxAj, M2A2, M3A3 are parallel, P2M2 is the
same curve as N2M! moved horizontally, parallel to itself,
through the distance P2N2 or A^. P3M3 is the same curve
as N3Mi moved through the distance P3N3 or AiA(. Simi
larly for other points.
   Hence, by taking a number of points on the vertical scale
and finding the corresponding positions of the telescope, and
then plotting a curve having the vertical distances from the

470       Mr. M. Carey Lea on the Transformations of
lowest point for orJinates, and the observed distances through
which the telescope has been moved from its first position as
abscissae, we can construct the path of the axis of the pencil
through the liquid.
   A previous observation of different points on the scale,
before tho liqnid is poured into the vessel, gives the inclina
tion of the telescope to the vertical, as in the first case. By
measuring the inclination to the vortical of the tangent to the
curve obtained, we can determine the refractive index at the
various points of the liquid.
   Assuming the curve for a short distance to be a straight
line, the index of refraction of tho layer of liquid between
any two points can be calculated as in the first case, and a
similar formula will be true.
XLVI. Transformations of Mechanical into Chemical Energy.
   {Third Paper.) Action of Shearing-Stress (continued).
   By M. Carey Lea.
THAT mechanical energy may be transformed into chemical
       has been, I believe I may say, well proved by the reac
tions described in the previous papers of this series. But the
matter is one of sufficient importance to make it desirable to
accumulate evidence and to obtain a solid foundation of fact
on which to rest the argument.
   In the paper which described the effects of shearing-stress
(Phil. Mag. Jan. 1894) I was able to cite one instance
only in which the decomposition-product was obtained in
easily weighable quantities. More lately others have been
obtained, among them one, mercuric oxide, in which it can be
determined how many units (gram-metres) of mechanical
energy have been transformed into chemical.
   Silver oxide precipitated and dried in the absence of davlight
is soluble without residue in ammonia. After trituration,
therefore, the unchanged portion is easily removed by that
solvent.
   1. Half a gram of silver oxide wholly soluble in ammonia
was triturated for 20 minutes in a porcelain mortar, the un
changed portion was removed by ammonia, the residue was
treated with nitric acid, filtered, and the silver thrown down
by hydrochloric acid.
           Silver chloride obtained. . . . '0402,
           Corresponding to metallic silver . '0?>()3.
   The use of a porcelain mortar is attended with the dis

               Mechanical into Chemical Energy.               471
advantage that during the prolonged and forcible grinding
necessary, a very appreciable amount of material is removed
from the mortar and pestle which must be separated from the
product subsequently. I have therefore made some comparative
experiments with a large agate mortar and an agate pestle
provided with a stout wooden handle adapted for the use of
as much force as with a porcelain mortar. But even under
the most favourable conditions, the efficiency of such a mortar
is (as will be seen) only one fifth to one tenth that of a porce
lain mortar of the same size. This is largely due, I think, to
the high polish which is very unnecessarily given to the inside
of agate mortars.
   It is therefore better to make use of a porcelain mortar,
taking adequate means afterwards to remove the material
abraded.
   2. The same quantity of silver oxide was triturated also for
20 minutes in an agate mortar. As the abrasion is inappre
ciable, it was only necessary to dissolve out the unchanged
oxide with ammonia. There was left, metallic silver,
                               •0048,
showing the much less efficiency of the agate mortar.
   Mercuric Oxid-e.—The specimen taken was examined for its
solubility in cold dilute (one tenth) hydrochloric acid, in which
it dissolved slowly but completely.
   Half a gram was taken, and after trituration the unchanged
oxide was dissolved out by repeated digestions with hydro
chloric acid. There remained mercurous chloride, a trace of
metallic mercury, and, as a porcelain mortar was used, abraded
porcelain. The reduction-products were dissolved out by a
few drops of aqua regia, were filtered and precipitated by
hydrogen sulphide.
           Mercuric sulphide obtained . . "0354
           Corresponding to Hg .... -0305
           And to mercuric oxide .... "0329
This, therefore (disregarding the traces of metallic mercury),
is the amount of mercuric oxide which underwent reduction
to mercurous oxide.
   The oxidation of mercury to mercurous oxide and that of
mercurous to mercuric are both exothermic reactions. As
respects the thermic equivalent of the oxidation of mercury
to both its oxides, quite different numbers have been found by
different chemists. Nevertheless, if from these different num
bers we calculate the amount of heat disengaged by the com
bination of Hg30 with 0, we get almost exactly the same
figures whether we use Thomsen's results as modified by
Nernst, or those of the French chemists ; it matters little,

472        Mr. M. Carey Lea on Transformations of
therefore, which are taken. Ditte, in his work Les Mdtaux
(Fascicule ii. p. 500), adopts the numbers 21*1 and 15*5 re
spectively.
   On this basis the amount of energy that must be supplied
to convert 2 HgO to Hg30 + 0 (endothermic) is that which
corresponds to 9*9 great calories. Therefore 400 grams of
mercury existing in the state of mercuric oxide will require
that amount of energy supplied to reduce it to mercurous
oxide. One gram, therefore, will require the equivalent of
24*75 small calories and one milligram "02475.
   In the experiment described mercurous oxide corresponding
to 305 nigs, metallic mercury was obtained. The energy
required to reduce 30*5 mgs. existing as mercuric oxide to
mercurous corresponds to 0*755 water-gram-degree and this
again to 321*5874 gram-metres. This number, therefore,
322 gram-metres, represents the mechanical energy trans
formed into chemical energy in the above operation.
   Potassium Ferricyanide.—A good method of obtaining this
salt absolutely free from ferrocyanide is to dissolve the com
mercial product in hot water and add a little potassium per
manganate by degrees until the solution takes a faint reddish
colour. Very little is usually required. The solution is then
filtered and crystallized, taking me first crystals only.
   Ferricyanide, purified in this way, was triturated about 20
minutes in an agate mortar. On adding water a deep green
solution was obtained which, by standing and warming, let
fall abundance of a blue powder.
   Ferric Ammonia Alum.—A specimen of this salt which,
when tested with potassium ferricyanide, gave a pale wine-
coloured solution without a trace of green, was taken and
3 decigrams were triturated for 25 minutes in a porcelain
mortar.
   After trituration the ferrous salt formed distinctly reduced
gold solution. A few drops of the dissolved substance being
added to a solution of ferricyanide, changed it to an intense
green colour. Undoubtedly reduction had taken place. It
need scarcely be mentioned that in this case the tests should
be applied immediately after the trituration. A few hours'
interval completely changes the reactions owing to the reoxi-
dation of the ferrous salt formed.
   This experiment was repeated with additional precautions.
To a strong solution of ferric ammonia alum enough potash
permanganate was added to distinctly colour the liquid, which
was then made to crystallize quickly by cold. These crystals,
certainly free from ferrous salt, were then actively triturated
in a porcelain mortar for 25 minutes. The filtered solution

                  Mechanical into Chemical Energy.            473
 produced immediate purple clouds in a cold, very dilute so
 lution of gold chloride and an abundant blue precipitate in
 one of potassium ferricyanide.
     It is essential that the ferric alum be thoroughly dried (at
 a temperature not exceeding 40° C), otherwise, owing to the
 large quantity of water of crystallization, it will become pasty
 in grinding and then no reduction will take place.
     Cupric Chloride.—Even by long trituration this salt showed
 no indication of reduction.
     This reaction, taken with the preceding, shows how distinct
 is the action of mechanical energy from that of heat. For
 cupric chloride is reduced by heat to cuprous chloride, but
 shearing-stress has no such action. On the other hand,
 shearing-stress reduces ferric sulphate, which heat does not.
     Sodium Chloraurate.—In the previous paper, the effect of
 triturating this salt in a porcelain mortar was given. For
 comparison it has since been tried in an agate mortar. With
 20 to 25 minutes' trituration, 3 decigrams gave 2-7 milligrams
 metallic gold, showing, as in other cases, the much lower
 efficiency of the agate mortar.
    Silver Carbonate.—Half a gram was triturated about
 25 minutes in a porcelain mortar. It darkened much. The un
 altered carbonate was dissolved out by exhausting repeatedly
 with ammonia. The residue was treated with nitric acid,
filtered, and the silver thrown down by hydrochloric acid.
 It amounted to 11 milligrams, corresponding to metallic silver
                                 •0083.
    Silver Sulphite was precipitated in a dark room by alkaline
sulphite and treated in the same manner as the foregoing.
Silver chloride obtained "0092, corresponding to metallic
silver                           -0069.
    Silver compounds, although easily giving weighable results,
are not well suited for determining the transformation of
energy that takes place. It is probable that the reduction is
to argentous salt, but it is not certain. Ammonia decomposes
argentous salts into argentic salts that dissolve and metallic
silver that remains. So that whether we consider the reduc
tion as being to argentous salt or to metal, in either case we
find the same quantity of metallic residue and cannot distin
guish with certainty.
    It scarcely needs to be said that the object of these various
determinations is not to establish any relation between the
quantity of substance taken and the amount of decomposition
that ensues, for none exists. It often happens that when a
larger quantity is taken there results a diminished decom-

position product, the particles protect one another. And even
¦when all other things are equal, the product will depend on
the activity and dexterity with which the grinding is done.
    But what is really important is that the amounts obtained
enable us in particular cases to determine the exact amount
of mechanical energy which has been transformed.
    In concluding this paper, two cases will be mentioned
which do not belong to the above category, inasmuch as the
reductions are exothermic. As a general rule, to canse sub
stances to part with oxygen, energy must be supplied, but
there are exceptions. Auric oxide, for example, disengages
heat in parting with oxygen, and the same is the case with
potassium permanganate.
    Auric Oxide.—As just said, the reduction of auric oxide is
 exothermic. Thomsen found the equations for its formation :
             2Au + 30 + 3H20 = 2Au (OH)3-2 x 66.
    The production, therefore, of a molecule of auric hydroxide
 requires that G"6 C. be supplied. We should, therefore,
expect to find gold hydroxide more easily and more largely
 reduced by shearing-stress than other oxides.
    Experiment confirms this expectation, and although this
 case does not belong to the subject proper of this paper, which
 deals with endothermic reactions, it seems sufficiently in
 teresting to add in this appendix.
    Gold trioxide hydrate, Au (0H)3, was obtained by Figuier's
 method (a gold solution is rendered strongly alkaline with
 potash or soda, and barium chloride is added as long as it
 causes a precipitate. Part of the gold remains in solution.
 The barium aurate is washed and decomposed with very dilute
 nitric acid). The brown powder after drying was ascertained
 to be completely soluble in warm dilute hydrochloric acid
 (1 to 10), showing that no gold had been reduced.
     (1) Of gold oxide 155 mgs. wore taken and were tritu
 rated 25 minutes in a porcelain mortar. The large reduction
 was at once evident to the eye, the pestle looked as if plated
 with bright gold. The unchanged portion of oxide was removed
 by digesting with dilute hydrochloric acid. The metallic
 fold was dissolved in aqua regia, reduced and weighed.
   t amounted to ... . "0718.
     The 155 mgs. of gold oxide taken contained 1231 of gold.
 The reduction was, therefore, as 718 to 1231. Fifty-eight
  per cent., or more than half the gold contained in the material
 employed, was reduced.
     (2) 200 mgs. gold oxide were triturated 30 minutes in a

 porcelain mortar. After removing the unchanged oxide as
 above, the metallic gold was dissolved, filtered, and reduced.
    Obtained                      -0538.
    Potassium Permanganate.—Two molecules of permanganate
by reduction to 2Mn02H20 lose 3 atoms of oxygen and at
the same time 28*4 cal. The reaction is therefore exo
thermic.
    By active trituration a portion of the permanganate taken
easily undergoes reduction. Exhausted with water, a brownish-
black insoluble residue remains, which dissolves with effer
vescence in strong warm sulphuric acid, forming a violet
solution—the residue is therefore manganic peroxide.
    Three estimations were made. A first rough one, after
trituration for 25 minutes in a porcelain mortar, gave of washed
and dried material which had become insoluble, 43 mgs.
   The second was made on a like quantity of permanganate,
also in a porcelain mortar. The portion rendered insoluble
was dissolved in hydrochloric acid, and estimated as Mn3Cv
    Quantity obtained . . "0136,
showing that 28'25 mgs. of permanganate had been reduced
to Mn02.
   The same quantity of permanganate treated in the same
wa}' in an agate mortar gave only '0030 Mn02, owing to the
less efficiency of the mortar.
   The reduction in the case of these last two substances are
exothermic ; they, however, do not take place spontaneously,
but require the aid of an exterior force—this aid is supplied
by shearing-stress.
   In these three papers a large number of reactions have
been described in which mechanical energy has been trans
formed into chemism. The number might be extended, but
in practice is necessarily limited to those cases in which a
perfect separation can be made between the original substance
and the altered product.

 476              J. H. van't Hoff on the Origin
 occurred to me that I might conveniently start from one of
 two centres. It was open to me to give an account either of the
 investigations on double salts and the limits of their existence,
 or of the theory of dilute solutions and osmotic pressure. As
 I had no desire to introduce a topic which might prove un
 welcome to the members of the Society, I remitted the choice
 of the subject to the committee. Although I had half hoped
 it would be otherwise, they expressed themselves in favour of
 the theory of solutions, but in giving an account of this sub
 ject I have promised to avoid everything of a polemical
 nature. Another reason which would have induced me to
 eschew this subject is that, in outline at least, it is already
 familiar to most of you ; consequently, a simple exposition
 would be mere repetition. I think, therefore, that it would
 be better to consider for a short time the origin of the theory
 of solutions; not for the purpose of espousing claims of
 priority, but rather to disclose how the train of ideas deve
 loped in my mind, so that finally the opponents can also say
 " Dass alles wissen, alles vergeben ist.
    All my opinions in regard to the " position of the atoms in
 space," which were only a structure founded on the relation
 ship between a physical property, viz. optical activity, and
chemical constitution, began to germinate when I commenced
the study of chemistry under Kekule and Wislicenus. Young
as I was at that time, I wished to determine the relation
between constitution and chemical properties, for a con
stitutional formula should express the complete chemical
behaviour of a substance.
    This was the origin of my work Ansichten uber die organ-
ische Chemie, which is possibly not known to you. It little
matters. It was only of value to me in so far as it clearly
indicated a gap in our knowledge. As is well known, the
oxygen in organic compounds exercises an accelerating action
on almost all changes ; for example, the oxidation of methane
is more difficult than the oxidation of methyl alcohol, and so on.
    An accurate knowledge of the velocity of reactions was
thus rendered necessary, and this consequently gave rise to
my work Etudes de dynamique chimique. The study of che
mical equilibrium, which depends on the equality of two
opposed reactions, naturally accompanied that of the velocity
of reaction, and was placed on a sure basis by its connexion
with thermodynamics. As often happens, in trying to reach
my goal I was getting farther and farther from it. And
since the question of equilibrium is intimately connected with
the problem of chemical affinity, I first of all encountered a

                   of the Theory of Solutions.                477
very simple phenomenon of affinity, namely the attraction for
water.
   Mitscherlich (Lehrbuch der Chemie, 4th edit. 1844, p. 565)
had already inquired into the magnitude of the attraction
which Glauber's salt has for its water of crystallization, and
perceived a measure of it in the diminished pressure of the
water of crystallization. He says (JLoc. cit.), " If Glauber's
salt be introduced into a Torricellian vacuum at It0, the mer
cury sinks 2"5 lines (5"45 millim.) by the liberation of aqueous
vapour. On the other hand, water itself causes a fall of
4 lines (8'72 millim.). Hence the affinity of sodium sulphate
 for ts water of crystallization corresponds to the difference,
1"5 line (3*27 millim.), t. e. about      of a pound       kilog.)
per square inch (2"615 square centim.)."
   This value, ^-J0 of an atmosphere, seemed to me excessively
small, and I still retained the opinion, which I had obtained
from Helmholtz's Faraday Lecture, that even the weakest
chemical forces are exceedingly great. It was therefore
desirable to see if this attraction for water could be more
directly measured in still simpler cases ; in aqueous solution,
for example, we have probably a much simpler phenomenon
than the attraction for water of crystallization. Whilst pon
dering over these questions I met my colleague de Vries and
his wife as I was leaving the laboratory. De Vries happened
to be occupied with osmotic experiments, and called my atten
tion to Pfeffer's determinations.
   You are all familiar with the apparatus which Pfeffer used.
It consisted of a porous pot, the wall of which was rendered
semipermeable by precipitating in it a layer of copper ferro-
cyanide. This semipermeable membrane, which allowed
water but not a dissolved substance, for instance sugar, to
pass through, admitted of the measurement of the osmotic
pressure, which amounted in the case of a 1 per cent, sugar-
solution to two thirds of an atmosphere.
   This pressure was exceptionally great when compared with
Mitscherlich's number, but there is nevertheless a relationship
between them.
   If in fig. 1 we suppose the sugar-             Fi°r. 1.
solution contained in the lower left-hand
side and separated from the water on
the right side by means of a semiper
meable membrane, then the water will
pass from right to left until the pressure
reaches the amount observed by Pfeffer.
In the space above the liquids, however,          3r« ffer

478                J. H. van't Hoff on the Origin
the water-vapour passes in the same direction, but only
until the pressure reaches that measured by Mitscherlich.
   It is even possible to make a calculation founded on this
interdependence. The force with which Mitscherlich dealt is
small because it acts on the attenuated vapour, whilst that of
Pfeffer is large because it refers to the concentrated water.
Thus we have:—
   Pfeffer : Mitscherlich - 1000 : -P- 0'08956 j (l+ ^/),
so that we can calculate Pfeffer's force from the diminution
of vapour-pressure (freezing-point).

              36              0-746            0-737
   The above proportionality is not quite exact. The accurate
formula is obtained if the work which the attraction for the
water can perform is made the starting-point ; this is inde
pendent of the fact whether the water as such, or its vapour,
is transferred. Hence we get the relation for 18 kilos water,
                       211. ^ = _LpV;

where pw and pi represent the pressure of the water and the
solution respectively, P the osmotic pressure in kilos per
square metre, and V the volume in cub. centims. of 18 kilos of
water.
   This formula reproduces Pfeffer's results very exactly. It
also lends itself for the determination of the pressure when p
only is known ; so that we have the solution of Mitscherlich s
problem in regard to the water of crystallization, for obviously
this attraction for water corresponds to that of a solution
having an equal maximum vapour-pressure. Hence we get: —

i. e. in order to prevent Na2S0, from taking up its water of
crystallization, for example in Pfeffer's apparatus, a pressure
of 600 atmospheres at 9° is necessary and sufficient.
    We must now return from Mitscherlich's affinity problem
of the attraction for water of crystallization, where we are
obviously dealing with enormous concentrations, to the ques
tion of dilute solutions. Hitherto I have been drawing your
attention to what appeared in my Etudes de dynamique chi-
mique, and now I would like to refer to a publication in the
Archives Neerlandaises. There I gave the proof of my
equation,
                              dlK.      q
which also occurred in my Etudes.
    The introduction of this equation here is only of secondary
importance. The chief point to be noted is, that I was able
 by means of reversible cycles to deduce this equation for
dilute gas systems. I should now like to show its applicability
to dilute solutions.
    It occurred to me that all the reversible cycles which so
 greatly simplify the use of thermodynamics in treating of
 gases, are also applicable to dilute solutions, provided that a
 semipermeable wall is employed, as may be seen from the
 following figure.
    This was a decided advance, and it clearly followed that
 the osmotic pressure for dilute solutions must obey Gay-
 Lussac's law, or, in other words, must vary with the tempe
 rature in the same way as the gas-pressure.              A direct
 comparison is simplest.
    The left side of the figure represents the well-known cycle
 for a gas. The heat supplied at T which for dilute gases
 corresponds only to the external work PAV, on lowering the
 temperature by dT is represented by the work YdP.

480              J. H. van't Hoff on the Origin
   On the rigbt side the osmotic pressure P0 is chosen equal
to P ; the cylinder is semipermeable and plunged in water,
                             Fig. 2.

the increase in volume, again AV, then corresponds (lor
dilute solutions where the heat of dilution is zero) only to the
external work PAV. Now here the same lowering of tem
perature dT must correspond to the same work V</P0, so that
we' have d¥0=dP. Incidentally it may be remarked that
such cycles take a very simple form when V is so great that
AV produces no appreciable change of pressure. On the
other hand, d¥ is so small compared with AV, that the course
of the adiabatic may be neglected.
   This result, Gay-Lussac's law for dilute solutions, was
quite in agreement with the available numerical data, although
it could not be asserted that it was sufficient to constitute a
proof. A glance at the table containing Pfeffer's results with
a 1 per cent, sugar-solution shows this.
   But there is also a second relationship, the full significance
of which was almost recognized by Pfeffer, viz., that the
osmotic pressure in dilute solutions is proportional to the
concentration ; that is to say, that Boyle's as well as Gray-
Lussac's law is applicable to dilute solutions. The mathe
matical expression for both laws is
                           PV = RT,
and with its help I was enabled to prove the above thermo-
dynamical formula, and so my goal was reached.
   On calculating the value of R, however, the result was
quite unexpected. It is well-known that for kilogramme-
molecules of gases the value of R is constant and equal to
about 846, provided that P is expressed in kilogrammes per
square metre and V in cubic centimetres. We have already

                    of the Theory of Solutions.               481
seen that Pfeffer found the osmotic pressure of a 1 per cent,
sugar-solution at 60,8 to be 0*664 atmosphere.
   We have, therefore,
         P= 0-664x10333,         V=34%          T=279-8.
Hence                        R=840.
   At first I thought this was a pure accident, and was dis
inclined, at least in the case of sugar, to attach any physical
meaning to this result. Equality of both values of R, t. e. for
gas and solution, has only one meaning however, viz. that the
sugar exerts an osmotic pressure equal to the pressure which
gnseous sugar of the same concentration and at the same
temperature would exert.
   In other words, this is the application of Avogadro's law
to sugar-solutions, the only difference being in the substitu
tion of osmotic pressure for ordinary gas-pressure.
               II. Hie Theory of Dilute Solutions.
   Although the above remarkable equality of osmotic and
gas-pressure at equal molecular concentration and temperature
appeared at first to be a mere chance, yet it occurred again
and again, and was connected with so many known and after
wards with newly discovered regularities, that at last there
seemed to be no room left for doubt.
  De Vries was the first to determine successfully the molecular
weights of substances in solution by an application of the
extended Avogadro's law. According to Loiseau-Scheibler
the molecule of raffinose contained 18 atoms of carbon, C18,
whilst Berthelot gave it a formula with C^. In order to
settle the question, a comparison was made with sugar, and
from each substance a few isotonic solutions were prepared,
i. e. solutions having equal osmotic pressures. This was
accomplished in an extraordinary manner with the help of
plant-cells containing protoplasm. The membrane of the
protoplasm is semi-permeable, and when the cells are placed
in solutions having greater osmotic pressures, the protoplasm
contracts and separates from the cell-wall, or what is termed
plasmolysis takes place. If the solution has a lower osmotic
pressure than the contents of the cell, the protoplasm continues
to fill the cell completely. The point at which the protoplasm
just begins to recede from the cell-wall when it is placed in
solutions of sugar and raffinose is sought out, and the solutions
thus proved to be isotonic. It is then only necessary, as in
the case of gases, to determine the ratio of the amounts
of sugar and raffinose contained in equal volumes of the

482              J. H. van't Hoff on the Origin
solutions in order to calculate the molecular weight. In this
way it was found that the formula of raffinose contained Cw.
This conclusion has since been confirmed by the splitting up
of raffinose into equal quantities of the three sugars—glucose,
levnlose, and galactose,—each containing six atoms of carbon.
   We will now consider the laws associated with osmotic
pressure.
   The Lowering of the Vapour-Presmre. —
If we suppose, with Arrhenius, that we
have osmotic equilibrium with a 1 per cent,
sugar-solution, as in fig. 3, where H is
the rise due to osmotic pressure, then the
column of solution H represents the
osmotic pressure and the column of vapour
H the lowering of the vapour-pressure.
Hence, for any solvent whatever, we obtain,
as before,

       Osmotic pressure         =              mnri—
where s represents the specific gravity of the solvent and
M its molecular weight in the gaseous state.
   Should the osmotic pressure be equal to the gas-pressure,
then, by comparison with hydrogen, it will be

This is the well-known law of Baoult, which states that the
molecular relative lowering of vapour-pressure is equal to
•jjyr of the molecular weight of the solvent.
   It is to be noted that here, as in all laws relating to dilute
solutions, we have only a limiting law which strictly applies
to infinitely dilute solutions, where the accurate expression of
the above law becomes

486               J. H. van't Hoflf on Hie Origin
                         III. Deviations.
   The question now arises, Is the foregoing sketch to be
considered as a theory of solution ?
   Not necessarily. It is rather a necessary correlation of
experimental results and laws, some of which have been known
for a long time, whilst others are of quite recent origin, and
I scarcely think that serious objections can be raised against
this correlation.
   It is not even necessary to select osmotic pressure as the
starting-point; the whole may be just as easily deduced from
Henry s or Baoult's law, but the osmotic law is a simple
tangible expression of the whole behaviour of dilute solutions,
and its physical meaning can be easily stated in words, and
graphically represented.
   When rarefied matter exists under such conditions that it
tends to spread itself out by diffusion, then the pressure, at any
given temperature, which prevents it from so doing depends
only on the number of molecules and is independent of their
nature and of the medium in which they exist.
   Where does the theory of solutions begin ? In my opinion
it begins where the attempt is made to explain the deviations
as being due to secondary causes.
   Such deviations exist, and immediately show themselves by
non-agreement with all the above correlated laws, for example,
in abnormal values of the osmotic pressure, deviations from
Henry's law, unexpected lowerings of freezing-point, &c.
   In now passing on to the real theory of solutions, my object
is to mention shortly in what way these deviations have been
explained, and with what success.
   One thing in particular is to be noted : the above-mentioned
relations, if they are to remain at all valid, necessitate only
that we are dealing with great dilutions, and are thus limiting
laws like those of Boyle, Gay-Lussac, and Avogadro. But it
is well-known that exceptions are also to be met with in the
case of very dilute solutions. Some lowerings of the freezing-
point are unexpectedly small, whilst others are unexpectedly
great. That this does not go so far as to conceal the main laws
is best proved by the fact that Baoult, long before the theory
of solutions, always referred to the present calculated values
as " normal."
   2V«e Small Lowerings of the Freezing-point, corresponding
to a smaller osmotic pressure, are of two kinds.
   First, and especially in the case of compounds conlaining
the bydroxyl group, e. g. the alcohols and acids in benzene
solution, values are obtained which are obviously only about

                   of the Theory of Solutions.             487
one half of the normal value. These exceptions are explained
at once by the formation of double molecules; and this expla
nation has been confirmed by the fact that such solutions on
dilution often lead to normal values, as if a dissociation of
the double molecules took place.
   Secondly, it has long been known that some acids, e. g.
formic and acetic acids, seem to have a bimolecular structure
even in the gaseous condition.
   Finally, and quite recently, Ramsay and Shields have, by
a method which is not far removed from osmotic pressure,
come to the important conclusion, similar to the above, that
alcohols and acids, in contradistinction to the hydrocarbons,
possess a polymolecular constitution ; and I have grounds for
suspecting that, if Ramsay slightly altered his method of
calculation, a still better agreement would be obtained.
   There is still another case, where small lowerings of the
freezing-point are observed, which cannot be explained by a
polymolecular constitution because simple halving is not
shown and because even a rise in the freezing-point often
occurs, as in solutions of antimony in tin, naphthol in naph
thalene, carbazol in phenanthrene.
   Then the idea occurred to me that the dissolved substance
as well as the solvent were frozen out together.
   Fig. 5 represents the vapour-pressure of ice and water
near the freezing-point, a, and also the vapour-pressure of a
                               Fig. 6.
 solution whose freezing-point lies at b. If now the ice is
 able to carry down some of the dissolved body, its vapour-
 pressure diminishes, and the freezing-point correspondingly
 rises to c, and can even lie to the right of a. As a matter of
 fact, experiment has repeatedly confirmed this assumption,
 as e. g. with solutions of lead, cadmium, tin, and gold in

488                J. H. van't Hoff on the Origin
mercury (Tammann), thiophene in benzene, antimony in tin,
naphthol in naphthalene (van Bylert), indol in naphthalene,
carbazol in anthracene (Ferratina and Garelli), and also with
ketopentene derivatives.
   According to Ferratina and Garelli it would appear that a
too small lowering of the freezing-point is a simple means
for determining the constitution of a substance, as the freezing
out of the dissolved substance is very often to be inferred
from similarity of constitution. In this way it was shown,
e.g., that nicotine probably was not a dipyridyl derivative,
and this is confirmed by the work of Pinner and Blau.
   Abnormally Large Depressions of the Freezing-point.—To
return once more to the osmotic experiment of de Vries.
The so-called isotonic coefficients, which are obtained by
comparison of isotonic solutions, express the relative osmotic
force in solutions which contain the same number of molecules
in equal volumes, or, in other words, the relative osmotic
force of molecular quantities.
   The so-called isotonic coefficients, which occur in so many
physiological experiments as conditional factors, should
according to the theory be equal to unity ; they are thus
obviously of serious importance in the development of a
"theory of solutions" and have imposed on me, in my Swedish
memoir, a certain amount of restraint in speaking of a
remarkable property frequently occurring in rarefied matter.
   Since that time, however, the state of affairs has altered.
Arrhenius has shown that the abnormally high values occur
only in solutions which conduct electricity, and numerous
reasons have been adduced to explain the abnormally high
values in consequence of the presence of ions obtained by the
splitting up of the molecules in solution. In the following table
I give the numbers which have been obtained in some of the
most significant cases, and a glance suffices to show what has
already been attained in this way:—

   Does, then, this assumption of electrolytic dissociation
correspond to actual fact ? I am just about to allude to this
matter, and I ask the continuance of your attention for a short
time in order to show what has followed from a consideration
of the narrow but important domain of saponification.
   In 1883, in conjunction with Reicher, I carefully investi
gated the velocity with which bases saponify esters. The
first experiments were made with soda and potash, and then
we tried calcium hydrate, as we expected a different velocity
of reaction. The corresponding' equations are
      KOH + OH3C02<J2H5 = CH3C02K + (J2H5OH,
 CaOsH2 + 2<JH3U0202H6 = (CH3C02)20a + 2C2H5OH.
   Proportionality between the velocity of reaction and the
square of the concentration of the ester in the latter case, and
with the concentration alone in the former, might be expected,
but we found in both cases practically the same velocity:
             Potash 2-298 ; Calcium hydrate 2-285.
This curious fact immediately found its explanation in the
theory of electrolytic dissociation, for the reaction in both
cases is conditioned by the hydroxyl alone, and hence is
 represented by the equation
           OH + CH3COjC2H6 = OhIcOj + C2H5OH.
    Ostwald observed an analogous fact, viz., that greatly
diluted acids have the same velocity of saponification. In
this case, the action is conditioned by the presence of hydrogen
 ions.
    Quite recently Wijs has, in my laboratory, investigated the
 saponifying action of water itself.
    This investigation possesses new interest on account of the
 question whether the excessively small saponifying power
 of water is due to the presence of the minute quantity of
 hydroxyl and hydrogen ions.
    In this case the question is experimentally and theoretically
 somewhat more complicated. Experimentally, the action of
 water is disturbed immediately after the commenceinent of
 the saponification by the co-operation of the acid which is
 formed, and hence must be measured only at the beginning.
 Theoretically, the increase in hydrogen ions, on account of
 the formation of acid, must be taken into account in the
 combined action of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions. In order
 to determine the quantity of acid in the exceedingly dilute
 solution (about 0'00005-normal), the conductivity, as being
 the best quantitative method, was employed.

490           The Origin of the Theory of Solutions.
    The general result of the investigation lias been the experi
mental confirmation of the theoretically predicted presence of
a minimum in the velocity. What tikes place here ? The
H- and OH-ions in the water cause the saponification; the
acid which is formed undergoes electrolytic dissociation with
the production of H-ions.
   The equilibrium -f-        —
                        H-4.0TT-r->H10J
which takes place between the H- and OH-ions on the one
hand and the water on the other, necessitates a diminution
in the number of hydroxy] ions on the appearance of new
hydrogen ions. The hydroxyl ions, however, saponify very
rapidly, and from the velocity of saponification by bases it is
calculated that they saponify 1400 times more rapidly than
hydrogen ions. Hence there must be a decrease in the velocity
caused by the disappearance of OH-ions, followed by an
increase in the velocity duo to the increased production of
 H-ions; in other words, there must be a minimum velocity.
    If C represents the concentration of the ester, and CH and
C0H the concentrations of the ions, we have mathematically:—
                 Velocity = K C (CH + 1400 C0H)
and                 CHC0H=£.
The change of velocity is
                         <ZCH + 1400dCOH,
the minimum velocity
                       rfCH=-1400dCOH
and               - 0OHrfCH = — CHrf0OH ;
hence                       0o„ =     .
The minimum therefore occurs when there are 1400 H-ions
and one OH-ion present in the solution.
    This is represented graphically in fig. 6. After about two
hours the velocity sinks to about ^ ot         initial value. At
this stage, two sets of experiments showed that a minimum
actually existed.
    A third experiment, performed with the greatest care, was
therefore made in order to determine accurately the minimum
velocity, and from this to calculate the electrolytic dissociation
 of water. The result which was obtained was 0 071 X 10~6 per

                On the Elasticity of Spider Lilies.        491

   The great importance of this result is seen on comparison
with the following numhers. Shortly before. Ostwald found
in quite a different way that the electrolytic dissociation of
water lay between 0*74 xlO-9 and 0"27xl0-a gram.-mol.
per litre ; whilst from Kohlrausch's conductivity determina
tion he calculated that the maximum value did not exceed
O-GxlO-". Arrhenius obtained O'llxlO-6 from Shields'
experiments, and Bredig estimated it at about 0"6 X 10-8
gram.-mol. per litre.
   Is the theory of electrolytic dissociation hereby proved ?
By no means. In the domain of saponification it has never
theless accomplished far more than could have been expected.
       XLVIII. Note on the Elasticity of Spider Lines.
      By James H. Gray, ALA. (Glds.), B.Sc. {Lond.)*.
THESE tests were made last summer in the Physical
      Laboratory of Glasgow University, in the course of some
work in which a very sensitive mirror-galvanometer was
required.
   When the mirror was suspended with a fine silk fibre, it
was found that, when deflected, it took an inconveniently
 long time to return to zero. This defect, common to silk
and most metal suspensions, and which has been called
 " creep," was, at the suggestion of Dr. J. T. Bottomley,
 F.R.S., obviated by using a spider's thread for supporting
the mirror.

492                    Mr. J. H. Gray on the
   In the Proceedings of the Royal Society tor 1889,
page 291*, an account is given of some very interesting
tests made of the value of the torsional rigidity of spider's
thread by Professor A. Tanakadate, of Japan. He found that
the torsional rigidity is rather loss than one sixth of that of
silk fibre of the same thickness.
   For the tests about to be described, several garden spiders,
species Epeira Diadema, about one eighth of an inch in length
of body, were caught and placed each in a separate box.
Fresh threads, free from dust, could thus be obtained. If
more than one spider was placed in the same box the number
soon became reduced to one, the others having been killed
and eaten by the survivor. It is necessary to employ the
garden spider, as the house species, which makes a closely
woven web quite different from the beautiful spiral of the
Diadema, cannot be made to spin a thread. The spinner
was taken out of its box and placed on a card or piece of
wood held about three feet or so above the ground. A slight
tap was sufficient to cause the spider to drop from the support.,
spinning a thread as it fell. Sometimes it dropped to the
floor, but in most cases it stopped when it had fallen six or
eight inches, and, after hanging apparently motionless for a
second or two, rapidly threw out an exceedingly light thread
which floated outwards and upwards in the direction of the
slightest draught. In the space of ten seconds sometimes as
many as ten feet of thread were thrown out. If the outer end
of this thread happened to attach itself to one of the adjacent
supports, the spider immediately endeavoured to make its
escape. The threads thus spun were exceedingly thin, and
could only be seen when a strong light was thrown upou
them and with a black background.
   While it was still floating, two marks were made about
50 centimetres apart, by carefully fixing with gum two pieces
of the thread, each 3 millimetres long, at right angles to the
length. Small wire weights from £ to HO milligrammes were
made, and half a milligramme was fixed a little beyond the
furthest thread-mark. This was sufficient to bring the thread
down to the vertical without appreciably stretching it. On a
vertical stand were fixed two paper scales graduated in half-
millimetre divisions, the one scale about 50 centimetres above
the other. Directly in front of these scales the thread was
hung, and by means of a telescope placed six feet away the
readings corresponding to the two marks on the thread were
obtained. Precautions were taken to prevent draughts, as

the' slightest current was sufficient to drive the thread against
the scales, from which it could only with difficulty be freed.
   The small weights were gradually fixed to the lower end of
the thread, and the corresponding readings of the marks taken.
The data were thus obtained for a stress-strain diagram, and
are shown on the annexed curve. The abscissae represent

   One milligramme corresponds to 127*3 kilogrammes per
square centimetre.
   The breaking-weight of this thread was found to be 17
milligrammes, that is, 2"16 X 106 grammes per square centi
metre. This number does not differ greatly from those for
the breaking-weights of copper (annealed), bronze, drawn
gold, palladium, and silver. It is rather greater than that for
cast iron, but considerably less than steel, and indeed than
silk fibre.
   The value for the breaking-weight per unit of cross section
of the spider's thread is given on the assumption that the
thread is circular. This is not quite correct, however, as it is
really composed of four or six strands parallel to each other.
Each of these strands, again, is made up of about one
thousand exceedingly fine threads. The cross section of the
complete thread being, therefore, virtually four or six small
circles instead of one large circle, the value given above for
the breaking-weight is probably from five to ten per cent, too
small.
    The diameter of tbe thread was very carefully measured
for me by Dr. William Snodgrass. of the Physiological
Laboratory, by means of a very finely-divided micrometer-
 scale and a powerful microscope. As measured by Dr. Snod
grass, the diameter was found to be almost exactly y^W °^
a millimetre.
    One interesting point is at once apparent on looking at the
form of the curve. Whereas in all metal threads, whenever

  494            On the Elasticity of Spider Lines.
  the elastic limit is exceeded, the extension increases iti a
  greater proportion than the tension, in spider's thread, on the
  contrary, the extension at first increases more slowly than the
. tension, and afterwards goes on at exactly the same rate up to
  the breaking-point. It will he seen that the latter part of
  the curve is practically a straight line.
                Stress-Strain Diagram of Spider's Thread.
    The hehavionr of spiders' thread under stress is very similar
 to that of muscle and all animal tissue. They show a kind of
 tetanus tendency when stretched. It also resembles india-
 rubber, as shown in a stress-strain diagram obtained by
 Professor Archibald Barr in a testing-machine designed
 hy him.
    Subject to the error caused by want of circularity of the
 thread, the Young's modulus was found to be 7"7(59 X 10s
grammes per square centimetre. This is much lower than
the value for any metal, the lowest being that of lead, which

is 51 x 106, and even than any of the woods as given in
volume iii. of Lord Kelvin's ' Collected Papers.' On account
of the thread not being circular, the calculation of the Rigidity
Modulus would of course be valueless.
   A rough trial was made of the Torsional Rigidity ; but as
the thread was very much finer than that used by Professor
Tanakadate, being about one third the diameter, it was diffi
cult to obtain a light enough twisting-weight. The result
obtained, however, agreed with that given by Prof. Tanaka
date, in so far as it showed that the torsional rigidity of
spiders' thread is considerably less than that of silk fibre.
XLIX. The Method of Fractional Distillation illustrated by
   the Investigation of Kerosene. By J. Alfred Wanklyn
   and W. J. Cooper *.
A LIQUID known as kerosene, or Russian kerosene, is
        imported into this country in immense quantities.
The liquid is produced by the distillation of crude natural
Russian petroleum in Baku, and is conveyed in tank-ships to
London. It arrives in this country in the condition of an
almost colourless oil, with very little smell, and of sp. gr.
0-825 at 15°*5 0. Apparently it is very constant in quality
and composition.
   The knowledge of it which we owe to former investigators
is that it is a mixture of hydrocarbons of the general formula
C„rl2„ ; that these hydrocarbons are not olefines, but are
isomers of the olefines. being not readily attacked by reagents.
Very few of the members of the series have been described by
former investigators. We have made a study of kerosene as
follows :—
   When kerosene is rapidly distilled in a glass retort, 70 per
cent, comes over below 250° C, about 20 per cent, between
250° and 300°, and the residual 10 per cent, may bo almost
completely volatilized ; the last 5 per cent, requiring, how
ever, a temperature much above the boiling-point of mercury.
   By careful quantitative experiment, a carefully measured
litre of kerosene being distilled in two operations, half a litre
at a time, it was ascertained that there is neither expansion nor
contraction during distillation. The observation was also made
that not until the temperature had risen to 170° C. did the
first drop of liquid distil over.
                   * Communicated by the Authors.
                                                                  /

   The actual figures of the experiment were as follows:—
                                                     cub. ceiitim.
         Distillate between 170° and 250° ...           688

                                                       1000
   That nothing should distil over below 170° is most remark
able, inasmuch as there is actually present in kerosene a liquid
with a boiling-point of 78° C. The proportion of this low-
boiling liquid is indeed small ; but there are other volatile
ingredients, and the sum total of the ingredients boiling below
170° C. amounts to more than one fifth of the total kerosene.
   The 688 cub. centim. of distillate (which has just been
mentioned) were submitted to redistillation, and they yielded
505 cub. centim. below 210° ('. And in that manner one litre
of kerosene was caused to yield 505 cub. centim. of distillate
below 210° C. When it is directly distilled a litre of kerosene
does not give anything like half its volume of distillate at
temperatures below 210° C.
    Continuing the investigation, the 505 cub. centim. of dis
tillate were redistilled, and they began to distil at 125° C,and
up to 170° O. 270 cub. centim. came over. And in that
manner a litre of kerosene (which when directly distilled
yields only one drop of distillate below 170° C.) may be
caused to evolve 270 cub. centim. of distillate below 170° C.
    All this illustrates how admixture with a high-boiling liquid
 raises the boiling-point of low-boiling liquids.
    We have carried out a most laborious investigation of
 kerosene, and, operating on a considerable scale, after many
months of fractionation have separated 21 different liquids,
which, with probably a few others, and together with about
 13 per cent, of residue boiling at temperatures above 290° C,
make up the complex mixture known as kerosene. As to the
proportions of the different ingredients of the mixture, it is
to be noted that there is no one preponderating ingredient.
There appears to be a very small proportion of the two most
volatile terms of the series, but for the rest the distribution is
not very uneven. We doubt whether the proportion of any
one ingredient exceeds 5 per cent, of the whole kerosene.

    The series of liquids, A to O, presents the following cha
 racters. Each liquid, when distilled separately in the well-
 known fractionation-flask, begins to distil about 10 degrees
 higher than its predecessor begins to distil. Thus the first
 term A begins to distil at 77°"5 ; the second term Az at 87° ;
 the third term Aa at 96° ; the fourth term Ab at 105o,5 ; the
 fifth term B at 116° ; the sixth term Bb at 127° ; the seventh
 term Be at 1<38°, and so on up to the last term 0.
    Except the few highest terms the members of the series
 fulfil the requirement, viz. that half of the liquid shall distil
 without the thermometer rising more than 2 or 6 degrees,
 that three-quarters shall distil within 5 or 6 degrees of the
 starting-point, and that by the time the boiling-point of the
 next in the series is reached 90 per cent, shall have distilled
 over.
     Within the last few weeks the seven lowest terms, viz. A

498             Fractional Distillation of Kerosene.
to Be inclusive, have been prepared anew from fresh kero
sene and fractionated with great perseverance. The first two
terms A and Az have not yet been procured in sufficient
quantity to admit of the very elaborate treatment to which
we should like to subject them, but the five next terms, Aa
to Be inclusive, have been obtained in abundance and have
been exhaustively treated.
   As an example we will quote the record of the final
testings of Aa :—
      Exp. I.—Vol. of Aa employed = 13b' cub. ceutim.
             °C.
        At 9(r2 ...            5 cub. centim. had distilled.

      E.rp. III.—Vol. of Aa, 130 cub. centim.
             °0.
            95-8 ...           5 cub. centim. had distilled.
            96-8 ... 50               '„          „
            98-8 . . .100              „          „
           104      ... dry.
Showing that three-quarters of Aa distils over without a
greater rise than 3 degrees, and that the retort becomes dry
before the boiling-point of Ab is reached.
   Before making the three final distillations Aa had been
deprived of traces of Az (the next lower term) by the
following course of procedure.
   139 cub. centim. of Aa was placed in a retort and 50 cub.
centim. was then distilled off. Next the 50 cub. centim. of
distillate was redistilled thus :—
                  94°'8 C. . .       5 cub. centim.
                  96         . . 1G         „
Then the 16 cub. centim. of distillate was redistilled,
                  94°        . .     5 cub. centim.
and 8 cub. centim. was distilled off and rejected.

   As has been said, five consecutive terms, viz. Aa, Ab, B,
Bb, and Be, have been exhaustively treated, and each one has
been proved to be incapable of being resolved into fractions
with different boiling-points. We believe that the conclusion
cannot be resisted that the kerosene series of hydrocarbons
mounts by increments of 7 instead of by increments of 14,
and we hold that the real atomic weight of carbon is G and
not 12.

UNiPLAifAR Algebra : being Part I. of a Propedeutic to the Higher
   Mathematical Analysis. By Irving Stringham, Ph.D., Professor
   of MatJiematics in the University of California. San Francisco,
   the University Press.
"nTHE logical grounding of Algebra," writes the author in his
        preface, " may be essentially arithmetical or geometrical. I
have chosen the geometrical form of presentation and develop
ment." " The point of departure is Euclid's doctrine of pro
portion, the fundamental propositions of which are enunciated
and proved in an Introduction (pp. 1-20) in which I have followed
the method recommended by the Association for the Improvement
of Geometrical Teaching."
    With Chap. 1. commences the explanation of the " Laws of
Algebraic Operation " as affecting real, or magnitudes involving
only the idea of length ; imaginary, including also the idea of
turning through a right angle, and complex, embodying length and
rotation through any angle. The product is obtained as a fourth
proportional to the unit, or " idemfactor" (Peirce), and the factors
of that product ; the quotient as a fourth proportional to the
unit, the dividend, and the reciprocal of the divisor. Indeter
minate Forms are here introduced, their evaluation being treated of
lower down ; combinations of signs, the Associative, Commutative,
and Distributive Laws are successively treated of and proved.
Logarithms are defined in Napier's manner, treated so as to intro
duce the conceptions of the modulus and base as well as expo
nential, whose Laws—of Involution and the Index—are proved.
The law of the interchange of indices and coefficients in Log
Operations is called by the distinct name " Metathesis." To con
clude the chapter, Indeterminate Exponential forms are touched
on, and a useful synopsis of the matter of the chapter added.
   Chap. II. contains au introduction to the circular hyperbolic
and Gudermannian functions, with proofs of some fundamental
limits.
   Chnp. III. is occupied with " Complex Quantities," represented

  500                Notices renjiecting New Books.
 by vectors, of which real quantities represented by segments of the
  axis and " imaginary " by vectors perpendicular to that line are
  particular cases. Perhaps more unity would have been imparted
 to the terminology by the substitution of " unreal " for " ima
 ginary;" then " real " would have expressed the complex of which
  the component perpendicular to the axis vanishes ; " unreal," that
  the real component of which is zero. The abbreviation cis. 0, to be
  read sector of 0, is adopted for the complex cos fl + tsinO. The
 associative, commutative, and distributive laws are then proved
 for complex magnitudes. All this has, of course, been founded on
 Argand's construction, which, however, is only formally explained
  hereafter.
     In the second section of this Chap. III. the Exponentials and
 Logarithms of complex quantities are dealt with by means of a
 diagram ; the theory as adopted having been the subject-matter of
 a paper by the author read before the New York Mathematical
 Society in October 1891, and subsequently published in vol. xiv. of
 the Am. Jotirn. of Math. Without the diagram, a description of
 this theory would be hardly intelligible. Just as the vanishing of
 an angle causes the complex to degenerate into a real, so in the
 diagram referred to the vanisliing of an arbitrary angle in it
 changes the Exponentials and Logarithms of complex into those of
 ordinary magnitudes. The result of these discussions leads to the
 definition of " an Algebra ; " viz. since the aggregate of all com
 plexes operating howsoever on one another form a " closed group,"
 i. e. evolve only complexes, such a group forms an Algebra.
 Reference is made to Peirce and Cayley.
    The chapter concludes with proofs that every magnitude can be
 expressed, with an error less than any assignable, in terms of an
 assumed unit by a rational number.
    Chap. IV. treats of the Cyclic and Hyperbolic Functions (direct
 and inverse) of complexes, defined with respect to a complex
 modulus (*•), and hence called " modo-eyclic " functions, having a
 period 2ikw or inr, and of the inverses of these.
    Chap. V. explains the one to one correspondence of points on a
 plane and on a sphere, having its centre in the plane, through rays
drawn from one end of the normal diameter, and the transforma
tion of the plauar complex into the tri-dimensional sphero-surface
complex (Cayley, Klein). The rest of this chapter on " Graphical
Transformation " is occupied with some particular cases of " Ortho-
raorphosis " (Cayley). In it occurs the only misprint which has
been noticed, of a symbol Bw for Bw°. The typography is highly
creditable to the San Francisco press — is, in fact, dainty of its
kind.
    In the concluding chapter, " Properties of Polynomials " with
complex coefficients are proved, after a preliminary page on the
evaluation of the »-;ith roots of a complex quantity ; this, as every
other branch of the matter of the book, being illustrated by a
collection of " Agenda " or Examples, on which the student may
exercise himself.

    So much must suffice to give an idea of the object and scope of this
small volume, which, it should be said, presupposes " a familiarity
with the elements of algebra and trigonometry." To students
thus qualified "its subject-matter and treatment constitute a rapid
review of the underlying principles of those subjects, including in
its most general aspects the algebra of complex quantities."

             Elasticity. By Dr. B. Williamson, F.R.S.
               (London: Longmans, 1894; pp. x + 135.)
The full title, viz. ' Introduction to the Mathematical Theory of
the Stress and Strain of Elastic Solids,' indicates that this little
book is an elementary one, and that it does not treat of the more
advanced portions of the general Mathematical theory. These, as
our readers know, are admirably discussed in Mr. Love's fuller
treatise. The subject is of the highest practical importance, and
we are glad to have such au Introduction drawu up by so com
 petent a writer as Dr. Williamson. Our author states at the
 outset that he adopts the notation suggested years ago by the late .
 Professor Townsend : a notation which " has the advantage of
 harmonizing with the generally recognized method of representing
 the equation of a surface of the second degree." The discussion
 is in the main confined to the consideration of perfectly elastic
 solids, so that the results are, of course, only approximately true
 for actual substances.
     The work is divided into five chapters. In Chapter I., Strain is
 treated of under the heads of Homogeneous and Heterogeneous
 Strain, and Strain in Curvilinear Coordinates. Chapter II. is
 devoted to Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Stress. The con
 nexion between Stress and Strain is the subject of Chapter III.,
 and occupies three sections, on Work and Potential Energy, Case

 is considered in Chapter IV., and Elastic Beams in Chapter Vr.
 From this summary it will be seen that a fair amount of interesting
 ground is covered. That the text is clearly put goes without
 saying, but there is no great scope for novelty of treatment. Dr.
  Williamson takes care to give references, where called for, to
 recent memoirs and treatises bearing on the subject. It only
 remains to add that each chapter is closed with a selection of good
  illustrative exercises from College Problem papers, and that there

  On the Definitions of the Trigonometric Functions. By A. Mao
       faelane, D.Sc. (Boston : J. S. CushiDg & Co. ; 49 pp.)
  This is a paper the substance of which was communicated to the
  Mathematical Cougress at Chicago on the 22nd August in last
  year. It is a following up of previous papers by the same author
  on points connected with Space Analysis. Three of these are
  respectively entitled ' Principles of the Algebra of Physics,' in
  which Dr. Macfarlane introduced u certain trigonometric notation

 502                Notices respecting New Books.
 for the partial products of two vectors. This notation has been
 discussed by Mr. Heaviside in the ' Electrician ' (December 9th,
 1892), by Prof. Alfred Lodge in ' Nature' (November 3rd, 1892)
and elsewhere. The present paper is in part a rejoinder to the
statements of these gentlemen. Then followed a paper on 'The
Imaginary of Algebra,' and ' The Fundamental Theorems of
Analysis Generalized for Space.'
   The author here proposes " to review critically the historical
definitions of the trigonometric terras, and the definitions, tri
angular, circular, or hyperbolic, given in the best modern treatises
 at my command ; then to devise a logical system of definitions
which will apply to space-analysis and that modern trigonometry,
which, as Prof. Greenhill shows (Diff. and Int. Calc. p. 61),
includes the properties both of circular and hyperbolic functions,
and will be able to bring within the same domain the properties
of the elliptic, general hyperbolic, and other functions."
   This wide extent is not gone over here, but attention is mainly
given to Plane Trigonometry : Trigonometry in space is bandied in
a further pamphlet entitled ' The Principles of Elliptic and
Hyperbolic Analysis.'
   Dr. Maefarlane discusses in detail the treatment adopted by
De Morgan and more recently by Dr. Hobson, Messrs. Levett and
Davison, and Mr. Hayward (iu his ' Vector Algebra and Trigono
metry '). M. Laisant's Essai sur Its fonct'wns huperboliques is noted
with warm approval, and then Dr. Maefarlane proceeds to show how
the " several species of trigonometric functions—the triangular,
the circular, and the ex-circular " (using Mr. Hayward's nomen
clature) " may be defined in harmony with one another. The
method adopted is afterwards shown to be applicable to the
logarithmic spiral, ellipse, and general hyperbola, and to a mixed
curve composed partly of a circle, partly of an ex-circle." In the
pamphlet which follows the one before us the method is said to
be applied to ellipsoidal and hyperboloidal trigonometry.

Gentlemen,
      Will you kindly allow me to offer a word of explanation re
specting the notice of Wiedemann and Ebert's ' Practical Physics,'
which appeared in the March number of the Philosophical Maga
zine (p. 334). In writing the notice I had occasion to refer to the
treatise by Prof. F. Kohlrausch as seeming " somewhat antiquated
in a modern laboratory." It should be stated, in justice to Prof.
Kohlrausch, that this remark was intended to be applied only to
the earlier editions of his work ; in a recently published German
edition the text has been revised and many new experiments have
been added. A similar revision of the English translation is greatly
to be desired.

            ON THE THERMAL BEHAVIOUR OF LIQUIDS.
             To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine.
   Gestlemex,
TN answer to the letters of Drs. B. Galitzine and P. de Heen in
    the April number of this Journal, we beg to make the following
remarks :—
   It is quite true, as stated by Dr. Galitzine, that our criticism
of the arrangements employed to obtain constant high tempe
ratures does not apply to him (provided that the naphthaline
employed by him as a jacketing vapour was pure). This, however,
we pointed out in our paper, at the same time calling attention to
the fact that the method was, with certain modifications, that
employed and recommended for many years by ourselves. We
think, however, that Dr. Galitzine's results are open to criticism
on the following grounds :—(1) The complete elimination of alcohol
from ether is not an easy matter, and cannot be effected by the
action of metallic sodium ; but no other method of purification is
mentioned in his paper. The last trace of alcohol may be removed
by shaking the ether twenty or thirty times with small quantities of
water, or by repeated distillation over phosphorus pentoxide; but we
do not know of any other method. (2) Although we fully appre
ciate the great pains taken by Dr. Galitzine to purify his ether from
air, yet we doubt whether any method involving the sealing of a
glass tube is capable of giving perfectly satisfactory results. In the
Trans. Chem. Soc. for 1891, p. 37, a new method of determining
the specific volumes of liquids and of their saturated vapours was
described by one of us ; and experience has shown that the chief
difficulty in this method is the necessity of sealing the tube con
taining the liquid. The vapour of the liquid may undergo slight
decomposition owing to the high temperature, or a trace of air
may be expelled from the glass. It has been frequently observed
in the experiments carried out by this method that when a minute
quantity of air or permanent gas is present, the attainment of the
final state of equilibrium is greatly retarded. It has also been
observed that the retardation increases with the amount of perma
nent gas present, and that if there is a comparatively large amount
(though actually a very small one), the results are rendered entirely
untrustworthy.
   The influence of the permanent gas has also been found to
increase rapidly as the critical point is approached, though it may
be very marked at much lower temperatures. This question has
been shortly discussed by one of us (Trans. Chem. Soc. 1891,
p. 1 28), and very fully by Dr. J. P. K uenen ( Verslagen dtr Afdfeling
A'aturkunde der Kon. Alcademie, Leiden, April 1892, p. 422 ; June
1892, p. 15 ; Oct. 1893, p. 85) ; and we fully agree with Dr. Kuenen
in the great importance he attaches to retardation.

   Dr. de Heen requests us to point out the errors of reasoning or
experimentation that he has made in the demonstration of his
fundamental proposition, and asks for an explanation why we
characterize his paper as " very inaccurate."
   Our criticism, which refers to the experimental work on which
the reasoning is based, was caused by the very wide discrepancies
between the critical temperatures observed by Dr. de Heen and by
other experimenters. As examples we may cite the following:—

   With such differences in the most easily determined critical
constant it seemed to us to be useless to discuss the much more
difficult observations on volumes.
   We are still of opinion that the interpretation of M. Gouy may
be admitted, and we think, with Dr. Kuenen, that the reason why
a stable equipoise in a vertical tube is not immediately produced is
due to the presence of impurity, in most cases of air or other
permanent gas.

SUPPLEMENTARY REMARKS ON CHANGES OF TEMPERATURE
   CAUSED BY CONTACT OF LIQUIDS WITH SILICA 1". BY DR. G.
   GORE, F.R.S.
   In addition to the remarks already made on the results of the
experiments in the above research, 1 beg leave to offer a further
explanation of the phenomena, and to say that all such changes of
temperature caused by the mere contact of liquids with solids are,
in my opinion, consistent with the statement that whenever two
substances approach or touch each other, they lose energy ; and when
they mutually recede, the opposite effect occurs.
   That this statement appears to be true of all bodies, whether
they are similar or dissimilar, of atoms, molecules, and masses, is
shown in many ways, only a few of which need be mentioned. It
is shown as loss of potential mechanical energy by falling bodies,
          * The letters A and B refer to two different specimens,
          t See Philosophical Magazine, Marcti 1894, pp. 306-316.

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.           505
usually as loss of heat when substances of any kind are compressed,
when liquids "adhere" to solids (as in the above experiments),
and when substances chemically " combine ; " it is also shown,
though in a less simple form, when bodies approach each other by
electric and magnetic " attraction." Conversely, when a gas is
rarefied by mechanical means, it gains heat by absorption ; simi
larly, when a film of air adhering to a solid is displaced by a liquid,
and when the molecules of a solid or a liquid are separated farther
asunder by a solution in a liquid without chemical union, or by
dilution of irs solution, heat is usually absorbed.
    Although in every one of the 98 experiments of the above
research heat was evolved and lost, in about half of the 58 trials
with silica the dissolved substance appeared to absorb heat by
contact with the powder. These apparent exceptions were prob
ably due to the amount of heat absorbed by the receding film of
air being greater than that evolved by the approach and contact of
the dissolved substances, and thus those cases were made to appear
inconsistent with the above general statement. Similarly, instances
of electric and magnetic " repulsion " are probably only apparent
exceptions to that statement, the real phenomena being obscured
by the attendant circumstances.
    As in all these various cases, whether of " adhesion " of films of
 air, water, or dissolved substance to solids, of chemical union, or
 of electric and magnetic attraction, the only factors of the mecha
 nical energy of the molecules are mass and velocity, and as in every
 instance the mass of neither of the acting substances is perceptibly
 altered, the loss of mechanical energy of bodies by mutual approach
 and contact, and the gain by mutual recession, must consist
 entirely of velocity. It is well known that a solid when dissolved
 in a liquid behaves like a gas, and as the molecules of a gas " move
 faster the better the exhaustion " (Crookes, Phil. Traus. Boy. Soc.
 1879, p. 160), so do those of a liquid by being separated by dilu
 tion ; this increase of molecular velocity by dilution is also shown
 by an increase of electromotive force (see Proc. Birm. Phil. Soc.
 vol. viii. pp. 63-138).
    As these supplementary remarks appear to afford a much wider
 and more complete theoretical explanation of the phenomena
 observed with silica &c. than that offered in the original communi
 cation, I venture to submit them for consideration.
    POLARIZATION OF NON-DIFFRAOTED INFRA-RED RADIATION
       BY WIRE GRATINGS. BY H. DU BOIS AND H. RUBENS.
     The results of this investigation, a preliminary account of which
 was given at the Edinburgh B. A. Meeting ( 1892), may be sum
  marized as follows :—
     Gratings were finally made of metal wire down to a diameter of
  2-5 mem. (" raillicentimetre "=0-001 cm.), the interspaces between
     Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 37. No. 228. May 1894.            2 M

  506          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
  the wires being equal to their diameter ; by inclining the grating
  relatively to the wave-front, the apparent clear spaces available for
 the passage of radiation could be reduced to 1 meui. The wave
  lengths investigated ranged from about | of the above unit down
 to that of red light. The method employed was a somewhat
 elaborate spectrobolometric one ; it was exclusively applied to the
 non-diffracted part of the incident radiation, corresponding to the
 so-called " central image."
     It was found that all wire gratings polarize perpendicularly to
 the direction of the wire so long as the wave-length is very small ;
 for larger wave-lengths the action is, however, reversed. The
 intermediate value of the wave-length, at which the grating does
 not polarize, i. e. the " neutral point," is independent of the geo
 metrical constants of the grating, but characteristic for the metals
 constituting its wires. Its value increases in the order Pt, Ag,
 Au, Fe, Cu. The wire gratings behave like polarizers in every
 respect. Malus' law, properly modified, was found to hold for the
 polarizing action in different azimuths. The polarizing action in
 creases as the apparent clear space diminishes : the ratio of the
 intensities of the two perpendicular components of radiation,
 which measures that action, could be pushed up to over 2. The
 results were checked by a simpler method of a more qualitative
 character, which may prove useful for a repetition or demonstration
 of the experiments.
    The authors then give a general discussion of the phenomenon,
 its possible relations to other phenomena, the influence of diffrac
 tion, and, lastly, the possible explanation by it of the properties of
 aeolotropic dielectrics. This particular part of the paper presents
 certain analogies with Lord Eayleigh's theoretical discussion of
 " the influence of obstacles arranged in rectangular order upon the
 properties of a medium " (Phil. Mag. Dec. 1892).
    However, the principal interest attaches to the experiments
described, when viewed in the light of the electric theory of radia
tion and of Hertz's discoveries : the diminutive polarizing gratings
in the present case being quite analogous to the large electro
magnetic wave-polarizers first introduced by that great investi
gator.
    Since there can hardly remain a doubt that in the electromagnetic
theory, the electric vector must be considered perpendicular to the
plane of polarization, the magnetic vector parallel to it (Trouton,
 Klemencic, Eighi), the action of polarizing gratings in general
may now be described as follows :—
    As long as the wave-length keeps below a certain value charac
teristic of the metal, the grating allows the greater fraction of
incident radiation to pass in case the electric vector be parallel to
the wires ; whereas for longer waves the transparency is greater
if the magnetic vector have that direction. For further particulars
the original may be referred to.—Wiedemann's Annalen, xlix. p. 593
(1893).

    MAGNETIZATION OF HOLLOW AND SOLID CYLINDRICAL CORES. •
                             BY H. DU BOIS.
     The vexed question of hollow v. solid cores is once more dis
  cussed in this note. Von Feilitzsch's well-known result that the
  magnetic moment of short hollow cores is hardly inferior to that
  of solid ones (other circumstances equal and saturation not being
 approached) has been elegantly explained by Prof. Silv. Thompson
  in a general qualitative way by the simple remark that the external
 air-resistance is approximately the same in both cases. There is
 no need whatever, therefore, for the assumption that the central
 fibres of cores are less easily " reached " by temporary steady
 magnetization than those near the skin : such a state of things
  would only be proved if the same result were obtained with hollow
 endless rings, which is improbable.
     Von Feilitzsch's experiments having been lately repeated and
 extended by Prof. Grotrian (Wied. Ann. 1. p. 705, 1893), the
 author seized the occasion for attempting to go into the matter
 somewhat more fully. The particular case of a cylinder being one of
 those in which the modern " magnetic circuit " notion does not
  lead up to quantitative results so well as the more orthodox theory
 of induction, the latter had to be applied, and immediately yielded
 the following general ride : —
     If for cylindric or prismatic bodies of given length and any
 shape of section the " demagnetizing factor " be proportional to
 the latter and not too small, then the magnetic moment will be
 practically independent of the section for fields which are not so
 strong as to produce an approach towards saturation.
     It is further shown that both premisses of this rule apply to
 thin hollow cores, for which it is thereby easy to draw the curves
 of magnetic moment and impressed field up to thorough satura
 tion for any given dimensions. An illustrative diagram of such
 curves is given, which presents exactly the same aspect as the
 experimental diagram of Prof. Grotrian's paper. Finally, the
 question of hollow cores for dynamos is touched upon. Signor
 Ascoli has since independently criticised Prof. Grotrian's results
 much on the same lines. — Wiedemann's Annalen, li. p. 529

        ON A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IN ELECTRO-OPTICS.
              To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine.
Gentlemen,
       In the April number of the Philosophical Magazine Dr. Ken-
has published a paper, " Experiments on a Fundamental Question
in Electro-Optics." Dr. Kerr finds the velocity of light changed
by electric stress in electrostatically strained liquids only for light
polarized perpendicular to the lines of force.
    My paper on the same subject is not mentioned in which, eleven
years ago, I treated this question with the identical methods
employed by Dr. Kerr. (Of. G. Quincke, " Electrische Unter-
suchungen, IX. Ueber die Aenderung der Breehungsexponenten
von Flussigkeiten durch electrische Rrafte," Wiedemann's Annalen.
xix. pp. 773-782, 1883.) A proof of this paper I sent immediately
after its publication to Dr. Kerr, who first observed the double
refraction of l'ght by electric stress.
    But the results of my experiments were different from those of
 Dr. Kerr. I observed sometimes an increase, sometimes a dimi
nution, of the velocity of light whose plane of polarization is
parallel to the lines of force. I supposed that the reason of this
 ambiguous change were two forces of opposite character, i. e. the
 heating of the liquid by vortex motion and the electric pressure,
 both excited at the same time by the electric forces.

                To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine.
       Gentlemen,
    With reference to the remarks made by Professor Lodge in the
 Philosophical Magazine for April, page 419, I only need to notice
 the chief point and to say :—It appears to me that the proposition
 that the amounts of mechanical energy of the molecules of different
 gases are equal, is of so fundamental a character that it ought, for
 the advancement of science, not to be limited to algebraic expres
 sions readable only by mathematicians, but it should, in addition,
 be explicitly expressed in simple words (as Avogadro's Law usually
 is) in every text-book of physics and monograph on gases, for the
 benefit of all persons.
                                  I beg to remain, Gentlemen,
                                                      Yours truly,
    Birmingham, April 6, 1894.                            George Gore.
     P.S. Had the " statement " I asked for in my previous letter
 (not an algebraic expression) existed in any of the text-books of
 science I should almost certainly have seen it, and that letter
 would not have been necessary.

                 LII. On Interference Phenomena.
                  By Arthur Schuster, F.R.S.*
1. /"I OUY t and Rayleigh J have recently j discussed
    VJ the question of interference phenomena observed
with a source of white light, and have arrived at important
results. "When the two interfering beams pass through the
slit of a spectroscope, the spectrum is seen to be crossed
alternately by bright and dark bands, and if high resolving
powers are used, these interference effects may be observed,
although the difference of path of the two original beams is
considerable. This well-known fact has always been taken to
prove that the vibrations of the white light are to a certain
extent " regular," and efforts have been made to find by
experiment the limits of that regularity. The futility of
these efforts has been completely demonstrated by Grouy and
 Rayleigh, who have proved that the bright and dark bands
 alluded to would appear with sufficient resolving power,
 even if light consisted of perfectly irregularly distributed
 instantaneous impulses.       These investigations would seem,
 therefore, to lead to the conclusion that a source of light
 is completely defined by the distribution of energy in the

 510                  Prof. Arthur Schuster on
 spectrum, and that there is no room for any such property
 as " regularity " independently from that implied in the
 connexion between energy and wave-length. A spectrum
 which possesses the same energy for all wave-lengths would
 prove complete irregularity of the source, while one in which
 the energy vanishes except for one definite wave-length would
 be due to a completely regular source. I confess that on first
 reading through the investigations which I have quoted, some
 difficulties presented themselves which it seemed necessary
 to clear up before these conclusions could be accepted in their
 full generality. There could be no doubt that Gouy's and Ray-
 leigh's results were correct in the case specially examined by
 them, in which the analysing spectroscope has a resolving power
 which is gradually increased ; but if we go to the other limit
 and gradually diminish the resolving power, would it neces
 sarily follow that all sources of white light behave in the same
way, and that the bright and dark bands would in every
case disappear at the same time, the difference of path being
kept constant ? A test case (7) occurred to me, which seemed
to leave a loophole through which we might still save some
of our inherited notions about " regularity " of vibration.
Although further investigation proved that the difficulties
were only imaginary, and that we must accept the new views
without restriction, I think that the importance of the subject
deserves a more detailed treatment than has yet been given
to it.
    In order to put the question at issue as clearly as possible,
it is necessary shortly to allude to the history of the subject.
   2. The fact that rays of light emanating from two different
sources do not produce so-called interference phenomena is
fundamental, and was always recognized as such. It natu
rally suggested the idea that the vibrations of luminous
particles are frequently disturbed, and this, again, led to the
further conclusion that interference between rays emanating
from the same source should cease if the difference in path
were sufficiently increased. Fresnel looked on each particle
of matter as vibrating during a certain time according to the
simple pendulum law, and considered the group of waves sent
out by the particle. If the group is divided into two, one
being retarded as compared with the other, " interference "
will take place. If the difference in path is equal or greater
than the length of the group, Fresnel argued that interference
should cease. " But," he adds, "another cause much sooner
prevents our observing the mutual interference of two systems
of waves, when the* difference of path is somewhat great : it
is the impossibility of rendering light sufficiently homo-

                     Interference Phenomena.                     511
geneous." Here follows the well-known argument as to the
effects of want of homogeneousness in the interfering rays.
   Foucault and Fizeau * more definitely put it as a question
for experimental determination, whether interference pheno
mena are ultimately stopped by want of homogeneousness or
want of " regularity." Experimenting with white light, they
came to the conclusion that their experiments " reveal in the
emission of successive waves a persistent regularity which no
phenomenon has hitherto suggested."
   The opinion put forward by Fizeau and Foucault that
observations on interference of light with large difference of
path could teach us something as to the " regularity " of the
vibrations of a particle was generally accepted, until more
closely examined by Gouy and Rayleigh in the papers already
alluded to. Their conclusions did not, however, receive the
attention they deserve. Thus, in the last part of the Encyclo
paedia der Naturwissenschaften, it is stated that " if natural
light really consists in a succession of different states of
vibration, these take place so slowly, that in a time which is
greater than 50,000 period, light must still be considered as
essentially of the same type of vibration/'
   3. Compare with this the following passage taken out of
Gouy's paper :—
   " Ainsi l'existence de franges d'interferences a grande dif
ference de marche, dans le cas des sources de spectres continus
et de la lumiere blanche n'implique nullement la regularite
du mouvement lumineux incident. Cette regularite existe
dans le spectre, mais c'est l'appareil spectral qui la produit,
en separant plus ou moins completement les divers mouve-
ments simples, qui jusque la n'avaient qu'une existence
purement analytique."
   Lord Rayleigh, in his article on the " Wave Theory," ex
presses the same idea as follows:—
   " Or, following Foucault and Fizeau, we may allow the
white light to pass, and subsequently analyse the mixture
transmitted by a narrow slit in the screen upon which the
interference bands are thrown. In the latter case we observe
a channelled spectrum, with maxima of brightness correspond
ing to the wave-lengths Jw/(wD). In either case the number
of bands observable is limited solely by the resolving power
of the spectroscope, and proves nothing with respect to the
regularity or otherwise of the vibrations of the original
light."
   Put shortly, the argument in favour of the above view is
this :—Any disturbance, however irregular, may by Fourier's
     * Acadimie des Sciences, 24th Nov. 1845 and 9th March 1846.
                                2 N 2

 512                      Prof. Arthur Schuster on
 theorem be resolved into a series of disturbances each of
  which corresponds to homogeneous light. It is the object of
  a spectroscope to separate laterally these homogeneous vibra
  tions, and no matter what the nature of the original light, the
  greater the resolving power of the spectroscope, the more
  nearly will it give us homogeneous light.
     4. The argument is at once seen to be conclusive in one
  direction. However irregular the original light, interference
  bands with large difference of path may always be produced,
  if a spectroscope of sufficiently high resolving power is used.
  But there is another side to the question. In order that
  Fourier's series should correctly represent a given disturb
  ance, there must be a definite phase relation between the
  different terms of the series. If a spectroscope of small
  resolving power is used, and if it is required to calculate the
  disturbance at the focus, we are not allowed to consider the
  different components of Fourier's series as independent, but
  must take account of this relation of phase. An example
  will show that in special cases altogether incorrect results
  will be obtained if this is neglected. Thus, let the light
 falling on the slit of a spectroscope be screened off until a
 given time, when the screen is removed but replaced subse
 quently after a short interval. The disturbance may by
 Fourier's series be decomposed into a series of simple *
 vibrations lasting through an infinity of time ; and if each
 component could be treated independently of another, it
 would follow that au eye examining the spectrum would
 continue to see light for any length of time after the incident
 beam has been cut off. This of course is absurd. The
 analysis by Fourier's series leads to results which are per
 fectly correct, if, when finite resolving powers are used, we
 take account of the phase relations between the component
 vibrations.
     It seems therefore advisable to consider the effects of
 finite resolving powers a little more in detail, although it will
 appear that even then the effects produced can give us no
    * Is it too late to abolish the term " harmonic " vibration to express the
projection of a uniform circular motion? The term " harmonic" seems
to me to imply a relation between two things, and is very useful when we
want to distinguish between, say, harmonic and inharmonic overtones.
It is quite correct to speak of the expansion in a Fourier's series as an
harmonic expansion, because the different terms are harmonically related,
but each of them taken separately is not harmonic. Much confusion
has been caused by a series of lines in a spectrum being called harmonics,
because their distribution suggested some definite connexion between their
periods, independontly of the question whether that connexion was of
the harmonic character. The term " simple " vibration seems to me to
be well adapted to express a sine vibration.

information concerning "regularity" of vibration. But in
the first place we must ask ourselves whether we can attach
any meaning to the expression " regularity " of vibration
when applied to white light.
   5. To quote Lord Eayleigh once more:—" It would be in
structive if some one of the contrary opinion would explain
what he means by regular white light. The phrase certainly
appears to me to be without meaning—what Clifford would
have called nonsense"*.
   I believe that those who speak of the regularity of vibration
in a continuous spectrum have in their mind the state of
motion of the original vibrating system, and not that of the
medium through which the light is transmitted. If we
imagine the light to be produced by a number of different
vibrating systems, each sending out homogeneous vibrations,
prismatic decomposition would give what we should call a
line spectrum. We may imagine the lines of the spectrum
to be so close together that any resolving power which we
can apply fails to separate them.
   There is nothing to prevent our imagining for the sake of
argument that all continuous spectra if examined by resolving
powers, say a million times larger than we can apply at
present, would ultimately appear to be line spectra, each line
representing perfectly homogeneous light ; and if each line
is due to a separate vibrating system, we may reasonably say
that that system remains perfectly regular for an indefinite
time. Let us then imagine a practically continuous spectrum
of this nature in which, for the sake of simplicity, there is no
difference in intensity, all wave-lengths being equally repre
sented. The spectrum might be made completely continuous
by imagining each vibrating system to be split up into
several, moving with uniform velocities in different directions,
and that velocity may be made indefinitely small, as the
difference in wave-length between the vibrating systems is
indefinitely reduced. But for my purpose it will be sufficient
to take the spectrum as ultimately discontinuous, and I shall
take such a system of vibrations as the representative of what
may be called " regular " white light. On the other hand,
imagine a set of molecules setting up a luminous disturbance
by perfectly irregular and indefinitely short impulses. When
examined by a spectroscope we should see a continuous
spectrum ranging over all wave-lengths with equal inten
sities ; of such we may imagine " irregular " white light
to consist.
   The question I shall discuss in detail is this :—Can we by
               * Phil. Mag. xxvii. p. 463, note (1889).

514                  Prof. Arthur Schuster on
any interference experiments distinguish between the light
sent out on the one hand by a regularly vibrating system of
molecules, and on the other hand by irregular short impulses?
    6. One of the fundamental facts of our subject is the im
possibility of two different sources producing interference
phenomena. This fact is generally taken as a proof that
molecules must suffer frequent disturbances. But two bodies
sending out what we have called regular white light would
have the same property. For imagine each of the two
sources to send out a series of waves of lengths Xj, Xg, &c,
differing by quantities which are so small that no instrumental
power at our command can resolve them. The illumination
at any point of a screen will depend on the manner in which
the trains of waves coming from the two sources will combine.
The difference of phase between the two sets of waves of length
Xt depends not only on the relative distance of the sources
from the screen, but also on the difference of phase at the
 two sources. As there is no connexion between that difference
of phase for the different wave-lengths, the wave-lengths in
 close proximity to Xj will partly destroy each other, partly
have fourfold or any intermediate intensity, the result being
the same at all points of the screen as if no interference had
taken place. This loads to an important result. Imagine
a body, the molecules of which vibrate in a perfectly definite
 period, but have a translatory motion such as we imagine the
molecules of a gas to possess. Such a body would give a
spectrum of one line, which, however, would have a certain
 width owing to the motion of the molecules. The want of
homogeneousness produced by this translatory motion would
be quite sufficient to prevent the possibility of interference
between two similar sources, and we need not take refuge in
 the impacts between molecules to explain the non-existence
of interference.

two screens in their focal plane having small apertures at the

will not remain an instantaneous

impulse at F, but the light reflected from each line of the
grating will reach F at certain intervals of time, and a
disturbance will be set up at F which will last during a finite
time. The time it takes for an impulse at G to pass com
pletely through F will be that required by light to go over a
space equal to the difference in optical length of the extreme
rays GBF and GAF. The fact that in every dispersive
system an instantaneous impulse entering the system is
changed into a disturbance lasting through a finite time is
of fundamental importance. It is easily seen that this is
brought about in the case of a grating, but the fact is equally
true if the dispersion is due to refraction, as will be pointed
out further on.
   Imagine that in fig. 1 two impulses of the same type
succeed each other. If the second impulse begins to reach
F before the effects of the first impulse have passed away
interference may occur, but if the disturbance due to the first
impulse has completely passed through F before the second
impulse reaches it, no interference can take place, and this
will happen whenever the distance between the impulses
before they reach G is greater than the difference in the
optical length between the extreme rays GAF and GBF. It
is thus seen that if light were to consist of separate instanta
neous impulses, interference at the focus of a grating-spectro
scope of finite resolving powers could only take place if the
retardation were smaller than a certain amount ; if the retar
dation were greater, no interference could possibly occur.
   Now consider the light to bo what we have called regular,
that is to say, to consist of the superposition of a large num
ber of homogeneous vibrations. If the beam of light is split
into two, one being retarded with reference to the other, the
spectrum formed in the focal plane of L2 will be crossed by
bright and dark bands ; if the retardation is gradually in
creased these bands will gradually get nearer and nearer
together, and at the same time become less distinct as their
distance approaches the limits which are still resolvable by
the grating. Looking at it in this general manner, there
seems to be no reason why there should be a definite limit
when interference ceases, but it would seem as if there ought
to be always a fluctuating intensity along the spectrum,
although the difference in intensity between the bright and
dark bands would with increasing retardation of the inter
fering beams become so small, that they could no longer be
traced. This is the test case previously alluded to, by means
of which I originally thought we might distinguish Between
 " regular " and irregular white light. It was found, however,
that on actually calculating the difference in intensity between

516                Prof. Arthur Schuster on
the maxima and minima of light produced by interference in
what we have called regular white light, it is found that, just
as in the case of the single impulses, there is a definite limit
of retardation, depending on the resolving power of the
spectroscope, and if the retardation is increased beyond that
limit, the spectrum is perfectly uniform. We shall arrive,
therefore, at the conclusion that, both for small and for large
resolving powers, any hypothesis we make as to the original
production of luminous vibration will lead to the same con
clusion. There is no distinction between regular and irregu
lar light beyond that which is brought out by the distribution
of intensity in the spectrum. If the intensity vanishes except
for a definite wave-length, we must call the vibration com
pletely regular ; if the intensity is the same for all vibrations,
it will appear that wo must call it completely irregular.
   We are prepared now to deduce a formula which will allow
us to calculate the disturbance at F (fig. 1), given the dis
turbance at G.
   8. It is convenient to introduce what may be called a
" simple grating." An imaginary grating of this kind has
                               Fig. 2.

already been made use of by Lord Rayleigh in his article
in the Encyclopedia Britannica*.          A simple grating has
properties such that a disturbance of unit amplitude is reflected
as a disturbance of amplitude cos q s, where q is a constant
and * is measured along the grating at right angles to its
" lines." In whatever manner the lines of an actual grating
are ruled, we may always express the amplitude of the reflected
ray as a function of s and obtain that function by means of
Fourier's theorem as a sum of terms, one being constant and
the others simply periodic ; so that every grating may be
treated as a superposition of a number of simple gratings and
an ordinary reflecting surface.

                     Interference Phenomena.                 517
    In fig. 2 let a plane-wave front LM advance towards a
grating AB having its centre at C, and let the disturbance at
some point of the Tine PC be given as /(at), t being the time
and a the velocity of light. By a proper choice of the origin
of time we may express the disturbance at any other point
by the same function. If we imagine a telescope pointed in
the direction OC, the disturbance at the focus of the object-
glass will depend on the disturbance at some previous time
over the different points on the line HK at right angles to
CO, account being taken only of that part of the disturbance
which reaches a point F on HK in a direction DF parallel to
CO. Let F' be a point on CD such that DF' = DF, and
assume that the disturbance at any time which reaches F
from D is the same as that which would have reached F' if
the grating had been absent, the amount only being reduced
in the ratio cos qs to unity. The excess of optical length
GDF over PCO is s(sin/8— sin a), where a and /9 are the
angles formed by the normal to the grating with CP and CO
respectively. Hence if s is measured from C and /(at) is the
disturbance at 0, the disturbance at F will be
                   cos qsf{at — «(sin/9— sin a)}.
The amplitude at the focus of the telescope will be propor
tional to the above expression integrated over the effective
aperture. If h be the length of the lines ruled on the gra
ting, 21 its width, the integral will become, writing y for
sin ft— sin*,
                   A cos /8 1 cos qs /[at ~ ys) ds             (1)
It is of course immaterial whether the beam is limited by the
grating, or whether we have an infinite grating, and limit
   ie beam by covering the object-glass by a diaphragm of
length h and breadth 2 / cos /3.
    A more rigorous analysis which is given further on (22)
will show that the expression which has been deduced when
multiplied by a constant factor correctly represents the
amplitude of the disturbance at the focus of the telescope, if
the origin of time is properly chosen, and if /{at) expresses
 the velocity of displacement in the incident beam. The
factor by which (1) must be multiplied in order to give
correct numerical values is l/27raF, where a is the velocity of
light and F the focal length of the telescope.
     We get a clear idea of the meaning of the integral (1) by
 its geometrical interpretation. The distance between suc
 cessive lines of the grating is 2v/q, and if there are 2N lines
 on the grating it follows that ql = 2irl$ ; writing \=2iry/q and

518                  Prof. Arthur Schuster on
changing the variable to ys=x, the integral (1) becomes
                       -J      cos27r.r/X./(a/— x)dx. ...         (2)
    For a given position of collimator and telescope, it is known
that a homogeneous ray of a certain wave-length will have
its principal maximum of the first-order spectrum at the focus
of the telescope, and it is easily seen that the wave-length in
question is given by the same relation by means of which we
have defined X. Also if yx=f(at) is the disturbance at any
 point of the incident beam, y=f{at— x) will be the disturbance

at a distance x, the wave travelling in the positive direction.
 If, therefore, in fig. 3 the thick line represents the shape of a
 wave travelling from left to right, and the thin line is the
 cosine curve wj = cos 2trxfK, having as many periods as there
are lines on the grating, the disturbance at the focus of the
telescope is proportional to J«/i y2 dx.
    The disturbance at all times is obtained by letting the wave
travel forward, the cosine curve remaining in the same
position.
    9. We shall use equation (1) as the basis of our calculations.
It is required to find the disturbance at F (fig. 1) for any
given position of the telescope. We may define the position
either by the quantity \ or by q = 27ry/'\ ; when convenient we
shall introduce the number of lines on the grating 2N = §Z/tt.
    As a first example, let /(a<) =p cos j)t, that is to say, let the
incident beam be homogeneous, the maximum displacement
being unity. Leaving out constant factors, the integral to be
determined is
                    "+«
                   r   p cos qs cos(pt—Ks)ds,
where * is written shortly for py/a.
    Bemembering that ql is a multiple of 27r, the integral is
easily seen to become
                       a    g sin k\ cospt                        (3)

                    Interference Phenomena.                 519
It follows that, whatever the direction of the telescope, the
disturbance passing through its focus is of the same period as
that of the incident light, that is to say, whatever the period
icity of the grating it nas no power of altering the periodicity
of the disturbance. The amplitude of the disturbance is
-J*-* sin kI. The manner in which this varies according to
q9 — ir
the direction of the telescope is shown by expressing I in
terms of N, when it is seen that we may write for the ampli

                   K±q        2ttN («+</)/</
   The second factor is of the form (sin a)/a, which reaches
its maximum value when a = 0. The successive maxima are
very close together if N is large, so that the whole light is
near the points for which k= ±q. The direction of the optic
axis in that case is given by + <7a=py. The wave-length of
the original light being ft=2ira/p and the distance between
the lines d=2ir/q = 2Tr/ic, the relation becomes
                   fi,=dy= +d(sin a — sin/3),
which is the well-known condition that a wave-length fi shall
have a first-order maximum in the direction defined by /9.
 The other maxima of (sin a) /a which our equation gives are
those commonly ascribed to diffraction from the edge of the
 aperture of the telescope.
    The principal maximum has an amplitude which, restoring
the constant factors, is plh cos /3/2iraF, or, introducing the
 wave-length p of the incident light, the amplitude becomes
 A/cos/3/F/*. The numerator of this fraction is half the
effective aperture of the grating, and the intensity of the
 spectrum is therefore one quarter of what it would be if the
 grating were replaced by a reflecting surface, and the colli
 mator moved until the direct image coincided with the focus
 of the telescope. A surface which acts like a grating must
 also, as pointed out by Rayleigh, act as an absorbing surface,
 so that the sum of the intensities in the diffracted spectra
 will be smaller than that of the original light.
    10. Ordinary gratings are generally taken to contain
 parts which are alternately completely reflecting or trans
 parent and opaque. Calling d the distance from the centre
 of one line to the centre of the next, and taking the origin at
 the centre of one of the lines, we may express the reflecting
 properties of the grating (confining ourselves to reflecting
 gratings) as a periodic function of x, say f(x), which may
 be expressed in a series of the form

        Let the reflecting part cover a portion 2o of the grating, and
       the opaque part a portion 2c. The function to be expanded
       has a value one from x = 0 to x = a; the value will vanish
       between x=a and x—a + 2c, and regain the unit value from
       x = d—a to .r = d.

          The first term represents that part of the grating which
       acts simply as a reflecting surface. In order that the first-
       order spectrum should be as bright as possible sin ay =1, or
       d=ia, in which case the spectra of even orders would all
       disappear. The factor 2/7r, taken in conjunction with what
       we have previously proved, shows that a grating constructed
       in the manner indicated gives a firstrorder spectrum whose
       intensity cannot exceed A/7T4, where A is the intensity of the
       reflected image, if there are no lines on the grating. The
       strongest second-order spectrum has an intensity A/4tt*.
          The direct image could be much diminished, and therefore
       the spectra increased in intensity, if a grating could be made
       on a glass surface—say the largest surface of a right-angled
       prism,—periodicity being introduced by silvering the glass
       along parallel lines. If light were then allowed to fall in
       ternally on the silvered surface, the reflexions taking place
       between glass air and glass silver respectively would have
       nearly opposite phases, which is the condition required for the
       diminution of intensity of the direct image.
          It appears, then, that although we have introduced an
       imaginary grating called a simple grating, the effects are
       exactly the same as those of a real grating, the latter con
       sisting of a superposition of simple gratings, as has already
       been pointed out.
          11. We return now to our more immediate object, and take
       as a second example of a disturbance analysed by a grating
       that of a single impulsive velocity v reaching the point 0

                      Interference Phenomena.                   521
 (fig. 2) at a time tx, and lasting during an interval of time r,
 the 'displacement produced by the velocity being c = vt.
    The value of /(at— ys) will vanish in this case unless
 at—ys = at1, which condition determines some point along s
 at which the disturbance is sensible, provided that t lies
  between tx—ylja and t^ + yl/a. The integral (1) therefore
  becomes

  -^- cos [?a«-,)/7] = -^- cos [«rHa(«- W].
    The equation applies while < lies between the stated limits ;
 for smaller or greater values of t the disturbance vanishes.
 Taking account of the omitted factor, the disturbance is seen
                                                 lie cos Q
  to begin with an impulsive displacement, -——^, followed
 by a simple vibration continuing for as many periods as there
 are lines on the grating, ending with a permanent displace
 ment c. While the disturbance lasts it is of the same nature
 as a homogeneous vibration having a wave-length 7Z/N, and
 as N/Z is the distance between the lines of a grating we may
 express our result as follows :—
    The disturbance produced by a single impulse leaving the
 focus of the collimator when resolved by a grating and tele
 scope will, at the focus of the telescope, consist of a succession
 of oscillations equal in number to the lines of the grating and
 having the same period as that homogeneous vibration which,
 leaving the collimator, would have its principal maximum at
 the focus of the telescope.
    It would be wrong to speak of such vibrations as homo
 geneous, although for a certain time they may be analytically
 represented by a sine function. This has repeatedly been
 pointed out by Lord Rayleigh, and a good deal of the difficulty
 which has been felt on the subject is duo to our natural
 inclination to consider as homogeneous a train of waves which
 for a finite space coincides with the curve y = cos kx. Such a
 train is the more homogeneous the greater the space for which
 the equation holds, and our grating will give at the focus of
 the telescope light which is the more homogeneous the greater
 the number of lines.
    12. It will be instructive to take as a third example the
 case of such a finite succession of waves as we have just
 spoken of, and see what the grating will make of it.
    We put j\ai) = 0 for all values of t smaller than tx and
 greater than tit while between these values of ( the velocity
/(at) shall be equal to p cospt. If at the time tx there is no
discontinuity of displacement, we must put cosp«!=l ; and
if the train consists of m complete waves, p(t3 — tj = 2irm.

                     fr
and must for that purpose divide the integral into three parts.
During the first period the train of waves will have encroached
on the grating, and the limits of the integral during that
period will be — / and that value of s, viz. a(t — ti)/y, at which
f(at—ys) ceases to vanish. During the second period the
complete train of waves will intersect the grating, and the
limits of the integral will be a(t — tj)ly and a{t — t{)ly. During
the third period the disturbance will pass off the grating.
   It is not necessary to give the details of the calculation.
During the first period the disturbance is expressed by
           -j^j, sin qait-tj/y--^, sin {pt + <l) ;
that is, the disturbance may be expressed as a superposition
of two trains of waves, one having a period equal to that of
the incident light and the other determined by the direction
of the diffracted beam. If the telescope is pointed towards
the principal maximum of light, the expression reduces to
                     £[a{t-tl)ly + l]cospt,
and represents a vibration with variable amplitude. The
factor in square brackets vanishes when the disturbance first
reaches the grating, and after m complete vibrations becomes
                          (nwrp/*) cos pt.
From that time onwards we have to change the limits of
integration, and the amplitude of the disturbance is then
expressed by

only means that the two vibrations have the same phase.
   Hence the amplitude will be

    The maxima of light take place when q=K, and the
 amplitude of the principal maximum is 2mp/(q + ic). If this
 is compared with the amplitude of the principal maximum
 formed when an infinite train of waves falls on a finite
 grating, it is easily seen that : The position of the principal
 maximum and the amplitude at the principal maximum are the
 same whether an infinite train of waves falls on a grating con
 taining 2N lines or whether the grating is considered infinite
 and the train of waves is limited to 2N complete waves. If
 we compare the time of vibration instead of the amplitude, we
 must note an important difference in the two cases. With an
 unlimited train of waves falling on a finite grating the period
 is everywhere the same as in the incident light ; but when the
 train of waves is limited, the period is that determined by the
 position of the telescope. At the principal maximum the two
 periods agree ; at other places they differ.
    13. We may now consider the case of two disturbances of
 the same type following each other after an interval 2r. If
 both consist of a single impulsive velocity, our previous result
 can at once be applied. Such an impulse will at the focus of
 a telescope produce as many oscillations as there are lines on
 the grating, the complete time t7 of each oscillation depending
 on the position of the focussing lens. The disturbance will
 therefore last through a time 2NV, and as long as t < Nt7
interference will take place—that is, the two trains of waves
will partially cover each other, and according to the relative
value of t' and t the energy during the period of overlapping
may be greater or smaller than the energy of the original
vibrations. But as soon as t^Nt1, the waves are clear of
each other and no interference can take place.
    Let us now treat the same problem, taking the white light
to be " regular," that is, to give an ultimately discontinuous
spectrum of homogeneous vibrations.
    We take the maximum velocity of the incident light to be
the same for all wave-lengths, in order to make it more closely
correspond to the single impulsive velocity, which, when
resolved by Fourier's theorem, draws no distinction between
different wave-lengths. The original disturbance, consisting

   The first two integrals will hold for x=0, as the left-hand
side vanishes at that point ; the right-hand side will therefore
vanish for indefinitely small positive values, and consequently
also for indefinitely small negative values. The third equation
will also hold for x=0, as both sides give the same value for
positive and negative values of x. The fourth equation, how
ever, does not hold at the same point. Putting x = 0 in the

    But if the value of r exceeds that of I, the integrals have
 different values.
    With the help of these equations we find, if r < I,
            E=p[ain2qr + 2ql+2q{l-r) cos2qr].

    The first term may be neglected compared to the two others
 if the number of lines on the grating is great, and we may
 without appreciable error write
                    E = A«[Z+(/-r)cos2!7r].
    This equation, however, only holds when I exceeds r. If,
 on the other hand, r>l, the definite integrals on which E
 depends take different values, which give in that case
                            E0=A*Z.
    The expression for the energy here does not involve r, and
 therefore whatever the retardation the energy is the same, and
the spectrum will show neither minima nor maxima. The point
at which interference ceases is given by r=l, that is by
r=yl/a ; yl being the difference in optical length between the
extreme rays which fall on the grating, the value of t is
identical with that for which interference ceases in the case
of a simple luminous impulse. Thus Gouy and Rayleigh's
proposition is proved for the case of a finite grating. Inter
ference ceases completely for a given retardation of path
depending only on the resolving power of the grating and
not on the nature of the light. Our test case is therefore
disposed of, but it is not easy to see how we could have fore
seen the result without the complete analysis.
    14. The expression for the energy may with advantage be
transformed by taking as the area s that included within
a slit parallel to the lines of the grating, the edges of the
slit coinciding with the principal maxima of the two wave
lengths \ and \+<A.. The illumination along the slit will
show maxima and minima distributed in a well-known
manner, the beam being limited by a rectangular aperture.
If x is measured along the slit and the intensity is taken as
unity at the central point, the intensity at any other point
will be

A being the height of the slit. If this is integrated between
infinite positive and negative values of x, the result is found
to be XF/A. This is the quantity by which we must mul
tiply our expression if the whole energy passing through
the slit is required. As regards the width of the slit we
connect in the first place X and 8 by the relation
                      X= — (sin 8— sin a),

where s is the effective surface of the telescope, and Bd\ the
energy per unit surface within the limits specified by d\. As
was shown previously for a single homogeneous vibration, the
energy contained in the first-order spectrum is one quarter
of that which would reach the focus of the telescope if the
grating were replaced by an ordinary reflecting surface.
   It must of course be remembered that in the last case we
have been dealing with a succession of two sets of waves for
each of which the energy per unit surface has been put equal
to Bd\.
   Returning to the smaller retardation for which the spectrum
is crossed by dark and bright bands, we may conveniently
write the energy passing through the slit between the wave
lengths X and X + rfX
where D stands for the retardation expressed as a length.

which holds as long as the retardation is smaller than the
product of the wave-length into the number of lines (2N)
on the grating. If D = 2NX the equation shows that there is
no difference between the minimum and maximum, and this
continues for greater values of D. The importance of the
equation lies in the fact that it is applicable whatever the
nature of the light, as long as the intensity does not change
rapidly along the spectrum. We may write the expressions
in a form in which they are applicable to the spectra of
different orders and also to spectra formed by prisms. If
we take as the limit of revolution of two lines of wave
lengths X and X + dK that in which the principal maximum
of one falls on the first minimum of the other, Rayleigh has
shown * that in the first-order spectrum two lines are resolved

   15. I have treated, so far, only of grating spectra. The
investigation in detail of the effects produced by prisms is
more complicated, but it is easy to see that there can be no
essential difference between the two cases. If we possessed
a substance which, when cut into the form of a prism, would
separate the wave-lengths laterally according to the same law
as the grating, the disturbance at the focus of the telescope
attached to a prism spectroscope woidd be exactly the same as if
the prism were replaced by a grating of the same resol ving power.
But whatever the law of dispersion the condition is approxi
mately fulfilled within that small region of wave-lengths
which adds appreciably to the disturbance at any point. A
separate treatment of prisms would therefore seem unnecessary.

    But there is a point of view sufficiently instructive in
 my opinion to be mentioned. In the case of a grating it is
easy to see how a solitary impulse is spread out into a dis
turbance lasting a finite time—it is not so clear that the same
holds for a prism. The easiest way to assure ourselves that
a prism acts in the same way as a grating, is to cease to
consider only homogeneous waves and to follow through the
prism a group of waves involving, as it always does, oscilla
tions of different periods.
   Let us imagine a train of waves made up of a finite number
of oscillations, each following the law of a simple pendulum.
The analytical representation of such a group will introduce
wave-lengths which do not differ much. The front or rear
of such a train of waves may be taken to pass through a
medium like glass with a definite velocity, which is the group
velocity corresponding to the given range of
wave-lengths. In fig. 4 let A B be the              Fig. 4.
direction of the front of the incident wave,
C D that of the emergent wave, then, as the
group velocity in the prism is smaller than
the wave velocity, the front of the group
will after emergence be parallel to some
such direction as D K. If the light is
concentrated by means of a lens, the position
of the focus is determined by the condition
of agreement of phase ; that is to say, the
optical length from all points C D to the focus must be the
same, but in that case the optical length from the different
points of K D will not be the same,—in other words, the
front of the wave will take some time to pass through the
focus, just as it would if the spectrum were produced by a
grating. The same holds for the rear of the group and for
any disturbance, account being taken of the different group
velocities for different regions of the spectrum. To make the
analogy with the grating more complete, let us calculate the
distance C K through which the group has fallen behind the
front. The group velocity U is connected with the wave-
velocity V by
                                djcV
                            U    dK '
where k is inversely proportional to the wave-length.       The
difference in the two velocities is therefore

   The wave-front will pass through a thickness t of the prism

in time t/V, the group-front in a time </U. The difference
in time is t(V — U)/UV, which, as V and U do not differ
much, we write approximately <(V — U)/V2. If t represents
the effective thickness of the prism, the distance CK, through
 which the group is displaced, will be, remembering that j*V
is the velocity in air,

    It has been shown by Rayleigh that the resolving power (R)
                           (14) is t -^- , so that the displacement
of' a prism defined as in (I
CK of the group will be
                              CK=R\,
just as in the case of a grating.
    What holds for the group front and rear will also hold for
any portion of the group in so far as it is made up of wave
lengths differing only to a small extent from the one under
consideration. The analogy between a prism and a grating
of the same resolving power is therefore complete.
    16. The consideration of the group-front instead of the
wave-front in optical systems
leads to known result* in a                      Fig. 5.
somewhat novel and instruc
tive way. Thus a lens (fig. 5)
will convert a plane front HK
into a spherical front AGB ;
but the group-front will be
distorted into a form such as
 AC'B ; where CC depends on
the thickness of the lens. The
 displacement does not alter the focus but it interferes with
 the definition of the image. The want of definition thus pro
 duced is known as chromatic aberration. Chromatic aberra
 tion may partially be corrected by joining two lenses of different
materials. From our point of view a lens is achromatic when
 the time taken from the original wave-front to the focus F is
the same along all paths for the <jr»w<p-fronts as well as for
 the imt'e-fronts ; and it is easily shown that this condition will
lead to the well-known relation for achromatism. It must
 be understood of course that the group-front differs from the
 wave-front in the important particular that the phases at
different points of the group-front are not the same. In a

                     Interference Phenomena.                 531
group of waves the waves move through the group, and the
configuration of the group changes. We can speak of definite
rate of propagation (U) of the group, because at definite inter
vals t the group takes up the same shape displaced through
a distance Ut. A good idea of some of the phenomena of
group velocities may be obtained by considering a medium
in which the wave-velocity varies as a linear function of the
wave-length, for in that case the group velocity is independent
of the period ; but the discussion of this subject must be
reserved for a separate communication.
    17. It will be useful at this stage to inquire in what cases
we can legitimately apply the word " interference " to an
optical phenomenon. The essence of interference is the inde
pendence of superposed vibrations ; in other words, the most
important point of an interference phenomenon is that there
is no interference as regards amplitude. There may, however,
be interference as regards energy.
    If a wave-front is propagated, we may say that this implies
interference, for if the different points of the wave-front acted
as separately vibrating points, and we summed up for energy
instead of for amplitude, a very different result from that
actually -obtained would be arrived at. Diffraction may in
this way be said to be the absence of interference. But in
speaking of interference phenomena we may reasonably leave
out of account that which is involved in the propagation of a
wave-front.
    Consider a succession of separate but exactly similar im
pulses, such as is shown in
fig. 6. If the different dis-                 Fig. 0.
turbances do not overlap,
there can be no interfer
ence between them. But
if each impulse is analysed
by Fourier's theorem, the
 different wave-lengths will be represented with different in
 tensities. If the sum of the disturbances is analysed, the
 relative intensity of the different terms of the series will be
 modified, and considerably so if the impulses are numerous
and succeed each other at regular intervals. The leading
term in the expansion will be that having a wave-length equal
 to the distance between the impulses. From the point of view
 of Fourier's series, wo may say that the different disturbances
 have " interfered," but the series being only a mathematical
 representation of the curve shown in the figure, I think the
 term interference would be misleading. We shall reserve the
word interference exclusively for the case that the total energy

532                     Prof. Arthur Schuster on
contained in the disturbance is not equal to the sum of the
energies contained in its different parts.
   If such a succession of waves as we have been speaking
of were to fall on the retina of our eye, a colour-effect might
be produced by the combination where none is produced by
the individual disturbance. In that case there is interference ;
but it will be shown that the interference is due to some
resonance effect in the eye, but does not exist objectively.
   1 8. We proceed to discuss the nature of interference pro
duced when some point of a screen is illuminated by two
different sources of light. Let the velocity due to each source
separately be expressed as functions of the time,/(t) and <f>{t),
the velocity at any time due to the superposition of the two
disturbances is f(t) + (f>(t) , and the excess of kinetic energy of
the combination over the sum of the energies due to each
separately will be proportional to

may be taken as a measure of the " interference." In order
to express this in a form suitable for our purpose, we make
use of the well-known proposition expressed by the equation

The excess of energy of two trains of waves over that of the
separate ones is thus seen to depend in a simple way on the
analysis of each by Fourier's theorem. If the two trains are
of the same type, one following the other at an interval of

and not on any assumption respecting the regularity or irre
gularity of vibration.
   19. We may apply our result to some special case. The
simplest experimental arrangement to obtain a double source
is that of placing a point from which light diverges close to a
mirror as in Lloyd's experiment, and we may imagine the
radiation to be received on a screen at right angles to the
mirror and the energy to be measured by means of a thermo
pile or bolometer. As the distribution of energy will entirely
depend on the law connecting radiation and wave-length, we
must introduce some assumption concerning the connexion.
The simplest law is that ascribed by Rayleigh to H. F. Weber,
according to which the energy contained within a region (Ik of
the spectrum is                  Ce~**%dic
where C and a are constants and 2v/k means the time of
vibration.
   The excess of energy E of the double source over the
separate sources is from (5)

   If the source of light is a slit parallel to the mirror and .r the
distance of any point on the screen from the mirror, the excess
of energy contained in a strip of width dx would be Et/ar, and
t, which is half the retardation in time of the light reaching
the screen from the two sources, is proportional to x. Hence
changing the value of C and a, we may say that the excess
of energy of the double source over the effects of the single
sources acting independently is
                            -^j=e-lVl*dx.
The energy is seen to bo greatest at the screen and to fall off
quickly towards the side. The excess of energy is everywhere
positive, or the total energy is increased by the presence of
the mirror. There is nothing intrinsically impossible in this
result. A source of sound will do more work when placed
close to a wall than if the wall were absent. If effects of the
same nature are generally not observed in the case of light, it
is due to the smallness of the wave-length of the radiation

                     Interference Pltenomena.                  535
which constitutes light. But any law connecting radiation
and wave-length must take in all ranges of waves, and the
particular law adopted gives finite values of intensity within
a finite range of k even for infinitely long waves, hence the
result we have obtained was only to have been expected. It
may be said, of course, that we have assumed our wall to be
a perfect reflector for all wave-lengths ; but it is not necessary
to enter into this question any further, as, for other reasons,
Weber's law cannot be reconciled with experiment. H. F.
Weber himself really uses his law in two contradictory senses
and seems to have overlooked the great difference there
is in the distribution of energy in a spectrum according
as a prism or a grating is used to analyse the light. Weber
takes as his measure of energy the energy contained in the
': homogeneous radiation of wave-length \." If the quantity
given by Weber is denoted by S, Rayleigh interprets his
meaning to be that the energy within a range d\ is Sd\, and
in the discussion of Langley's observations Weber uses his law
in that sense; but Weber also draws conclusions favourable to
his equation from the fact that Tyndall, using a prism, observed
the maximum heating-effect of an arc-spectrum at a particular
place and uses his formula as if the energy contained within
a range dp (fi being the refractive index) was Sdfi.
    If the more natural interpretation of Weber's formula is the
right one, there should be no maximum of energy in a spectrum
formed by a prism at all, but the intensity should indefinitely
 increase with the wave-length. For /* and k being approxi
 mately connected by the relation
                   ji = /j,0 + c*2,      dfi = 2cicdic,
 the energy contained within a range dfi becomes proportional
to                              i
                               -e^^dfi;
                                K
 the factor of dfi being infinite for infinite values of the wave
 length. This puts Weber's law out of court. We may, how
 ever, draw this conclusion from it :—If a is taken to be infi
 nitely large all radiations are of equal intensities. In that
 case the excess of energy which we have deduced from the
 law vanishes at every point, and the two sources may be said
 not to interfere with each other.
    As an approximately correct law for the distribution of
 energy in the spectrum we may take that suggested by
 Michelson, and write for the energy Sdic, where

    If we call E0dx the energy supplied to a strip of width d.v
 and unit length by each source separately, then for t=0 the
 energy should be 4E0rfx.            Hence the excess of energy
 (E — 2E0) due to the double source will be determined by
                 E-2E0=§E0e-''(4^ + 3-12.-2), . . . (6)
where z is written for r/a.
    The retardation t may be expressed in the usual way in
terms of the distance of the two sources from each other and
from the screen. If
    D = distance of screen from source of light ;
   2d = distance of the two sources of light from each other ;
   V = velocity of light ;
    x = distance of any point of the screen from the central
            line, i. e. that line on the screen for which t = 0 ;
we have the following relations :—
                             T=xd/(VT>),
                             z=xd/(VDa).
The quantity a can be determined if we know the wave-length
for which the energy is a maximum in a spectrum formed by
a grating, the condition for the maximum being
or                             xa= v 3.

   As we are now dealing with the only interference-effect
which can properly be said to take place with white light
when the source is only doubled, and not multiplied more
frequently as in the case of thin films, it seems worth while to
discuss the energy-curve as given by (6) a little more closely.
   In fig. 7 (page 541) the line A gives the assumed illumination
of the screen due to the source only. The source being doubled
by the introduction of the mirror, the straight line B gives on
the same scale the illumination of the screen calculated on
the assumption that there is no interference ; the intensity in
that case being simply doubled. The curve C gives the actual
illumination obtained by Lloyd's mirror-arrangement, cal
culated on the hypothesis that Michelson's formula for the

                    Interference Phenomena.                 537
distribution of energy in the spectrum is correct. The dif
ference between the ordinates of B and the curve C may bo
taken to measure the amount of interference. The curve D
gives the assumed distribution of energy in the grating-
spectrum, the abscissa? being wave-lengths drawn to such a
scale that a particular value of the wave-length is placed at
that point of the screen at which the corresponding homo
geneous radiation would, have its first principal maximum.
Analytically the curves are represented (?/ and z being the
ordinates and abscissa?) by the equations
                  y=2 + fe-''(4^-r3-12«3), .        . .   . (C)
                  y=\\e-**.                                 (D).
   Assuming the illumination due to the one source alone to
be E0, the principal features of the curve (.! are :—
    (1) At the intersection of the screen and mirror the illu
mination is 4E0.
   (2) The intensity diminishes until a value of z is reached
for which s2=|— v/| = -275 (or s = -524). The total energy
is then 2E0, and at this point we may say that no interference
takes place.
   (3) The intensity diminishes still further, and now becomes
less than that due to the sum of the two separate sources. The
minimum intensity takes place when
                r>=|_ Vi=0919 (z=0-959).
The value of E0 at this point becomes 0'78E0, or only about
three quarters of the energy due to each source alone.
   (4) The iutensity increases again, and at a point for which
2? = f+ */f = 2,725 (2 = 1-65) it is once more equal to 2E0.
   (5) A maximum of intensity takes place when
                r>=§ + •| = 4-081 (2=2-02).
The maximum is not very pronounced, its value being 2-24 E0.
    (6) The intensity diminishes and gradually approaches the
value 2E0. The total excess of energy on the screen vanishes
                     e-*(4z*+ 3 -12^)^=0.
                  I
   As a result of our calculation, we may say that in all cases
 where interference is produced by an artificial doubling of
 the source, such as in Fresnel's mirrors or biprisms, or in
 Lloyd's mirror-arrangement, the true interference-curve with

 538                 Prof. Arthur Schuster on
 white light does not consist of alternate bright and dark
 bands, but is represented by the curve C (fig. 7), and has only
 one well-defined minimum. There would be no interference
 at all, in the sense the word is used here, if we could have a
 source of light giving out all radiations with equal intensities.
 If we can draw a curve such as that given, it is only because
 we know that the energy of our available sources of white
 light is distributed in a way which cannot differ much from
 that represented by the curve D (fig. 7). There would be no
 difficulty in extending our investigation to the case of thin
 films and other cases in which the source of light is multi
 plied more than twice. The general result, however, would
 not be altered ; whatever interference there is, must depend
 on the prevalence of some particular wave-length in the
original spectrum.
    20. Imagine, now, a photographic film to be substituted
for the screen in the last section. The curve C (fig. 7) would
evidently not represent the effect on the film, for the bands
commonly associated with interference-effects would appear ;
this indicates an interference phenomenon which is not in
cluded in the cases we have hitherto discussed. To explain
how the photographic film can produce interference where
it previously did not exist, we may think of a pendulum
which is set in motion by a blow and moves without fric
tion. Suppose that after a certain lapse of time the blow
is repeated. The second blow may increase or diminish
the momentum due to the first blow according to the rela
tion between the interval of time which intervenes between
the blow and the time of vibration. It will be quite con
sistent with our use of the word if we say that the second
blow has "interfered" with the first, But if friction be
introduced so that, before the second blow is delivered, the
motion due to the first has practically died out, the second
blow will produce its own effect whatever the interval of time
between the blows. There is now no interference, and the
interference in the previous case is seen to depend on the fact
that the effect of the first blow is a periodic motion continued
for a sufficient number of periods. From the case of a single
blow we may proceed to the discussion of impulses delivered
at regular intervals.
     Consider two exactly equal pendulums vibrating in a
period t. Let blows be delivered to the first at regular
intervals t, and to the second at intervals <+t. If n blews
have been delivered, the first being given simultaneously in
both cases, the blows given to the second pendulum will be
behind those given to the first by an interval nr. If that

                      Interference Phenomena.               539
quantity is not more than a certain fraction of a period, which
we may roughly take to be a tenth, the energy gained is prac
tically the same in both cases. But as n increases, the first
pendulum will gradually accumulate an amount of energy
decidedly greater than the second, provided there is no fric
tion. If the friction is sufficiently large so that in the
interval jit, at which the non-agreement of phase between
the blows and the pendulum comes to be important, the effects
of a single blow are practically obliterated, the two pendu
lums will show no appreciable difference, in energy, whatever
the time. If, on the other hand, not knowing beforehand
whether there is any friction or not, we observe that the two
sets of blows delivered at intervals t and t + r produce a
markedly different effect on the pendulum, we may fix a
lower limit to the possible amount of friction that can exist,
and may say that a single blow must produce an effect which
lasts through a number n of periods, where the value of n
must be greater than that at which the difference in phase
becomes detrimental.
   From the effects produced by a succession of blows we may
pass to those produced by a continuous periodic force. A
vibrating system without friction, whose natural period is
27r/n, will, if acted on from rest by a force E cos Kt, show a
displacement
                        E f               .
                a = -j—^ (cos Kt — cos nt) ,
The latter form of the equation shows that if n and * are
nearly equal, the motion is approximately represented by a
vibration of amplitude -5—-j sin —q—t} the maximum velocity
being                     n iC         I
if (n — K)t is sufficiently small. If «0 is the maximum velocity
in the special case that n = K,

   Supposing we are dealing with luminous vibrations, and
that our eye can easily appreciate a difference of intensity of
2 per cent., that is a difference in amplitude of 1 per cent,
we find that the time t at which we begin to draw a clear

  540                Prof. Arthur Schuster on
 distinction between the effects of the force E cos Kt and
 E cos nt is given by
                        (n— ic)t = % nearly.
 This means that the difference in phase between the forces at
 the time t may amount to nearly 30°. If we introduce the
 ?eriodic times of vibration of the two forces T1=2w/?i and
   s = 27r/«, we may say tliat, in order that they should intro
 duce a difference in the energy amounting to two per cent, of
 a vibrating system whose natural period is Itrjn, it is neces
 sary that they should continue to act for m vibrations where
           —Hj        = q~ v/,24 = -08 approximately.
    If the vibrating system is subject to friction, and the differ
 ence in the energy absorbed is two per cent., it follows that
 the friction must be sufficiently small to allow a single impulse
 to produce vibrations which do not appreciably diminish in
m vibrations, where m is the number determined by the above
equation.
    All these considerations tend to show that if a medium
absorbs strongly some particular wave-length and transmits
another wave-length near it, the particles must be capable of
being set into vibration by an impulse, and that the periodic
disturbance of the particle produced by the impulse must last
the longer, the more sudden the variation in the coefficient of
absorption. The fact that a substance draws a distinction
between two periods in the incident light which are near
together implies a regularity of vibration in the substance
capable of being produced by irregular impulses of the medium.
    If we produce an interference-pattern on a photographic
screen, and by this means are able to observe interference
with large difference of path, the case is exactly analogous to
that in which a grating or prism is used. The regularity
which enables lis to observe the interference lies in the instru
ment of investigation, and does not prove anything with
respect to the regularity of white light. Our eye is an
instrument which distinguishes light of different wave
lengths ; this implies a certain regularity in the motion pro
duced by an impulsive disturbance of the medium. If an
impulse reaching the retina did not call forth periodic
motion in nerve-fibres persisting for some appreciable time,
the interference-spectra observed, say, with Lloyd's mirror
would be identical with that indicated by a thermopile, as
shown in fig. 7. But we see a succession of a few spectra,
and may gain a rough idea of the number of periods

                      Interference Phenomena.                  541
 during which a more or less regular motion is produced in
 our eye by the action of light. We may easily distinguish
                               Fig. 7.
between yellow and orange light, the periodic times of which
stand in the ratio of 61 to 59. The fraction (Tj-TJ/T, is
about        and the number of vibrations during which the
effects of an impulse will last must at least contain 24 com
plete periods. On the other hand, 1 think we should find it
difficult to distinguish in any part of the spectrum between
two vibrations the periods of which differ by the three-
hundredth part of either ; and we may conclude that the
physical effects of an impulse in the eye could not show any
regularity lasting for much more than 300 periods. We are
not of course dealing here with the physiological actions
which prolong the sensation of light for a measurable time.
   The fact that white light shows any objective interference
at all, without the artificial introduction of regularity, is due
to the prevalence of certain wave-lengths over others. What
ever regularity there is in the light is intimately connected
with the distribution of intensity in the spectrum.
   We cannot help speculating as to the ultimate cause which
renders the regularity of vibration a function of the tempe
rature only, and independent of the natural periods of the
molecules. Perhaps the solution of the difficulty will be
found in the fact that our observations tell us nothing directly
as to the vibrations of the atoms or molecules. What we
observe is the disturbance of the medium, and the distribu-
ton of energy in the spectrum of an incandescent black body
which is in thermal equilibrium may indicate a property of
the medium rather than that of matter. That is to say,
the motion of vibration in the molecule may be perfectly

irregular, but the medium may take up and propagate some
vibrations quicker than others.
    There are many signs tending to show that the time is not
 far distant when, in order to explain the connexion between
optical and electrical facts, we must recognize some structural
properties of the medium, and the regularity in the vibration
of a black body may be intimately connected with such
structural properties.
    21. The result of this paper is in complete agreement
 with the conclusions formed by Gouy and Lord Rayleigh as
 to the nature of white light. We have obtained an expres
 sion (§ 8) for the disturbance produced by a grating if
 the disturbance in the incident light is given, and traced the
 result in special cases. We have more especially examined
 the case in which bright and dark bands are formed in a
 spectroscope when two sets of rays are brought to inter
 ference, one having a certain retardation compared to the
 other, and shown (§ 14) that provided the intensity of light
 does not sensibly vary from one band to the next, the relative
 intensity of the maxima and minima can be given in terms of
 the retardation and resolving power without any hypothesis
 as to the nature of light. No conclusions, therefore, can be
 drawn as to the " regularity " of white light. The nature of
 light, including its " regularity," as follows from Rayleigh's
 investigations, is completely defined by the distribution of
 energy in the spectrum.
    The analysis of the spectrum by a prism is shown (§ 15) to
 involve, like that of a grating, the spreading out of an impulse
 over a length of time which increases with the resolving
power. That is to say, a single impulse falling on the slit
 of the collimator will not pass through the focal plane of the
telescope as a singlo impulse, but as an oscillatory motion.
 Tbis follows in a simple manner if we consider the passage
 through a prism of a " group " of waves, the front of which
moves with the group velocity.
    In § 18 an expression has been obtained for the distribu
 tion of light on a screen, in a case of simple interference like
 that of Lloyd's mirror arrangement. The expression again
 only involves the distribution of energy in the spectrum. If
all wave-lengths were equally represented, there would be no
interference at all. The coloured bands which are seen in
this case, as well as the colours of thin films, are shown, § 20,
to be due to interference produced in the eye itself, and to
depend on the fact that in any substance showing selective
absorption a single impulse produces an oscillatory motion
lasting for some time. In order that two impulses should

                      Interference Phenomena.                        543
interfere, it is necessary that their effects should overlap.
 When an interference pattern is produced either in a spectro
scope, or with the help of a medium like the eye showing
selective absorption, it always means that each impulse is
spread out so as to overlap the one which follows. Looked
at from a different point of view, we may say that two perio
dicities are involved in every case of interference. We have,
in the first place, a retardation of path of the two interfering
rays. Whatever the nature of light, if analysed by Fourier's
theorem, this retardation is seen to produce a periodicity,
which, however, alone is not sufficient to give rise to inter
ference effect. The prism or grating which analyses the
light, or some medium showing selective absorption, intro
duces the second period. If there is without such means an
interference which can be objectively observed with a ther
mopile or bolometer, it means that there must be some pre
vailing period in the original light. The light may be homo
geneous or it may only show like sunlight a maximum of
intensity in some region of the spectrum.
   22. We have calculated the disturbance produced by a
grating with the help of an equation (1) § 8, which may be
proved in a more rigorous manner. Let <j> be a function
satisfying the differential equation
                            $-«v*                                     <7>
and having given values $ and ^ at the boundaries of the
space we are considering. Kirchhoff * has shown that at any

   Both ^r, and fa satisfy separately the differential equation
   The value of fa at a given point and time is expressed as
the potential due to a double layer. Of such a potential it is
known that it shows a discontinuity at the surface equal to
2<f)(t) . Hence if the surface is plane the fa at the surface must
be equal to <f>(t). The function fa takes, therefore, the same
value as <f> at the surface, and from (8) it follows that the
same must hold for fa also.
   The value of fa is expressed as a surface potential, and the
form of the integral shows that at the plane surface

taking as axis of z the direction of the normal, we may, for
the special case under consideration, write Kirchhoff's equation

         LI II. A New Mode of making Magic Mirrors.
                       By J. W. Kearton*.
THE first explanation that occurred to me on seeing the
       Japanese mirror about fourteen months ago was that the
face might bear directly invisible differences in polish, which
a powerful beam of light would probably convert into visible
ones by reflexion on to the screen. To produce such minute
differences, it was my intention to take pairs of different
metals closely agreeing in colour and reflective power, as
silver and platinum, and to deposit electrically in the form of
 some easily recognizable figure a thin coating of the one
metal on a groundwork of the other. Very faint mercuric
staining of bright metallic surfaces was also contemplated.
These ideas, however, resolved themselves into a test much
simpler, yet involving the same principle. A piece of metal
was so polished that in subdued daylight a cross, more finely
burnished than the general surface of the plate, could just be
distinguished. Reflected on to the screen, the figure came
out exceedingly faint ; and this fact, apar.t from the con
sideration that figures so produced could have only a pre
carious existence, was sufficient to condemn the hypothesis
in question.
   This result has a bearing upon another hypothesis—one
worthy of prompt burial with the quiddities and essences of
the purely deductive method, viz., that the magic-mirror
phenomena are due to local molecular rearrangements in the
reflecting surface, brought about by unequal cooling of the
mass of the mirror. Now, since it is held that the regu
larity or convexity of the surface is not thereby affected, this
molecular rearrangement can put itself in evidence optically
only by reflecting more or less light than the parts of the
surface unaffected by irregular cooling. But it has been
shown that with figures so pronounced as to be directly
visible, the electric beam is powerless to produce results com
parable in intensity with those given by the Japanese mirror ;
much less will directly invisible figures of the type under
reference come up to the required standard.
   The plate used in the foregoing experiment, whilst fur
nishing no clue in virtue of its polished figure, yet presented
evidence that pointed clearly in the direction where a solution
of the problem was to be found. Strikingly well-defined
lines and dapplings of light were thrown on the screen by

             A New Mode of making Magic Mirrors.            547
light reflected from the disk. These marks were found to
 correspond to concave strains produced by hammering the
 plate into rough convexity before scouring down with char
 coal. Depressions produced by electro-deposition of silver
 on a silvered plate, protected in parts by varnish according to
the figure desired, were therefore tried ; but they invariably
deepened into the underlying brass before the sharp edges of
the figure were polished away.
    Next, a fairly thick coating of silver was deposited on the
plate, and a pointed bit of agate was repeatedly drawn with
pressure over certain parts of the porous layer of metal. The
figures thus obtained were startling ; for the depressions ap
 peared on the screen as reticulated lines of deep shade, which
 had their analogue in the broken spinal divisions left by the
 agate point. The bad working of metals electrically deposited
 caused me to give up the deposition method.
    My plate of brass was next slung up in a weak solution of
copper sulphate and sulphuric acid on the positive wire of a
pint bichromate-cell. After an immersion of four minutes,
the parts of the plate not protected by the naphthaline solu
tion of sealing-wax came out beautifully fretted. After
several attempts on these lines, and two days after the lecture
delivered here by Prof. S. P. Thompson on the 27th of
January last on the Magic Mirror, my first success was
achieved in the shape of a mirror 2 inches in diameter,
representing a stem with leaves and a guide-post standing in
a mound of earth. From that mirror to my present one, the
first of the new class being coinpleted in the following July,
was, however, a far ciy. Applied to larger mirrors and
figures, the electrical method proved essentially bad. Exactly
contrary to what was required, the figures were deeper at the
edges of the lines than at the central parts : indeed, a broad
line scoured down into two lines defining the lateral limits of
the original one.
    Nitric acid was finally adopted as the figure-eating agent,
care being taken to use good brass and to polish well before
immersion, so that the action on the plate might be uniform.
Smooth figures were thus produced after immersions of up
wards of six seconds in strong acid. The walls of the figures
are perpendicular to the surface of the disk, and the deter
mination of their proper height relatively to the breadth of
the lines of the figure involved much further labour. The
process of scouring with Sheffield lime and swans'-down
calico has a double effect—it rounds off the upper rectangular
edges of the walls, and at the same time converts the flat
floors of the figure into concave depressions, the walls and

 548        A New Mode of making Magic Mirrors.
floors finally merging into one concave sweep. This curve,
 with narrow lines, is sharper than with broad lines; con
 sequently the latter may disappear, while the former remain
 visible. Very brief immersions in the acid are therefore not
 suitable for figures having lines differing much in breadth.
 Long immersions, on the other hand, are objectionable both
 on the ground of the excessive labour in rounding off the
 edges, and of the well-nigh impossible task of reducing
 uniformly the deep runnels of the figure by scouring the
 general surface with charcoal.
    Gradations in depth according to the breadth of the several
 limbs were therefore tried, and produced in the following
 way :—The figure, say of a tree, is made by removing paraffin
 wax from the brass plate with a pointed stick of boxwood, and
 is then fixed by a very short immersion in the acid. The
 slender branches are now painted over with hot wax, and the
 broader branches and trunk are reduced in breadth sym
 metrically by the same means, the plate then being immersed
 a second time. By a repetition of alternate painting and
 immersing, all the members of the figure are made to increase
 in depth by fine gradations from the boundary lines to the
 central parts. This method, specially applicable to figures
 with very broad and narrow lines, is, however, rather trouble
 some, and does not give satisfactory results unless the grada
 tions are minute, which otherwise will be brought out by
 reflexion on to the screen.
    Reverting to single immersions, final experiments were
 made with plates bearing figures prepared in the usual way,
 viz. by removal of wax, a record being kept of the strength
 of the acid and the time of immersion in each case. The
result is that for figures with lines ranging from ^ to § of
an inch in breadth, an immersion of 3 seconds in a solution
of 5 volumes of concentrated nitric acid to 2 of water gives
a satisfactory depth.
    The next step was to produce figures in low relief, which
come out on the screen in shade. As there is in this case no
intersection of the reflected rays, and, consequently, no
blotting out or dimming of the figures, very narrow lines may
be used. These are conveniently drawn with a camel's-hair
brush and sealing-wax dissolved in naphtha. From 1 to 2
seconds' immersion, according to the breadth of the characters,
will be found sufficient.

LIV. The Minimum Temperature of Visibility. By P. L.
   Gray, B.Sc, Assoc. R.C.S., Lecturer in Physics, Mason
   College, Birmingham*.
THE title of this paper is, for convenience, somewhat
        elliptical. Fully, it should be " The Minimum Tem
perature at which a Strip of Platinum, either bright or lamp-
blacked, becomes visible in the dark."
   Apparently no exact work has been done on the point since
that of Draper ("On the Production of Light by Heat," Phil.
Mag. 1847, xxx. p. 345), who used a somewhat similar method
to that described in this paper. This work soems to be gene
rally little known, vague statements, usually without authority,
being given when the subject is referred to at all. It only
fell under the present writer's notice after the observations,
detailed below, had been completed.
   Draper looked at a small strip of platinum, only ^ inch
wide, in a dark room, gradually heating the metal by an
electric current until it became visible, and estimating its
temperature from its linear expansion, measured by a mag-
nifying-lever method. Taking a mean coefficient of expansion,
from Dulong and Petit's results, with a lengthening of
he arrives at a temperature of 525° G. This is obviously too
high, as no account is taken of the increase of the coefficient
with temperature. Taking the most recent result f for pla
tinum,
                      « = 10-9(8901 + T21*),
or
                     ^=10-9(8901 + 1-210 ;
and integrating, we have
                     lt-l0= 10-9 x 8901 1+ 10-9 x 1-21 * ,
or
       ¦^=-0045045=                „   „      „
whence * = 490° C.
   As this formula was only tested experimentally up to about
73° C, it is most likely that another term, in t2, should be
added, which would somewhat reduce this value, and thus
produce a satisfactory agreement between Draper's result and
the maximum obtained by myself.

550              Mr. P. L. Gray on the Minimum
   In the same paper Draper arrives at the conclusion that all
solid bodies become msible at the same temperature; a conclusion
which is fully borne out by the observations given below, as
to the equality of temperatures in the case of bare .and lamp-
blacked platinum.
   Draper's value being, as shown above, somewhat doubtful,
the point seems worthy of more exact experiment, both from
a physical and a physiological point of view ; and as I had,
in beginning a series of investigations on Radiation, a means
of keeping a platinum surface at any desired temperature, I
made a number of observations on the subject, while waiting
for other apparatus for use with which the platinum strip
was primarily intended.
   The instrument in question is Wilson and Gray's modified
form of Joly's Meldometer, and is described in their paper,
"Experimental Investigations on the Effective Temperature
of the Sun," read before the Royal Society on March 15th,
and shortly to be published*. It consists essentially of a strip
of very thin platinum, about 10 centim. long, 1 centim. broad,
and ^q millim. thick. The plane of the strip is vertical.
   It can be heated by an electric current, and its linear
expansion is indicated by an optical method, by which an
alteration in temperature of 1° can easily be noticed. The
method of calibration is described in Joly's paper t, and in
that already mentioned, so that it is unnecessary to do more
than briefly refer to it here, Minute fragments of substances
of known melting-points are placed on the strip and watched
through a microscope, while the temperature is very slowly
and cautiously raised until, in any case, melting is seen to
take place, when the position of the spot of light which indi
cates the expansion of the strip is noted. In these experiments
the substances used were KsN03 (339°), AgCl (451°), KBr
(699°), and gold (1041°) f. From these observations a curve
showing the relation between temperature and scale-readings
is obtained. One point may, however, be mentioned, viz. as
to the difference of temperature between the middle of the
strip and its surface. Joly says § that the difference is prob
ably measured by hundredths of a degree only. The following
figures will show the correctness of this assumption.

The loss of energy per unit area was obtained by a voltmeter-
and-amnieter method, which is to be further developed for the
Radiation experiments. All the figures are approximate, the
smallness of the resulting difference (about yoQG ° ^'-) show
ing that there is here no need for any high degree of accuracy.
   With the surface of the platinum lampblacked the case is
different ; but even here an approximate calculation shows
that there is still less than 1° difference between the platinum
and the surface of the carbon. In a typical case the following
residts were found:—
   Thickness of layer ='00033 centim. This was determined
from a knowledge of the specific gravity of the lampblack.
   Conductivity ='0002. This is the value given by Everett
for powdered carbon, and is probably less than the correct
value for the lampblack ; but the two must be of about the
same order of magnitude.

               Method of Making the Experiments.
   The first requisite was to get the strip in a perfectly dark
 enclosure, within which both eyes could be directed towards
it without strain. To this end the apparatus was enclosed in
 a wooden box (blackened within), one end of which was
 replaced by a black velvet cloth, under which the observer
 placed his head, and which he could gather round his neck
 and under his chin so that not a ray of light could penetrate
 the enclosure. The box was about 48 centim. long, 30 broad,
 and 22 high, and ordinarily the eyes, in making an observa
 tion, would be about 30 centim. from the strip. The other
 end of the box was provided with a hinged shutter, which was
 lifted immediately after an observation had been made, for
 the purpose of noting the temperature of the strip.
    The strip itself was further protected from draughts &c. by
 means of a piece of brass, bent twice at right angles, and

  552            Mr. P. L. Gray on the Minimum
 resting on the slate block below the strip, as in the calibration
  experiments ; thus (natural size) :—
 The angular dimensions of the surface of platinum, as seen in
 any experiment, were therefore :—
              Apparent length = 3° 49' approximately ;
                   „     width =1°54'           „
 so that the apparent area subtended was about 36 times that
 of the full moon.
    The current by which the strip was heated ran through a
variable carbon resistance, the handle of which was within
convenient reach of the observer as he sat with his head under
the black cloth. He could thus alter the temperature of the
platinum until it was on the very verge of invisibility, a very
small fraction of a turn being then sufficient to produce utter
darkness where before the area of faint light had been. A
contact-breaker was also within convenient reach, so that the
current could be broken or made at pleasure, and the objective
reality of the faint luminosity at the limiting-point thus de
monstrated. When he was satisfied that the limiting-point
had been reached the hinged end of the box was opened, a
beam of light sent to the mirror connected with the strip, and
the deflexion, giving the temperature, read on the scale. The
possible error in the estimation of the absolute value of the
temperature may be taken as certainly not more than 2°.
                    Discussion of tlie Results.
   My first idea, in putting down final results, was to take the
mean of a large number of observations as expressing the
required minimum temperature ; but there soon appeared to
be too much variation in individual cases, both for the same
eyes at different times and for different people's eyes, for this
mean to be of any value. It seems better, therefore, to put
down the determinations in some detail, with such remarks as
may help towards some general conclusions afterwards.

   The first case given is my own, in which it has naturally
been easier to obtain a larger number of records than in the
case of other people.
   The dates are given merely to distinguish one day's obser

                  and 4th, and again a few minutes' rest after
                 the 5th.

 554              Mr. P. L. Gray on the Minimum
    Observations on two succeeding days gave readings varying
 from 470° in the morning to 385° in the evening, the influ
ence of rest in darkness being always plainly marked.
    To test if the intervals of rest noted above were sufficient
 to bring the eyes to their extreme state of sensitiveness, some
 observations were made at 3 a.m., after I had been asleep in
 a dark room for 3 hours. The readings then obtained were
 373°, 386°, showing a slightly greater sensitiveness than that
 in any previous experiment ; the small difference probably
 indicates that the eyes were very near their extreme limit,
 and that no longer rest would give a lower reading.
    Before going on to the general conclusions to be drawn
from these results, the values are given obtained by other
 observers, who (with the exception of two) were either mem
bers of the staff, or students, of Mason College. They are
 probably not equally trustworthy, and in general no particular
preparation was gone through by the observer.
    Usually the first observation in each case showed a higher
temperature than the second and succeeding ones. This was
to be expected, since the time spent in darkness during the
first experiment prepares the eye to a certain extent for the
second. The results obtained are as follows :—

                     Temperature of Visibility.                     555
                        General Conclusions.
    (1) That the minimum temperature of visibility is the same
for a bright polished metallic surface as for one covered with
lampblack, although the intensity of the radiation in the two
cases may be different.
   This result may at first be, to some, unexpected, but a little
consideration will show that it might have been, a priori,
anticipated. For probably temperature governs the highest
wave-length from a radiating body, and wave-length governs
visibility, at least after an extremely small intensity of radia
tion has been passed *.
    (2) That the visible limit at the red end of the spectrum
varies greatly for a normal eye, according to its state of pre
paration ; i.e. according to the intensity of the light in which
the observer has been before making the observation.
    I take my own eyes as normal ; they have been tested in
the Anthropometrical Laboratory at S. Kensington, and
roughly by Captain Abney's method ; and in the figures given
above the results are supported by those obtained by the
other " cases," none of whomf are known to have abnormal
sight.
    Speaking generally, we may say that a bright light
diminishes the sensitiveness of the eye to radiation of low
frequency ; that darkness increases it. Or that, as a rule,
the eye is less sensitive in the morning than at night.
     (3) 1'hat for the less sensitive condition, the minimum tem
perature of visibility for the surface of a solid is about 470° C,
 but that this may be much reduced by even a few minutes in a
 dark room.
     (4) That at night, a surface at a temperature of 410° is
 visible, and that by resting the eyes in complete darkness, this
 may be reduced to as low as 370° nearly, below which apparently
 one cannot go, since 10 minutes' rest appears to be almost as
 efficacious as 3 hours'.
     (5) That different people's eyes {of no special or known de
parture from normality) differ somewhat in their " minimum
 temperature of visibility," but probably not to any great extent,
 if tested under the same conditions as to preparation, fyc.
     Case G was a somewhat curious one ; the observer was the
 one exception among those I tried whose red colour-percep
 tion is perhaps not quite normal. He arrived at the lowest
   • Langley, "Energy and Vision," Phil. Mag. xxvii. (1889), shows
 that the amount of energy sufficient to excite vision is immensely less
 than that radiating from the strip in these experiments, at least in the
 low-red wave-lengths.
    t With the possible exception of Case Q.

556         The Minimum Temperature of Visibility.
temperature in the evening without any long rest in the
darkness, and, as is seen above, 17 minutes in perfect darkness
produced no alteration ; yet, in the morning, he went up to
about the usual figure, so that what I had hoped to find an
abnormal case turned out approximately ordinary.
   The loss of distinct colour at the low temperatures is very
striking ; the appearance to myself, and to most of the
observers, has absolutely nothing of red in it, but is like a
white mist— tbe nearest comparison I can make.
   In the morning observations, however, when the strip dis
appeared at from 460° to 470°, the last appearance was
distinctly reddish ; and this agrees with one observation noted
at night, when after getting the visibility critical-point at
about 390° C, the temperature was raised until one could
declare for certain that the light looked red : it was then
found to be 449°.
   Of course, in all the observations, the luminous area was
most distinctly seen by somewhat averting the gaze from it :
generally I found it best to look in the direction of either far
upper corner of the enclosure.
   As already mentioned, most of the observers pronounced
the appearance at the critical-point to be that of a " whitish
mist ;' one, however, thought he saw a slight " lilac tinge "
in it ; and " Case G " declared it to be decidedly yellow,
which is interesting, because to him a red mark on white
paper (such as a pip on a card belonging to one of the red
suits of a pack) appears yellow, by artificial light at night.
   In one experiment a plate of glass, | inch thick, and in
another a layer of water, £ inch thick, were inserted between
the strip and the eye, without making the slightest difference
in the phenomenon ; showing (1) that the point where these
substances begin to be more or less opaque to infra-red radia
tion had not been reached ; (2) that the small difference in
intensity produced by their insertion had no appreciable
effect. This last conclusion is far more strongly borne out
by the equality of temperature in the case of the bare
metallic and the black surfaces, and indicates that in all the
cases it was ivave-length, and not intensity, which was deter
minative of visibility, so disposing of the possible objection
that the difference between "morning" and "evening"
might be due merely to the state of enlargement of the pupil
of the eye, which would naturally be more contracted at the
one time than at the other, thus affecting the total amount of
radiation falling on the retina. Also, if such an objection
were valid, it would imply that fatigue of the muscles of the

      Determination of the Relative Affinities of Acids.      557
iris produced a relatively enormous "time-lag" in following
changes of luminous intensity, which we know does not exist.
   There seems, in fact, to be little doubt that the difference
is due to the retina itself becoming sensitive to long waves
after rest, which were incapable of affecting it when it was in
some way fatigued by exposure to the ordinary bright light
of day.
   The next and obvious step is to find the respective wave
lengths corresponding to the different temperatures. This
point, however, and others, cannot be determined without
some additions to the present apparatus, and will form the
subject of a future paper.
LV. Neio Method of Determining tlie Relative Affinities of
              certain Acids. By M. Carey Lea *.
THIS method of measuring affinities is based on the
       principle that the affinity of any acid is proportionate to
the amount of base which it can retain in the presence of a
strong acid selected as a standard of comparison for all acids.
The standard acid being in all cases kept exactly at the same
dilution.
   An example will make this clearer. Sulphuric acid is
here taken as the standard, and its presence or absence in the
free state is ascertained by means of the herapathite test
 (described in this Magazine for July 1893). For simplicity,
we will suppose that the quantity taken is always a gram-
molecule at a fixed rate of dilution. It is evident that two
gram-molecules of sodium hydroxide would exactly saturate
it. If, now, we take a given acid, we may find that a
quantity of its sodium salt corresponding to three gram-
molecules of sodium hydroxide will exactly extinguish the
reaction of a gram-molecule of free sulphuric acid. With still
another acid we may find that a quantity of its sodium salt
corresponding to four gram-molecules of sodium hydroxide
is needed to extinguish the sulphuric reaction. Then the
affinity of the second acid is exactly twice as great as that of
the first. At the point where the free sulphuric-acid reaction
was extinguished, the second acid under examination retained
twice as much sodium as the first, and this quite independently
of any question of comparative basicity.
   Throughout the series of determinations here to be described
the sulphuric acid was used invariably at the same degree

558      Mr. Carey Lea on a New Metltod of Determining
of dilution, otherwise the results would not be strictly com
parative. Having obtained normal acid by titration with
                                                       N
pure sodium carbonate, this was further diluted to -rr, and 50
to 100 cub.centim. were found a convenient quantity to employ.
The salt to be tested was finely powdered and thoroughly
dried at 100°, or at whatever higher temperature it could
support. It was then placed in a weighing-bottle and cooled
in a desiccator and kept there except tor a few moments at a
time. By using the dry salt, the dilution of tho acid was kept
constant. When the point of extinguishment seemed to be
reached, at least four final crystallizations were made. Great
care is necessary to seize the exact point of extinguishment.
The quantity of the salt found is then reduced to correspond
with one gram-molecule of sulphuric acid. It is next divided
by its own molecular weight : this gives the number of mole
cules of the salt needed to extinguish the reaction in one
molecule of sulphuric acid. In order to make it possible to
compare acids of different basicities, the figures thus obtained
must next be modified to correspond with the basicity of the
acid used. If the acid is bibasic, no change will be needed.
If monobasic, the figures obtained must be divided by 2. If
tribasic, they must be multiplied by | &c. Finally, as the
quantity characteristic of the acid is the excess of the quantity
found over the amount equivalent to one molecule of sulphuric
acid, unity is deducted from the amount obtained, and the
residue thus found represents the comparative affinity of the
acid, and may be called its index.
   This may be rendered more clear by one or two instances.
   In the case of hydrochloric acid, there was needed as a
mean of many determinations 29-37 gram-molecules of sodium
chloride to extinguish the reaction in one gram-molecule of
sulphuric acid. At this point the solution necessarily contained
                 NasS04 + 2 HC1 + 27-37 NaCl.
   Tills is proved beyond question by the fact that the solution
no longer gives a trace of reaction of free sulphuric acid.
The quantity of 27-37 gram-molecules of sodium chloride is
the proportion of undecomposed sodium chloride that must
remain in the solution in order that the sulphuric acid may
be completely converted into sodium sulphate, and may remain
as such in the solution in a condition of equilibrium.
   This number 27*37 therefore represents the strength of
the affinity of hydrochloric acid for sodium. But in order to
compare acids of different basicities it is convenient to refer

               the Relative Affinities of certain Acids.                 559
 them all to bibasic sulphuric acid, and therefore the number
just found must be divided by 2. Therefore 13*68 may be
taken as the index of the affinity of hydrochloric acid, in
comparison with those of other acids determined in like
manner.
   Similarly with pyrophosphoric acid. The mean value
found for the quantity necessary to extinguish the free sul
phuric acid in one gram-molecule of sulphuric acid was found
to be 0"963 gram-molecule of sodium pyrophosphate. At
this point the liquid contains
               Na2S04-l- i(H«P,0T) + -463(Na4P207)
in equilibrium. The number '463 therefore represents the
comparative affinity of pyrophosphoric acid, except that as the
acid is quadriliasic the number found must be multiplied by
2 in order to bring it into comparison with bibasic acids.
Therefore the index of pyrophosphoric acid is "926. This acid
being quadribasic, half a molecule contains the quantity of
sodium requisite to saturate a molecule of sulphuric acid, and
therefore only half a molecule of pyrophosphoric acid is set
free.
   In other words : It is found by experiment that the quantity
of sodium pyrophosphate necessary to extinguish the reaction
for free sulphuric acid with one thousand molecules of that
acid, is 963 molecules ; out of this, five hundred molecules of
pyrophosphoric acid are set free as just mentioned, and there
remain 463 molecules of undecomposed pyrophosphate. This
number 463 multiplied by 2 because of the basicity of the
acid, and divided by 1000 to make it correspond to one
molecule of sulphuric acid, gives "926 as the index of pyro
phosphoric acid.
   The state of equilibrium is always conditioned by the degree
of concentration. If to any solution of sulphuric acid a salt
is added in just sufficient quantity to extinguish the sulphuric-
acid reaction, it is then only necessary to add a little water
and the equilibrium is at once changed ; a certain portion of
the salt that had been added is re-formed and the sulphuric
reaction reappears. In order, therefore, to obtain true com
parative results, it is necessary to use the sulphuric acid always
at exactly the same dilution and to add the dry salt to it.
   The affinity of sulphuric acid for water is a most important
factor in all determinations of this nature. Mendel'-ef indeed
expresses the opinion* that most of the affinities hitherto

                              2Q2

560      Mr. Carey Lea on a New Method of Determining
determined are unreliable for want of sufficient exactitude in
this respect.
   To show how much precaution is needed the following
reactions may be mentioned.
    When 4 cub. centim. of normal sulphuric acid are added to
40 cub. centiin. of normal solution of sodium nitrate, not a trace
of free sulphuric acid can be detected in the liquid. In con
sequence of the large excess of sodium salt the sulphuric acid
has been completely taken up by the sodium, with of course
an expulsion of an equivalent quantity of nitric acid.
    But when, instead of 4 cub. centim. of normal sulphuric acid
we use 40 cub. centiin. of decinormal acid, then, although the
quantities of acid and of salt are exactly the same, the equili
brium is completely changed. The greater quantity of water
present by reason of its affinity for sulphuric acid counter
acts to some extent the affinity of the sodium. Free sulphuric
acid exists in the solution, and is abundantly indicated by the
herapathite test.
    This difference may be even more strikingly shown in the
following manner :— Taking the mixture of 4 cub. centim. of
normal sulphuric acid and 40 cub. centim. of normal solution
of sodium nitrate, let a drop be placed in each of two small
porcelain basins previously slightly warmed. To one of them
 let a single drop of distilled water be added, and then the
herapathite test to both. In a few minutes the one which has
received the drop of water will show well-marked crystalliza
tions of herapathite, whilst the other will not show a trace.
The effect of dilution in changing the equilibrium of the
solution of a base with mixed acids is thus made visible to the
 eye by a chemical reaction. Hitherto it has been a deduction
 from physical changes requiring great delicacy of measure
ment. Results of a precisely similar character were obtained
 when potassium bromide was substituted for sodium nitrate,
 and are no doubt of general occurrence.
    The applicability of this method proved to be a good deal
 restricted owing to the tendency of many acids when set free
 to decompose the herapathite reagent. For this reason the
 affinities of hydrobromic, hydriodic, chloric, iodic, and nitric
 acids could not be measured with accuracy, although many
 attempts, sometimes as many as 30 or 40 or more, were made
 to get reliable results. This work, however, was not entirely
 thrown away. It demonstrated that chloric acid has the
 strongest affinity for bases of any known acid. It might
 have been expected a priori that a highly oxidized acid of
 chlorine would have stronger affinities than chlorine hydride.

              the Relative Affinities of certain Acids.        561
 It also showed that the comparative affinity of nitric acid has
 hitherto been placed somewhat too high. Taking hydrochloric
 acid as 100, nitric acid scarcely exceeds 75.
    The weaker acids, being for the most part without action
 on the test solution, give satisfactory results. Oxalic and
 tartaric acids must, however, be excepted, the acid set free
 tends to form acid salts of sparing solubility, these are pre
 cipitated: thus the conditions are changed.
    The results obtained are here tabulated :—
                            29-37          13-fi8       100
                             1-21           0-21          1-54
                             228            014           102
                             102            0-53          3-87
                             0-963          0-926         6-77
                              1-2           U-2           1-46
    The first column of this table shows the absolute number
of molecules of the sodium salt which must be added without
 regard to the basicity of its acid, in order that one molecule of
sulphuric acid may be so completely saturated with base as
no longer to give a reaction for free sulphuric acid.
   In the second column these numbers are modified in such
manner as to cause them to justly represent tbe comparative
affinity of the acid. With monobasic acids the number of
molecules is divided by 2, with quadribasic acids it is multi
plied by 2. For a tribasic acid it is multiplied by §. Bibasic
acids only remain unchanged. Next, unity is subtracted
because it is always the excess of the salt which must be present
in order to keep the sulphuric acid saturated with base that
gives the measure of the affinity of the acid. Were this
correction not applied, the entire result would be vitiated.
   The third column gives the numbers as they appear when
hydrochloric acid is taken as 100.
   Instead of adding salts of different acids to sulphuric acid,
we may add various acids to a salt formed by the union of
sulphuric acid to a strong base, for example, to sodium
sulphate.
   bulphuric acid is now recognized as being a weaker acid
than hydrochloric, and yet we have seen that it is able to
detach a certain quantity of base from a chloride. Further,

562       Mr. Carey Lea on a New Method of Determining
that if the chloride is present in sufficient excess, the sulphuric
acid may take up enough base to completely saturate itself.
The general fact that a certain quantity of acid may be expelled
from a salt by another acid, even much weaker than the first,
has been shown by the researches of Thomsen and of Ostwald.
So that if, for example, we add acetic acid to a solution of
 sodium sulphate, a distinctly recognizable quantity of sulphate
is decomposed and converted into acetate. A condition of
 equilibrium is produced in which the liquid contains both
 acids in a free state and both salts. In some way that we do
not yet understand the presence of the free acid maintains the
 combined acid in its combination. The sodium acetate exists
 only by virtue of the free acetic acid present.
    The existence of this state of equilibrium was first proved
 by Thomsen, who deduced it from the thermochemical changes
 which took place on mixing tho solutions. Ostwald reached
 similar conclusions by making accurate determinations of the
changes of volume and, consequently, of specific gravity
which resulted from the mixing of the solutions, and in
 other ways.
    In both these cases the conclusions are reached by logical
 deductions from the phenomena observed. But with the aid
 of the herapathite test, the expulsion of sulphuric acid by a
 very much weaker acid can be rendered immediately evident
 to the eye. Thus if to the solution of sodium sulphate we add
acetic acid, and place two or three drops of the mixture in a
warm porcelain basin and add some of the test liquid to it, in
a few minutes we have a great number of small black rosettes
 of herapathite which crystallize out. Solution of sodium
 sulphate not containing acetic acid gives no such reaction
with the herapathite test. It dries up to a pale yellow residue.
    Acids vary very much in their ability to detach sulphuric
 acid from soda. The following acids, when added to sodium
 sulphate and tested by the herapathite test, give the results
 here noted.
    Malic acid, gives an abundant crystallization.
    Succinic acid, acts similarly.
    Lactic acid, a moderate reaction.
    Mucic acid, about the same as lactic.
    Vanadic acid, traces.
    Arsenic acid, abundant crystallization.
    Hippuric acid, distinct traces.
    Salicylic acid, distinct crystallization.
    Of course the stronger organic acids, tartaric, oxalic, and
 citric, separate sulphuric acid with abundant crystallizations
 of herapathite when they are made to act on sodium sulphate

             the Relative Affinities of certain Acids.       563
and the test is applied. It was observed that an acid oxalate
acts like a free acid. Thus, when a solution of potassium
binoxalate or quadroxalate is added to one of sodium sulphate,
sulphuric acid is detached precisely as if free oxalic acid had
been used.
   It is clear that extremely weak acids, such as hippuric and
salicylic, are able to take a certain quantity of base even from
so strong an acid as sulphuric, setting free a recognizable
quantity of this latter acid. Carbonic acid is still weaker
than these. Ostwald, in determining the relative affinities of
acids by the rate of the decomposition of acetamide and by
the inversion of cane-sugar, found no appreciable effect from
carbonic acid. It therefore became of interest to ascertain if
any sensible decomposition of sodium sulphate would result
from the action of this acid.
   Perfectly pure carbonic anhydride was passed for a long
time through a solution of sodium sulphate without setting
free a recognizable trace of sulphuric acid. This was expected,
the experiment was only preliminary to its repetition under
pressure.
    For this purpose sodium sulphate with the test solution
was placed in one leg of a bent tube, in the other leg was
placed sodium bicarbonate ; and the tube was sealed. Heat
was gradually applied to the bicarbonate. In the second trial
the pressure was raised so high that the stout glass tube was
ultimately shattered with violence. The leg containing the
test liquid and sulphate had been secured in a clamp and re
mained uninjured. The liquid therefore had been subjected
to the action of carbonic anhydride at a high pressure—it,
 however, gave no indications of a separation of traces of sul
phuric acid under its action. It is to be remarked that this
 test is more decisive than if a solution of sodium sulphate had
 been used and had been tested afterwards. For in this last
 case, on release of the pressure, the reaction might readily be
 reversed with recombination of sulphuric acid, had any been
 liberated. But with the test liquid present during the pressure
 this reversal could not take place.
    Carbonic anhydride, therefore, does not even under pressure
 set free any portion of sulphuric acid from sodic sulphate.
    The reactions described in this paper indicate :—
    1. That when to free sulphuric acid a salt is added in
 sufficient quantity to cause the whole of the sulphuric acid to
 saturate itself with the salt-base, it is possible by means of
 the herapathite test to determine the exact point of such

564       Dr. S. P. Thompson and Miles Walker on the
saturation. At this point there will necessarily be as much
of the acid at first combined with the base, now free in the
solution, as corresponds to one molecule of a bibasio acid,
that is two of a monobasic acid, half a molecule of a quadri-
basic acid, <fcc. From this we can deduce the exact nature of
the resulting equilibrium.
   2. That a series of equilibria thus obtained with different
salts enables us to determine the comparative strength of the
affinities of the acids of those salts.
   3. That the fact, already proved in other ways, that even
small quantities of weak acids, added to sulphates, will set
free a certain quantity of sulphuric acid can, by means here
given, be for the first time rendered visible to the eye by a
well-marked chemical reaction.
 LVI. On the Design and Winding of Alternate- Current
   Electromagnets.      By Silvanus P. Thompson, D.Sc,
   F.R.S., and Miles Walker*.
1. "TN designing electromagnets for use with alternate
    -L currents various considerations enter which do not
enter into the design of electromagnets for use with continuous
currents. Chief of these considerations are the self-inductive
action of the windings, and the frequency of the alternation
of the current.
   As with continuous-current electromagnets, so with alter
nate-current magnets, the degree to which magnetization is
carried in the magnetic circuit of given configuration depends
upon the number of ampere- turns of the excitation. The
methods of predetermining the number needed to produce any
desired degree of magnetization are too well known to need
any reference. Our present aim is to show how to determine
the winding which will, under given circumstances as to
frequency, voltage, &c, produce any desired number of
ampere-turns.
   2. As a preliminary, however, it is needful to touch upon
the point whether an electromagnet (properly laminated, it is
understood) will give an equal pull, when excited with an
equal number of ampere-turns of alternating current.
   Since the pull of an electromagnet upon its armature
depends upon the normal tension along the magnetic field
integrated over the area of the pole-face, and this tension
    * Communicated by the Physical Society : read April 27, 1804.

        Winding of Alternate-Current Electromagnets.         565
is proportional to the square of the intensity of the magnetic
flux, then, if this flux were proportional to the number of
ampere-turns of excitation (as would be the case if the per
meability were constant), the pull wrould be proportional to
the square of the number of ampere-turns. Now the ampere
meters for alternate currents operate upon principles that
cause them to indicate the square root of the mean square
values of the current. Hence it follows that, if permeability
were constant, the pull should be proportional to the square
of the current, whether the current be continuous or alterna
ting. But since, with an alternating current of the same
nominal value as a continuous current, the magnetism is
carried at each period to a point considerably higher than
with the continuous current, and since also at the higher
degrees of magnetization the permeability is lower, it follows
that the pull of the electromagnet when excited by alternate
currents ought to be slightly less if the excitation is so
great as to carry the magnetization                 Fiff. 1.
into the regions commonly spoken of as
approaching saturation. The pull ought
to be independent of the frequency of the
alternation provided this exceeds a certain
minimum.
   Experiments made show that these
views are justified in practice.
   An electromagnet of the form shown
in fig. 1 was made up of iron stampings
about 0'5 millim. thick.
    The principal dimensions were as follows :—
         Mean length of limbs and yoke .    38 cms.
         Breadth of limb                     3*1 cms.

    The stampings of the armature were of the same thickness,
 number, and breadth as those of the electromagnet. In the
 succeeding experiments the electromagnet was wound with
 163 turns of copper wire 2'03 millim. in diameter, and the
 armature was separated from the pole-faces by a distance-
 piece of wood (K)52 centim. thick.

    These experiments show that the pull was exactly the same
when the intensity of the flux did not exceed 4000 lines per
square centimetre. At higher degrees of magnetization the
pull with alternate currents is slightly less.
    It may be remarked that at higher intensities and with
higher frequencies, eddy-currents, if any are present, will
produce, for an equal flow of exciting current, a greater
demagnetizing action, and therefore lessen the pull. On the
other hand, if the current is supplied at a constant (alternating)
voltage, eddy currents do not decrease the magnetization but
cause more current to flow in proportion.
    Another experiment was made with a solenoidal electro
magnet with a laminated U-form plunger belonging to a

          Winding of Alternate-Current Electromagnets.             567

the current required to raise it was measured, with the
following results :—

   3. When alternate currents are supplied at a given voltage
to an electromagnet having a given configuration of the mag
netic circuit, and it is desired to produce by a winding any given
number of ampere-turns of excitation, it is obvious that there
are many ways of attaining the result with coils of various
sizes and numbers of turns. If the resistance of the coil is
so small relatively to the inductance as to be negligible, then
there will only be one possible solution as to the number of
turns. If, however, the resistance of the coil is of a magni
tude comparable with that of its inductance, then there are
 various possible solutions, for an equal number of ampere-
turns may be produced by using currents of different strengths
and coils of different numbers of turns. In the cases of
 different windings the lag of phase of the currents will be
different. If the resistance is large relatively to the inductance,
the difference of phase between the current and the impressed
 volts will be small, and the wasted watts large. If the in
 ductance is large relatively to the resistance, the difference of
 phase will be nearly 90° ; and the current will be nearly
 wattless, the efficiency being relatively high.
    It is in accordance with good constructive practice to use
 such frequencies in the supply, and coils of such relatively
 high coefficients of self-induction as to justify the assumption,
 for the purpose of design, that the inductance is the important,
and the resistance of the coil the unimportant matter. How
 ever, to bring the calculations to bear upon all cases that may
occur, both resistance and inductance have been taken into
 consideration.

 5G8      Dr. S. P. Thompson and Miles Walker on the
    Let the impressed volts be called V, the current t (both
 being square-root of mean square values), the resistance of
 the coil R, its coefficient of self-induction L, the frequency of
 the period of alternation n, and the number of windings W.
 The inductance will then be 2irnh, which for brevity may be
 written ph. Then the impedance will be is/RP+fPL*. The
relation between volts and amperes in the coil will be expressed
The angle of lag being called <j>, its sine will have the value
                         ph+VW+piU.
 Hence we have the following relation :—
                          V.sin^=tpL;                         (1)
these being equivalent expressions for the effective part of the
 volts that is employed to balance the counter-electromotive
 force of self-induction in the coils. Now L is proportional to
the square of the number of windings ; and may be written
 = &W*, where k is the coefficient of self-induction of a single
turn, and W the number of windings.
    Now, let the prescribed number of ampere-turns that are
to be produced be called Z = iW. Inserting these values in
(1) we obtain the expression
                         Vsmtf> = kpWZ;                       (2)
and finally                w_ V sin <f>
                            * - ~kpW »•••••• M)
which is the relation sought.
   4. The quantity k denoted above, the coefficient of self-in
duction of a single turn, depends upon the dimensions of the
iron parts of the magnetic circuit and upon those of the air-
gap, as well as upon the permeability of the iron. If the
magnetization is not carried beyond 5000 lines per square
centimetre, the permeability may be considered as constant.
But k will decrease with any increase in the reluctance of
the magnetic circuit, such as the lengthening of the air-
gap. On the contrary, as the armature is attracted up
toward the poles k increases. The quantity k represents the
number of magnetic lines ( x 10~9) which permeate the mag
netic circuit when one ampere circulates in a single turn of
wire around the core. We have only to multiply k by the
square of the number of windings to obtain the coefficient of
self-induction of any coil subsequently to be wound upon this ¦
magnetic circuit. The quantity k must itself be experimentally

           Winding of Alternate- Current Electromagnets.     569
determined. This can be done by winding upon the magnetic
circuit an experimental coil having a known number of turns
w, and a known resistance r. Using this coil, measure the
virtual current c which passes when it is supplied at a voltage
v of frequency n. During the experiment the armature should
be fixed, say by wooden distance-pieces, in the position which it
will occupy in use. Then the coefficient of self-induction I of
the temporary coil will be
                    1= vV-cV-h vMttW.
Then I being thus experimentally determined, it follows that
k=l/iei.
    From the equation (3) we see that V, p, and h being
constant, there is a certain maximum number of windings
which must not be exceeded if we are to get the prescribed
number of ampere-turns of excitation ; for sin <f> cannot be
greater than unity. If this maximum number of windings is
exceeded, the result will be to give fewer ampere-turns.
This is easily seen if equation (3) be put into the form,
                                                             W
Other things being equal, the ampere-turns are inversely
proportional to the number of icindings. This, at first sight,
seems an anomaly ; but is easily understood when we re
member that the self-induction, and therefore the lessening
of the current, is proportional to the square of the number of
turns ; so that whilst we are increasing our turns we are
reducing our amperes in a much greater ratio.
    Having ascertained k, the only other factor to be determined
 is sin <f>. This in most practical cases can be assumed to be
 unity, since with the usual frequencies of supply and using
 magnets with iron cores, there is no difficulty in keeping the
 resistance negligibly small even when the number of windings
 is at the required maximum, so that </> is very nearly 90°.
 This will be seen from the results given below obtained from
 an actual magnet. In most ordinary cases, then, we merely
 write
                            W = V/#pZ ;                       (5)
 and, having calculated W, we find what current the wire will
 have to carry from the equation ? = ZW. If there is room,
 and in most cases there will be ample, we may wind with
 thicker wire than is necessary to carry the current ; but
there is no advantage in using thicker wire than such as
makes R practically negligible.

 core and armature were those already described in rela

 copper wire, 1*22 millim. in diameter, for the purpose of first
 determining k when the armature was at the distances of 9*52,
 6*35, 3-17, and 0 millim., respectively, from the poles. The
 resistance of the wire when heated by carrying 12 amperes
 was 0'3 ohm, and the frequency 93 periods per second. The
 fourth and fifth columns are worked out from the formulae

   Suppose it were now required to wind the iron core so as
to obtain 2400 ampere-turns when the armature was distant
 9-52 millim. from the poles, using 50 volts and the same
frequency as before.
   Taking the equation (5) we obtain :

were wound upon the core. The current found, under the
above conditions, to flow through the coil was 14'9 amperes,
as measured by a Siemens's electrodynamometer. This shows
that the coil produced 2430 ampere-turns, the error being
well within what may be expected when using commercial
measuring-instruments.

   6. An advantage of the alternate-cnrrent electromagnet is
the greater constancy in the pull which it exerts over a given
range. If supplied at constant voltage a fairly constant pull
on tne armature can be obtained over a considerable range.
The reaction set up by the core tends to set up a back-electro
motive force the limiting value of which is equal to the
impressed voltage. If the resistance of the coil were actually
zero and the magnetic leakage also negligible, this limiting
value would be attained. Now suppose that when acting
upon its armature at a distance the self-inductive reaction
chokes the current down to a certain value, the magnetization
of the core going round cycles between definite maxima.
Suppose the core to be drawn in nearer to the pole, the
reluctance of the magnetic circuit is lessened, and fewer
ampere-turns will suffice to produce an equal magnetization ;
but because the reluctance is lessened the coefficient of self-
induction is correspondingly increased, and the current choked
in corresponding proportion. These two effects counter
balance one another, the magnetization going round cycles of
practically the same amplitude as before. Hence the pull
will be practically unchanged, save in so far as any change
in the magnetic leakage at the different positions of the
armature comes in to affect the question by weakening the
 field between the pole-faces and the armature. Were the
 pole-faces made relatively large so as to obviate the tendency

    It is, however, doubtful, since the magnetic circuit contains
 two joints, whether so high a value as 2000 can be expected
in ordinary work for /*. In that case the coefficient 141 will
be lower. With the electromagnet described above, at a fre
quency n = 93, and with'the armature in contact, the coefficient
was 0-6 instead of 1*41. This is tantamount to saying that
the working permeability was only 850. As so arranged, L
being 0'044, the inductance ph was 25*26 ohms, and R was
0"15 ohm. The alternate voltage ratio was therefore about 170.
    As the armature was removed from proximity to the poles
the self-induction, and therefore the impedance, fell, making
 the voltage ratio for equal currents lower. When the armature
was at 3'17 millim. the voltage ratio fell to 34, and at 9*52
millim. to 21-5.
    It was stated above that in ordinary cases the ratio pL/R
might be taken instead of the more complete expression of
equation (6) . If it is desired to obtain a nearer approxima
tion to ^W-i-p2U/R than is afforded by simply neglecting
 the R under the square-root sign, we may take the value

 which, by reference to the preceding numerical instances,
 shows that the correcting term is really negligible, being in
 the first case, where jsL/R was 170, only ^4^, and in the
 last case, where pL/R was 21*5, only £%, less than J of 1 per
cent.
   8. [Added April 27//i.] — Lastly, a very simple expression can
 be found for the number of windings, in terms of any desired
mean value of the magnetic flux N in the iron. For if the
 iron of cross-section A is subjected to cycles of magnetization
 in which the mean value of the permeation is B, the mean
flux is N = AB, and if the frequency be n periods per second,
the self-induced electromotive force in W windings surround
ing the iron will be equal to 27raWN-f-108 volts. If, then,
the resistance is negligibly small, this maj' be equated to Y,
the mean volts of supply, whence we obtain at once

            LVII. The Second Law of Thermodynamics.
                   By S. H. Bubbury, F.R.S.*
IN a statistical system of molecules let T be the mean
      kinetic energy, and t'j . . . vT certain " controllable " co
ordinates, according to the notation used by Messrs. Larmor
and Bryan in tbeir Beport on Thermodynamics. Let BQ be
the energy that must be supplied, or spent in external work,
when T becomes T + dT, and i\ becomes t'l + brj, &c. The
object of this paper is to find the most general condition
that will make -™- a complete differential of a function, of
T, vl . . . vr. It will be found to be the same condition which
is necessary to make the motion stationary with T, p2            rr
constant.
   1. Let the state and position of a molecule be defined by
the n generalized coordinates xx . . . xn with corresponding
velocities, and the r controllable coordinates »,         »>. It is
assumed that the p's vary so slowly that their velocities may
be neglected, but their components of momentum shall be
Vj . . . v r. Let U be the potential, t the kinetic energy of a
molecule, E=sU + t.
   2. Let us assume provisionally that if the molecule be
started from any position with any velocities, i>i...t>, being
maintained constant, its motion will be periodic ; and there-
                             dV
fore on average of time -3- = 0 for each v.
   3. Generally, if only the conservative forces act, t>i . . . rr
will vary. We must then apply external constraining forces
Px . . . Br to prevent t'x       vr from increasing.

   4. For any given constant values of vt . . . vT we may have
many different motions of the molecule, all of this character,
but with different values of t, the mean kinetic energy. So
with the same t we may have different values of rt . . . vr. If
we wish to make the system pass from an original motion, in

     5. Now let there be a great number, N, of such molecules,
 all with the same values of Vy . . . vn but different values of t
 and E. According to the provisional assumption above made,
 the N molecules are describing periodic motions with different
 periods, and with an infinite variety of phases. Owing to
                           dV
this variety of phases -y- = 0 for each V, not only on average
of the time, but on average at any instant of all the molecules
describing a given orbit. And if the whole motion be sta
tionary, this property may hold even though the motions of
individual molecules be not strictly periodic. We may then
replace the provisional assumption, that each molecule is in
                                                 dV
periodic motion, by the assumption that -=- =0 for each v.
    6. Let N/"(*i . . . xn) dxi . . . dxn, or, shortly, N/tfo", be the
number of molecules whose coordinates at any instant lie
between the limits
                       Xi and Xx + djCy,^

Then fdo~ is the chance that any given molecule at any instant
shall belong to that class.
    Similarly let f(xi . . . xH)dxi . . . dxn, or, shortly, fdoJ, be
the chance that for a given molecule at any instant the velo
cities shall he between the limits

to both class A and class B is ffdodoJ, or, as we will

   8. We may now suppose vx. . .vr to vary in any manner
for all the molecules simultaneously. Further we may, with
or without variation of t^ . . . vT, make T vary. Now t is a
quadratic function of ij . . . .r„, with coefficients which may
be functions of vx . . . vr as well as of xx . . . xn. And there

vary. But if v\. : . vr be constant, T can only vary by the
variation of F. We might suppose F a function of a variable

    13. But these are the same conditions which make the
 motion stationary with T, »x . . . vr constant. This has been satis
 factorily proved for the case where the mutual action between
 the molecules is restricted to " binary encounters." (Watson's
 Kinetic Theory of Gases, second edition, p. 36.^
    In the January number of this Magazine I have endeavoured
 to show that the same form of F gives stationary motion if
 we remove this restriction on mutual action.
    14. If tho necessity for making —¦ a complete differential
 can be established as a substantive law by independent evi
 dence, the above investigation affords an independent proof
 of the distribution
 for such a system as above described, and that whether the
 mutual action is restricted to binary encounters or not.
    15. I have assumed that the continued products of differen
 tials dcr and da do not vary. If they do vary, that is in effect
 if the limits of integration vary, the assumption F=^f—j T\
 will still make ^ a complete differential.

 Man ; the Primeval Savage : his Haunts and Relics, from the Hill
    tops of Bedfordshire to Blachwall. By Wortiungton G. Smith,
    4'c. Pages i-xvi and 1-349, with 242 Illustrations by the
    Author. 8vo. Stanford : London, 1894.
'T^HE author of this interesting book makes a praiseworthy
 -1- attempt to popularize the subject of Early Man, from a strictly
scientific point of view, .with the evidences of his existence, his
modes of life, and his surroundings, in this part of the world at
least. Mr. W. Q. Smith has done much in judiciously searching
for, and happily finding, tangible proofs of Man having occupied
certain sites now buried beneath various deposits that have been
left by lakes and rivers during repeated superficial changes of the
land. Here some geological knowledge aids him ; and, as an
archaeologist with a good eye for the recognition of differences
between relatively old and new implements of flint, and of the
chips and blocks left in places during their manufacture, he tries
to piece together the broken history of Early Man once occupying
parts of Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, Middlesex, and Essex.
    Ereely using the results of similar observations made by others
at various places, and recognizing the value set by anatomists on
certain human bones as indicative of special races,—and by
palaeontologists on the particular characters of the more frequent
 bones of the lower animals found in gravels and other deposits of
 Quaternary age, Mr. Smith has thus added greatly to his former
contributions to the Anthropological and other Societies.
    In the first two Chapters he briefly treats of Primeval Man as
 known by his implements of stone, found in caves, gravels, and
 elsewhere, and by the rarely associated fragments of human skulls
 and skeletons, the more frequent bones of animals, and remains of
 plants ; and by the comparison of the bones of some of the lowest
 races of mankind with those of the anthropoid apes. The probable
 ways and habits of the early savages, and their surroundings, are
 presented in picturesque descriptions by the pen and pencil of
 modern civilization forced to a. knowledge the barbarous and dis
 gusting habits of our probably cannibal progenitors. " Man at
 that time was not a degraded animal, for he had never been higher ;
 he was therefore an exalted animal ; and, low as we esteem him
 now, he yet represented the highest stage of development of the
 animal kingdom of his time " (page 59).
     Of the primeval folk of England we have set before us by the
 artistic author four pictures. One of them (on the cover) is a
 woman sitting on a dead and broken tree-trunk, with her hair
 turned up in Egyptian style, and in " full dress," consisting of a
 waist-strap supporting a stone hache ; and a club lies handy. The
 face of this savage is almost manly, perhaps tatooed at the corners
 of the mouth, if not moustached ; and the ear is strongly pointed ;
 a feature which still survives at Dunstable, according to page 51

 580                   Notices respecting New Boohs.
and its woodcut. On the title-page a man and his two wives,
 with an infant-girl, make a fallen tree their resting-place by
the water-side. They are destitute of even skins for raiment,
and have no apparent belongings except a club near one woman,
and a stone-weapon strapped to the waist of the other. Their
luxuriant hair, carefully parted or otherwise arranged, barely
hides their sharp-pointed ears ; tatoo-marks seem to add width
to the female mouths, whilst the man has a moustache. They
are all looking earnestly in one direction (towards us, as if to be
 photographed), waiting for something or somebody.
    The chief interest of the book is connected with the district
 round about Caddington, a village 30 miles north of London,
 3 miles south-east of Dunstable, and 2 miles south-west of Luton.
 Here Mr. W. Q-. Smith has discovered very many man-made
 weapons and tools of flint, of very great antiquity, on the highest
 hill-tops of the Chalk, which are capped with stony clays, gravels,
 and brickearths. These deposits are described briefly at page 70,
 and in more detail, with carefully drawn sections, in subsequent
 pages. Flint implements occur in the upper clays and gravels,
 which are much distorted, and here and there pushed down, as it
 were, in violent curvatures, into the underlying brickearth. The
 last-mentioned deposit is about 50 feet thick in some places ; and
 Mr. Smith found in it, at some 10 or 12 feet from the surface of
 the ground, one or more levels distinguished by small heaps of
 flints, artificially accumulated in some olden time ; and he observed
 that, both among them and on the intervening spaces, many of the
 flints had been broken and "dressed,'" or shaped for use. He
 succeeded in fitting together hundreds of the flakes and pieces that
 had been disregarded and thrown aside by the primeval artificers
 of stone tools and weapons.
    Carefully following out the indications of this tool-making area,
 Mr. Smith traces it, by sections, through Caddington Hill (page 64),
 as having been a part of an old land-surface, bearing oue or more
 lakes or pools along a marshy valley ; and on the valley-sides, near
the water, the flint-folk must have lived and worked, leaving their
refuse to mark what is termed a " paleolithic floor," because the
tools have certain shapes, regarded as characteristic of the older-
stone-age implements, or " palffioliths."
    In the " upper red clay drift " of the brick-pits, smaller, more
roughly shaped, ochreous or chocolate-coloured implements are
met with ; and these, evidently deposited long after the working-
floor, or lake-side living-place, was covered up, were probably
derived by the natural agency of water descending from neigh
bouring hills, and bringing with it the washings of some local
ochreous capping, possibly very much older than any of the valley-
   After describing these more or less stratified materials, and
endeavouring to explain the conditions under which they were
formed and modified,—and giving particulars of his long examina
tion of the sections, and his persistent search for the actual pits

and strata in which the several forms were obtained,—the author
attempts some observations about the fashions and the relative age
of flint implements, but they have neither any special importance
nor novelty.
   The latter part of the book describes some of the relics of
primeval man as found on the banks of the Lea, from its source
near Dunstable, in Bedfordshire, to London ; with a description of
the already known primeval living-place or " palaeolithic floor at
Stoke-Newington, London.

   It is evident, and indeed partly stated, that Chapters XIII. to
XVIII. consist of renewals and reprints of earlier notes and
memoirs by the author and others, published in the Journ. Anthro
pological Institute, Proceed. Geologists' Association, Quart. Journ.

Field-Club, 'Ancient Stone Implements of Great Britain,' 'Archaeo-
logia Cambrensis,' &c. In such a compilation, however, the refer
ences to papers by fellow-workers should be complete, and careful
acknowledgement of all sources of information should be made in
every case, so that the reader should distinguish what is not, from
what is original, in the book before him.
   The printing and paper are good. " All the Illustrations are
original or taken from original sources." They have been admi
rably drawn (some after photographs) and reproduced on wood or
otherwise, by the Artist-engraver, Mr. W. G. Smith, himself.
The " archaeological map of the Caddington and Dunstable district "
clearly defines the topography of the author's discoveries; and
another map shows a part of the north-eastern neighbourhood of
London. The numerous illustrations comprise skulls, bones, stone
tools and flakes, sections, local views, a few shells and fossils, and
four neat and expressive ideal portraitures of the aborigines. We

 are sorry that two of these clever pre-Kaphaelistic pictures are not
 lodged in the text; one is on the title-page, and one indeed is
 seen only gilded on the cover.
    Altogether, this interesting work, partly descriptive of a new set
 of discoveries, and partly a compilation of more or less relative
 matter, is calculated to incite a taste for seriously hunting up the
 history of Primeval Man ; and, by showing how and where the
 study may be practically followed, it will satisfy, to some extent,
 many enquiring minds, putting them on the right lines for investi
 gation, and affording some clues to other and more i*nportaut
 systematic works on archaic anthropology.

  ON THK MAGNETIZATION OF IRON AND NICKEL WIKB BY RAPID
       ELECTRICAL OSCILLATIONS.        BY PROF. I. KLEMENCIC.
 T> Y the aid of the formulae of Lord Eayleigh and Stefan the author
 -'-' endeavoured to determine the strength of magnetization, or,
 in other words, the value of ft, from the disengagement of lieat
 which occurs in a magnetizable wire when electrical vibrations are
passed through (number of vibrations about 9 x 107). The deve
lopment of heat was measured by means of a delicate thermo
element near the wire under experiment, and was each time
compared with the disengagement of heat in a non-magnetized
wire. Observation gave the following values for ft : —soft iron,
118; steel (piano wire), soft 106, hard 115; BessemeV steel, soft
77, hard 74 ; nickel, 29.       These values agree well with those
which Baur and Lord Eayleigh found for very feeble magnetic
forces. As the experiments of these observers teach, the per
meability is a constant magnitude up to certain values of the
magnetizing force while it thus rapidly increases. The present
observations show that in these experiments ft varies within a
certain range. This fact can be explained either by assuming that
the magnetizing forces used here are very feeble, and of the order
of magnitude of those strengths of field in which ft is really con
stant ; or by assuming that we are dealing with much greater
magnetizing forces, but that the magnetization cannot follow the
rapid change so quickly as to reach that part of the curve of mag
netization which corresponds to the variable and far greater values
of ft. An approximate estimation of the field-strengths under
consideration shows that at any rate on the surface of the wire
and at the beginning of the oscillations we have magnetizing forces
which are several hundred times as grent as that limit within
which ft is constant. There would accordingly in this case be a
retardation of the magnetization, which, however, must not be
confounded with hysteresis. It must in this be assumed that the
results of Baur and of Lord Eayleigh which refer to longitudinal
magnetization are also applicable to circular magnetization.
    Within the limits of the constant ft there is no remanent mag
netism ; the magnetization in this region is similar to the deforma
tion of a body within the limits of elasticity, while the further stages

of magnetization are to be compared with permanent deformations ;
an analogy which Maxwell had already pointed out. That part of
the magnetization which can be applied technically is in the region
corresponding to the permanent deformations. It is very probable,
and the assumption is confirmed by experiment, that the magneti
zation in very rapid changes of field does not attain this region,
while the molecules within the region of the constant p can follow
far more rapid oscillations than those here used. Further experi
ments, which will perhaps best be made by discharges of condensers,
must decide this point.— Wiener Berichte, March 1, 1894.

the highest value of the inductance is about 180 henries, corre
sponding to a " time-ratio " of 180/2-4=75 seconds; the mean
values are of course less. Ballistic measurements are none the
less out of the question.
    When provided with flat pole-pieces the apparatus represents
the simplest possible type of magnetic circuit, and is therefore
 well suited for an experimental verification of its laws. By a
 special method, which is described in extenso, the author was
 able to verify his form of the theory of magnetic circuits (Phil.
 Mag. Nov. 1890 ; Wied. Ann. xlvi. p. 491, 1892) with sufficient
 approximation. The leakage was roughly determined by a com
 pass ; its absolute amount was found to reach a maximum for a
 comparatively low magnetizing current, and to diminish consider
 ably as the current was increased. This final decrease of leakage,
 which of course is more marked still when referred to unit flux
 of induction through the circuit, was previously found with a
 smaller ring by H. Lehmann (Phil. Mag. April 1893) and discussed
 by the author ('The Electrician,' xxix. p. 450, 1892). It was
 explained how this simple fact constitutes an " experimentum
 crucis" against the fallacy of assuming—arguing from analogy
 with a voltaic battery immersed in an electrolyte—that leakage
 must always increase when saturation is being approached. It
 was also found that leakage is considerably diminished by the
 ampere-turns near upon the air-gap : the " pole-coils " producing
 them fulfil the useful function of keeping the flux of induction
 together, thus preventing the lines from spreading.
    The principal object of the apparatus is the production of strong
 fields by concentrating this flux through properly shaped pole-
 pieces. A theory of the latter was developed almost simultane
 ously (1888) by Stefan and Ewirig and Low, in which the

  584            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
  assumption of absolute saturation is made. As this condition can
   never be fulfilled in practice, the author redetermined the best
  shape for the poles in an empirical way. It was found—in good
  agreement with Prof. Ewing's prediction—that it is best to take
  a straight truncated cone of semi-vertical angle 60° (instead of the
  theoretical 54° 44'). The field obtainable in air with such pole-
  pieces falls short of the theoretical value by several thousand units ;
  however, it beats the previous record (about 30,000 C.G.S.) by a
  considerable amount. It was found —
                  For a = 5 mm. ; H = 36,800 C. G. S.
                    „ a = 3 mm. ; H = 38,000          „
  where a denotes the diameter of the small truncated faces.
     To give an idea of this field the author points out that a bit of
  good thin iron wire would easily get saturated up to 1 = 1750,
  corresponding to an induction
                B = 38,000 + 4 ttx 1750 = 60,000 C.G.S.
     This corresponds to a tension of Ba/8r dynes per cm.8, or 144
  Kg-weight per cm,' A concentrated aqueous solution of ferric
 chloride in a U-tube (Quincke) would be lifted about half a metre;
 finally, the resistance of a bismuth spiral would be nearly trebled
 in the field.
     The author concludes that it is possible to obtain fields of, say,
 40,000 C.G.S. with ring-electromagnets of reasonable size ; but
 that stronger fields can probably only be reached by means out of
 all proportion with the purpose in view.—Wiedemann's Annahn,
 li. p. 537 (1894).
              ON THE THERMAL BEHAVIOUR OF LIQUIDS.
              To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine.
 Gentlemen,
       The last number of your Journal contains a paper by Messrs.
 Bamsay and Young, to which it would not be necessary to reply
 if all your readers were familiar with the investigations on the
 thermal behaviour of liquids. But as this cannot be assumed to
 be the case, I am for the sake of my scientific reputation compelled
to reply.
    Messrs. Bamsay and Toung reproach me with an error of obser
vation of about 50° in the determinations of the critical point ; as
these authors well know, it would be impossible even for the most
inexperienced to make so serious a mistake. The liquid I used
had really the critical temperature stated, but I was in error in
relying upon the statement of the chemist who supplied me, that
the products were pure.
    The error is acknowledged by myself in the book 1 published,
and the critical temperatures I found are no longer given. But it
is too much to assume that a physicist who once in a way had the
misfortune to work with a mixture instead of a pure substance,
has become incapable of making a correct observation.
