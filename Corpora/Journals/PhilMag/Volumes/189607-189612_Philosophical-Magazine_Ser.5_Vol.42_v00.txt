§ 1. IN order to obtain a full knowledge of the thermo—
            dynamic properties of a homogeneous gaseous sub
stance it is indispensable to perform upon it a twofold experi
mental investigation: besides its thermometric and dynamic
behaviour the calorimetric properties ought to be studied
independently.     It is known that, in order to solve the <U+FB01>rst
part of the problem, it is sufficient to test the thermal expan
sion of the gas under different pressures and its compressibility
at one temperature—0r conversely, the compressibility at
different temperatures, together with the expansion under a
single pressure. This part of the problem I worked out
ex erimentally four years ago; the results have been pub
lished in the 23rd volume of the Rozprawy. In the present
paper I intend to supplement these investigations by the
second, calorimetrio part.
   In this respect we may make use of the general laws of

thermodynamics. It follows that, in order to disclose the
whole of the ealorimetric properties of a homogeneous <U+FB02>uid,
it is suf<U+FB01>cient to investigate experimentally the speci<U+FB01>c heat,
in its dependence on temperature, under a single constant
pressure, together with its compressibility and thermal ex
panswn.
    § 2. Any state of thermodynamic equilibrium of the gas
may be de<U+FB01>ned by means of two independent variables, for
instance by its pressure p, and temperature 0 (=t on the
absolute thermodynamic scale). Consider an in<U+FB01>nitely small
change of state, corresponding to the increments dp and dt
of the variables ; then the gas does a quantity of work,
                             2;       v
                    dL =19 % dt—l-p      dp ;
and absorbs a quantity of heat,
                      dQ=mcp dt + l dp.
We denote by m the mass of the fluid, by 0,, its speci<U+FB01>c heat
under the constant pressure p, by la certain kind of latent
heat ; the last two quantities are to be considered as variables,
depending on p and t.

    It follows from these equations, that the variations of the

 speci<U+FB01>c heats, as well as their difference, can be deduced from
 the fundamental equation of the body, viz. v = F(p, t).
 Although we do not possess a suf<U+FB01>ciently accurate general
 expression for the volume of atmospheric air in terms of the
 pressure and temperature, yet some inferences as to the
 thermodynamic behaviour of that body at different tempera
 tures, down to the critical, and under different pressures, may
 be drawn from the numerical data which have been given in
 the <U+FB01>rst part of the present paper, both in tabular and in
 graphical form. These results can be obtained by means of
 the graphical calculus.         It is true that results arrived at in
 this manner cannot be as accurate and convincing as those
 obtained by direct experiment. Still I thought them worthy
 of attention, the more so as direct calorimetric measurements at
 very low temperatures would be attended by serious dif<U+FB01>culties.
 Another reason which induced me to try the indirect method
 was the desire to learn something more about the speci<U+FB01>c
 heat of gases, which has been investigated usually only within
 very restricted limits of temperature and pressure. Besides
 the important work of Prof. Joly‘, the object of which was
 to determine the effects of increased pressure and temperature
 on the speci<U+FB01>c heat at constant volume, I have to notice a
 memoir by M. Margules-l- on the variations of the speci<U+FB01>c
 heat of carbon dioxide, determined by calculations based on
 Andrews’s and Amagat’s experiments.
     §3. Integrating (1) along the isothermal t, between the
 limits of 1 and p atmospheres we obtain

 If we assume the thermal expansion to be known, this equa_
 tion (Rankine’s) may be used to calculate the values of 0,,
 corresponding to ditl'erent states of the gas.
     First of all, however, it is necessary to inquire how far the
 quantity c,-—a constant of integration with respect to
 depends on the temperature ; cl denotes evidently the speci<U+FB01>c
 heat under the constant pressure of one atmosphere, at the
absolute temperature t.
     In order not to depart from the notation adopted in the
<U+FB01>rst part, I shall denote by p the pressure expressed in atmo
spheres. The mass m of the gas may be chosen so as to have
v=1 cubic centim. at the temperature of melting ice, under

     § 4. It has been already remarked that the investigation
 ought to bear in the <U+FB01>rst place on the quantity 0,. The
 speci<U+FB01>c heat of atmospheric air under constant pressure has
 been repeatedly measured. In the <U+FB01>rst rank there stands
 the fundamental work of Regnault"; fourteen years later
 these experiments were repeated by E.VViedemann1-, with
 the help of a simpler form of apparatus. Regnault’s experi
ments cover a range of temperature from +200° to —31°;
 air of ordinary density was tried, as well as condensed air,
 up to 12 atmospheres. Notwithstanding these relatively
extended limits Regnault was not able to discover any marked
variation of the quantity cp; hence there arose the very
general belief, that the speci<U+FB01>c heat of air is a constant, inde
pendent of pressure and temperature—an opinion which, as
will be seen further on, is very far from being correct.
Wiedemann’s experiments, so far as air is concerned, were
intended to control Regnault’s value of the speci<U+FB01>c heat.
The results obtained by the two investigators are only in
approximate agreement. According to Regnault the most
probable value of the speci<U+FB01>c heat 01 between 0° and + 100°
is 023741; this is the mean value of single determinations
varying between the limits 0'23536 and 023890.
     Wiedemann’s result is 02389, the limits of single determi- -
nations being 02374 and 0‘2414. Although the principal
aim of my own experiments was to <U+FB01>nd the variations of the
specific heat of air through as wide a range of temperatures
as possible, yet I thought it worth while to redetermine once
more the exact value of this important constant ; this seemed

  the more desirable, as the thermometric scale is now better
  de<U+FB01>ned, thanks to the investigations of the International
  Bureau of Weights and Measures—and some light has also
  been thrown on the variations of the speci<U+FB01>c heat of water.
  I may mention now that my result, as regards the speci<U+FB01>c
  heat of air, is nearly identical with that of Begnault.
     To detect any variations in the speci<U+FB01>c heat of air at atmo
  spheric pressure it was desirable to enlarge the limits of the
  experiments on the side of low temperatures, because on the
  ground of Regnault’s work we may be sure that at high
  temperatures such variations do not manifest themselves; in
  this r‘pspect I have been able to reach the temperature of
 —l70 .
     § 5. In order to adapt the well-known apparatus employed
 usually to determine the speci<U+FB01>c heat of gases to the particular
 problem of low-temperature calorimetry it was necessary to
 to modify it in several respects. I wished also to make it
 more reliable, so as to lessen as far as possible the limits of
 experimental errors, because of the smallness of the expected
 variations in the speci<U+FB01>c heat.
    In studying Begnault’s memoir on the speci<U+FB01>c heat of
 gases, one comes to the conclusion that the chief cause of
 error in determinations of this kind is to be sought in the
uncertainty as regards the true temperature of the gas at the
moment when it enters the calorimeter, i. e. the cooler im
 mersed in it. The in<U+FB02>uence of this cause of error manifests
itself clearly by the fact that the calculated value of the
speci<U+FB01>c heat depends in a marked degree on the velocity with
which the gas-stream is made to pass through the apparatus :
on increasing this velocity the result tends towards a maximum
value. It is known that Regnault considered only those de
terminations as valid which corresponded to this maximum.
    In my own experiments I used at <U+FB01>rst an apparatus similar
to that of E. Wiedemann (l. 0.). I soon became convinced
that in order to do away with the uncertainty as to the initial
temperature of the gas, and at the same time to diminish as
far as possible the direct in<U+FB02>ux of heat (or cold) from the
heating apparatus into the calorimeter, it was indispensable
to improve the mode of connexion of these two parts. The
following conditions were to be kept in view in devising this
most important part of the apparatus :—(1) The connecting
piece ought to be perfectly air-tight, and at the same time a
bad conductor of heat ; (2) it ought to transfer the gas from
the heater into the calorimeter with the least possible loss of
heat ; (3) some thermometric arrangement ought to be intro
duced in it in order to measure directly the temperature of
the gas-stream where it enters the calorimeter.

6                    A. W. Witkowski on the
   It is known that the determination of the temperature of
a gas is attended by some dif<U+FB01>culty. Owing to the great
diathermancy of these bodies, a thermometer introduced in a.
gas tends to show rather the temperature of the surrounding
bodies than of the gas itself. To get over this dif<U+FB01>culty
resolved to apply a mode of temperature-measurement which
has proved successful in meteorological observations, and is
perhaps best known in its application in Assmann’s aspirating
thermometer. The thermometer .is placed inside a polished
metal tube, through which a brisk current of air is made to
pass. It has been found that under such conditions the tempe
 rature indicated is nearly independent of the temperature of the
tube. After several trials I constructed upon this principle
the connexion between the heater and the calorimeter ; it will
 be described fully in § 7. The only thermometric apparatus
which could be applied under the given conditions was the
thermo-electric couple. The mode of experimenting was
such that, instead of measuring the initial temperature of the
gas, 1 determined with the aid of the couple only the small
loss of temperature experienced by the gas during its passage
from the heater into the calorimeter. For this purpose one
of the solderings of the couple was placed in the gas-stream,
just inside the calorimeter, the other in the heater, or in
a separate thermostat of known temperature. This second
soldering was always in contact with the bulb of a hydrogen
thermometer, in order to reduce <U+FB01>nally the observed tempe
ratures to a de<U+FB01>nite scale.
   § 6. Another modi<U+FB01>cation concerned the determination of
the mass of air used in every calorimetric experiment.
Usually the quantity of gas has been determined by previous
experimenters in an indirect way. E. Wiedemann, following
Delaroche and Bérard, measured the volume of water which
replaced the gas, contained initially in a bladder or indiu
rnbber bag. Regnault used a spacious receiver <U+FB01>lled with
compressed gas, and observed the fall of pressure occasioned
by the using up of gas in every experiment. The volume of
the receiver and its temperature being known, the mass could
be calculated on the basis of the law of compressibility, which
Regnault determined himself expressly for that purpose. I
have found it more convenient and accurate to measure the
mass of air by direct weighing.           Accordingly a large
reservoir (about ten litres capacity) was <U+FB01>lled with pure
compressed air at a pressure of 80—100 atmospheres: this
was ample enough to provide the gas for some dozen of
calorimetric determinations. From this store I <U+FB01>lled small
metal <U+FB02>asks (capacities 136, 220, 208‘ cubic centim.), as

                 Thermodynamic Properties of Air.                      7
represented in <U+FB01>g. 1, provided with screw stopcocks.              These
were weighed on a large chemical ba-                     Fig. 1.
lance carrying some 1500 grammes.
By gradually opening the stopcocks the
<U+FB02>asks yielded during the calorimelric
experiment a perfectly uniform current
of air. They were then again weighed,
whence, by applying the usual correc
tions, the mass of gas passed through the
calorimeter could be accurately calcu
lated. 1n the three <U+FB02>asks used it was easy
to store up some 50 or 60 litres of gas.
The tightness of the <U+FB02>asks and stop
cocks was controlled by the weigh
ings themselves; even a small leakage
renders     an    accurate weighing im
possible“.
   The mode of preparing and compres
sing the air was exactly the same as
described in Part 1., § 5.
    § 7. I shall now describe the calori
metric apparatus, namely that form of it
which I usedin the low-temperature work.
In my <U+FB01>rst experiments I constructed
a calorimeter on the lines of that of
Reguault and Wiedemaun; the cooler,
i. e. the system of metallic tubes destined to transmit heat
from the gas to the water, was attached'to the calorimetrio
vessel by solder, while the exit-tube of the heater was intro
 duced near the bottom of the vessel and <U+FB01>xed there by means
 of a cork. This arrangement proved inconvenient, and more
 over it rendered difficult the intended measurement of the
 initial temperature of the gas. Accordingly I modi<U+FB01>ed the
 apparatus in such a manner as to make the heater entirely
 independent of the calorimeter proper. In <U+FB01>g. 2 (reduced
 in the ratio 2% :1) DPR’R represents the heater (I shall
 continue to call it so, although, when used at low tempera
 tures, it acts really as a cooler) ; S the cooler ; both are <U+FB01>xed
 to a separate support E, which stands on a heavy base E’.
 This part of the apparatus may thus be used in conjunction
 with di<U+FB02>'crent calorimetric vessels.
   * I think that the method described here, of weighing gases in a com
 pressed condition, could be advantageously employ ed in accurate deter
 minations of the density of some gases under atmospheric pressure. For
 that purpose the weighed <U+FB02>asks ought to be disc arged into an empty
receiver of known capacity and temperature, provided with a mercury
 manometer.

              Thermodynamic Properties of Air.                9
   The calorimeter K—a vessel of thin sheet silver, capacity
about 250 cub. centims., weight 98'310 grammes—rests on
three pointed glass feet inside a double-walled brass enclosure
Z, protected on the outside by sheets of paper and cotton
wool ; the space between the walls is <U+FB01>lled with water.
Through several openings in the deuble sheet-brass cover of
the enclosure there are introduced into the calorimeter :—
(1) the cooler S, (2) the stirrer M, the oscillations of which
are maintained by a heavy pendulum (not shown), (3) the
thermometer T.
   The thermometer T, an excellent instrument furnished by
G. Fontaine of Paris, was divided in 0'02 degr. (from —0°'5
to +0°'6 and +ll°'.") to +22° 3). It has been standardized
with reference to the hydrogen scale by the Central Of<U+FB01>ce of
Weights and Measures at Vienna. The corrections proved
so insigni<U+FB01>cant that it was possible to omit them altogether.
Weight of glass and mercury was determined by the maker.
it represents a small electromagnetic hammer, destined to
shake the thermometer T, in order to prevent any lagging of
mercury. t and t' are two auxiliary thermometers by means
of which the temperature of the stem of the rincipal ther
mometer was determined in order to obtain t e well-known
thermometric correction.
   The heater was constructed as follows :—A copper tube P,
one metre in length, internal diameter =2 millim., external
diameter :4 millim., is coiled round a vertical brass tube
D F, <U+FB01>xed along the axis of the heater. The outer end of the
copper tube is joined by means of a thick-walled indiarubber
tube with a T-shaped piece. One of its ends P’ is connected
 with the <U+FB02>asks <U+FB01>lled with compressed air, the other N with an
open mercury manometer, which serves to control the velocity
and steadiness of the current of air. The inner end of the
copper spiral is connected by solder with the brass tube D F,
near its lower end, where a small hole (u, <U+FB01>g. 2a) is provided,
through which the air cooled in the spiral passes into the
brass tube, and thence through the connecting piece C into
the cooler S. The connexion consists of a thin-walled glass
tube C, some 25 millims. in total length, its upper end bein
cemented by means of isinglass into the brass tube D F, the
lower end into the cooler S by sealing-wax. The glass tube
serves only to provide an air-tight connexion and to protect
against external heat the inner tube 8, which is the real
delivering tube of the gas. The last-mentioned tube s is made
of very thin highly-polished sheet silver; it is soldered to

 10                  A. W. Witkowski on the
 a silver collar r, <U+FB01>xed tightly in the brass tube DF, just
 above the end of the glass tube C.
    In the axis of a, some 3 or 4 millims. from its month,
 there is <U+FB01>xed one of the solderings B of the thermo-electric
 couple, composed of very thin wires of copper and nickel.
 The wires pass freely through the brass tube D F ; near its
upper end they are cemented by shellac into a capillary glass
tube, the end of which can be seen in <U+FB01>g. 2, protruding over
the end of D F. The capillary is <U+FB01>xed here by a cork,
tightened by means of marine glue. In order to protect the
cement against the cold the end F of the brass tube is dipped
in water contained in a small glass beaker (indicated'by dotted
lines). One of the wires of the couple (copper) leads to the
galvanometer G, the other to the heater, where the second
soldering A is in contact with the bulb “7 of the hydrogen
thermometer.
   This construction of the connecting piece was devised
in agreement with the remarks of § 5. The silver tube 8,
being a good conductor of heat, assumes a temperature which
differs very little from that of the heater; the gas is thus
conducted into the cooler through a channel of nearly its own
temperature. At the same time the polished silver tube is a
bad radiator, and therefore it prevents effectually any inter
change of' heat between the heater and the cooler, with the
exception of that due to the air current.
   Secondly, the silver tube 5 forms part of' the thermometric
arrangement, constructed upon the principle of aspiration.
The air passes through the relatively narrow channel 8 with
a suf<U+FB01>ciently great velocity, and it communicates its tempera
ture very quickly to the soldering B of the couple. In
order to shield the soldering against the radiation of the
cooler S, the temperature of which is generally very different
from that of the gas, it is advisable to place the soldering at
some distance from the mouth of .9, so as to reduce as far as
possible the cone of rays passing from B to S.    This radiation
is also intercepted by a small silver bridge, put across the
mouth of the tube a, which serves at the same time to keep in
place the soldering B, which is tied to it by a bit of cocoon
<U+FB01>bre.
   The cooler S is made entirely of silver ; it is quite similar
to that employed by E. Wiedemann in his researches on the
speci<U+FB01>c heat of gases. Four vertical silver tubes are connected
by short pieces of silver tubing, alternately near their upper
and lower ends. They are filled with compressed silver

               Thermodynamic Properties of Air.                11
turnings (<U+FB01>ne silver thread-tape) ; the whole weighs 30'024
grammes. I have found that this number of tubes is more
than suf<U+FB01>cient to allow perfect equalization of temperatures
of the as and the water.
   The Treater is placed vertically along the axis of a rather
wide glass tube R’, which acts as a receiver of the freezing
mixtures. Near its lower end it is contracted into a narrow
neck, in which the end D of the axial brass tube is <U+FB01>tted
tightly by means of an indiarubber ring. Another glass
cylinder R of larger diameter surrounds the vessel R’; its
bottom a consists of a varnished cork, in a perforation of
which the neck of R’ is <U+FB01>tted. The glass cylinder and the
cork act as insulators against heat.
    When liquid oxygen was to be applied as frigori<U+FB01>c medium
 I found it, economic to cool the current of air previously to its
passing into the copper coil P.      For that purpose a small
metallic trough f (indicated by dotted lines) was provided,
which was <U+FB01>lled with a mixture of solid carbon dioxide and
ether.
    In order to determine the speci<U+FB01>c heat of gases at higher
temperatures, for instance at + 100°, the same form of
 apparatus could obviously be used with the glass receiver R'
replaced by some form of steam-heating. In my <U+FB01>rst experi
ments, however, I used a slightly different form (<U+FB01>g. 3).
 The connexion of the brass tube DF with the cooler, the
 thermometric arrangement, &c., are exactly like those in the
 apparatus for low temperatures. Instead of the copper spiral
 the heating of the gas is accomplished, as in Wiedemann’s
 apparatus, in a wide horizontal brass tube P, <U+FB01>lled with copper
 turnings, and soldered at a right-angle to the tube DF.
 Both tubes are placed permanently in a brass trough R, being
 soldered to it. The temperature of +100° was obtained by
 boiling water in the trough, with the use of a small gas
 burner G. The soldering A of the thermo-electric couple
 was heated in a separate steam thermostat. On this occasion
 I found (after having lost much time in search of an error
 in all parts of the apparatus) that the wires of the couple
 leading into the thermostat ought to be very <U+FB01>ne, otherwise
 the soldering would not acquire the temperature of +100°,
 even in a copious current of steam.                               ‘
    § 8. The initial temperature of the gas was determined, as
 already mentioned, by means of a thermo-electric couple
 (copper-nickel) in connexion with a hydrogen thermometer.
 It will be useful to say a few words on the mode of calcula
 tion of the temperature.

Despretz galvanometer, resistance about 145 ohms, the sensi

been tested frequently, also by means of a thermo-electric
couple, at temperatures 0° and + 100°.
   The calibration of the couple was performed as follows :—

It will be remarked that the law of Tait and Avenarius is not
strictly ful<U+FB01>lled, since these numbers do not obey the law
of linear variation.

the other to some higher temperature 3’. Then the electro
motive force will be:—
                  E‘f,’ = sf,” - E? = $'f(§') _ e<U+FB02>e).
If the difference between the temperatures 3 and 3’ is a small
one, as it was in my calorimetric experiments, where 3—5:
corresponded to the small loss of temperature of the gas in
its passage from the heater to the calorimeter, then we may

 temperature at a mean temperature 8. These numbers I have
 used to reduce the galvanometer de<U+FB01>exions observed during
 the calorimetric work, in order to obtain the losses of tem
 perature of the gas.
    § 9. Every one of the calorimetric determinations was
 conducted as follows :—-After weighing the metal <U+FB02>asks <U+FB01>lled
 with compressed air, and testing them for any possible leak
 age, they are connected with the calorimeter. Next the
 calorimetric vessel is charged with water from a small distilled
 water bottle, as used in chemical laboratories, and the weight
 of the charge determined by observing the loss of weight of
 the bottle. Lastly, the heater is filled with the corresponding
 frigori<U+FB01>c medium (carbon dioxide, ethylene, or oxygen), the
 stirrer started, and during a few minutes (10) the following
 temperatures are read at noted times :—temperature of the
 calorimeter, of the two auxiliary thermometers t and t’, of the
 hydrogen thermometer. At the end of the tenth minute a
 <U+FB01>rst assistant starts the current of air, with some determinate
 speed, as registered by the mercury manometer, and tries to
 keep it as steady as possible by handling the screw valves of
 the <U+FB02>asks. At the same time a second assistant begins to
 observe the galvanometer de<U+FB02>exions, noting them at each half
 minute contemporaneously with the readings of the tempera—
 ture of the calorimeter. During these observations the moment
 is noted when, the <U+FB02>asks being emptied, the current ceases
 and the mercury column in the manometer falls down to zero.
 At this time the auxiliary thermometers are read again, as
 well as the hydrogen thermometer. During the next ten
 minutes the rate of cooling or heating of the calorimeter is
 again observed. The experiment closes with the weighing of
 the empty <U+FB02>asks.
    The whole course of a determination and calculation of
 results will be best understood with the help of the following
 example :—
~ Air cooled by liquid ethylene. Weight of air (corrected)
 48'8842 grammes. Weight of water =244'410 grs. Reduced

 current of about 15'3 grs. of air per minute). The following

With the aid of the numbers recorded in the lst and 2nd
columns of the above table a curve is drawn, representing the
variations of temperature of the calorimeter. It is composed
of three nearly straight parts (the regular course of which
serves as a proof that the readincs are free from mistakes) ;
the inclination of the <U+FB01>rst and third branches enables us to
determine the in<U+FB02>uence of external heating or cooling on the
tBmpe-rature of the calorimeter.                   We <U+FB01>nd easily in the present
example :-—

       Mean         ,,   ....... .. 0'0544 ,,            ,,
  This mean value I accept as determining the external cooling
  in<U+FB02>uence during the principal period of the experiment, when
  the gas current is <U+FB02>owing. I have found that this simple
  mode of reckoning gives nearly identical results with the
  more elaborate method of calculating the corresponding cor
  rection which has been proposed by Regnault. It seems,
  moreover, that a more laborious determination of the external
  heating or cooling effect would be useless, on account of the
  following anomaly, which presented itself in a more or less
  marked degree in every experiment :—The transition from
  the rapid fall of temperature, caused by the cold gas-stream,
  to the less marked cooling observable during the <U+FB01>nal period,
  is always preceded by a slight depression of temperature (as
  in the preceding example) ; in experiments at high tempera
  tures the phenomenon is exactly reversed. Undoubtedly
  these anomalous variations of temperature are caused by the
  fact that the direct conduction of heat (or cold) from the
  heater to the calorimeter is slightly modi<U+FB01>ed by the gas
  current itself. This disturbing cause did not escape the
. attention of Regnault- (l. 0. pp. 83, 214), but he did not suc
  ceed either in getting rid of it, or in taking it into account.
  Some uncertainty thus remains in every determination of the
  speci<U+FB01>c heat.
     In the foregoing example I considered the movement of
  heat as <U+FB01>nished at the end of the 14th minute. The initial
  and <U+FB01>nal temperatures of the calorimeter are thus :—20'152
  and 14'523 ; when corrected with regard to the temperatures
  of the stem (t and t’) they are :—20'162 and 14'514, whence
  the total fall of temperature =5‘6-18. From this there is to
  be subtracted the fall of temperature caused by external
  in<U+FB02>uences (0'0544 per minute), the amount of which is :—
  4XO'O544=O'218. Thus we obtain the corrected fall of
  temperature =5°'430.
     As regards the initial temperature of the air, it is equal to
  —103'5U+2'01= —-101°'49, because the mean de<U+FB02>exion
  30'15 millims. on the alvanometer-scale corresponds to a
  gain of 2'01 degrees.           be <U+FB01>nal temperature of the gas is to
  be calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of the tempera
  tures of the calorimeter at the beginning (2016) and at the
  end of the current; the latter we <U+FB01>nd on the temperature

                Thermodynamic Properties of Air.              17
curve, it is 14°94. Therefore <U+FB01>nal temp. =17°'55, total rise
of temperature of the gas =101‘49+17'55=119°'04.
   According to Bartoli and Stracciati the speci<U+FB01>c heat of
water at the temperature of the experiment is 09996, the
sp. heat at +l5° being taken as unity.      Therefore we have
<U+FB01>nally:
        253'829 x 0'9996 x 54:50:01 x 48'8842 x 119'04,
whence it follows: 01:0'2368 as the mean value of the
speci<U+FB01>c heat of air between the limits —17° and + 100°.
   § 10. In the annexed table I have collected all the data
serving to characterize the different determinations of the
speci<U+FB01>c heat of air at constant atmospheric pressure. The
columns headed I.—XI. contain the following quantities :—
      1. Mass of air passed through the calorimeter in grs.
     II. Equivalent mass of calorimeter in grs. of water.
    III. Velocity of current : grs. per min.
    IV. External heating of calorimeter, before and after the
            current, in<U+FB01>,0 degr. per min.
     V. Time of in<U+FB02>ux of heat into the calorimeter in minutes.
    VI. Initial and <U+FB01>nal temperatures of calorimeter (corn).
  VII. Total rise of temperature (corrected).
 VIII. Dilference of temperatures of heater and gas, as indi
            cated by the galvanometcr (degrees).
    IX. Initial and <U+FB01>nal temperature of the gas (degrees).
     X. Speci<U+FB01>c heat of air, under a pressure exceeding slightly
            the atmospheric, between temperatures indicated
            in IX.
    XI. Mean values of the foregoing.
   The whole of these results may be summed up as follows:—
     Between    + 20° and +98° ............. .. 01:0'2372
         ,,     —- 77° ,, +16° ............. .. 01:0'2374
         ,,     —lO2° ,, +17° ............. ..  01:0'2372
         ,,     —l70° ,, +18° ............. ..  01:0'2427
On the ground of these results we may assert with certainty
that the speci<U+FB01>c heat cl does not vary in a sensible manner
down to a temperature of about —100°. At the lowest
tem eratures, however, there is apparently a small increase
in t e quantity 01 of about 2 per cent. But I think there is
su<U+FB01>icient reason to conclude that even this small increase is
only apparent, namely, that it ought to be ascribed to the
in<U+FB02>uence of pressure rather than to that of the temperature.

Indeed, we shall see later on that the in<U+FB02>uence of pressure on
the speci<U+FB01>c heat at very low temperatures is very considerable;
for instance, at a temperature of —144° a doubling of the
atmospheric pressure brings about an increase of speci<U+FB01>c heat
by 0'03. Now the air on entering the heater is clearly under
a pressure exceeding the atmospheric by an amount indicated
by the mercury manometer.        in the liquid-oxygen series of
my experiments this was about 70 centims. of mercury. Part
of this pressure-head is absorbed by the resistance of the
heater; but on entering the cooler there remained still an
additional pressure of about 48 centims. This is amply
su<U+FB02>icient to account for the observed small increase of the
speci<U+FB01>c heat.
   In what follows I shall therefore consider the speci<U+FB01>c heat of
air under atmospheric pressure as a constant (02372) from
 + 100° down to —170°.
   § 11. We are now prepared to take up the more general
problem proposed in § 2, to determine the dependence of the
speci<U+FB01>c heat 0 on pressure, at different temperatures. That
a dependence of this kind does really exist may be inferred
from the fact that the values of the second differential
              9
coe<U+FB01>icient g7: (§ 2, equation 1) are in general different from
                           2
zero.   The values of 3—,: can be obtained from the results
recorded in the <U+FB01>rst part of the present memoir. Denoting
by v the volume, under the pressure p, at 0 degrees, of a mass
of air which occupies the volume 1 at 0°, under atmOspheric
pressure, we have
                         17=%0(1+a9); . . . . . . (6)
a denotes here the mean coef<U+FB01>cient of expansion under the
pressure 11, between 0° and 0°, 17° the coef<U+FB01>cient of com
pressibility at 0°, depending on p only.        The values of a
have been given in a table in § 15, those of 170 will be found
in the table of compressibility {§ 17, vol. xli. p. 309) in the
column headed “ O.’
    In what follows I shall assume

  To obtain 6—0 and W I constructed on a large scale a dlagram
  of values of or arranged in curves of equal pressure, abscissee
  representing temperatures ; it is in fact the diagram alluded
  to in § 14 (Part I.). These curves were divided in short
  pieces, approaching to straight lines; the differences of _
  ordinates of their ends gave a          _“ . the values so obtained
                                         69 ’
  were considered as corresponding to the middle point of each
  piece.
      Another diagram was then constructed with 3%,; as ordinates.
  The curves were carefully smoothed, care being taken to keep
  the whole of them in sight in doing so. The process of
                                                               '2
  differentiation repeated furnished the values of g—g’.
                                    2
       Using these values g2; can be now calculated by equa
  tion (7).      It would be super<U+FB02>uous to reproduce here the
  vast number of values thus obtained; some of them will be
  given later on.       An idea of the curious shape of the curves
    2

     *P It might be objected that this method of calculation is not capable of
  yielding results of any high accuracy.    Indeed, it cannot be denied that
, in drawing long curves along a comparatively small number of observed
  points, the success depends in a large measure on the <U+FB01>rmness of eye
  and steadiness of the drawer’s hand. Yet on the other hand it is to be
  remarked that the curves control one another, gross errors are thus easily
  avoided.
     Although graphical differentiation, if accurately done, is a very tedious
  process, it is unfortunately not possible to erform it by mechanical
  means, since, as far as I know, mechanical ilferentiators (working in
  a similar manner to the numerous integrators) do not exist. If I am
  right they are even impossible on dynamical grounds.

22                   A. W. Witkowski on the
     The shape of these curves leads forcibly to the conclusion
                                                 2
that for small pressures (p=1 atm.)                  cannot be zero
throughout the whole range of temperatures. It is very
small indeed for temperatures above —100°; but near the
critical temperature its values cannot be neglected. This is,
of course, an inference obtained by extrapolation (dotted parts
of the curves on P1. I.), since no experiments are available
on expansion of air at low temperatures under atmospheric
  ressure.
     Although this extrapolation does not seem to be doubtful,
and, moreover, any errors in it: do not in<U+FB02>uence the <U+FB01>nal

result, namely the integral              dp, in amarked degree, yet
                                  1 D”
it seemed desirable to test its probability in an indirect way.
For that purpose I integrated twice the extrapolated values of
  '1
gig (for p=1 atm.), with respect to temperature, by mecha
nical quadratures, adding to the result 1+                  in lieu of
constant of integration. It appears from this calculation
that at a temperature 0: -—140° (hydrogen scale), a constant
pressure (1 atm.) air-thermometer would indicate —l40°'76.
    know of no experiments to corroborate this result. From
Olszewski’s experiments on constant volume gas-thermo
meters'l‘) there may be quoted the following results: at a
temperature of —143°'7 (hydrogen scale) a constant volume
nitrogen thermometer indicated —144°'4, a similar oxygen
thermometer -l45°‘5. This is not inconsistent with the
ab0ve extrapolation.
      § 12. In order to obtain the values of the speci<U+FB01>c heat 0,,
according to equation (4) it remains to calculate the integrals
    1’ 2v                   .             B’v
f          dp, along the Isothermals 67, p and dp being ex

respective absolute temperatures t and by the constant factor
 18'714 represent the difference between the speci<U+FB01>c heat 0,,
and the speci<U+FB01>c heat 0,, under atmospheric pressure, which is
very nearly a constant, =O'2372.

                  Thermodynamic Properties of Air.                25
    The variations of the speci<U+FB01>c heat 0p, as revealed by these
tables, have been represented in a graphical form on P1. II.
It will be remarked that with increasing pressure the speci<U+FB01>c
heat increases, the more considerably the lower the tempe
rature of the corresponding isothermal.       In the vicinity of the
critical temperature these increments are largest, and in the
critical state itself the speci<U+FB01>c heat tends to in<U+FB01>nity. This
might have been anticipated, on the ground of equation (2), § 2,
because g2 =0 in the critical state, whilst a” and —p remain
  . .                                                    at
<U+FB01>nite.
    The most interesting feature of the diagram (Plate II.) is
that at temperatures above the critical the speci<U+FB01>c heat rises
with increasing pressure only to a maximum value, corre
sponding to a certain limiting pressure (which is a function of
the temperature). Under pressures exceeding this limiting
value the speci<U+FB01>c heat remains nearly constant, with but a
 slight tendency to decrease. The lower the temperature, the
 smaller is this limiting pressure, and the more marked the
 transition from increase to approximate constancy of the
 speci<U+FB01>c heat. It would seem as if these pressures marked a
 limit between truly gaseous states and a gaso-<U+FB01>uid condition
 of matter, in which the intrinsic pressures attain a prepon
derance against which the external pressure has but little
influence. It is interesting to note that the curves of the
 coef<U+FB01>cient of expansion at, under constant pressure (Part 1.,
 plate i.), show similar bends for pressures which are not
 much different from the limiting pressures of the speci<U+FB01>c-heat
 curves. We shall'see that neither the curves of the speci<U+FB01>c
 heat at constant volume, nor those of the coef<U+FB01>cient of expan
 sion at constant volume, show any trace of bends of this sort.
      § 13. It is a more dif<U+FB01>cult matter to calculate the variations
 of the specific heat at constant volume. At <U+FB01>rst sight it would
 seem easiest to apply the equation (3), § 2 :—
                            80._ t 8211 ,
                            Bo     Jm, at” '
      But we shall see that the variations of pressure at constant
 volume are so nearly proportional to those of the temperature,
 that the calculation of the second differential coef<U+FB01>cient
    2
 3—52 is practically impossible.
      In order to <U+FB01>nd the variations of pressure of air of any
  density kept at a constant volume, I shall refer once more to

the results obtained in Part I.            Through the origin of the
diagram of compressibility (Part 1., plate ii.) draw any
straight line. The intersections of it with the isothermals
pv=const. mark evidently a series of pressures corresponding
to the respective temperatures, and satisfying the condition
v=const.; it is supposed that 'u=1 when 6=0°, and the
pressure is atmospheric. Using the original diagram of pv,

  In <U+FB01>g. 4 we <U+FB01>nd a graphical representation of these results
by means of curves of equal density.
   Some time ago Ramsay and Young announced an important
generalization of the law of Charles, according to which the
constant-volume relation of pressure and temperature (in the

28              -   A. W. Witkowski on the
gaseous and liquid condition of matter alike) would be
a linear one, at any density. It is now known that a law
of that kind is not enerally true, or that it holds good
only approximately.        at it is remarkable how nearly it is
ful<U+FB01>lled in the case of atmospheric air at widely different
temperatures and densities.        The curves of <U+FB01>g. 4 depart
only insigni<U+FB01>cantly from straight lines.      But none of them
cuts the axis of abscissae at the point —273°—s0 often
spoken of (by a curious confusion of ideas) as absolute zero
—except, perhaps, those corresponding to very low densities;
tile pressure of dense gas decreases far more rapidly than
t at.
    The constant-volume relation p=F(0) will be perhaps more
clearly expressed by introducing the pressure-coef<U+FB01>cient ,8 of
expansion defined by the equation
                        P=Po(l+/96),
p0 being the pressure exerted at 0° by the gas, when
compressed to a density p=;1— (unit of p: density at 0°
under atmospheric pressure).          The values of B are as
follows :—
        p:    20.     40.       60.   I so.    100. l 120.

    The pressure coef<U+FB01>cient does not vary much through a
range of 245°, provided the density be kept constant. An
increase of density causes it to augment rapidly. In con
trast with the tortuous curves representing the coef<U+FB01>cient
0:, those of [3 form a narrow nearly straight bundle, con
verging approximately to one point, namely, [8:0'00367

   § 15. These results prove conclusively that the speci<U+FB01>c heat
at constant volume is a variable quantity. For increasing
pressure “the quantity 0, increases at all temperatures, the
more so the lower the temperature. For small pressures the
corresponding isothermals converge approximately to the
value 0169, which is the speci<U+FB01>c heat of air of ordinary
density.

             To obtain a graphical representation of the variations of
        c, I constructed isothermals of that quantity, considering it at
        <U+FB01>rst as a function of the density It .    These. lines are curves,
        turning their concave sides to the axis of abscissae.       After
        wards I made the remark that a far simpler law results when
        6.7 is considered as a function of the pressure 12. As shown
        in <U+FB01>g. 5 the isothermals of Cu drawn on that supposition are

             0=      0°, 09:0-169+O'00008 (10-1).
 As regards the fact of the speci<U+FB01>c heat at constant volume
 increasing with increasing pressure, these results are in
 perfect accord with the direct determinations of Prol. Joly.
 A numerical comparison cannot be made properly, because
 these experiments have been performed at higher temperatures
 (+50° in the mean). Yet the following result of Prof. Joly
 may be quoted (l. 0. page 99). The speci<U+FB01>c heat at constant
 volume of compressed air, of absolute density =O'0205 (which
 corresponds to a pressure of about 19'51 atmospheres), has
 been found =O'l72l ; from the same experiments it is con
 cluded, that the value of a, under atmospheric pressure would
 be 0'17154. From these numbers there results an increase
 of 0,, per atmosphere
              =(O'1721—0'17154) : 18'51=O'OOOO3.
 Considering the difference of temperatures, this agrees well
 with my own results.
    Prof. Joly has also investigated the in<U+FB02>uence of the tempera
 ture on the speci<U+FB01>c heat 00 of compressed gases. For carbonic
 acid of absolute density 0'124 he <U+FB01>nds c,=O'197l at +50°,
 and cv=0'1894 at + 90°; this means an increase of speci<U+FB01>c
 heat at low temperatures. He remarks also, that under small
 pressures the influence of the temperature is quite insensible.
  All these conclusions are in perfect agreement with what has
 been said above with regard to the speci<U+FB01>c heat of air.
    § 16. By means of the results arrived at in § 14 we may
 now calculate the ratio 1:: 3—" of the two speci<U+FB01>c heats; the
 Values of k are given in the tables of § 14 in the last column.
 The general features of the variations of /c will be best under
 stood if we consider k as a function of the temperature, at
 constant volume, or at constant density. The corresponding
 curves are shown in <U+FB01>g. 6.
    With regard to the variability of Is our knowledge is ex
 ceedingly scanty. The only fact known till now in this respect

                  Thermodynamic Properties of Air.               35
is the experimental result of Wiillner, that the ratio In increases

to 1'40526 at 0°, for air of ordinary density). An increase of

Although the general course of the curves of lc is very clearly
marked, yet some irregularities manifest themselves in the
diagram of <U+FB01>g. 6, chiefly at the highest and 10west tempera
tures, where the graphical calculation has been also less
certain. I have not attempted to correct them arbitrarily, but
I drew the curves as near as possible along the calculated
points (marked on the diagram by dots).
   § 17. In concluding I wish to state expressly that the
absolute numerical values of the several thermodynamic
quantities given in          12, 14, and 16, being obtained by a
graphical method of calculation, cannot claim a degree of
exactness comparable with that of direct experimental results.
Notwithstanding this I considered it useful to spare neither
time nor trouble to obtain them, in order to throw some light
on these important and wholly unexplored relations.
   During the preparation of the manuscript of the present
paper I became acquainted with a memoir of Sgr. Silvio
Lussano (Nuovo Cimento, 1894, ser. iii. tom. xxxvi. pp. 1, 70,
130; 1895, ser. ii. tom. ii., p. 327 ; “ Sul calore speci<U+FB01>co dei
gas”) on the in<U+FB02>uence of pressure and temperature on the
speci<U+FB01>c heat of gases at constant pressure. The results of
Sgr. Lussano, being obtained at higher temperatures, are not

       Melting-points of Aluminium, Silver, Gold, Copper, (9'0.         37
   directly comparable with mine.           As regards the in<U+FB02>uence of
  pressure Sgr. Lussano <U+FB01>nds, in the limits of pressures em
  ployed, an increase of 0], with increasing pressure; but the
  in<U+FB02>uence of the temperature is just contrary to that which I
  have found at low temperatures. It cannot be doubted that
  at suf<U+FB01>ciently low temperatures the speci<U+FB01>c heat 0,, increases
  with decreasing temperature, since in the critical state its
  value is positive in<U+FB01>nity. This point must therefore be
  reserved for further researches, the more so, as the increase
  of 0,, with increasing temperature, at higher temperatures, has
  been proved long ago in some gases (carbon dioxide &c.)
 without any doubt.

  II. dialling-points of Aluminium, Silver, Gold, Copper, and
       Platinum. By S. W. HOLMAN, with R. R. LAWRENCE and
       L. BARR*.
  THE following melting-points are offered as provisional
           only, but with the belief that they are more reliable
  than previous data. The absolute values depend in part upon
  the assumption of 1072° C. as the melting-point of pure gold,
  the recent determination of Holborn and Wien at the Beichs
 anstalt. Should that datum, however, be shown to require
 revision, the validity of the present measurements would not
 be impaired, but new values of the melting—points could be
 readily computed from them which would be consistent with
 the better value for gold.

       The Pure Metals used were of a high degree of <U+FB01>neness,
 except unfortunately the platinum.
       The gold contained less than 001 per cent. total impurities,
these being, if any, probably minute traces of silver and pla
tinum. It was obtained as part of a specially prepared lot
from the United States Assay Of<U+FB01>ce in New York through
the courtesy of Professor H. G. Torrey, upon whose authority
the above statement is made. The purity was at least as great
as the best “proof” metal used at the United States or London
mints.
    '1' From an advance proof of the Proceedings of the American Academy
vol. xxxi. (n. s. xxiii.) p. 218, communicated by Prof. Holman.

38        Messrs. Holman, Lawrence, and Barr on the
    The silver was from the same source and equally pure.
    The aluminium was manufactured and given by the Pitts
burg Reduction Company, of Pittsburg, Penn., and was stated
by Mr. Alfred E. Hunt, President of the Company, to con
tain but 0'07 per cent. of impurity, consisting entirely of
 silicon.
    The platinum was the ordinary platinum wire supplied by
 Carpentier, of Paris, with his Le Chatelier thermo-electric
 pyrometers. It presumably contained 0'5 per cent. or more
 of impurity.
     The copper was electrolytically produced, and was from
 the Lake Superior region. It was kindly given by Mr.
  Maurice B. Patch, of the Bu<U+FB02>'alo Smelting Company, Buffalo,
  N.Y., who stated that it showed by analysis 99'99 + per cent.
  of Cu, and contained no Ag, As, or S, and only 00002 per
  cent. of Fe.
     The Less Pure Metals.—Partly for the purpose of testing
  the effect of impurities, other samples of gold and copper
  were employed with the results stated later. These were :—
     Dentists’ Gold.—This was a gold-foil employed by dentists,
  purchased as being of good quality.
     lngot Copper.——This was also from Mr. Patch, of the Buffalo
  Smelting Company, who gave its analysis as :—

   This was the company’s “regular run ” of copper.
      Commercial Electrolytic Copper.—A sample of commercial
   electrolytic rolled sheet copper, furnished by a friend,and not
   assumed to be of unusual purity. It was probably Montana
   copper.
      Commercial Hard-drawn Copper Wire.—This was from a
   lot -purchased for electrical testing purposes, which showed a
   speci<U+FB01>c resistance of 01440 international ohm per metre
   gram, or an electrical conductivity of about 98'?) per cent.
   referred to Matthiessen’s copper.
      Methods and Apparatus—The method consists in measuring
   the thermal electromotive force of a couple composed of one
   wire of platinum and the other of a lO-per-cent. rhodo
   platinum alloy.     One junction is immersed in the melting or

    Melting-points of Aluminium, Silver, Gold, Copper, (5'0.    39
  solidifying metal, and the other surrounded by ice. The wire
  was that furnished by Carpentier, of Paris (through Queen &
  00., of Philadelphia), with the Le Chatelier pyrometer.
     The E.M.F. was measured in microvolls (international) by
 the Poggendorff null method modi<U+FB01>ed for rapid and con
 venient working. The disposition of apparatus is shown in
 <U+FB01>g. 1. B is a battery of suf<U+FB01>ciently steady             (A single
                               Fig. 1.
 Samson-Leclanché cell was entirely satisfactory.) In direct
 circuit with this were two water rheostats, W, in series; an
ammeter, A, which was a Weston voltmeter (No. 395) with
the calibrating coil only in use ; and a manganine wire resist
ance, a,b, c, d, divided into sections, each of accurately known
resistance. T is the thermo-couple connected through a sen
sitive galvanometer, G, and key to any desired sections of the
coil a, b, c, d. The water rheostats were of about 100 ohms
and 8 ohms respectively, and the vertical motion of their
plungers thus served to give a coarse and <U+FB01>ne adjustment to
the resistance in the circuit. The current could thus be
promptly and closely adjusted. The voltmeter was one of
the type having a “calibrating coil;” that is, one having a
connexion by means of which the usual high resistance series
coil could be cut out, leaving its resistance about 117 ohms.
Any of the Weston voltmeters with a special connexion made
to effect that result would answer equally well. The volt
meter was preferred to a mil-ammeter as probably more
reliable. The instrument was carefully and repeatedly cali
brated throughout its scale by an application of the Poggen
dorfi'method, measuring by the Clark cell the drop of potential
in a known resistance through which a current was passing in

   40        Messrs. Holman, Lawrence, and Barr on the
   series with the ammeter, and at the same instant reading the
   ammeter. The calibrations at different times were checked
   at the same point, with an average deviation of only a few
   hundredths of one per cent. A test for temperature error
   showed a change of but O'l per cent. for a change of
   15° 0.; so that, as the temperature during the work was
   constant within a few degrees, no correction was needed.
   The manganine coil, <U+FB01>g. 2, consisted of about 16 feet of
   No. 20 wire, had a total resistance                 Fig, 2
   of about 8'8 ohms and was divided                      ‘
   into nine sections by copper po
_ tential wires leading into different       __ .
  points along the coil.     These sec-            E1, - —-- l
  tions were so designed that, by           —      r

  responding to currents from 0006            _
  to 0009 ampere roughly. The                   -        —
 'coil was immersed directly in kero- ‘
  seas, and as its temperature-coe<U+FB02>icient was but 0001 per 1° 0.,
  the correction became very small. The relation and actual
  resistance (international ohms) of the whole coil and its several
  sections were repeatedly determined against a standard ohm
  by the differential galvanometer, and checked by a modi<U+FB01>ed
  Wheatstone-bridge arrangement. These data were reliable
  probably well within 0 05 per cent. throughout.
     In the thermocouple circuit, the sensitiveness necessary
  in the galvanometer to give the smallest E.M.F. to 0'1 per
  cent. was easily computed to be only about 7'7 .106 (mm. de<U+FB02>.
  at 1 m. per ampere or (1/0). The instrument as actually used
  exceeded this requirement, averaging about 5 . 107. Its resist
  ance, all in series, was 143 ohms.
     The cold junction 0 of the tlierlno-couple was fused together
  in an oxyhydrogen <U+FB02>ame. The wires, insulated from each
  other by having one strung through a very <U+FB01>ne glass tube,
  were run down another tube of about 3} inch ins1de diameter
  and 8 or 10 inches long. This tube was fused together at the
  bottom and top, as well as at some intermediate points, and
  when in use was always packed in a double vessel of cracked
  ice, as shown in <U+FB01>g. 3.
     The intermediate junctions from which the copper leads

    illelting-points of Aluminium, Silver, Gold, Copper, do.   41
 went off to galvanometer and key were soldered. They were
 kept at an equal temperature by the device of enclosing them
 in a stoppered glass tube, which was packed with hair-felt
 into a one-inch hole in a <U+FB01>ve-inch cube of cast iron. This
 arrangement was entirely satisfactory, but seems to possess
 no material advantage over making the junction of the copper
 leads with the Pt and Pt-Rh serve as the cold junction, and
 immersing this in ice as in <U+FB01>g. 3, except that the latter makes
 a rather more bulky mass to insert in the ice.
    The wires were also fused together at the hot junction
 except when this was unnecessary on account of their being
 immersed in metal. It may be noted here that, as a null
 method was employed, the total resistance of the thermal
 circuit, or any variation in it, was without effect other than a
 corresponding change in sensitiveness.
    As the hot junction was to be immersed in vapour of sulphur
 as one of the known temperatures, the following apparatus was
 designed for this purpose. It is substantially the sulphur
 boiling-point apparatus of Griffiths, and is shown in <U+FB01>g. 4.
          Fig. 3.
A glass tube, A, similar to the Victor Meyer vapour-density
tube, 16 inches long and with a two-inch bulb, was provided
with an asbestos jacket and hood, B, B, The upper few
inches of the tube were wound with a spiral wire spring, S,
which rendered this part e<U+FB02>icient as a condenser. The top was
closed with a layer of asbestos. Two overlapping diaphragms
of asbestos were inserted in the tube at D and E. The couple
passed downward through a glass tube to the asbestos tubular

 42       Messrs. Holman, Lawrence, and Barr on the
 hood, C, which served as an umbrella to shed the dripping
 cooler sulphur, and as a radiation-screen. The hood, how
 ever, had openings top and bottom for the free circulation of
 the vapour. An asbestos diaphragm, H, upon which the bulb
 rested, reduced the chances of superheating.
    For the melting metals, after trial of several devices, the
 one shown in <U+FB01>g. 5 (of exactly half size) was settled upon as
                                    Fig. 5.

 proving very satisfactory. The crucible, 0 (usually of <U+FB01>re
olay), is supported by clay blocks in the double-walled <U+FB01>re
 clay furnace, F. A carbon block, E, channelled to <U+FB01>t the
crucible, forms its cover, and a carbon diaphragm, 1), inside
the crucible serves to support some powdered carbon shown
by the dotted mass. The object of these carbon parts was to
prevent oxidation of molten metals, and they proved very
effective in the case of aluminium, silver, and copper. G G was
an asbestos diaphragm supporting a non-conducting layer of
<U+FB01>brous asbestos, AA. The temperature was controlled by
the blast-lamp B. The clay crucible was one inch in diameter
outside, and the amount of metal em loyed ranged from 11
grams (gold) to 35 grams (copper).              arger amounts might
be advantageous, but with 30 to 35 grams it was easily
possible to obtain a constant indication for <U+FB01>ve minutes during
the melting or solidifying of copper. N o di<U+FB02>iculty whatever

    Melting-points of Aluminium, Silver, Gold, Copper, 6'0.      43
was experienced with this arrangement with silver, gold, or
copper. With aluminium, however, a peculiar action occurred,
the cause of which in the time available for investigation
could not be determined beyond doubt.           The phenomenon
was that after a few minutes of constant temperature at the
melting-point, the indication of the thermo-couple fell oft" with
increasing rapidity. On withdrawing the couple, cleaning it,
or clipping it 05 and restoring it to place, the melting metal
meanwhile being untouched, the indications returned to their
 original high value. The apparent explanation was the for
 mation of a slag between the wires; but this was not entirely
 satisfactory. The use of a plumbago cruci'ble in place of the
 clay and an entirely fresh lot of aluminium did not remove
 the phenomenon, and gave the same initial readings, which,
 it could not be doubted, were the ones corresponding to the
 melting-point. The fusion of the aluminium was, however,
 the least sharply de<U+FB01>ned of all the metals used.
     The fusion of platinum was, of course, differently e<U+FB02>'ected.
 For this the two wires of the couple were laid close together
 on a piece of lime. An oxyhydrogen <U+FB02>ame was then directed
 upon their ends and the platinum fused into a globule which
 with care could be made to travel slowly up the wire. There
 was no dif<U+FB01>culty in obtaining steady temperatures for a suf<U+FB01>
 cient period to make the necessary readings, and check results
 to 0'1 per cent. were obtained on di<U+FB02>'erent days.
     The galvanometer, keys, coils, and all junctions of dis
 similar metals, were, so far as possible, covered with boxes
 of wood, pasteboard, or asbestos to maintain uniformity of
 temperature, and thus minimize local thermo-electric disturb
 ances. With this precaution, no sensible trouble from that
 source was experienced.
     The procedure is as follows :——To take the observation for
 vapour of sulphur, for instance, the hot and cold junctions
  are exposed as described. After a suf<U+FB01>cient time the main
  circuit is closed, the thermal circuit is connected to a suitable
 part of a, b, c, d, and the rheostats W are adjusted until on
  pressing the key no de<U+FB02>exion occurs in the galvanometer G.
  At this instant A is read, which gives the current 0 in the
  main circuit. The adjustment is disturbed and remade a
  number of times, and the resulting readings should check to
  the nearest tenth of a division of A, provided the metal has
  reached a steady state of temperature.
      By this adjustment the drop of potential or due to the
  current a amperes in the part 'r ohms of the resistance a, b, c, d,
  spanned by the thermal circuit is made equal to the total re
   sultant E.M.F. in the thermal circuit. The latter, which will be

44        Messrs. Holman, Lawrence, and Barr on the
denoted by 2:9 or if, e, is the algebraic sum of the thermal
E.M.F. proper of the junctions, of the Thomson E.M.F. in the
wires, and of any “stray” or local thermal E.M.F. in the
circuit. The last was found to be negligible throughout the
work.
   To observe the melting-point, the furnace containing the
metal is heated more or less rapidly until the melting-point is
approached. The blast-lamp is then adjusted to give a slowly
rising temperature. The thermal circuit, with the couple
previously fused into the metal, is connected to a suitable
section of a, b, c, d. The rheostats are continually adjusted
for zero de<U+FB02>exions of the galvanometer G, and the corre
sponding readings of A are taken. These will show gradually
increasing values ; but the rise will presently be interrupted
by a series of constant readings, after which the readings will
again steadily increase. This period of constant, or nearly
constant, readings of A is that in which the latent heat of
fusion is being absorbed, and its duration is frequently several
minutes. The temperature at that time is, of course, that of the
melting-point. The reverse process, starting with the metal
in a molten state and cooling it gradually, shows a. similar
period of solidi<U+FB01>cation.
   No difference was discovered between the ascending and
descending readings when a suf<U+FB01>cient amount of the metal
and a slow rate of heating and cooling were employed. With
small amounts the steady reading was more or less masked by
phenomena which were clearly due to inequality in distri
 bution of temperature throughout the mass of mixed liquid
and solid metal. In the case of aluminium, however, some
 thing more than this irregularity was observed, as elsewhere
stated, but the time at command did not permit a study
beyond the point of satisfying ourselves that the point observed
 was unquestionably the true melting-point.
   This work was done chie<U+FB02>y as the thesis work of Messrs.
Lawrence and Barr. The ef<U+FB01>cient assistance of Mr. C. L.
Norton contributed materially to its progress and success.

    This problem has been elsewhere discussed by one of the
 authors of this paper *.
    In that article two interpolation formulae were developed.

    Both formulae have been applied to the data of the present
investigation given in Table I., with results shown below.
The Avenarius formula has also been applied for purposes of
 comparison.
    To evaluate the constants m and n of the exponential
equation (for method, consult the paper referred to) it is
necessary to have values of Z<U+FB01>e at three known temperatures.
Of these, however, one may be 2.56:0, at T=273°, i, e. with
both junctions in ice. It therefore remains to <U+FB01>x upon two
other temperatures between which to interpolate, or, in other
words, two other temperatures which shall be assumed as
known. In looking Over the ground, it seemed that the
boiling-point of sulphur, being so high and so accurately
determined by Callendar and Gri<U+FB01>iths‘,
                     444-53 + 0'082(H - 780),
was preeminently one of these points.             The other must be
much higher, and the melting-point of pure gold seemed to
be almost, if not quite, the only one upon which reliance could
be placed.
    Apart from freedom from oxidation and its conveniently
high point of fusion, gold seemed the more suitable because its
melting-point had recently been so carefully measured by
Holborn and Wien, and because the metal could be obtained
of the necessary purity. Add to these considerations the fact
that its melting-point in a state of at least fairly high purity
has been measured by more experimenters than that of any
other high melting metal, so that it serves as an excellent
connecting link between their work, and we have claims which
no other substances can at present offer. The fusion-point of
gold was therefore chosen as the second reference or calibration
temperature. As to the <U+FB01>gure to be assumed as the melting

46       Messrs. Holman, Lawrence, and Barr on the
point of gold, there is room for differences of opinion. The
claims of the work of Holborn and \Vien, supported to some
extent by considerations advanced by Barus", lend much
weight to the conclusion that Violle’s value of 1035° is con
siderably too low. Granting this, and in the absence of
suf<U+FB01>cient basis for the assignment of weights to the work of
divers other investigators, the simplest and best step seemed
to be to adopt provisionally, without modi<U+FB01>cation, Holborn
and Wien’s value,              10720_
   These two points settled upon, the constants m and n could
be computed as elsewhere described, and the equation trans
posed to deduce other values of t from observed values of 2:0.
Representing m'r: by ,8, a constant, the equation for the tem
perature as a function of Zée takes the form

     Inspection of columns 6 and 7, Table L, will show that the
  computed boiling—points of water and napthalin by the ex
  ponential and logarithmic equations depart widely from the
  known temperatures in opposite directions, by about equal
  amounts, and in the directions according with the departures
  from the Barus and Holborn and Wien data. Also, that the
  diti'erences between the computed melting-points intermediate

  48         Messrs. Holman, Lawrence, and Barr on the
 between sulphur and gold differ but slightly by the two
 formula, thus con<U+FB01>rming the former conclusions. It is
 obvious, therefore, that although either of the two formulae
 would yield fairly good interpolations for Al, Ag, and Cu,
 yet that a mean between the two would probably quite
 nearly offset against each other the systematic errors of
 the respective equations. This is also true in the dangerous
 process of extrapolation for the platinum melting-point, where
 the chances of error in the result seem to be probably very
 much reduced by averaging. The means of the melting
 points computed by the exponential and logarithmic equations
 are, therefore, regarded as the nearest available approxima
 tions, and the round numbers of column 9 are adopted as
 provisional values to represent the results of the work.
     Comparison of the results of the Avenarius formula,
 column 5, will show that they depart widely from the others
 in the direction which would have been anticipated from the
 conclusions of the previous paper, thus further strengthening
 those inferences.
     In addition to the foregoing, the melting-points of three
 other samples of copper and one other of gold were measured.
 The gold was dentists’ gold “foil,” purchased in Boston.
This is usually classed as “very nearly pure,” but its analysis
was not known. No special interest, therefore, attaches to it
beyond the indication that it gives of the sign and order of
magnitude of the error (about —4°) which would be introduced
by the use of such gold in the calibration of the Le Chatelier
pyrometer, or in similar ways*. The melting-point was
found to be 1068°.

     The concordance‘of these results on various coppers, together
  with the completely satisfactory behaviour of the metal in
  fusion, and the ease and cheapness of obtaining the metal of
  a very high grade of <U+FB01>neness, sug est the decided availability
  of copper in a direct study of big temperatures or melting
  points by the gas-thermometer. A large mass of the metal
  could be employed, and a constant and uniform temperature
  for a protracted period thus secured for the bulb of the
 gas-thermometer, or for other apparatus immersed in the
 molten or solidifying material. There are unfortunately too
 few substances which ful<U+FB01>l even these requirements. An
 added merit lies in the nearness to the gold melting-point,
 enabling the two to be satisfactorily connected by some means
 of relative measurement.
     It also appears that the use of good commercial copper
 would introduce sensibly less error (3° less) into the calibra
 tion of the Le Ohatelier pyrometer than the use of the
 “dentists’ gold” above tested, which is as good metal as
 would readily be obtained in the market by most observers.
    Reliability of the Results—The points involved are :—
    Instrumental errors.
    Purity of the metal.
    Was the observed point the real melting-point?
    Validity of the interpolation equation.
    Error in the assumed melting-point of gold and boiling
 point of sulphur.
    The investigation was planned and the apparatus arranged
 with the intention of reducing the combined instrumental
 errors below one-tenth of one per cent. in the measurement
 of 2e above 200° C. Tests, check measurements, and a dis
cussion of the sources of error, unnecessary to detail here,
have given satisfactory demonstration that an even higher
accuracy than this was attained. So far, therefore, as constant
or variable instrumental errors are concerned, it is believed
that no error beyond 0°‘5 to 1° C. exists in the results, while
probably this estimate is large.
    The error from impurities must have been exceptionally
small, as the analysis of the metals indicates. Some impurities
from alloying with the platinum and rhodium of the thermo
couple must have entered during the experimenting, but
as results at different stages of the work checked those
obtained upon the <U+FB01>rst use of the metal, and as renewals of
the metal made no di<U+FB02>'crence in readings beyond the limits of
other variations (about 5 parts in 10,000), the error from this
source must have been negligible.
   In the case of platinum the metal at command was un

fortunately not of known composition, nor was it possible at
the time to obtain any whose purity was known. An analysis
of the wire used may perhaps be obtained later, and it is
hoped to carry out further measurements with the better
platinum now obtainable through the recent advances made
in its manufacture in Germany and England.
   The aluminium was of a very high grade, but it is thought
that still better may be obtained, and the peculiar occurrence
attending its melting-point measurements should be further
investigated.
    The actual e<U+FB01>'ect of the small impurities cannotbe numeric
ally estimated, but must have been inconsiderable except for
platinum, where the error probably has the positive sign.
    As to the third point, there was no reasonable doubt left in
 the minds of the observers that the observed temperatures
 were sensibl the melting-points.                Except as noted for
 aluminium, t e readings with rising and falling temperatures
 did not exceed about one part in one thousand. Also entirely
independent observations on separate days, and with renewals
 of the metals in some cases, were equally concordant. The
 average difference was much less than the error of reading
the ammeter. As an example of the concordance, and at the
 same time as showing the homogeneit of the thermo wire,

    Between these observations a considerable length of the
 wires was necessarily clipped o<U+FB01>'. Reduced to a common
 temperature of 445°, the maximum difference is but six micro
 volts in 5290, or 0'11 per cent, while the average deviation
 of a single observation is but 0'02 microvolt, or 004 per

 0024 per cent. At higher temperatures the discrepancy
 was even smaller.

been introduced into the results by this source should, how
ever, be added. This is believed to be for aluminium less than
 142°, for silver less than i2°, for copper less than i0'5o,
and for platinum less than i 10°.
    Comparison with the temperatures computed by the Ave

remove or account for some of the apparent discrepancies,—
a task which will perhaps be undertaken later.

III. A Further Examination of the Edison E<U+FB01>'ect in Glow
   Lamps. By J. A. FLEMING, M.A., D.Sc.,F.R.S., Pro
  fessor of Electrical Engineering in University College,
   London*.
§1. THE experiments described in this paper had for their
           object the further examination of an effect which can
be produced in certain forms of electric incandescence lamps
and to which attention was <U+FB01>rst drawn by Mr. Edison in 1884.
This effect may be generally described as follows :—A carbon
<U+FB01>lament incandescence lamp having the ordinary horse-shoe
loop carbon has a metallic plate placed in the exhausted bulb,
the plate being carried on a platinum wire sealed through the
}globe, and <U+FB01>xed so as to stand up between the legs of the
  orse-shoe (see <U+FB01>g. 1). If the lamp is set in action at the
             Fig. 1.                           Fig. 2.
usual incandescence by a. continuous current of the proper
strength, and a suitable sensitive galvanometer is connected
between the insulated metal plate and the positive terminal of
the lamp, it will in general be found to indicate a current of
some milliamperes <U+FB02>owing through it. The direction of this
current is from the positive electrode of the lamp through
the galvanometer to the insulated metal plate, or wire. When
the same galvanometer is connected between the negative pole
of the lamp and the middle plate, unless it is very sensitive, it
indicates no current. This effect was very carefully examined

  by Mr. WV. H. Preece in 1885, and be subjected it to a
  systematic examination by the aid of a number of lamps
 having such metal plates placed in various positions *. By
 this observer a number of very interesting facts were col
 lected, the result of which was to point out the general nature
  of the phenomenon. A suf<U+FB01>cient number of new questions
 were, however, suggested by the information so acquired to
  invite further inquiry. Whilst con<U+FB01>rming and re-examining
  the experimental results obtained by Mr. Preece, some facts
 that had previously escaped notice presented themselves,
 which it is the object of this paper to describe.
     §2. The <U+FB01>rst experiments were made with a lamp of the
 form shown in <U+FB01>g. 2, similar to some used by Mr. Preece in'
 his experiments. A metal plate, generally of aluminium, is
 supported on a. platinum wire sealed through the bulb or
 glass receiver, the plate being so <U+FB01>xed that its plane is at
 right angles to the plane of the loop of the carbon, and as
 nearly as possible midway between the legs. The plate there
 fore projects between the legs of the horse-shoe carbon, and
 the carbon conductor arches over it without touching it.
 The plate is entirely insulated from the carbon.
     The preliminary experiments with this normal type of
 middle-plate lamp consisted in determining the effective
 potential-difference between the third terminal and one or
 other of the two electrodes of the carbon <U+FB01>lament when the
lamp was subjected to varying steady electromotive forces
suf<U+FB01>cient to raise the temperature of the carbon from dull red
to vivid incandescence, and in determining the magnitude of
the current <U+FB02>owing in a circuit connecting the middle plate
 with one or other of the electrodes of the lamp.
     §3. Experiment 1.—-An ordinary carbon <U+FB01>lament electric
lamp, having the horse-shoe shaped conductor, had a platinum
plate (see <U+FB01>g. 3) about 2'5 centimetres long by 1'5 centi
metres wide welded to a platinum wire, sealed through the
side of the bulb. The plate was so placed as to project
between the legs of the carbon conductor, having its plane at
right angles to the plane of the horse-shoe, and initially <U+FB01>xed
about halfway between the two legs.         This lamp will be de
scribed in the subsequent paragraphs as Lamp No. 4. Under
a steady electromotive force of 40 volts, this lamp took 3'7
amperes when working at the normal temperature corre_

and the middle plate M, a current was found passmg through
the galvanometer from the terminal P to the plate M. This

  current had a magnitude of about 3 milliamperes when the
 carbon was in the normal state of incandescence.
     If the milamperemeter was connected between the negative
  electrode of the lamp and the middle plate, no current per
  ceptible by this galvanometer was found. On replacing the

                  Edison Efect in Glow Lamps.                   55
milamperemeter by a more sensitive Elliott mirror galvano
meter (resistance 7142 ohms), it was found that a small
current passed through it, when joined in between the negative
electrode of the lamp and the middle plate, but that this
current had a magnitude hardly exceeding '0001 of a milli
am ere when the lamp was at its normal incandescence.
    11 order to avoid repetition, it may be here said that, unless
otherwise stated, the terminal of the lamp in connexion with
the positive pole of the working battery will be spoken of as
the positive electrode of the lamp; that in connexion with the
negative pole of the battery as the negative electrode. For
brevity's sake, the half of the carbon <U+FB01>lament between the
centre of the <U+FB01>lament and the positive electrode will be called
the positive leg, and the other half the negative leg.
   § 4. A preliminary series of experiments was made with lamp
No. 4 by placing the lamp in a photometer and determining
the watts per candle_power and the current taken by the
lamp corresponding to various working electromotive forces,
taken over the whole range of electromotive force from that
necessary just to render the <U+FB01>lament incandescent to the
highest the lamp could with safety endure. In any subse
quent experiments, the simple measurement of the potential
di<U+FB01>'erence between the electrodes of the lamp enabled the
rate of dissipation of energy in the <U+FB01>lament and the watts per
candle-power to be deduced. It may here be remarked that
in the preliminary experiments some dif<U+FB01>culties arose from
the occlusion of residual gas by the middle metal plate, but
<U+FB01>nally this was overcome, and the vacuum in these experi
mental bulbs made and preserved as perfect as in good ordinary
commercial lamps. The following results were then obtained
with this lamp No. 4.    The lam was raised to various degrees
of incandescence by varying t e working volts by the aid of
a rheostat in series with the lamp.
   The milamperemeter was employed to measure the effective
potential-difference between the positive electrode of the lamp
and the middle plate and then, tabulating against the working
volts of the lamp the current in milliamperes <U+FB02>owin through
the galvanometer, the potential-difference between t e middle
plate and the positive electrode of the lamp was calculated
from these <U+FB01>gures.     The results are given in the table below
(Table No. l).

    The results given in table No. l are plotted in curve No. 1,
in which horizontal abscissae represent to scale the working
Volts of the lamp and vertical ordinates the milliampere
currents through the galvanometer. It will be seen that the
curve representing the current from lamp electrode to plate
takes a rather sharp turn upwards at a point corresponding to
33 working volts, and this occurs when the lamp is working
at about 7'8 watts per candle-power. Beyond this point the
curve is very approximatel a straight line. Accordingly, at
and beyond the volts at w ich the carbon <U+FB01>lament becomes
fairly well incandescent, the effective potential-di<U+FB01>'erence
between the middle plate and the positive lamp electrode is
very nearly a linear function of the lamp voltage ; and at the
normal working volts, viz. 40 volts, this potential-difference
between the middle plate and the positive electrode so deter
mined is apparently about half' that between the lamp terminals,
the plate being nearly midway between the carbon legs.
The results given in Table 1 are the mean of several obser
vations, but it was noticed that when the lamp was maintained
at a steady voltage, the potential-difference between the
middle plate and the positive electrode would often jump

jump perhaps to 22 volts, and then slowly decrease to 19 volts,
or so. This tendency of the potential-difference between the
middle plate and positive lamp electrode to ump from a low
to a high value, or vice versd, is most marked in lamps in
which the plate is about half-way, and symmetrically placed,
between the legs of the carbon.            We shall speak of these
two values as the high and low value of the current through
the galvanometer, and defer until later a discussion of some
other causes tending to make the current pass from a high to
a low value or the reverse, as well as its possible explanation.
In Table No. 2 are tabulated a set of observations on the same
lamp N0. 4, showing these double values which the potential
ditference and current ma have, and it may be here noted
that in the previous Table {10. l,the higher values have been

per candle-power, there are two possible values of the effective

 raised, the reading of the galvanometer inserted between the
middle plate and positive electrode is also increased, but there
 is a great tendency to jump from a certain low value to a

60                    Prof. J. A. Fleming on the
higher one, and this occurs when the working pressure of the
lamp is preserved steady. There is also an effect produced
by the presence of a magnet near the lamp bulb. \Vhen the
current is at the low value corresponding to any working
voltage, the galvanometer reading does not seem to be per
ceptibly altered by bringing a magnet near the lamp, but
when it is at its high value, the reading is sometimes increased
for a little, showing a steady de<U+FB02>exion, and then immediately
falls to its low value.
   §5. Experiment 2.—The difference of potential between
the middle plate and the positive electrode of the lamp depends
to a considerable extent upon the position of the middle plate.
Supposing the plate to be placed with its plane perpendicular
to the plane of the carbon horse-shoe and then moved to
various positions between the two legs of the carbon, it is
found that the difference of potential between the plate and
the positive electrode will have different values according to

the lamp, the supporting platinum wire carrying the platinum
middle plate could be bent so as to displace the plate from its
symmetrical position as regards the two carbon legs, and
bring it nearer to one or other of the legs. In several
different positions the current flowing through the milampere
meter, when connected between the middle plate and positive
electrode, was measured, the lamp being kept meanwhile at
the same working electromotive force.
   Estimating as nearly as possible the fractional distances,
the plate was placed at distances from the negative leg equal
to 110-, 1}, 3‘5, i, and 9D of the whole distance between the
positive and negative legs, and the lamp being taken throu h
a de<U+FB01>nite cycle of volts, the potential-difference between t e
middle plate and the positive electrode was measured with
the milamperemeter. The results are collected in the follow

carbon loop and the middle plate M in various positions, the
galvanometer G being inserted between the late M and the

positive electrode of the lamp is represented by the magnitude
of the vertical ordinate of each curve.      For every one of the
different voltages at which the lamp is worked, there is there
fore a curve representing by its ordinates this current strength
through a galvanometer inserted between the middle plate,
placed at these positions, and the positive electrode of the
lamp, and it is seen that there is a minimum value for this
current at a position equal to Z of the whole distance between
the legs reckoned from the negative leg.
   Imagine the middle plate therefore connected through a
galvanometer with the positive electrode of the lamp, and let
the middle plate be <U+FB01>rst placed close to the positive leg and
then moved continuously nearer towards the negative leg.
The current through the galvanometer would <U+FB01>rst fall of? as
the plate receded from the positive leg, and after reaching
a minimum at a point about % of the whole distance between
the legs reckoned from the positive leg, would rise up to a
maximum when the middle plate was as nearly in contact with
the negative leg as possible without actually touching it.
   § 6. Ewperiment 3.—In order to explore more thoroughly
the action of the different portions of the incandescence carbon
conductor in producing this effect, a lamp was taken having
a horse-shoe shaped carbon, and a pair of small platinum cylin
                              Fig. 5.
                      LAMP N0 3
ders, held on platinum wires sealed through the glass, so
placed as to embrace without touching the carbon conductor.
One of these cylinders, X, was placed so as to embrace the
carbon near the bottom 0f the leg, and the other, Y, near the
spring of the arch (see <U+FB01>g. 5). These small cylinders had a

64                 Prof. J. A. Fleming on the
length of about 12 millims. and a diameter of about 8 millims.
so that the distance from the carbon <U+FB01>lament to the inner
surface of the cylinder was about 3 or 4 millims. The lamp
had a rather thick carbon, and at an electromotive force of
48 volts took a current of 1'32 amperes to raise it to its
normal incandescence of 18‘8 candles, corresponding to 3'3
watts per candle-power.         This lamp will be alluded to as
Lamp No. 3.
   It is obvious that there are four possible arrangements in
which a current can be obtained between an embracing
cylinder and a positive electrode of the lamp. These are
illustrated in <U+FB01>g. 6, in which the horse-shoe shaped line stands
                               Fig.

for the carbon <U+FB01>lament, X and Y are the platinum c 'linders,
P and N are the positive and negative electrodes of the lamp,
and G is the galvanometer.
   We will call these arrangements (1), (2) , (3), (4), as <U+FB01>gured.
It will be seen that if we imagine the carbon <U+FB01>lament straight
ened out, these four arrangements are equivalent to being
able to slide a cylinder along the <U+FB01>lament into four positions,
and in each position measuring the potential-difference be
tween the cylinder and the positive end of the carbon. We
are thus able to place an embracing collecting-plate at four
different places along the carbon conductor, and determine
the potential-di<U+FB01>'erence between this embracing cylinder and
the positive electrode of the lamp. A series of experiments
was made with lamp No. 3, in which the working volts of the
lamp were raised to various values, and in each case the

the foot of the negative leg of the carbon as possible. If the
cylinder is placed near the top of the negative leg that
potential-difference becomes less. If the cylinder is taken
near the top of the positive leg or near the base of the positive
leg itis least, and it seems to be a minimum when the cylinder

surrounds the top of the positive leg, and is as far as possible
away from the foot of the negative leg.        We have here a
con<U+FB01>rmation of the fact observed with respect to lamp N0. 4,
viz. : that the potential-difference between the positive lamp
electrode and the metal plate held somewhere near the incan
descent carbon conductor is greatest when the plate is as near
as possible to the foot of the negative leg or negative elec
trode.
   In this lamp N0. 3, in which in all positions the cylinder
employed is placed very near some point on the incandescing
conductor, the current through the galvanometer joining the
positive electrode and the cylinder has never been observed
to jump or to take double values as in the case of lamp No. 4.
   If a sensitive galvanometer is connected to the two insu
lated cylinders X and Y, and if in addition there is a battery
in series with this galvanometer, then no current can be de
tected in such an arrangement even when the battery has an
electromotive force of 120 volts, whether the lamp carbon is
incandescent or not. Just as in the case of lamp N0. 4, the
current obtained by connecting either cylinder with the nega
tive electrode of the lamp is excessively small.
   In order to obtain curves showing the mode of variation of
the effective difference of potential between one or other of
the metal cylinders X and Y and the positive electrode of the
lamp, a set of observations was made on the lamp when sub
mitted to various working voltages, and at the same time the
milamperemeter was connected <U+FB01>rst between the positive
electrode and cylinder X and then between the positive
electrode and cylinder Y, with the following tabulated
results (p. 68).
   These results, when plotted out in curves in which hori
zontal ordinates represent the working volts of the lamp and
the vertical ones the milliampere currents going through the
galvanometer, in both cases have the same general form as
curve N0. 1 plotted for the case of lamp No. 4.

     § 7. Experiment 4.—-The magnitude of the current found
 on connecting any galvanometer between one of the cylinders
 and the positive electrode of the lamp was found to be de
 pendent to some degree on the perfection of the vacuum.
 Lamp No. 3 when <U+FB01>rst made had not a very perfect vacuum.
 A series of measurements was, however, made with it, and the
 same repeated after re-exhaustion. The results are tabulated
 together below.

   The imperfection of the vacuum is indicated by the higher
watts per candle-power absorbed at low voltages, and we
see that at any given working pressure the potential-difference
between the positive electrode and the cylinder Y embracing
the top of the negative leg is greater when the vacuum is
imperfect than when it is very good. The presence of residual
air tends to bring down the potential of the embracing
cylinder more nearly to that of the carbon at the point adja
cent to it.
   § 8. Experiment 5.—A series of observations was next
made in which the potential-di<U+FB01>'erence between the middle
plate and the positive electrode was determined by the aid of
a condenser. If a condenser of capacity C in microfarads is
charged to a potential of V volts and discharged through a
ballistic galvanometer, we can determine the ballistic constant
of the galvanometer. A second observation of a like nature

70                 Prof. J. A. Fleming on the
in which the “ throw ” of the same galvanometer is observed
when the same condenser is charged by contact with two
points concerning which we require to know the potential
di<U+FB02>'erence, gives us the means of calculating the electrostatic
potential-difference in volts. A condenser of '987 microfarad
capacity carefully determined was charged to a potential of
54 volts and discharged through a certain ballistic galvano
 meter having a needle whose periodic time of vibration was
 about three seconds. The resulting “ throw ” of the galvano
 meter was .59 30'. Hence a discharge of 54 X '987=53‘3
 microcoulombs through the galvanometer produces a “ throw”
 of 5° 30’. Neglecting a very small correction for the loga
 rithmic decrement, in this case not of importance, we have
 for the ballistic constant B the value
               53'3=R sin 315(5" 30’) =R x '04798;
 hence                      R=1110.
    The same condenser was then connected between the
 middle plate and positive electrode of lam No. 4 and then
 discharged through the same ballistic ga vanometer. The
 lamp was subjected to a working pressure of 39 volts as de
 termined by a corrected voltmeter attached to the electrodes
 of the lamp. The charge of the condenser was sent through
 the ballistic galvanometer, and a “throw” of 4° obtained.
 If v is the potential-difference between the middle plate and
 positive electrode of the lamp, we have the following equation
 for v in terms of the ballistic constant and angle of “ throw”:
                       '987 v: 1110 sin 2°
                              = 1110 X '0349
 or                         v = —%;,i9 = 39 nearly.
    The potential-di<U+FB02>'erence between the middle plate and the
 positive electrode as determined by this method is therefore
 exactly the same as the potential-difference between the positive
 and negative electrodes of the lamp. In other words, when the
 <U+FB01>lament is brought to full incandescence, the middle metal
  plate is brought to the same potential as the negative elec
  trode of the lamp. This observation was repeated with several
  other lamps having middle plates in various positions and 'of
 various forms, and always with the same result, viz., that the
  potential of the middle plate when insulated is brought down
 nearly to that of the negative electrode.

 tained by the condenser method and to eliminate all the
 conditions which necessarily exist when we attempt to
 measure potential—difference galvanometrically, an electro
 static method of measuring the potential-difference at any
 instant between the metal plate and the positive electrode of
 the lamp was next used. For this purpose a Kelvin multi
 cellular electrostatic voltmeter was employed to determine
the potential-difference between the positive and negative
 electrodes of the lamp and between the positive electrode of
 the lamp and the middle plate, with the following results :—
    A lamp (No. 4) having the plate <U+FB01>xed between the carbon
 legs was raised to various working voltages and the potential
 di<U+FB01>'erences above mentioned taken.

   These observations con<U+FB01>rm conclusively the previous re
sults. The insulated metal middle plate is in this case brought
to the same potential as the base of the negative leg of the
carbon; and hence, on measuring electrostatically the poten
tial-difference between that metal plate and the positive
electrode of the lamp, we <U+FB01>nd it to be the same as the poten
tial-difference between the two electrodes of the lamp.
   § 10. Experiment 7.—In order to see if this was the case
when the metal collecting-plate had a very small surface
placed at some distance from the negative electrode of the
lamp, the lamp called No. l was employed. In this lamp a
platinum wire threaded through the turns of a double spiral
100 volt carbon lamp (see § 11). The lamp was raised to
various working voltages, and the electrostatic voltmeter
employed to measure at the same time the static potential
di<U+FB01>'erence between the positive electrode of the lamp and the
platinum wire, with the following results :—

    The <U+FB01>gures in the above Table No. 8 show that when the
 surface of the collecting-plate is very small and is placed
 some distance from the base of the negative leg of the carbon
 it is brought down only to the potential of some point (probably
 the nearest point) on the carbon conductor, and that there
 fore the potential-difi'erence between the plate and positive
 electrode of the lamp is somewhat less than the potential
 ditt'erence between the working terminals of the lamp. At
 the same time, however, the electrostatic voltmeter shows no
 measurable potential-difference between the negative terminal
 of the lamp and the platinum wire, and the most sensitive
 galvanometer between these points gives no indication of any
current.
     By means of the electrostatic voltmeter it was, however,
 ascertained that in those cases in which the metallic plate
 presented considerable surface (several square centimetres)
 and was placed so that some portion of it was not removed by
 more than a centimetre or two from the base of the negative
 leg of the carbon, it was brought down almost immediately
 to the potential of the negative terminal of the lamp. If the
 middle plate is placed at a little distance from the carbon
 100p then, on testing by the condenser method, it is found
 that the plate is not instantly brought down to the potential
 of the negative terminal, but that some few seconds have to
 elapse before this is the case.
     § 11. A series of experiments was then undertaken in order
 to determine the effect of varying (1) the surface, and (2) the
 position of the metal plate in the bulb, and in these experi
 ments the plate was sometimes of platinum and sometimes of
 aluminium. In all cases the vacuum was a very perfect one,
 any occluded gases in the plates being got rid of by special
 means.                                                          '   .

   Experiment 8.—A normal lOO-volt carbon-<U+FB01>lament lamp,

<U+FB01>g. 7) had a short stout platinum wire ('024 inch diam.)

sealed across the bulb so as to thread through, without
touching, the spirals of the carbon. The lamp at 100 volts
took 1‘54 amperes and gave an illumination of 40 candles,
equivalent to a power absorption of 3'9 watts per candle-power.
The vacuum was very good. This lamp will hereafter be
 called Lamp No. 1. As before, no current could be detected
 by a galvanometer when joined up between the platinum wire
 and the negative electrode, but when the galvanometer was
 connected between the platinum wire and the positive elec—
trode of the lamp a current of some milliamperes was found
passing through it. As in the case of lamp No. 4, this lamp
 was characterized by a great tendency to change suddenly
the value of the current <U+FB02>owing through the galvanometer
 when the working volts on the lamp were kept perfectly con
stant. In the <U+FB01>rst series of observations the milamperemeter
was employed to measure the current <U+FB02>owing between the
positive electrode of the lamp and the platinum wire when it
 was connected between these points, and at and beyond a
 working-pressure of 90 volts or so the galvanometer would
often jump suddenly from one reading to another, when the
lamp working volts were kept perfectly constant.
   In the. following table, No. 9, are collected the results when
the working pressure of the lamp was gradually raised from
80 to 100 volts :—

       These <U+FB01>gures show that at any de<U+FB01>nite working electro
 motive force of the lamp the current between the positive
 electrode and the middle plate has very variable values, and
  that it suddenly changes from one value to another without
any apparent reason, the working volts of the lamp remaining
constant all the time.
       It‘ the surface of the collecting-plate is large, say several
square centimetres, the potential-di<U+FB01>'erence existing between
it and the positive electrode is not found to be so much
reduced by. attempting to measure it with a galvanometer
 of about 6000 ohms resistance as it is when the collecting
  wire presents, as in this lamp No.1, only a small total
 surface of about one square centimetre.
        § 12. Experiment 9.—A horse-shoe carbon <U+FB01>lament, taking
   1'3 ampere of current at a working-pressure of 42'5 volts,
had a middle plate made of a long piece of platinum wire
bent up in a zigzag shape so as to form a rectangular-shaped
 grating (see <U+FB01>g. 8).              The object of this was to ascertain

                  Edison Efect in Glow Lamps.                  75
whether a middle plate offering a surface pierced with many
apertures was as effective in producing the current as a solid

plate of about the same general outline.      Practically it was
found that this was the case.
    The magnitude of the currents obtained at various working
 voltages are of the same magnitude approximately as in the
case of a lamp like No. 4, that is to say some 3—4 milliamperes
 at full incandescence.
    § 13. A set of experiments was then undertaken with the
 object of examining the special effect of varying the position
 of the middle plate, and a series of lamps was used in which
 platinum or aluminium plates held on platinum wires were
 placed in the lamp bulb, or in tubes opening into it, in various
 positions. These lamps are generally 50-volt lamps of usual
 type, and had single horse-shoe shaped <U+FB01>laments.
    Expe'r'inwnt lO.-—A lamp-bulb had a side tube blown on it
 (see <U+FB01>g. 9) and a plate about 6centims. long and 1'5 centims.
 wide welded to a platinum wire was sealed into it. The
 platinum plate was placed vertically and edgeways in the side
 tube and the side tube was in such a position that the plane
 of the‘ platinum plate coincided with the plane of the horse
 shoe <U+FB01>lament. This lamp, called henceforth No. 2, when
 worked at 48 volts took 1'3 amperes of current and gave a
 light of 17'5 candles, equivalent to a power-consumption of
 3'55 watts per candle-power. The vacuum was very good.
 In the case of this lamp the current between the positive
 electrode of the lamp and the platinum plate was found to be
 numerically very much smaller at the usual working pressure
 of the lamp than was found to be the case in those lamps in

which the middle plate was placed between the carbon legs or

   The current obtained at any de<U+FB01>nite working voltage was
considerabl greater when the le of the carbon nearest the
plate was t e positive leg than w en it was the negative leg.

   If we compare together the results obtained with this
lamp No. 2, in which a plate is placed edgeways on and
outside the carbon loop, with the results obtained in the case
of lamp No. 3, in which the plates embraced the carbon in
the form of cylinders, we see the difference produced by the
change of position of the plate. Both these lamps, No. 2 and
No. 3,are 48-volt lamps when working at normal incandescence.
Referring to Table No. 7 in § 7, we see that for lamp No. 3
at 48 volts the voltage difference of the positive electrode and
the platinum cylinders was respectively 13'2 and 18‘3 volts
as measured with the Elliott galvanometer, and this indicated
a current of about 1'3 and 1'8 milliamperes <U+FB02>owing through
the resistances from the positive lamp electrode to the metal
plate ; but in the case of lamp No. 2, at 48 volts the potential
difference between the platinum plate and the positive lamp
electrode was only '2 volt, and this corresponded to a current
of '03 milliampere nearly. Accordingly the current is greatly
diminished when the collecting-plate is placed edgeways to
and someway outside the loop of the carbon. At normal
incandescence the current between the positive lamp electrode
and the middle plate when joined by the galvanometer is
about '03 or '04 milliampere when the positive leg of the
 carbon is nearest the middle plate, but only about '02 or '03
milliampere when the negative leg is nearest the plate.
    § 14. Experiment ll.——In order to compare the previous
results just given with those obtained when the collecting
plate was placed broadside to and yet outside the carbon loop,
                              Fig. 10.
                      LAMP NO 6
 a lamp was made as in <U+FB01>g. 10 in which an aluminium plate
 was held on a platinum wire just outside one leg of the

  78                            Prof. J. A. Fleming on the
  carbon and with its plane perpendicular to the plane of the
  horse-shoe.
     The aluminium plate was 5 centims. long and 1 centim.
wide, and distant from the nearest leg of the carbon about
'5 centim. This lamp therefore differed from lamp no. 4 in
having the plate outside the carbon loop rather than between
the legs. It may be noticed that in this lamp the current
here obtained by joining the positive lamp electrode to the
plate through a galvanometer was slightly greater when the
leg nearest the plate was negative than when it was the positive
leg, whereas in the case of lamp No. 2 it is just the reverse.
This lamp exhibited also the same effect as lamp No. 4, in
that the current <U+FB02>owing between electrode and plate is very
 liable to “jump” from one value to another even when the
lamp is kept at constant volts. The following tabular result
of the observations shows this. This lamp is called Lamp
No. 6 and was a 50-volt horse-shoe carbon lamp, taking 1'33
amperes of current at a working electromotive force of
50 volts.

   Experiment l2.—ln this case a glass tube about eighteen
inches long and three-quarters of an inch in diameter was
attached to a lamp bulb. The end of the glass tube furthest
from the bulb was closed and an aluminium plate welded to a
platinum wire was sealed in near this closed end. The plate
 ad a length of about 3 centimetres and a width of about
1 centimetre. The tube formed an extension of the bulb
space, and accordingly this arrangement formed a device by
which a metal plate could be removed to a distance of some
eighteen inches from the incandescent conductor contained in
the bulb. On placing this lamp on a circuit and bringing
the carbon to normal incandescence and connecting the ter
minals of the Elliott galvanometer respectively to the aluminium
plate and the positive electrode of the lamp, a very small
current was found to be passing through it, not, however,
exceeding one ten-thousandth of a milliampere. When the
galvanometer was joined in between the aluminium plate'and'
the negative leg of the carbon no current whatever could be
detected with this galvanometer, which was suf<U+FB01>ciently sensitive

 plate as before, and the tube was bent up about the middle at

the bulb, which was that of an ordinary 50-volt 16 candle
power lamp, was rendered incandescent by being connected
 to a circuit of appropriate electromotive force, and the Elliott
 galvanometer connected in between the aluminium plate and
 the positiVe electrode of the lamp, a current of not more than
about one twenty-thousandth of a milliampere was detected.
The fact that the “ Edison etfect ” was extinguished when the

 above Table No. 12 are compared with those in Table 2 for a
 similarly constructed lamp with no tubular shield we <U+FB01>nd that
 the magnitude of the current <U+FB02>owing from the positive elec

 same. The lamp No. 9 was then placed on the circuit in such
 a manner that the leg shielded by the glass tube was the
 negative leg, and a similar series of observations of the current
 between the positive leg (new the uncovered leg) and the
 middle plate was made. The results were as follows in Table

   On comparing the results in Table No. 13 and the previous
one No. 12 we see what an immense reduction in the current
<U+FB02>owing between the positive electrode and the middle plate is
produced by shielding the negative leg.          Hence the action in
virtue of which the current is produced is greatly interfered
with by enclosing or covering up the negative leg of the
carbon.    In this particular case at 51 volts, the current
between the positive electrode of the lamp and the middle
plate when the negative leg is covered up is only 31$ of that
which it is when the positive leg is covered up. The results
in Tables Nos. 12 and 13 are plotted together in Curve No. 6.

 the carbon legs (see <U+FB01>g. 14) was surrounded by an aluminium
 cylinder extending nearly the whole length of the leg, and
 also a middle plate of aluminium was placed between the
 legs. Both the plate and the cylinder were held on platinum
  wires scaled through the glass. The lamp took 1'25 amperes
  of current at 41'5 volts.

     Experiment 15.—The lamp was placed on a circuit so that
 the leg shielded by the aluminium cylinder was the positive
 leg. The milamperemeter was then connected between the
positive electrode of the lamp and the middle plate, and the
usual measurements made. It was found that the current
 “jumped ” a good deal, and that high and low values of the
                            Fig. 14.
galvanometer current occurred, even when the terminal
voltage of the lamp was kept perfectly constant.
    The lamp was then reversed on the circuit so that the
shielded leg was the negative one, all other arrangements
remaining the same. The current now between the positive
 electrode and the middle plate was practically zero, at any
 rate too small to be measured with this galvanometer.
 Hence we see that shielding the negative le , whether by
glass or a metallic cylinder, entirely cuts off t e production
of a current between the positive lamp electrode and the
middle plate.
    § 18. Experiment ]6.—Another series of experiments was
made with the lamp N0. 10 in which the galvanometer was
connected between the positive electrode of the lamp and the
aluminium cylinder (see <U+FB01>g. 15), the leg inside the cylinder
being either the positive or the negative leg. In this case
the middle plate remained unused and insulated and acted as
a shield between the cylinder and the carbon leg which was
not contained in the cylinder.
    It was found that when the cylinder surrounds the negative
leg and its surface is, therefore, as much exposed to it as
possible the current is a maximum, but that when it includes

reason of the fact that it opposes less surface to the negative

it and the negative leg of the carbon.
   § 19. Experiment 17.—In order <U+FB01>nally to demonstrate
that the negative leg of the carbon loop was the chief active
agent in this production of a current between the middle

surface of the metal middle plate, and when placed up against
it it shielded one surface from, and when jerked on one side
it exposed that surface to, the carbon leg opposite to that
surface. This lamp (called No. 5) was set on the circuit in
the <U+FB01>rst place so that the leg of the carbon horse—shoe
opposite to the mica-shielded side of the middle plate was
the positive leg. If the carbon Was brought up to an incan
descence corresponding to about 3'5 or 4 watts er candle
power and the galvanometer connected between t e positive
electrode and the middle plate, then it was found that the
effect on the gaIVanometer current which was produced by
the interposition or withdrawal of the screen of mica between
the positive leg and the plate was not very great. It reduced
the current through the galvanometer from about '44 mil—
liampere to '38 milliampere.         If, however, the current
<U+FB02>owing through the lamp carbon is reversed in direction so
that the mica screen is interposed on that side of the middle
metal plate which faces the negative leg, the result is very
different. When the screen is down, the current <U+FB02>owing
through the galvanometer from the positive electrode to the
middle plate being as before '44 milliampere, the interposition
of the mica screen on the side of the plate facing the
negative leg reduced the current at once to zero.       We <U+FB01>nd
therefore, that the interposition of a mica screen between the
 middle plate and the negative leg reduces to zero the current
 <U+FB02>owing between the positive lamp electrode and the middle
 plate. As in all other lamps with a middle plate set exactly
 between the legs, the current through the galvanometer
joining the middle plate and positive electrode is very liable
 to “ jump ” from a low to a higher value or vice versd. When
 the current has its higher Value corresponding to any given
 voltage on the lamp terminals, the e<U+FB02>'ect of screening is less
 marked, and although the interposition of the mica screen on
 the side facing the negative leg has an effect of reducing
 the current <U+FB02>owing through the galvanometer connected
 between the middle plate and positive electrode it is not by
 any means reduced to zero.
    §20. The foregoing experiments a<U+FB02>'ord proof that the
 production of the current through a galvanometer joined
 between the positive electrode of the lamp and a metal plate
 placed somewhere in the vacuous bulb, is an e<U+FB02>'ect due chie<U+FB02>y
 to the negative leg of the carbon, and that shielding the
 negative leg by enclosing it in a glass or metal tube, or
 covering with a mica screen that surface of the plate which
 is exposed to the negative leg, either quite prevents or greatly
 reduces the production of this current. The experiments

‘88                   Prof. J. A. Fleming on the
also have shown that the magnitude of the current <U+FB02>owing
through the galvanometer is increased by bringing the plate
near to the base of the negative leg, or, better still, making
 the metal plate in the form of a cylinder and making this
 cylinder surround the negative leg near its base; and cor
 respondingly it is diminished by removing it from the
 negative leg to a considerable distance, or by shielding this
 collecting-plate from the radiation from the negative leg of
 the carbon. The experiments with the condenser have also
 given evidence that when an insulated metal plate is sealed
 into a lamp this plate is brought down either instantly
  or in a very short period of time to the potential of the
 negative leg near its base or to that of the negative electrode
 of the lamp. In looking for an explanation of these facts we
 are assisted by our previous knowledge that in'carbon incan
 1descence lamps, when working at an e<U+FB01>iciency equivalent to
 v3 to 4 watts per candle-power, there is a gradual loss of
  carbon from all parts of the conductor. We know also that
 the carbon molecules which are projected from the conductor
  are thrown off into a space so highly vacuous that their mean
 :free path is of a length comparable with, or greater than that
  of the dimensions of the glass bulb. The existence of
  moleculartshadows in incandescence lamps" affords evidence
  that from intensely heated portions of the carbon conductor
   carbon molecules are projected in straight lines and move
 freely forward until they impinge against the glass. Com
   mercial experience informs us that at and above a tem
   perature corresponding to 3 watts per candle-power this loss
   of carbon becomes very rapid and thins away the <U+FB01>lament
   in one place, or generally reduces the diameter of the carbon
   conductor. Hence we have every reason to believe that
   when in a normal state of incandescence the carbon conductor
   in a lamp is throwing off in all directions carbon molecules,
   and that in the vacuum usually obtained the mean free path of
  these projected molecules is comparable with the dimensions
   of the vessel containing the conductor. The whole of the
   experiments which are detailed here seem to be capable of
 . consistent interpretation if we may justi<U+FB01>ably make the
   hypothesis that these carbon molecules or atoms so projected
   from the conductor when intensely heated by the current
   <U+FB02>owing through it are all negatively charged. Some of the
   observed facts seem to point to the conclusion that the
 - molecules projected from the incandescent conductor, Whether
   they are portions of the conductor itself or molecules of the
   residual gases, respectively carry away negative charges

 proportional in magnitude to the potential of the conductor
 at the point from which they are thrown o<U+FB02>'.           The may,
 therefore, be looked upon as condensers of small but e<U+FB01>nite
  electrostatic capacity charged to the potential (negative)
  of that part of the incandescent conductor at which theyv
  separate from it.       We have then in addition to explain
  how it comes to pass that there are few or no projected
  molecules charged positively. Two suggestions may be made
  on this point: either the radiation of matter is wholly con<U+FB01>ned
  to that half of the conductor at a negative potential or the
  incandescent carbon molecule thrown off from the heated
  conductor cannot retain a positive charge. There is much
  to lead to the conclusion that from all parts of the incan
  descent carbon conductor there is a constant radiation of
  matter carrying a negative electric charge. The nearer down
  to the negative electrode of the carbon we select our point
  of observation the greater is this molecular charge found to
  be. It will be convenient to denote this conveyance of
  electric charge by moving charged molecules by the term
   molecular electrovection. We can then state the hypothesis
   thus—from all portions of the negative leg of the carbon
   loop a process of molecular electrovection is going on when
   the conductor is incandescent, the molecular charge being
   negative, and equal in potential to that of the point on the
   conductor from which it is projected.
      § 21. On the assumption that a molecular shower of nega
   tively charged atoms was being projected against the middle
  'plate when the conductor of the lamp was incandescent it
   was considered probable that a positively charged conductor
   connected to the middle plate would be discharged, and this
   was found to be the case.
      E.'t'pe1-z'ment 18.—A lamp of the form of No. 4, having a
   middle metal plate placed between the carbon legs, had its
   middle plate connected to one terminal of the Elliott gal
, vanometer. The other terminal of the galvanometer was
   connected to one terminal of a condenser of 5 microfarads
   capacity.      The other terminal of the condenser was connected
   by a wire to the gas pipes of the laboratory. The lamp was
   actuated by secondary batteries (see <U+FB01>g. 17) not very well
   insulated. If the condenser was charged to a potential of
  '50 volts so that the plate next the 'galvanometer was posi
  tively charged, then this positive charge was instantly dis
   charged when the carbon was rendered incandescent. If,
   however, the plate of the condenser in connexion with the
   middle plate through the galvanometer was charged negatively
  the condenser was not discharged when the lamp was illumi

 nated by rendering its carbon incandescent. It is a very
 striking experiment to see a condenser charged with this
 amount (250 microcoulombs) of electricity instantly discharged
 when its positive coating is brought into connexion with the
 middle plate of such a lamp. The discharge may be brought
                                Fig. 17.

 about either by joining up the positive side of the condenser
 to the middle plate <U+FB01>rst, and then rendering the carbon of the
 lamp incandescent by switching on the lamp, or the lamp
 may be <U+FB01>rst of all illuminated and then the junction of the
 condenser effected.      In both cases the middle plate when
 positively electri<U+FB01>ed is instantly discharged.
    It was found that if the lamp carbon is rendered incandescent
 bya highly insulated secondary battery then in order to produce
 the discharge, the plate of the condenser not in connexion
 with the middle plate, and which is negatively charged, must
 be somewhere connected with the battery circuit. It does
 not matter, however, whether the wire from the negative
 side of the condenser is in connexion with the positive or the
 negative pole of the secondary battery actuating the lamp;
 all that is necessary is that the negative side of the condenser
 should be in conducting connexion with the circuit of the
 incandescent carbon.       The experiment may be interpreted
 by considering that this negative charge of the condenser
 can escape out of the incandescent conductor and discharge
 across the highly vacuous space to the positively electri<U+FB01>ed
cool middle metal plate; but that a positive charge cannot be
 discharged out of the hot conductor, or, which amounts to the
 same thing, a negative charge cannot discharge across from
 the cool metal plate to the incandescent carbon which is
positivel charged. We have then a unilateral conductivity
exhibite by this highly vacuous space bounded by two

electrodes one of which is incandescent and the other of
which is cold. Negative electricity is discharged at once
out of the hot surface but not out of the cold, and a
negative discharge can take place from hot to cold but not
vice versd. When the discharge of a charged condenser is
effected by connecting (the positive plate, through a galvano
meter, with a metal plate sealed into the lamp and the
negative plate with the lamp circuit, and then switching on the
lamp, there is a curious instant of delay before the discharge
begins. When the metal plate is placed very near the negative
leg of the carbon the discharge of the condenser is complete
in one instant. This the case when a lamp of the type No. 4
 (<U+FB01>g. 18) is used. If, however, we employ a lamp of the type
No. 2 (<U+FB01>g. 10), in which the metal plate is at some distance
from the negative leg of the carbon, the discharge of the
condenser is long drawn out and the electric charge in it is as
it were tapped oti' slowly and not in one short sharp discharge.
   Moreover this effect of discharging a condenser takes place
only when the carbon is above a fair red heat. At brilliant
incandescence and when the carbon is above a temperature
corresponding to 3 watts per candle-power, the discharging
power of a lamp of the type of N0. 4 is very great. A con
denser of 10 or 20 microt'arads capacity charged to 50 volts
is discharged instantly if its positive plate is connected to the
metal plate placed not far from the negative end of the
incandescent carbon conductor.
   The foregoing results were con<U+FB01>rmed with lamps of other
types. Using, for instance, a lamp like No. 6 with the
aluminium plate placed outside the carbon horse-shoe and
near the leg, the same discharging power for positive elec
tricity was found.    It was not dependent on the direction of
the current through the lamp carbon, although it seemed a
little more vigorous when the leg nearest the plate was the
negative leg. As above observed, the rate of discharge was
much reduced when employing a lamp having the metal plate
placed edgeways on to the carbon and some way from it, as,
for instance, when employing a lamp of the form of No. 2.
   § 22. Ewperiment l9.—-A series of experiments was in this
case also tried to determine the effect of shielding the negative
leg of the carbon. The lamp no. 9 was employed, in which
one leg of the carbon was enclosed in a glass tube connecting
the positive late of a charged condenser through a galvano
meter with t e middle plate of the lamp, and the negative
plate of the condenser somewhere to the battery circuit; it
was found that when the shielded leg of the carbon was the
positive leg the condenser was discharged as before. If,

 92                Prof. J. A. Fleming on the
however, the shielded leg or leg enclosed in the glass tube
was made the negative leg, which could be done by reversing
the current through the carbon conductor, then the condenser
was not discharged when its positive plate was connected
with the middle plate.
   The same fact was less perfectly exhibited by employing
the lamp with the middle plate having a removable mica
shield on one side. We are thus able to assure ourselves that
the active agent in producing this discharging effect upon a
positively charged body connected to the middle plate is the
negative leg of the carbon conductor. The experiments were
varied in many Ways, but all pointed to the conclusion that if
a charged condenser is connected to two terminals, one of
which is a metal plate and the other a carbon conductor, both
enclosed in a high vacuum but yet separated from each other
by an inch or so of distance, the condenser is discharged
instantly when the carbon terminal is rendered highly
incandescent, provided that the negative plate of the con
denser is in connexion with it.                               ~
   §23. If the condenser is left in contact with the middle
plate under some circumstances, not only is it discharged if
previously charged but is charged again in an opposite
direction.
   Experiment 20.--A condenser of 5 microfarads capacity
perfectly discharged has its poles or terminals connected for
one instant, one with the middle plate of No. 4 lamp and the
other with the positive electrode of the lamp (see <U+FB01>g. 18).

    §24. In considering the behaviour of the heated carbon
electrode and the cool metal plate in their respective powers
of discharging the positive or negative charge of the con
denser, it seemed that the fundamental fact was the power of
the heated surface to discharge negative electricity out of
itself. Hence arose the question, how lar the observed facts
would be modi<U+FB01>ed if the middle metal plate itself could be
also heated. One way by which this might have been done
would have been to have rendered this plate incandescent by
heating it by radiant heat concentrated by means of a powerful
mirror or lens.     Some experiments tried in this way were
not satisfactory, and consequently a method was adopted in
which a middle plate of carbon could be rendered incandescent
electrically.
    Ewpew'ment 21.—A vacuum tube was provided with two
carbon conductors (see fig. 19), one the ordinary carbon
                             Fig. 19.

S of a 4 volt lamp. The smaller carbon was sealed in the
usual way through the glass and placed so as to stand
symmetrically between the legs of the larger carbon loop.
   The smaller carbon could be rendered incandescent by an
insulated battery of <U+FB01>fteen secondary cells, appropriate

94                Prof. J. A. Fleming 0n the
resistance being introduced. The larger carbon also could
be rendered incandescent by the proper electromotive force.
If the smaller carbon was kept cold and employed simply as
a third electrode or middle plate, all the phenomena previously
described as happening with metal middle plates of aluminium
or platinum took place. If the small (cold) carbon loop is
connected through a galvanometer with the positive electrode
of the larger carbon loop when this last is rendered incan
descent by a current, we <U+FB01>nd as usual a current of a few
milliamperes passing through the galvanometer from the
positive electrode of the larger carbon to the small carbon.
If the small carbon (still cold) is connected through the
galvanometer to the negative electrode of the larger carbon
we get no current. This is the normal effect, and it is the
same for a cold carbon conductor used as a middle plate as
for ametal middle plate.
   Experiment 22.—The next experiment consisted in making
this small carbon incandescent by an insulated secondary
battery, appropriate resistance being inserted so that the
carbon was brought to the normal condition of temperature as
indicated by its incandescence. When this was done the
galvanometer was inserted between the positive electrode of
the large carbon loop and one of the electrodes of the small
carbon loop. A current was obtained as before. On con
necting the galvanometer between the negative electrode of
the large carbon loop and one of the electrodes of the small
carbon loop a current of nearly equal value was now obtained.
In this last experiment it was found to be immaterial whether
the terminal of the galvanometer was joined to the positive or
to the negative electrode of the small carbon loop. Hence
we <U+FB01>nd that when the small carbon loop is not incandescent
and is used as a middle plate or electrode, it is brought down
together with the insulated battery attached to it to the same
potential as the negative end of the large incandescent carbon,
and we get as usual a current through a galvanometer con
nected between the positive electrode of the large incandescent
carbon and any point on the small cold carbon, and no current
between the negative electrode of the large hot carbon and
the small cold one. On rendering the smaller carbon loop
incandescent this is all changed. The smaller carbon, new
hot, is not brought down to the potential of the negative ends
of the larger carbon, and we get a current through a galvano
meter connected between either positive or negative electrode
of the large hot carbon and any point on the circuit of the
smaller equally hot carbon.

50 volts.   \Vhen the positive plate of this charged condenser
was attached to the carbon L and the-negative side to the
carbon S, then on making L incandescent by its own
insulated battery and keeping S cold, the condenser was
found not to be discharged when insulated and tested by a
galvanometer. If, however, the same charged condenser was
connected in the same way to the two carbons and the
carbon S, to which the negative side of the condenser was
attached, was made incandescent, the condenser was instantly
discharged.    If the direction of the charging of the condenser
was reversed the same rule was found to hold good.                         The
 condenser was discharged if the negatively charged plate of the
condenser was connected to the incandescent carbon loop,butnot
if it was connected to the cold carbon 100p. Beginning with
 the condenser charged and connecting it in between the two
 carbon loops, neither of them being incandescent, then the
 condenser was discharged instantly if that loop to which the
negatively charged side of the condenser was attached was
rendered incandescent, but not discharged if the loop to
which the positive side of the condenser was connected was
rendered incandescent.     If both loops were rendered incan

96                Prof. J. A. Fleming on the
descent simultaneously the condenser in any case was dis
charged, but apparently at an accelerated rate.           These
experiments show again that if two carbon electrodes are
sealed into a bi h vacuum, negative electricity escapes very
freely out of eit er electrode if it is rendered incandescent,
but that the escape or discharge of positive electricity is not
in the same way facilitated by heating the positive electrode.
Accordingly a highly vacuous space bounded by two carbon
electrodes separated by a distance less than the mean free
path of the gaseous molecule at that pressure, presents a
unilateral conductivity when one of these electrodes is cold
and the other highly incandescent. For if the hot electrode
is connected to a negatively charged body and the cold
electrode to a positively charged body, discharge takes place
across the vacuous space, but it' the charges are reversed then
no discharge takes place. The negative charge can escape
from the heated electrode but not from the cold one.
   §26. Experiment 24.-—The question of the apparent uni
lateral conductivity of the vacuous space bounded by a hot
and a cold electrode was then further examined by the aid of
the lamp N0. 6 formerly used.
   In this lamp an aluminium plate is sealed into the vacuum
and placed just outside the carbon horse-shoe. It a sensitive
galvanometer (the high resistance Elliott galvanometer) is
joined up between the metal plate and the negative electrode
of the lamp, then, as in other cases when the lamp is in action,
                              Fig. 21.
                  no cunasu'r
 no current of a magnitude much greater than '0001 of a
milliampere is detected. If a single Clark standard cell is
inserted in the galvanometer circuit (see <U+FB01>g. 21) with its
negative pole attached to the middle plate and its positive

                  Edison Elfect in Glow Lamps.                 97
pole to the galvanometer terminal, the current is barely if at
all increased. In this case the negative pole of the Clark, cell
is in connexion with a cold metal electrode and the positive
pole is in connexion through the galvanometer with the
incandescent carbon electrode, and under these circumstances
the galvanometer detects no current <U+FB02>owing.         The position
of the Clark cell is now reversed, and it is joined up so that
its positive pole is in connexion with the middle plate and its
negative pole in connexion, through the galvanometer, with
the incandescent carbon electrode. It is then found that a
considerable current of some few milliamperes in magnitude
is <U+FB02>owing through the galvanometer. The direction of this
current in the ordinary way of speaking is from the negative
electrode of the lamp through the alvanometer to the metal
plate scaled into the bulb. We t as <U+FB01>nd that a negative
current of' electricity can be made to <U+FB02>ow across the vacuoui
space between the incandescent carbon and the metal plate
from the hot carbon to the cooler metal plate, but not in the
reverse direction.     The space presents an apparently uni
lateral conductivity.
    § 27. Experiment 25.—The same experiment was repeated,
only using instead of a Clark cell an insulated secondary
battery of 25 small cells. When the secondary battery
 (see <U+FB01>g. 21) was connected with its negative pole to the
metal plate and its positive pole through the galvanometer to
the negative electrode of the carbon, no current greater than
that found with the Clark cell similarly arranged was found ;
but if the secondary battery was reversed and joined up with
its positive pole to the middle plate and its negative pole
through the galvanometer to the negative electrode of the
incandescent carbon, then so strong a current <U+FB02>owed through
the galvanometer that it could not be measured without
 shunting-down the galvanometer considerably. The same
 experiments were repeated with the lamps having the zigzag
 wire as a metal plate, No. 7, and the same general results I
 obtained. These experiments therefore show that in a circuit
 which consists partly of a galvanometer-wire and partly of a
highly vacuous space bounded by two electrodes—one a metal
 plate and the other an incandescent carbon snrface,—the
 insertion of an electromotive force in one direction can produce
a very sensible current, but that if the electromotive force is
 reversed then no current <U+FB02>ows. The direction of the electros
motive force must be such as to urge negative electricity from
the hot surface to the cold across the vacuum space.              '

  the base of the positive leg of the carbon, and cylinder Y was
  the one near the top of the negative leg.
       W hen the galvanometer was connected between the negative

  a direction that a current of positive electricity was <U+FB02>owing
  across the vacuous space from the metal cylinder to the hot
  carbon, or a negative current from the hot carbon to the cooler
  metal cylinder. On switching-off the lamp, there was a curious
  ‘-‘ kick ” or _“ throw ” of the galvanometer, indicatin a sudden
  rush of current in the same direction as the stea y current
  which the cell had been sending. These effects occurred also
  when the cylinder Y was employed, and the galvanometer with

a quarter as great in magnitude as when the cylinder X was
employed. There was the same kind of “kick” of the galvano
meter on breaking the lamp-circuit.     These experiments evi
dently showed that the highly vacuous space between the hot
carbon traversed by its own current, which rendered it incan
descent, and the insulated cylinder possessed a sort of unilateral
conductivity, negative electricity from a separate source of
small electromotive force being able to be forced through it
from the hot carbon surface to the cooler metal surface, but
not in an opposite direction.                 '
   §29. In the above-recorded experiments the carbon con
ductor was rendered incandescent by a unidirectional or con
tinuous current in a highly perfect vacuum. In seeking for
an hypothesis to connect them together, it became essential to
ascertain how the effects would be modi<U+FB01>ed if the vacuum
was imperfect and if the current was alternating instead of
continuous.
   Experiment 27.—The fundamental experiment was therefore
repeated with the normal type of lamp (No. 4) , having a middle
metal plate placed symmetrically between the legs of the
carbon. A lamp of this type was set in action by an alternating
current of suitable strength and of which the frequency was
some 80 to 100 per second. On connecting the milampere
meter between either of the electrodes of the lamp and the
middle plate,_a continuous electric current was found <U+FB02>owing
through the galvanometer. The direction of this current was
such that positive electricity was found to <U+FB02>ow from either
lamp terminal to the middle plate of the lamp. In other words,
a continuous current of negative electricity <U+FB02>owed out of the
middle plate to one or other of the two terminals of the lam ,
viz. to that terminal to which the other extremity of the ga -
vanometer was joined.     Hence, since in this case each leg of
the carbon becomes in rapid succession positive and negative
when the lamp is operated with an alternating current, the
unilateral effect observed of a current flowing between the
middle plate and the positive leg, when the current through
the carbon is a continuous current, is here found to exist
equally between the middle plate and bot/i terminals of the
lamp. This is only what might have been expected. The
potential of the middle plate is then not the same as that of
the base of either leg of the carbon, but something between
the two depending upon the Igosition of the plate.

imperfect the equality in potential between the middle plate

,ishow that negative electricity is <U+FB02>owing through the galvano

   plate. In other words, negative charge is carried over from
the plate to the positive leg of the carbon across the imperfectly
'vacuous space ; and the means by which this is effected is the
residual air. This seems to afford proof that the normal effect
 of the molecular electrovection of negative electricity from the
negative leg is due to carbon molecules, and that the presence
of residual air exhibits itself, when present beyond a certain
amount, in producing an effect which the carbon molecular
electrovection cannot produce.
      § 31. Experiment 29.~—--It seemed very desirable to ascertain
vif the effect of molecular electrovection exists in the ease of
,an incandescent platinum wire rendered vividly incandescent
tin a highly perfect vacuum.       A bulb was accordingly con

   On the hypothesis that all theSe effects are due to a scattering

platinum wire rendered incandescent in a vacuum, Only that
the radiation of matter is far greater in the caSe of the
incandescent carbon than it is in the case of the incandescent
platinum.
   § 33. If a lamp is selected having an insulated plate <U+FB01>xed
between the legs of the carbon <U+FB01>lament, it is found that under
certain conditions the electric conductivity of the vacuous space
between the plate and the negative leg is much affected by the
presence of a magnetic <U+FB01>eld. If a galvanometer, preferably a
movable coil galvanometer, having a resistance of aboutVSOO
or 600 ohms, is connected between the middle plate and the
negative leg it will show but little current passing when the
lamp is incandescent at normal temperature. If the volts on
the lamp terminal are raised so that the <U+FB01>lament is brought
into a state of incandescence corresponding to about 2'5 or
3 watts per candle, then the alvanometer will show a small
current passing through it.       f then a horse-shoe ma net is
held so as to create a magnetic <U+FB01>eld the direction of w ich is
across the space between the plate and the negative leg, the
current indicated by the galvanometer immediately decreases
considerably. This happens irrespective of the direction of
the <U+FB01>eld so long as it is across the direction of the line joining
the negative leg and the middle late. This indicates that
the presence of this transverse <U+FB01>el increases the resistance of
the rare<U+FB01>ed as. The galvanometer current responds to the
presence of t e magnet in a manner which shews that the
resistance to the <U+FB02>ow of the current through the gas is
increased by creating a magnetic <U+FB01>eld at right angles to the
line of the current. The general fact that gaseous resistance
is increased by such a transverse magnetic <U+FB01>eld has been
already noted and described by Professor J. J. Thomson. The
behaviour of bismuth as regards electrical resistance in a
 magnetic <U+FB01>eld is strikingly similar.                               _'
 ' The “umping ” of the current from one value to a higher,
 which has been already mentioned, appears to be due to some
 thing equivalent to a sudden change in the resistance of the
 space between the negative leg and the middle plate when the
 lamp is in action and at high incandescence. The fact of

sending a small current through this space seems to e<U+FB02>'eét a
change in the qualities of the rarefied gas as a conductor which
makes it conduct better. There are certain after~etfects in
some cases which are strongly similar to the polarization of

seem to point to the validity of the view that gaseous con

Thomson that gases, or at least certain gases in a rare<U+FB01>ed con

greatest part of the obstacle to conduction through a vacuum
tube is at the electrodes and may be largely removed by
heating the kathode to incandescence.
  IV. Note on the Degree of Dissociation of Electrolytes at 0°.
               By MEYER WILDERMANN, Ph.D.*
   N the Philosophical Magazine, February 1896, Mr. Wood
1     published a paper, “The Degree of Dissociation of some
Electrolytes at 0°,” in which he, by a curve, illustrates certain
molecular freezing-point depressions, by some misapprehen
sion attributing them to me. The reader will see from the
paper which he cites (Phil. Mag. July 1895) that, contrary
to his statement, Arrllenius’s generalization <U+FB01>nds an excellent
con<U+FB01>rmation.
   In the interest of the matter I wish to add a few words on
the following point. The good a reement between the degree
of dissociation as obtained from t e freezing-point depressions
(at 0°) and from electric conductivity (18° and 25°) has
already shown that there can only be a little difference
between the degrees of dissociation as obtained from electric
conductivity at 0° and at 25°.     Mr. Waldin’s investigations
 (Zeitsehr. plays. Chem.) on the electric conductivity of acids
at different temperatures lead to the same conclusion. What
I suggested in my paper was that, as we <U+FB01>nd some differ
ences between the degrees of dissociation of acetic acid at
18° (Kohlrausch) and at 25° (Ostwald), the electric conduc
tivity of salts and acids, &c. should be investigated near to
the freezing temperature in order to ascertain the small
differences possibly existing. This is of interest because
of the importance of Arrhenius’s generalization; but it re
quires accurate work, and must only be carried out on a
broad basis, as has been done by Kohlrausch and Ostwald
at other temperatures. Mr. Wood does not investigate the

by several per cent., and his investigations are limited to
three acids and two salts. For this reason the investigation
of the matter remains as desirable as it was before.

      HE recent researches of H. Becquerel‘l' on the emission
         by compounds of uranium and by metallic uranium of
invisible radiations which very closely resemble those dis
covered by Wiedemunnli and by B6ntgen§, and which yet
unquestionably consist of transverse vibrations, are of so great
importance that any experiments upon the same line, however
incomplete, are of interest to physicists.
     In January last the writer and his assistant Mr. Miles
Walker were repeatin Rontgen’s now familiar experiments
on the production of photographic shadows by the emanations
from Crookes’s tubes, and were casting about for means to
shorten the long exposures then necessary, when the idea
occurred to them which has independently suggested itself to
many other experimenters, namely that of employing <U+FB02>uo
rescent substances in contact with the photographic <U+FB01>lm to
hasten the photographic action by the emission of rays of a
visible sort when stimulated by the w-rays. Accordingly,
having prepared sheets of paper or of aluminium covered with
<U+FB02>uorescent material, they tried the effect of inserting them in '
some cases below the glass plate, in other cases above the
glass plate with the <U+FB02>uorescent surface next the <U+FB01>lm, and in
yet other cases above the plate but with the fluorescent sur
face outside. The materials so tried were sulphide of calcium,

    When sheets of paper or aluminium covered with these were
placed face down upon the sensitive <U+FB01>lm, so that the x-rays
were compelled to pass <U+FB01>rst through them, some results were
obtained tending to show that the method might have some
hdvantages : but the resulting negatives were always patchy
and irregular. The most striking effect, however, was quite
unexpected. Care had been taken to keep these prepared
 sheets of <U+FB02>uorescent material in the dark for a suf<U+FB01>ciently
 long time for all visible phosphorescence or persistent <U+FB02>uo
 rescence to disappear. This, in the case of the sulphide of
 calcium, required many hours. The powdered <U+FB02>uor was also
 heated beforehand. Nevertheless, though no visible phos
 phorescence was present, the sensitive <U+FB01>lms were fogged by
 rays emitted from these materials.    Fluor-spar and the pla
 tino-cyanides did not produce any noticeable fogging, however.
 Even after being kept six weeks in darkness the sulphide of
 calcium is very active in the emission of rays that will a<U+FB01>'ect
 a photographic plate.
     While these experiments were in progress other experi
 ments were begun to ascertain if from any other sources,
 such as sunlight or the light of the arc lamp, any rays could
 be obtained having, like the w-rays, the power of penetrating
 opaque bodies.     From the arc lamp, with an exposure of
 about two hours, shadows of pieces of metal were obtained on
 a photographic plate through a piece of pine-wood several
 millimetres thick; but aluminium was found to be totally
 opaque to everything radiated from the arc and to sunlight.
     While the experiments on fogging were still in hand there
 was published the observation of M. Henry on the e<U+FB02>'ect of
 sulphide of zinc in apparently augmenting the transparency
 of aluminium to w-rays ; an observation which had an obvious
 bearing on that which was under investigation. A number
  of small portions of the <U+FB02>uorescent substances with which we
  Were experimenting were then placed upon the front of a
  sheet of aluminium about 0'5 millimetre thick, behind which
  was a gelatino-bromide plate (a Cadett’s “lightning ” plate) ;
 and these were left for several days upon the sill of a window
  facing south to receive so much sunlight (several hours as it
  happened) as penetrates in Februar ' into a back street in the
  heart of London.    On developing the plate it was found that
  behind these spots where portions of uranium nitrate and
  uranium ammonium <U+FB02>uoride had been placed, photographic
  action had taken place through the aluminium sheet. No
  very distinct e<U+FB01>ect had been been produced by the other
  substances. On communicating these observations to Sir G.
  G. Stokes he drew the writer’s attention to the similar obser

           ‘Dr. S. P. Thompson on Hyp'erphosphorescence.                 105
Ivatio'ns of M. Becquerel with respect to uranium salts, ob
 servations which have since been so remarkably extended.
 While agreeing with the Rontgen rays in the property of
   enetrating aluminium, zinc, and other opaque materials, and
 in exercising photographic actions, the Becquerel rays differ
 in the circumstance that they can be retracted and polarized.
 Whatever the R'dntgen rays may eventually prove to be, the
 Becquerel rays consist of transverse waves of an exceedingly
 high ultra-violet order.
     The circumstance that the strongest <U+FB02>uorescent effects are
 found in the compounds of two metals having such heavy
 atomic weights as platinum and uranium, when correlated
 with the other circumstance that the absorbing power towards
  .c-rays is greatest in elements of the greatest atomic weights,
  naturally suggests a new application of the law of reciprocity
 between emission and absorption.             If that law can hold good
 in the phenomena of the Rontgen rays, or of the closely
  related Becquerel rays, one would argue that the best sub
  stances to employ as emitters of such radiations would be
  those substances which absorb them most freely.                   Now the
  property of emitting Rontgen rays has been observed in man
  substances, but always under the stimulation of the kathodic
  discharge. In Rontgen’s original research glass was the
  radiator. Porter and Jackson independently found platinum
  foil to be superior. Rolti has found porcelain and mica also
  to serve. The writer has observed Rontgen rays to be
  emitted from the following substances exposed to kathode
  discharges z—calc-spar, apatite, rubies, sapphires, diamonds,
  uranium glass, scheelite, tourmaline, a phosphorescent enamel
  containing 60 per cent. of sulphide of calcium, sulphide of
  zinc (hexagonal blende), zinc, aluminium, copper, iron, mag
  nesium, and platinum. Of the metals in the above list, iron
  and platinum appeared to work better than copper, aluminium,
  or magnesium. The low melting-points of the last two
  render them unsuitable. Metallic uranium would have been
  tried had it been possible* to obtain a specimen; but all
  inquiries in London proved fruitless.           Of the other substances
  named, the phosphorescent materials seemed to have some
  advantages over ordinary glass, but they are not so convenient
  to manage as the metals. Apatite was tried because, consist
  ing as it does chie<U+FB02>y of phosphate of lime, it was thought that
  the w-rays emitted from its surface could be more certainly
     1* [IRVhile these lines have been going through the press, a. specimen of

 absorbed by bone than are the .z-rays emitted from denser
 materials such as platinum.                                   »
    At an early stage of these investigations the use of a <U+FB02>uo
 rescent screen revealed the fact that the relative transparency
 of <U+FB02>esh and bone ditfered with different materials used as
 emitters, and depended also upon the degree of exhaustion.
 The necessary inference that the w-rays are not all of one kind,
 but are heterogeneous, was announced by the writer about
 the same time* that the same conclusion was drawn by MM.
 Benoit'l' and Hurmuzescu from other causes.            To‘the rays
 emitted from apatite, bone was indeed found to be more opaque
 than to those emitted from platinum. But apatite, when
 subjected to the kathode discharge, continues to give out
 gases which after a very few seconds spoil the vacuum ; and
 the tube containing apatite as an anti-kathode could not, con
 sequently, be used except attached to the pump. Glass was
 found to be more transparent to .z-rays emitted from platinum
 than to x-rays emitted in the same tube from glass.
    The extraordinary property exhibited by the uranium com
 pounds of emitting a persistent invisible radiation that will
 pass through aluminium and produce photographic action
 would suggest that these rays are identical with Rontgen’s,
were it not that Becquerel’s success in re<U+FB02>ecting, refracting,
and polarizing them proves that they are more akin to ultra
violet light. The latter does not indeed penetrate aluminium:
but it has long been kn0wn that ultra-violet rays penetrate
<U+FB01>lms of silver which though thin are thick enough to re<U+FB02>ect
all visible kinds of light. It would seem to be prowd, then,
that Becquerel’s rays di<U+FB01>'er from the known ultra-violet in
degree rather than in kind, being rays of higher frequency
and shorter wave-length. That their properties are inter
mediate between those of ultra-violet and of the Rontgen
rays furnishes a strong presumption that the latter also di<U+FB02>'e'r
only in de ree, and are an extreme species of ultra-violet
light. It s ould not be forgotten that so far back as 1857
M. Niepce de Saint Victor observed many cases in which an
object, an engraving on paper or a <U+FB01>gured piece of porcelain
or marble, immediately after exposure to sunlight, was found
capable of giving a photographic impression to a sheet of
paper prepared with chloride of silver, with which it was
placed in contact. He even used, after exposure to light,
cardboard imbibed with salts of uranium or with tartaric acid,
and found such to be capable of emitting rays that were
photographically active. There was no attempt made, how

   The phenomenon of persistent emission of these invisible
rays by the uranium compounds long after any electrical or
luminous stimulus has ceased to be applied would seem,
therefore, to bear the same relation to the transient emission
of them in the Crookes tube as the persistent emission of
visible light by phosphorescent bodies does to the transient
emission of light by <U+FB02>uorescent bodies. Hence the writer
ventures to give to the new phenomenon thus independentlyr
observed by M. Becquerel and by himself the name of hyper.
phosphorescence. A hyper-phosphorescent body is one which,
after due stimulus, exhibits a persistent emission of invisible
rays not included in the hitherto recognized spectrum.

§1. IN a communication presented to Section A of the
            British Association-[- at Oxford in 1894, giving
an account of measurements made to determine the value
of the International Ohm in absolute measure by the method
of Lorenz, I referred to a small error consequent on the fact
that my standard coil is wound on a cylinder, the section of
which at right angles to the generating lines is not a circle
but an ellipse of small excentricity.
   In considering the effect of this ellipticity on the value of
the resistance calculated from the observations, it must be
noted that the ordinary formula implies that the coil is
circular. “ This formula is          '                               '

  percentage correction to be applied to the value of the integral

  the same as the percenta e correction to be ap‘ lied to its

       GENTLEMEN,
     OME years ago, after some holiday enjoyment of making
       “ducks and drakes” on a calm sea with <U+FB02>at smooth
 pebbles, it occurred to me as strange that I had never seen
 any theory given of “ducks and drakes” ; but convinced
 that a phenomenon, so beautiful as these light rebounds of
 solid from liquid, and so de<U+FB01>ant of those rules of propriety so
 concisely laid down in our treatises on hydrodynamics for
 liquids aspiring to be perfect, must have been handled by
 some master of <U+FB02>uid motion, I thought it would be a good
 exercise to work out a sketch explanation of the phenomenon
 and see how far it coincided with the authoritative theory
 when found. But without an exhaustive search I have yet
 come to the conclusion that there is really-n0 theory of the
 phenomenon published, for I have not encountered even an
 allusion to an explanation of these most elegant “ ducks and
 drakes.” Under these circumstances, and at a time when
 hydrodynamicians are making vigorous efforts to break away
 from the academic allurements of the perfect liquid and to do
 some service (hard service it seems to be) in the cause of the
 plain liquids of nature with their lamentable imperfection of
  an inveterate viscosity, it seems to me that there may be some
  justi<U+FB01>cation for the brief publication of my rough sketch of a
  theory, because it brings out the possibility of the existence of
  high tension in liquids in motion, so that in a general theory

 112            _  ‘  Mr. W. Sutherland on
 of the motion of natural liquids both viscosity and capacity
 for exerting tension have to be taken into account. Of
 course one gathers either directly or indirectly that most of
 the great writers on hydrodynamics, beginning with, say,
 Poisson and Stokes, saw the philosophical necessity for
 recognizing tension in liquids in motion ; and Maxwell, when
 introducing his idea of the “time of relaxation ” of an impul
 sively generated tensile strain, intended it to apply even to
 natural gases as well as to liquids. The merit of the “ ducks
 and drakes ” phenomenon is that it brings liquid tension from
 the region of scienti<U+FB01>c imagination to that of actual fact, and
 demonstrates in a brilliant manner that tension in moving
 liquids is no mere subordinate matter only7 slightly altering
 the properties of the liquid from those of the ideal perfect
 one, but produces a fundamental change.        Of course static
 tension, of which Worthington appears to be the latest inves
 tigator, has already received a certain amount of practical
attention.
    The broad facts of “ducks and drakes” are, that a solid
 body having a <U+FB02>at face and made to impinge with this face
 on a liquid surface parallel to it tends to rebound from the
 surface if the component velocity parallel to the surface
exceeds a certain value ; the tendency depending on the rela
 tion between the area of the face and the mass of the body,
 and also on the angle the direction of its velocity makes with
 ,the normal to the liquid surface : the larger the mass of the
'body per unit area of <U+FB02>at face the smaller is the ratio of the
 normal velocity before impact to that after ; the smaller the
angle that the velocity makes with the normal the smaller is
 the ratio of the normal velocity before impact to that after,
 until a limiting angle is reached at which the ratio appears
 to be zero, so that for smaller angles the rebound ceases
 entirely. Of the existence of this limiting angle with ordi
-_nary stone, glass, ahd oyster-shells, and sea or river water, I
{have satis<U+FB01>ed myself by many trials, and I have thought of
 making a quantitative study of the laws of the rebound of
 solid from liquid, but see no immediate prospect of the neces
 sary time. But for present purposes the existence of the
 limiting angle is an important fact, because it implies also
 what has been already stated, namely, that with a given
 normal velocity there must be associated a velocity parallel
'to the surface not less than a certain value if there is to be
 rebound; and the increasing ef<U+FB01>ciency of the rebound with
increasing angle implies that the velocity parallel to the
 surface is the most important element in the conditions of
 rebound.     Evidently there is an entire difference between

 the laws of rebound of a solid from a <U+FB02>at liquid and from a
 <U+FB02>at solid surface.
     Let us suppose the <U+FB02>at face of the solid to be a square of
  side a, and also that it does not pass discontinuously into the
 rest of the surface, but by means of a thin strip of curved
 surface passing tangentially into it all round, the sections of
 the strip by planes normal to the side of the square being arcs
 of radius 1'. Suppose the solid to move with the <U+FB02>at face
 horizontal, and with horizontal velocity u and vertical ve
 locity v at the instant when it encounters a horizontal liquid
 surface. To trace the effects of the encounter we had better
 for a moment imagine u to be zero, so that we have <U+FB01>rst the
 simple case of normal impact with velocity v.
    The <U+FB01>rst effect of the impact is to establish both motion and
 compression in the water near the solid, and also to compress
 the solid and diminish its motion. This goes on till the
 instant when the face of the solid and the liquid in contact
 with it are moving with the same velocity. But by this time
 part of the energy imparted to the liquid by the compression
   as changed itself into motion within the mass of the liquid ;
 and apparently in all ordinary cases this part of the energy
 is usually a large fraction, so that the liquid has only a little
 compressional energy left with which to attempt to thrust the
 solid body away from it ; and thus the rebound fails, the dis
 tinction between the encounter of two solids and that of a
 solid and a liquid being that in the latter case a large fraction
 of the available ener is soon changed into energy of motion
 within the liquid.       nder these circumstances it comes to
 pass that, in consequence of the motion in the liquid, its sur—
 face near the solid takes the form of a curved depression
'tangential to the curved edges of the face.
    When the vertical velocity v is zero, the effect of impact
 with only horizontal velocity can be studied separately. The
v<U+FB01>rst effect is the establishment of intense tensile strain in both
 solid and liquid. With viscous communication of motion to
 the liquid and from the solid the tensile strain in the liquid
 tends to relieve itself rapidly by generating motion within
 the mass ; but the solid for some little time must tend to restore
 the strain as fast as the liquid relaxes it, so that we have a
 short period of constant tension in the liquid near the solid.
     When both velocities u and v are in existence, a combina
 tion of the states of affairs just described occurs ; by the end
 of some short time t the vertical velocity v is destroyed, and
 the surface of the liquid contains a curved depression which is
 tangential to the curved edge of the <U+FB02>at face of the solid;
 the depression moves with a velocity comparable but not

 114                   Mr. \V. Sutherland on
equal to that of the solid, for the surface of the liquid near
 the solid has been set in motion b it. Let two sides of the
 square <U+FB02>at face be parallel to the direction of u, then we may
 liken the surface of the depression in the liquid to a stretched
 membrane, and the front and back edges to portions of
 cylindrical surfaces of radius r, over which the stretched
 membrane passes with the tension perpendicular to the axes
 of the cylinders, and therefore exerting pressure on the
 cylinders ; at the side edges the tension is parallel to the axis
 and is therefore devoid of pressure effect.
    Let b be the width of the strip of curved edge in contact
 with stretched liquid, and let the tension near the surface of
 the liquid be T per unit width, then the liftin pressure on
 each area ab is abT/r, making an angle b/Zr wit the vertical ;
 the total lifting force due to tension is therefore
                          2 cos (II/2r)abT/r.
This result can obviously be extended to the case where the
face of the solid is not <U+FB02>at with rounded edges but is any
curved surface; let A be the area of contact between solid
and liquid, T the mean tension, and l/r the mean curvature
of the face in the direction of the tension, then each unit of A
is subject to a normal pressure T/r, and the total vertical
lifting pressure is the sum of the vertical components of all
the normal pressures. Thus, then, we can include all cases
in the one general expression suf<U+FB01>cient for our purposes if we
say that the lifting force is equal to cAT/r where c is a con
stant, A is that part of the face of the solid in contact with
the liquid and having <U+FB01>nite curvature, the average value of
which is 1/r in the direction of T; c, A, T, and r being also
average values for the duration of the impact.                     _
   Now su pose for a moment that the solid has only the
vertical veibcity v at the moment of impact, and let h be the
distance below the free surface of the liquid to which its face
penetrates before it is brought to rest, then we may assume
the energy given to the liquid to be proportional to H2, and
then h9=kmv9/2 where m is the mass of the solid and la is a
constant. Then when u is not zero we have to take account
of the fact that the force cAT/r opposes the descent of the
solid, doing work hcAT/r against it, and therefore
                       Ita=k(mUQ/2—IICAT/T) .
Then the uplifting force cAT/r will in most cases act on the solid
through distance k, and discharge it from the surface of the
liquid with a vertical velocity 0’ upwards given by the equation
                        mom/2 = hcAT/r,

 If T is proportional to the excess of the velocity u above a
 lower limit U, so that T=K(u— U) where K is a constant,
 then            12'2/v2 = 1/{1 + hr/K/ccA (u — U) },
 and this expression corresponds to the general laws of “ ducks
 and drakes,” for since it holds only for values of u greater than
 U there is a certain minimum horizontal velocity required
by a solid which is to rebound from a. liquid ; for horizontal
velocities greater than this there is rebound, but the energy
of the vertical motion after impact is always less than that
 before impact, although it becomes more and more nearly
equal to it the greater u becomes ; also it appears from the last
equation that with <U+FB01>nite velocities the angle of incidence for
which rebound is possible has a limiting value. because
tan i=u/v ; and u having the lower limit U, and v the upper
limit V of experimental possibility, tan i and therefore
i has a lower limit. Again, as It increases with m, and A
generally increases with the size of the face of the solid, it
follows from the equation that the smaller the mass of the
body and the larger the face the more nearly does '0” equal
1;”, whence the advantage of thin <U+FB02>akes of stone and shell for
  etting “ducks and drakes.” It is to be remembered that in
t e case of a <U+FB02>at face the area over which there is <U+FB01>nite
curvature is only the small strip of transition from the <U+FB02>at
surface to the rest of the surface, and thus A becomes very
small, but so also does 1* become small, and the effect of the
shape of the face is best expressed by making A the product
of an average width a and an average length b in the direction
of motion, so that A/r becomes ab/r, which depends on a and
the angle b/r.    It should be noticed that the velocities are not
great which are required to produce the phenomena of ducks
and drakes, for at the last rebound of a series of ten or twelve
the motions are very gentle, but the tension called forth must
be remarkably high seeing that the impact lasts so short a time.
We all know the wonderful manner in which Kelvin has
helped us to grasp the coexistence in the aether of apparently
irreconcilable properties by his homely instances of jelly and
pitch, and it seems to me that “ ducks and drakes ” carry in
themselves a suggestiveness only communicated to jelly and
pitch by the sagacity and imagination of a master mind.

Azimuth Tables for the Higher Declinations.        By II. B. Goonwnv.
   London: Longmaus, Green, & (‘0.          1896.
THESE tables, extending from 24° to 30° Declination, may be
       considered supplementary to those of Burdwood and Davis.
The limits embrace the moon, larger planets, and a belt of bright
stars. The latter are more particularly useful in the Southern
Hemisphere, which contains no practical pole-star.
   Unlike the tables of Burdwood and Davis, these have for one
argument the star’s altitude, excepting in the supplementary por
tion termed Table B, which follows the ordinary usage of having
as argument the star’s Hour—angle.
   The tables are very legibly printed in old-face type, which lends
itself peculiarly to <U+FB01>gure work. The emission, however, of the lead
ing <U+FB01>gures excepting at the change of the degree is a. very doubtful
advantage, and it is very probable that a table giving degrees
and tenths only with all the <U+FB01>gures printed would be a more useful
 one in the hands of the navigator. The subdivision of the degree
into minutes possesses no advantages whatever, and only adds to
the labour of differencing and interpolation. We observe a few
<U+FB01>gure errors, but on the whole the tables appear to be fairly accu
rately printed and read, and they should be a valuable addition to
the chart-room of the skilful navigator, and an incentive to the
 more general use of star observations in practical seamanship. In
the introduction the author states that Burdwood mentions only
 three bright stars between the equator and 23° S. (the limits of his
tables). If we take, however, the stars in the Nautical Almanac
within the author’s limit of brightness (Mag. 2-4), we <U+FB01>nd ten stars
 against four comprised in Goodwin’s tables. Again, the author
 states “ for the moon, the tables will be brought into requisition
 for approximately one third of the month,” overlooking the fact
 that when the moon’s node is between 270° and 90° the declination
 of the moon never exceeds the obliquity of the ecliptic. This will
 be for a period of over nine years successively, or one-half the
revolution of the node.

    1. ‘On an Alpine Nickel-bearing Serpentine with Fulgurites.’
 By Miss E. Aston, B.Sc. With Petrographical Notes by Prof. T.
 G. Bouncy, D.Sc., LL.D., F.R.S., V.P.G.S.
    The specimens described were collected on the summit of the

       The Pliocene Glaciation 0f Subalpz'ne Switzerland.          117
Ri<U+FB01>elhorn (near Zermatt) by Prof. W. Ramsay, F.R.S., and J. Eccles,
Esq., F.G.S. As they showed some very well marked ‘lightning
tubes,’ the former thought that possibly analyses might prove
interesting. These were undertaken by Miss Aston at University
College, London. The rock is a serpentine, somewhat schistose from
pressure, which has been formed by the alteration of a rock chie<U+FB02>y
composed of olivine and augite. One of the analyses gives 4'92
per cent. of nickel oxide and hardly any lime. Prof. Bonney detected
some awaruite under the microscope, but not nearly enough to
account for the analysis. Reasons are given to show that the
nickel oxide probably replaced lime in the pyroxenic constituent of
the rock.
   The tubes, about T1,, inch in diameter, are round in section,
cleanly drilled, and lined with a very thin <U+FB01>lm of dark brown
or black glass. The microscopic structure of this is described,
as well as that of glass made by melting the rock with a blow
pipe (using oxygen). Some fulgurite-glass from the Hernli has also
been examined (much resembling that described by Mr. Rutley
from Monte Vise), and an analysis of this rock is given.
   2. ‘ The Pliocene Glaciation, Pre-Glacial Valleys, and Lake-Basins
of Subalpine Switzerland: with a Note on the Microscopic Struc—
ture of Tavayanaz Diabasic Tufa.’ By C. S. Du Riche Preller, M.A.,
Ph.D., F.G.S., F.O.S., A.I.M.I.E., M.I.E.E.
   I. The main object of this paper, which is the sequel to one read
last session, was to solve the problem whether the Pliocene glacie
<U+FB02>uviatile conglomerates of the Swiss lowlands were deposited on a
plateau or in already existing valleys. For the purpose of this
enquiry, the author examined last summer a large additional
number of glacial high- and low-level deposits throughout the Ziirich
Valley over an area more than 40 miles in length; and his investi
gations further led him to important conclusions with respect to the
combination of causes which determined the formation of the lake
basins lying in the same zone at the foot of the Alps.
   II. The author established the true characteristics of the Pliocene
nagel<U+FB01>uh as distinguished from Miocene, purely <U+FB02>uviatile conglome
rate on the one hand, and from glacio-<U+FB02>uviatile Pleistocene gravels
 on the other. With respect to the origin of the Pliocene conglome
rate, he contended that the material composing the same was not
transported from a great distance, but was, in the main, derived from
the enormous accumulations of Miocene nagel<U+FB02>uh at the foot of the
Alps. Specimens of Miocene nagel<U+FB02>uh-pebbles were exhibited, in
cluding the so-called ‘ Tavayanaz Sandstone,’ which the author, in
an Appendix to the paper, showed to be diabasie tufa.
   III. The author described in detail a variety of glacial exposures,
and showed that Pliocene nagel<U+FB02>uh in situ, of which he exhibited
numerous specimens, occurred not only on the ridges of the hills, but,
at it gradually ascending level, also at and near the <U+FB02>oor of the
Ziirich Valley.

1 18                    Geological Society :—
   Hence he contended that at the advent of the <U+FB01>rst glaciation
the Ziirich Valley was already eroded, and that, consequently, the
term ‘ Deckenschotter,’ or plateau-gravel, was not strictly applicable
to the Pliocene glacio-<U+FB01>uviatile deposits of the Swiss lowlands. In his
view, the isolated high-level deposits were formed during the inter
mittent shrinkage of the Upper Pliocene ice-sheet, while the low
level deposits were formed during the subsequent recession of
individual glaciers left in the several valleys.
    IV. The author reconstructed the pre—Glacial <U+FB02>oor of the Ziirich
Valley upon the evidence of the solid rock and of the low-level
Pliocene nagel<U+FB02>uh deposits, with the result that the depth of the
lower part of the Valley was approximately that of the present day,
while the <U+FB02>oor of the upper part was at a higher level (maximum,
300 feet above present lake-level), and was subsequently lowered
by earth-movements. He further adduced evidence that the Sub
alpine valleys of the Reuss, Aare, and Rhine were likewise excavated
before the <U+FB01>rst glaciation. By calculation, he arrived at an estimate
of the time required for the excavation of the Ziirich Valley, and
 contrasted the erosive energy of the river with the impotence, on
 mechanical grounds, of a glacier 7000 times larger in volume.
    V. The author showed that the Lake of Ziirioh owes its origin, in
the <U+FB01>rst instance, to a zonal subsidence (probably between the <U+FB01>rst
 and second glaciation) of about 1000 feet, as evidenced by the
 reversed dip of the disturbed molasse-strata between the lakes
of Ziirich and Zug. During the second and third Ice-periods, the
 original lake—basin was gradually <U+FB01>lled with glacial and <U+FB02>uviatile
 deposits at both ends, and was <U+FB01>nally restricted to its present
dimensions by a post-Glacial bar deposited at its lower end by
a tributary river. In the author’s view, the other Subalpine lakes,
 extending from the Lake of Constance to Lac Bourget in Savoy,
 owe their origin and present limits, in the main, to the operation of
 similar causes.
    VI. With regard to the main question, the author averred that
 the Lower and Middle Pliocene period was, in Switzerland, entirely
 one of erosion and denudation on a prodigious scale. Irrespective of
 the evidence he had adduced, he was therefore driven to the conclusion
 that at the advent of the <U+FB01>rst Ice-period in Upper Pliocene times,
 the principal Subalpine valleys must have been already excavated
 approximately to their present depth, and that ever since then the
 action of the great Alpine and Subalpine rivers has been, as it is
 still in our own day, mainly directed to regaining the old valley
 <U+FB02>oors by removing those enormous accumulations of glacial and
 glacio-<U+FB02>uviatile material, which are respectively the direct and
 indirect products of three successive and general glaciations.
    3. ‘Notes concerning certain Linear Marks in a Sedimentary
Rock.’    By Prof. J. E. Talmage, D.Sc., F.G.S.
    The marks described in the paper occur in a <U+FB01>ne-grained argil

               On Submerged Land-surfaces at Barry.                119
 laceous sandstone referred by the U.S. Geological Survey to the
 Triassic or Jura-Trias period, which is found on a low tableland
 within 2 miles of the bluffs overlooking Glen Canyon. The marks
  commonly appear as straight lines intersecting at right angles, but
  some have a pinnate distribution, suggesting engravings of frost
 <U+FB02>owers. A description of the markings is given, and various
 experiments made in the laboratory to illustrate the effects of
 formation of crystals formed over sediment are described.

                             in the Chair.
    The following communications were read :—
    1. ‘On Submerged Land—surfaces at Barry, Glamorganshire.’
 By A. Strahan, Esq., M.A., F.G.S. With Notes on the Fauna and
 Flora by Clement Reid, Esq., F.L.S., F.G.S., and an Appendix on
 the Microzoa by Prof. T. Rupert Jones, F.R.S., F.G.S., and
 F. Chapman, Esq., F.1t.l\I.S.
    Excavations for a new dock at Barry have disclosed a series of
 freshwater or slightly estuarine silts with intercalated peats, below
 sea-level on the north-eastern side of the island. The site of the
 excavation was over<U+FB02>owed by the tide until the year 1884, when the
 docks were commenced. The newest deposits seen are therefore
 Blown Sand, Scrobicularia-clay, and sand or shingle with recent
 marine shells.
    These rest on an eroded surface of blue silt, with sedges in
position of growth. Four peat-beds occur in this silt, at 4, 11,
20, and 35 feet below Ordnance datum respectively. The upper
most peat contains a seam of shell-marl, partly composed of the
shells of ostracoda and partly of Bythinia, Limnaza, &c. The
second is a mass of matted sedges. The third is aland-surface, and
in places consists almost wholly of timber with the stools and roots
in situ. The fourth is also an old land-surface, as is proved not
only by the presence of roots in place beneath it, but by numerous
land-shells. A fragment of a polished <U+FB01>int-celt was found by
Mr. Storrie embedded in the lower part of the uppermost peat.
   By a comparison with the existing maritime marshes of the
neighbourhood, it is shown that the fourth peat indicates a sub
sidence of not less than 55 feet.
   The sea encroached upon the area in consequence of this sub
sidence. It entered by the lowest of three low cols in the southern .
water-parting of the Cadoxton river, thus isolating the portion of
land now known as Barry Island. A slight further movement
would have converted the water-parting into a chain of islands.
   2. ‘ On a Phosphatic Chalk with Holaster pla'nus at Lewes.’ By
A. Strahan, Esq., M.A., F.G.S. With an Appendix on the Ostracoda
and Foraminifera by F. Chapman, Esq., F.R.M.S.
   This rock, which occurs at the base of the Upper Chalk, at the

120                       Geological Society :—
horizon of the Chalk Rock, does not exceed 1% foot in thickness and
persists for a few yards only. In composition and microscopic cha
racter it presents a. close analogy to the Taplow phosphatic deposit,
which, however, occurs at the top of the Upper Chalk. Like it, it
consists of brown phosphatic grains embedded in a white chalky
matrix. The grains include a large number of pellets, attributable
to small <U+FB01>sh, phosphatized foraminifera, chips of bone, &c.        Fish—
teeth also occur in abundance.
    To complete the resemblance, the Lewes deposit rests on a <U+FB02>oor
of hard nodular chalk, beneath which is a. white chalk traversed by
irregular branching pipes <U+FB01>lled with the brown variety. Such
‘ <U+FB02>oors’ are attributed to concretionary action ensuing upon a. pause
in the sedimentation. The piped chalk is compared with the
structure known as Spongia paradoxica.
    It is concluded that phosphatized deposits may occur at any
horizon in the Chalk ; that the phosphatization is due to small <U+FB01>shes,
attracted by an unusual abundance of food ; that they are shallow
water deposits, and associated with a pause or change in the sedi
mentation.
    Mr. Chapman furnishes a list of 42 species and varieties of
foraminifera and 6 species of ostracoda. The former indicate a
deeper water origin than do those of the Taplow Chalk. He notes
the occurrence for the <U+FB01>rst time in this country of Gypsina O'oetw,
Hansen.
    3. ‘ On the Classi<U+FB01>cation of the Strata between the Kimeridgian
and the Aptian.’ By Dr. A. P. Pavlow, Professor of Geology in the
University of Moscow, For.Corr.G.S.
    In this paper the author discusses the new evidence respecting
the palazontology of the Lower Cretaceous and Upper Jurassic
deposits of Russia which has come to light since the publication by
himself and Mr. Lamplugh of ‘Les Argilcs de Speeton et leurs _
 Equivalents’ (Moscow, 1892).        He is now enabled to <U+FB01>x with
 certainty the zones of Hoplites riasensLs and Olcostephanus hoplitoides
of the provinces of Riasan and Simbirsk, and is thus in a. position
to correct and complete his former classi<U+FB01>cation of the Upper
Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous rocks of Russia, and to de<U+FB01>ne more
 strictly their relationship equivalent to the strata of other countries.
    The whole of the Petchorian Series—that is, the zones of
Ammonites stenomphalus and Amm. Keyeerlingi—is now regarded
as Lower Neocomian of a hitherto unknown boreal type, notwith
standing the af<U+FB01>nity of its fauna with that of the underlying
Jurassic (Aquilonian) strata. The author is thus led to carry up
into the Cretaceous the corresponding stages in Western Europe,
including the upper part of the zone of Belemnites lateralis of Speeton
and Lincolnshire, the Upper Berriasiau of South-eastern France,
and probably the Hils Beds of Germany, instead of classing these

    1. ‘ The Junction~Beds of the Upper Lias and Inferior Oolite in
N0rthampt0nshire.—Part I. Physical and Chemical.’ By Becby
Thompson, Esq, F.G.S., F.C.S.
    The author, while combating the view that a considerable
unconformity exists between the Upper Lies and the Inferior Oolite
of Northamptoushire, brings together much evidence to illustrate
the effects of slipping, and to show that these effects may be mistaken
for those of unconformity. He also applies the evidence which he
has collected 'to illustrate certain points in the physics of valley
formation.
   After giving details as to the horizon of the springs of the district,
the distribution of water in the Interior Oolite, and the development
of the springs, he argues that every valley of the district has been
elongated in the direction which it now has by a stream originating
in a spring always at its head, and that the development of channels
towards particular points of discharge has been the chief agent in
initiating the formation and guiding the direction of all the minor
valleys of the river-system within the in<U+FB02>uence of the same set of
beds. A description of the characters of the slopes follows, and
their signi<U+FB01>cance is discussed. The structure of the hills and valleys
of the district occupies the next portion of the paper, and the
author considers that corresponding to the deepening of a valley by
denudation there is uplifting of the beds below it, and at the same
time an outward and upward thrust along the hillside which lifts
beds there; also, that hills are reduced in height by sinking as well
as by denudation of their upper parts. In discussing the question
of unconformity between the Inferior Oolite and Upper Lias, the
rarity of exposures of true junctions is noted, theunctions which have
been chie<U+FB02>y examined by other observers being obscured by slipping ;
and reasons are given for inferring an absence of unconformity at
the horizon, both on account of the character of the true junctions,
and from other considerations.      The author, however, gives reasons

   2. ‘Contributions to the Stratigraphy and Palaeontology of the
Globigerina-limestones of the Maltese Islands.’ By J. H. Cooke,
Esq., F.L.S., F.G.S.
   A bibliography of the Globigerina-limestones is followed by some
remarks on the physical features and general distribution of the
strata.   The limestones are divided into nine subdivisions, lettered A
to I, the former being uppermost.    Four seams of phosphatic nodules
form the subdivisions B, D, G, and I, and local nodule-bands also
occur in E. The subdivision G serves as a line of demarcation
between the Langhian Series (Miocene) and the Aquitanian
(Oligocene). Details of the lithological and palaeontological cha
racters 'of the various subdivisions are given, and the author
concludes that I and the lower part; of H were laid down on a
 sinking sea-<U+FB02>oor, in about 300 fathoms of water; that the upper
part of H and G, F, E, D, composed to a large extent of Glob'igerina
and other pelagic organisms, were probably deposited in about
1000 fathoms; while C, B, and A were probably laid down, like I
and the lower part of H, in about 300 fathoms of water.
    3. ‘ On the Geology of the Neighbourhood of Carmarthen.’ By
Miss Margaret 0. Cros<U+FB01>eld and Miss Ethel G. Skeat.
    The area described lies approximately within a 4-mile radius of
 Carmarthen. The beds of the district have been subjected to com
 plicated foldings, amongst which an earlier set, giving rise to a
 number of small anticlines with north-and'south axes, and a later
 more extensive set, due to the series of earth-movements which pro
 duced the great Condrusian ridge, producing anticlines and synclines
 having a. general east-and-west trend, can be made out.      The rocks
 forming the subject of the present paper occur in one limb of a.
 complex anticline produced during the latter set of movements. In
this limb beds of the following ages occur z—Tremadoc Slates,
Lower and Upper Arenig, Llanvirn, Llandeilo, and Dale. These
 beds are described in detail. A regular succession of strata from
 Tremadoc Slates to Dioranogrzqotus-shales is found, while the Bala
 beds of Mount Pleasant abut on Arenig strata, and the reason for
 this irregularity has not yet been decided by the authors. The beds
 are compared with those of other areas. The Tremadoc Slates are
 equivalents of Stage 3a of the Christiania district ; the Lower Arenig
 Beds with Phyllograptus angustifolius, and the Upper Arenig with
Didymograptus m'tidus, &c. resemble those of other British areas;
the Llanvirn Beds contain Didymograptus bi<U+FB02>dus and other fossils ;
the Didymogmptus Murchisoni-beds are well known elsewhere. The
Llandeilo Limestone is probably represented by sandy beds with
Asaphus tyrannus ; and the Dicranogmptus-shales are like those of
the Haverfordwest region. The Bala Beds of Mount Pleasant,

    ON A ROTATIONAL MOTION OF THE KATHODE DISK IN THE
             CROOKES TUBE.      BY FRANCIS E. NIPHER.
  T is well known that the equations which represent the pro
“ perties of the magnetic <U+FB01>eld external to a conductor are incon
sistent when applied to points within the body of the conductor.
Assuming the total magnetic force within to be tangent to a circle
whose centre is at the wire centre, and that the surfaces of equal
potential are radial planes. Assuming the force due to an element
of the conductor of in<U+FB01>nite length and of section ds to be 27th, it
follows that the force at any point without the conductor varies
inversely, and at an internal point directly, as the distance from
the centre. If now within the wire we assume any radial plane
as a datum equipotential plane, and determine the locus of any
other equipotential surface, such that the difference of potential,
measured along the lines of force, is constant, this surface turns
out to be one having as a cross-section a spiral known as the lituus
having the radius as an external asymptote, and reaching the centre
after an in<U+FB01>nite number of turns. It is evident that these internal
surfaces of equal potential cannot be both radial planes and spiral
cylinders.
   Maxwell disposes of this absurdity to which the equations lead
in the single sentence which closes section 606 of his ‘ Electricity
and Magnetism.’ He says: “Within the substance of the con
ductor, there is no such thing as magnetic potential.”
   It has long seemed to me that this failure of the equations
must be the result of leaving some elements of the problem
out of the discussion. I have spent a great amount of time in
seeking for some rotational phenomenon hitherto unrepresented in
the equations. Until recently the results were wholly negative.
While recently experimenting with a Crookes tube I observed that
the circular aluminium disk of the kathode became slightly loose on
the aluminium wire, and that it was constantly rocking in rotary
motion on the wire. After several days of use, during which it
had been decided to construct a tube with disks capable of rotation,
the kathode disk suddenly became loosened, and began to rotate
slowly on the wire as an axis.
   The bearings were somewhat rough, and the disk was not per
fectly balanced. It often stopped, but then began to rock against
the obstacle until it again freed itself. The direction of rotation
was contrary to the hands of a clock, when the disk was viewed

  124           Intelligence and Zllisccllaneous Articles.
 from the point where the kathode wire pierces the wall of the
 tube.   All attempts to accelerate or retard the motion by means
 of strong bar magnets, as in Barlow’s wheel, were without eifect.
 Placing the tube at various distances from the induction-coil and
 giving the disk all possible positions in the earth’s <U+FB01>eld produced
 no change in the rotation.     A more decided rotation was produced
 by using the brush-discharge of a 24-inch Holtz machine. No
 rotation has been produced as yet when the leading wires were
 in metallic contact with the conductors of the Holtz machine,
 but when the leads consisted of rods having spherical terminals,
 separated by short spark intervals, the rotation was always seen.
 When the loose disk was made the anode, no tendency to rotation
was observed. Thus far all attempts to produce the elfect in air
 of ordinary pressure have failed, but the work in this direction is
 not yet concluded.
   In the tube used, the tendency to rotation was not observed
until by long use the vacuum had become Very high, and it has now
 nearly reached the limit where the sparks pass around the tube,
 rather than through it.
   The leading-in wires are at right angles to each other in the tube
used. Tubes are now in preparation which will have rotary disks
facing each other as well as at right angles to each other, and
various other features, by which it is hoped that many questions
which at once suggest themselves may be answered. There is
much reason to suspect that the gas particles do not shoot otf
normally from the surface of the disk, but in a vortex the axis of
which is in the two dark spots opposite the kathode faces. The
fact that the anode does not respond, and that similar experiments
in open air have thus far failed, seems to point to the kathode dis
charge as the direct active agent. This view is not easily reconciled
with the result of the experiment made by Crookes with the hemi
cvlindrical kathode (‘ Nature,’ July 3, 1879, p. 229, <U+FB01>g. 3), but the
<U+FB01>gure shown does not seem to quite agree with the description of
it. Experiments are now in preparation which will decide this
question. It is possible that the rotation observed is a direct
action and reaction between the current in the disk and the ex
ternal <U+FB01>eld due to the current. In this case the rotation apparently
Ought to be producible in open air, and on the anode terminal of
the Crookes tube.
   Whatever may be the direct agency producing this rotation, it
seems apparent that we now have an experimental basis for impose
ing a term representing a rotation into the equations representing
the conditions within a conductor.—Transactz'ons of the Academy
of Science of St. Louis, vol. vii. no. 7 (May 8, 1896).

XI. On the Convergency of Fourier’s Series. By W. \VILLIAMS,
           B.Sc., Royal College of Science, London“.
                                I.
TPHE convergency of Fourier’s series is a subject which
       has been so fully investigated by eminent mathemati
cians that it is necessary to offer some apology for venturing
to discuss it afresh. It is, however, a subject of such singular
di<U+FB02>iculty,—a dif<U+FB01>culty which has only been partially over
come,—and the investigations connected with it are so
laborious and abstruse in character, that any simpli<U+FB01>cation
that may be effected in the method of attack is of value quite
apart from any fresh light that may be thrown upon the con—
vergency itself. The chief difficulty connected with the
investigation is that of assigning the necessary conditions to
be ful<U+FB01>lled by the function which determines the coef<U+FB01>cients
of the series, and this dif<U+FB01>culty arises from the highly general
manner in which the term “ function ” is de<U+FB01>ned and employed
in modern anal sis. Of course, if we con<U+FB01>ne ourselves to
the comparativel;r simple functions which occur in the prac
tical applications of the series, functions, for example, which
are continuous and obey the laws of the differential calculus,
much of this dif<U+FB01>culty disappears. But it is necessary that
we should, in such a case, state clearly the limitation which
we make, as otherwise our investigation partakes of a too
general character, and proves too much. For, as we shall

126                    Mr. W. Williams on the
afterwards see, even when we limit ourselves to functions
which are <U+FB01>nite and continuous, the limitation is too general,
and we cannot determine whether Fourier’s series is con
vergent or not until we know something of the nature of the
continuity of the function.
    2. The object of the present paper is to simplify the
investigation of the subject, to bring it within the reach of
the student acquainted only with the elements of the In<U+FB01>ni
tesimal Calculus, and to exhibit in an elementary manner the
nature of the dif<U+FB01>culties that have to be surmounted and the
principal results obtained. At the same time, in addition to
simplifying the discussion, and rendering it perhaps more
interesting and instructive, it is hoped that some additional
light will have been thrown upon the question of the con
vergency, and that the limits within which the convergency
holds will be found to be to some extent widened and more
clearly discussed.
   3. The literature of Fourier’s series is very extensive, few
mathematical subjects having, perhaps, been so widely dis
cussed. A very valuable account, both critical and historical,
of the chief investigations into the subject has been given by
Arnold Sachse (“ Versuch einer Geschichte der Darstellung
willkiihrlicher Functionen einer Variabeln durch trigonome
trischen Beihen,” Gettingen, 1879) in an essay which has been
translated and published in the Bulletin des Sciences Mat/zé
matiques, vol. iv. (1880). It is not proposed to enter here
into the history of the subject, or to discuss the elementary
properties of Fourier’s series, such properties being treated
and illustrated in ordinary text-books. We have here to take
Fourier’s series in its most general form, as it stands, and
determine the conditions under which it is convergent.
   4. Fourier showed that if an arbitrary function of a: can
be expanded into a series of the form

investigate the possibility of the expansion, it is, therefore,
necessary to determine the most general conditions which the
function must satisfyin order that the series thus de<U+FB01>ned may

                  Convergency of Fourier’s Series.                    127
 this investigation, there are two of particular importance on
 account of the results to which they have led, and the fact
 that they are still the methods most generally employed in
 mathematical text-books. These are the methods of Poisson
and Dirichlet.
     6. Poisson proceeds * by forming, from the given Fourier
series, another derived from it by multiplying each term of
the latter in succession by ascending powers of a quantity 9
 less than unit , and then <U+FB01>nding to what limit this derived
 series tends w en 9 tends to the value 1. This method has
 given rise to numerous and interesting investigations. In
particular, the method in the hands of Stokes in England led
to the discovery of the in<U+FB01>nitely slow convergence of a
geriodic series in the neighbourhood of a discontinuity.
   tokes showed that when a periodic series represents a dis
continuous function, the rate of convergence of the series
increases inde<U+FB01>nitely at the point of discontinuity, or that,
if a certain number of terms is required to represent the
continuous portion of the function to a given degree of
approximation, the number required to represent the function
to the same degree of approximation becomes greater and
greater as we approach a discontinuity. This important
discovery was published, in Dec. 1847, in a pa er “ On the
critical values of the Sums of Periodic Series ’ (Cambridge
Philosophical Society). The subject was independently in
vestigated, and the same result discovered by Seidel, and pub
lished in 1848 (Journal of the Bavarian Academy, 1847—49),
another remarkable instance of two investigators proceeding
independently along the same line of inquiry.
    7. Dirichlet’s method of proceeding is to form an expres
sion for the sum of the <U+FB01>rst n terms of the series taken in
order, and to <U+FB01>nd the limit to which this tends when n is in
creased inde<U+FB01>nitely. This method was given by Dirichlet in
1829 (Journal de Crelle, vol. iv. p. 157), in a paper which
contains the <U+FB01>rst rigorous investigation into the convergency
of Fourier’s series. The method is more direct than Poisson’s,
it enables us to investigate the limitations more simply and
effectively, and it has formed the basis for most of the
researches that have been subsequently made into the subject.

    This <U+FB01>nal expression may be called the integral sum of the
 series. It involves two variables, or rather it involves the
 same variable twice over, namely, once in determining the
 coef<U+FB01>cients of the series, and then in assigning to the series
 its different values. This double use of the same variable is
 denoted by the different symbols employed in the two cases,
 namely, 12 in the one case, and .z' in the other. We may,
 therefore, call v the variable of integration, and a: the variable
 of summation. Denoting the expression by S", Dirichlet’s
 problem is to determine the limitin        value of S, when 71:00
 for all values of a: between in.       T is limiting value we may
 conveniently denote by Sm
    9. As a result of his investigation, Dirichlet proved that if
 the function F is <U+FB01>nite, and single-valued between in, and
 has only a <U+FB01>nite number of discontinuities and maxima and
 minima between those limits, then Fourier’s series is con
 vergent, and tends to the value FM) for all values of .2:
 except those which correspond to the discontinuities and the
 limits i-qr ; the value of the series at a point of discontinuity
 being the mean of the values of the parent function on either
 side of the discontinuity and in<U+FB01>nitely close to it, and its
 value at either limit the mean of the values of the parent
 function at the two limits. This result has been made the
 subject of further inquiry by later mathematicians, notably
 Riemann, Heine, Cantor, and P. Du Bois-Reymond, the
 inquiry relating to the necessity for the conditions laid down
 by Dirichlet. For an account of these investigations, and of

                 Convergency of Fourier's Series.              129
the results obtained, reference must be made to Sachse’s paper
already mentioned.
    10. The method employed by Dirichlet to determine the
value of Sn when 11:00 is to break up the integral into the
sum of elements which are alternately positive and negative,
that is, into an alternating series with terms of <U+FB01>nite magni
tude. The manipulation of this series is, however, very
laborious, and the method of evaluating S, by means of it is
long, and highly involved and indirect, and consequently is
not suited to the needs of the average mathematical student.
The investigation given in the following paper is a simpli<U+FB01>ed
form of Dirichlet’s in the sense that it depends upon the
evaluation of the same integral Sn. But the dif<U+FB01>culties at
tending Dirichlet’s evaluation are avoided by breakin up
the integral into three portions, two of which are of nite
range, the limits being —'rr to —h, and h to 7r respectively,
while the third portion is taken between ih, It being in<U+FB01>
nitely small. It is then easy to show in a simple and
straightforward manner that the two <U+FB01>rst portions vanish
when n=ao , and that, therefore, the value of the integral
depends only upon the in<U+FB01>nitely thin strip taken between
 ill. By this means we are enabled not only to evaluate Sn
more easily and directly, but to investigate the limitations to
which the function F(.r) must be subjected in a simpler
manner. For, as we shall see, the conditions that have to be
ful<U+FB01>lled by the function F(.v) in order that the terms of the
series may be <U+FB01>nite and determinate, and that the nth term
may be in<U+FB01>nitely small when 11:00, which are conditions
that have to be ful<U+FB01>lled in the case of every series, are suf<U+FB01>cient
 to ensure that the two portions of Sn which lie outside the
 limits ih vanish when n=oo . The dif<U+FB01>culties attending the
 determination of the remaining conditions to be ful<U+FB01>lled by
 the function are thus removed to the in<U+FB01>nitely small portion
 of it which lies between i-h. The investigation is given,
 <U+FB01>rst, for the case of functions which obey the laws of the
 differential calculus, this being the only case which occurs in
 ordinary analysis. Afterwards, the case of functions in which
 this condition is not ful<U+FB01>lled is taken up.
                                 II.
     11. Let F(.'v) be a <U+FB01>nite, single-valued, and continuous
 periodic function; and where continuous, let it be di<U+FB02>'eren
  tiable. Then, since F is periodic, and of period 2w, the limits
  of integration may be shifted through any distance at pleasure,

     12. In the particular case when F(0,+ :0) has a constant
value c all the terms on the right in (11) vanish except the
 <U+FB01>rst, the value of which is 0.          Hence in this case S,=c.       If,
in addition, the limits of integration are from -1r to 0, or
 from O to or, instead of from —'1r to 1r, we get S,=§c.
 These results will be required later.
     13. Since the function under the sign of integration becomes
 in<U+FB01>nite when 0:0, we have to break up the integral into
 three portions A, B, C, taken respectively between the limits
 —-n' to —h, —lz to h, and h to 1r‘. We shall now show that
 A and C vanish when 1i=ao for values of h as small as we
 please, and therefore that the value of S... depends only upon
 the in<U+FB01>nitely thin strip B within which the function integrated
 becomes in<U+FB01>nite.
     14. Consider <U+FB01>rst the portion 0. Let (211+ 1)12~0=¢, and
        F 9 +0:
 put <U+FB01>g?) =x(§0). Then

 Whatever a may be, we can always choose 111' so that (211 + 1B]:
  is a multiple of 1r. The integral can therefore be broken up
  into a number m of elements in each of which the range
  is 271', and one element at the upper limit in which the range
  is      or        This latter element will have a <U+FB01>nite value a.
  For a given value of n let p be the value of the numerically
  greatest of the remaining m elements. Then the sum of the
  (m+ 1) elements lies between -_l_-'mp+ a ; and therefore C lies
                           a                  m
  between :1; p +                ; since           is <1.       But when n

   —h to g, and g to 1r, h and 9 being independent small quantities.
     1' Or, if (2n+l)%,h is not a multiple of 1r, each element of range 21:
  can be broken up into four portions in each of which sin 4) preserves the
  same sign, so that the reasoning of (14) is still applicable.

increases without limit, p diminishes without limit. For each of
the above we elements can be broken up into two parts of equal
range 7r, in one of which sin ¢ is positive, in the other nega
tive. The value of each element will therefore be of the form
2 (p1— P2) where p1 is some value of x (2nd; 1) taken between the
limits of the <U+FB01>rst portion of the element, and p2 between those
of the second.    But as n increases, the change in x(2n¢:l_ 1
when ¢ changes by 271' diminishes; and since x is everywhere
<U+FB01>nite and continuous, p1 and p2 tend to the same value. Hence
by increasing n suf<U+FB01>ciently, we can make pl—pg as small as
we please; and therefore in the limit when 71:00 it vanishes.
In other words, since as n increases                       tends to
remain constant during the integration of any element while
sin 45 passes through all the values included between i 1, each
element tends to the value zero, the value it would really have
if 942714; I) remained absolutely constant during the inte
gration.
    15. This holds for all <U+FB01>nite values of h however small.
When It is very small, p1 and p2 will have their greatest
values in the neighbourhood of d>=(2n+ l)%h, in which case

where t is some value lymg between 0 and m, and 1s 1n

 are both in<U+FB01>nitely small. But since F is everywhere conti
 nuous, and n is to be increased without limit, this condition
 can always be satis<U+FB01>ed. Hence the limit of p, and therefore
 of C, is zero for values of It as small as we please; and in
 the same manner we may show that the limit of A is zero.
 The value of S... therefore depends only upon the value of
 the in<U+FB01>nitely thin strip B of breadth 2h within which the
 function integrated becomes in<U+FB01>nite, and is independent of
 the values of F (6+.c) outside this strip. Consequently, we

   132                  Mr. W. Williams on the
   may, outside the strip B, assign to F(0+x) any continuous
   <U+FB01>nite values at pleasure.
      16. Since within the strip B the range of integration is
   in<U+FB01>nitely small, we ma replace F(9+a:) by F(.r)+ 9F'(.1:).
   We then get, putting Q for sin *6,
    s..= 25f)jfh8i“ (22313030 + F1"”)Lhfin (211+ 13030,
   which reduces to the <U+FB01>rst term on the right because the
- _integral of the term involving F’ (x) is zero. The value of
   S, when 11:00 is therefore the same as the value it would have
   Hence
   if       S..=F(.c)
      F(9+.z)          by (12).
                remained   constant throughout and equal to
      17. If we change the limits of integration in S, from —1r
   and 'n' to ——1r and 0, or O and 1r respectively, we can evaluate
   the integral exactly as before. For since the portion taken
   between —1r and —h, or between h and 1r, vanishes when
   n=oo , the value of the integral depends only upon the in<U+FB01>
   nitely thin strip taken between —h and 0, or O and h. Hence,
   replacing F(0+.'c) in this stri by F(.'v)+ 0F’(x), it follows,
   as before, that the value of t e integral is the same as the
   value it would have if F(0+.r) remained constant throughout
   and equal to F(a:). Hence in this case Sm=§F(w) by the
   latter portion of (l2).
      From this it follows that in the original integral taken
   between in, F(0+w) may change abruptly in value or
   experience a discontinuity when 0:0; for we can break up
   the integral into two portions at the point 0:0, and evaluate
                                A'   A”

                               A      O    B
   each portion by the above as if the other were absent.        If
   F(0+.z) is discontinuous when 9:0, it will have different
   values at that point according to whether 0 attains the value
   zero from the negative or from the positive side.
      Thus, let 6 have a small numerical value 8, and let 0A: —8,
   OB = 8,AA’= F(x—8) ,BB’: F(m + 8'). Then when 8 vanishes,
   F (ax—8) becomes F(.r-0) or CA”, and F(.1:+3) becomes
  -F(.z'+0) or OB”. If, then, we evaluate each of the above
   portions as if the other were absent we get QOA” or §F(x—O)
   for the <U+FB01>rstv portion, and lOB” or §F(.r+0) for the second.

                   Convergency of Fourier’s Series.                          133
Hence in such a case S, =§[F(w—- 0) + F(¢+ 0)] *. F(0+.z)
may have such discontinuities for other values of 9 as well,
provided their number is <U+FB01>nite. For if we break up the
integrals A and C between neighbouring discontinuities into
separate portions, we may show, as in (14) and (15), that each
of these portions vanishes when n=<>o . Hence, since there is
only a <U+FB01>nite number of them, their sum vanishes, and there
fore A and C vanish when n=oo ; so that, as before, the
value of S... depends only upon the value of the in<U+FB01>nitely thin
strip which lies between -_l_;h. Consequently F(0+.r) may
have any <U+FB01>nite number of discontinuities between i yr, the
value of S, at any discontinuit being the mean of the values
to which F(0+a:) tends as t e discontinuity is approached
from either side.
    18. If F(0+a:) is not periodic, we may regard the portion
of it included between in as a wave of an arbitrary periodic
function with, in general, <U+FB01>nite discontinuities at i 1r, +31r,

134                   Mr. W. Williams on the
    19. Hence, <U+FB01>nally, if F is <U+FB01>nite, single-valued, and con
tinuous between in, or, if not continuous, has only a <U+FB01>nite
number of <U+FB01>nite discontinuities, and where continuous is
differentiable, then Fourier’s series is convergent, and tends to
the limit F      for all values of .2: except those corresponding to
the discontinuities and the values in, i 3n, &c. The value of
the series at a point of discontinuity is ,1,[F(.e—0) +F(a: + 0)],
the mean of the values to which the function tends when ap
proaching the discontinuity from either side ; and its value at
 in, &c., is HFQn') +F(—7r)], the mean of the values of the
 function at the two limits.
                                 III.
    20. The simpli<U+FB01>cation in the above method of evaluating
the integral Sn consists in having <U+FB01>rst proved that the two
portions A and 0 taken respectively between the limits —1r
to —h, and h to r vanish when n==>0 however near to the
value zero we take the ordinates ih, so that the value of the
integral depends only upon the value of the in<U+FB01>nitely thin
strip B taken between ih. Sun is therefore independent of
the values of F(0+a:) outside the strip B, and consequently
is the same as if F(9+w) remained constant throughout and
equal to its mean value F(.z) within B. That is, S,o =F(.e).
    21. The vanishing of A and 0 when n= 00 depends upon the
 fact that the function integrated, namely xge) sin (2n+ 1)12~0
has an in<U+FB01>nite number of<U+FB01>nite oscillations (that is, oscillations
of <U+FB01>nite amplitude) between —'rr and —h, and between h
and 1r.    Hence, since the number is in<U+FB01>nite and the ampli
tudes <U+FB01>nite, neighbouring oscillations differ in<U+FB01>nitely little
from each other, and therefore the area included between the
ordinates —1r and —h, or h and n, and the portions of the
function and the axis of 0 intercepted by them is in<U+FB01>nitely
small.    In other words, the mean value of the function from
 —1r to —h, and from h to 1r is zero, and therefore the integral
of the function between the same limits is also zero. But the
function itself is not zero: it is merely indeterminate,—the
oscillations being, as it were, too <U+FB01>ne-grained to be traced
individually. The transformation (2n+1)%9=¢, however,
resolves these oscillations, however <U+FB01>ne-grained they may be,
into oscillations of <U+FB01>nite period cutting the axis of 9 at equal
intervals 7r. We are therefore enabled to deal with each
individual oscillation instead of with the oscillations as a
whole, and so to determine the precise effect of each upon the
value of S".
   22. If we break up the portions A and C of the integral Sn

                   Convergency of Fourier’s Series.                 135
into (m+1) elements as above, without transforming the
variable we can show as before that each element vanishes
when n=<>o . But the sum of the m elements taken in this
form is not determinate when n=oo. For as 11 increases
without limit, m also increases without limit, and therefore
the sum tends to the indeterminate value 00 x0, as in the
case of any de<U+FB01>nite integral. We have thus no means of
determining whether A and C vanish when n=oo . But by
means of the transformation (2n+1)§6=¢, we see that each
element is really of the form
                               “22(273. 1)sin WW”

 or       x O), and the form 3 when looked into is found to be
 derived from W, whose real limit is <1.               It is this that
 determines the convergence of S“ to its limiting value.
      23. It is necessary to remark that in general an element of
                                                                   471'

 It?) and F—(h—i—t—gzjl-QQ are both in<U+FB01>nitely small, t being

 without limit by increasing 12. without limit, and F(0+a:)
 is continuous, this condition can be satis<U+FB01>ed for values of In
 less than any assignable <U+FB01>nite limit, however small. But as
 11 increases without limit, the two in<U+FB01>nitesimals t and h must
 diminish at different rates ; for whereas t tends to the value
  zero at a constant rate, h must do so at a constantly dimi

although h is in<U+FB01>nitely small and F(0+a:) is continuous
between 0 and h, we cannot without a special examination

   25. A function which is differentiable wherever it is con
tinuous is said to possess ordinary continuity. We thus see
that ordinary continuity is only a particular kind of continuity.
It is, however, the kind exclusively dealt with in the In<U+FB01>ni
tesimal Calculus ; for the processes of the Differential Calculus
are based upon the properties of the differential coef<U+FB01>cient,
and, practically at least, integration is treated as the inverse
of di<U+FB01>'erentiation. While, however, every <U+FB01>nite and con
tinuous function has an integral, only some possess a dz'<U+FB02>'eren~
tial coe<U+FB01>cient. Here, then, the inverse operation is always
admissible (though it cannot always be formally effected),
whereas the direct operation is not always admissible. For
this reason Weierstrass, in his lectures, once made the de<U+FB01>nite
integral the starting-point for the investigation of the pro
perties of functions, and especially of the condition for the
existence of a differential coef<U+FB01>cient.
   26. Examples of functions which are continuous and per
fectly determinate, but not differentiable, were <U+FB01>rst given by
Weierstrass *.     The essential feature in the case of such func~
tions is that the loci consist of an in<U+FB01>nite number of in<U+FB01>nitely
small zigzags and oscillations (for otherwise the functions
would be ditferentiable). The functions are thus perfectly
determinate and continuous; but              8:0 W8]

cannot anywhere have a determinate value, and the processes
of the Differential Calculus are therefore inapplicable. When
drawn the locus of a function of this kind is indistinguishv
able from that of a function having ordinary continuity, and
whose values at the different points are the mean of the
values of the given oscillating function at the same points.
But we cannot treat the two as analytically the same. Thus,
to borrow an illustration used by Prof. Greenhill, the zigzag
locus CD' is indistinguishable from the straight line AB
when the zigzags are in<U+FB01>nitely small and in<U+FB01>nitely nu—
merous. But we cannot treat it as having the properties of a.
straight line. For the length of the zigza locus is always equal
to the sum of the lengths of C E and E , however small we
make the zigzags,provided they do not alter in form.         If, then,
we treat the zigzag locus as a straight line when the zigzags
are in<U+FB01>nitely small and in<U+FB01>nitely numerous, it follows that
the third side of a triangle is equal in length to the sum of
              it Gayley’s article “ Function,” Encyc. Britt.

11:00 may conspire with the oscillations of F(.z+0) —F(w) to
produce any value whatever, <U+FB01>nite or in<U+FB01>nite. In cases of this
kind we can determine nothing as to the value of the integral
until we know something as to the nature of the continuity of
the function ; for the ordinary de<U+FB01>nition of a continuous
function is too general, and does not confer upon the function
enough properties to enable us by means of known processes
of integration to evaluate the integral.
   27. The conditions under which Fourier’s series has been,
up to the present, proved to be convergent are :—
     i. That the function       must not become in<U+FB01>nite.
    ii. It must be continuous and determinate except at a
<U+FB01>nite number of points, where it may change abruptly in
value or experience a discontinuity.
   iii. It must, wherever it is continuous, possess ordinary
continuity.
   These conditions are suf<U+FB01>cient for all the cases that occur
in ordinary analysis. The third condition, moreover, is
necessary in all such cases, since processes involving differ
entiation constitute an essential part of the In<U+FB01>nitesimal
Calculus. From the point of view of the general theory of

                 Convergency of Fowler’s Series.            139
functions, however, it is necessary to consider the cases in
which this condition does not hold.
    28. The investigation of Dirichlet involves the <U+FB01>rst and
second of these conditions, but not the third. The third is
replaced by the more general one that F(.e) must not have an
in<U+FB01>nite number of maxima and minima between in. In
Dirichlet’s investigation this condition is applied to the
function throughout the whole extent of the integral S”, that
is for all the values of the variable of integration 6. This,
 however, is not necessary. For it has already been shown
that the portions A and C 0f.the integral vanish when n=ao
if only the function is <U+FB01>nite and continuous—the nature of
the continuity being immaterial. The third condition should
therefore apply only to the in<U+FB01>nitely small range of values of
F(0+.z') which lie on either side of 6:0. We shall now
show that this condition is sufficient to ensure that the
integral
               h                    -         1
                 [F(0+o:)—F(.v)] Wee

 vanishes when n=oo , and that therefore Sm
    This integral can be put into the form

It being in<U+FB01>nitely small, while m is in<U+FB01>nitely great and      9)
 in<U+FB01>nitely small between 0 and h. Since             has not an
 in<U+FB01>nite number of maxima and minima, it will ultimately
 preserve the same sign, and either constantly increase or
 constantly diminish between 0 and h. Let it constantly de
 crease. Then, dividing the Variable by m, we get
                       fat)?“
    This integral can now be broken up into the sum of a series
 of elements which are alternately positive and negative and
 constantly diminishing numerically (since 8m 0 and
                                                 0
 diminish numerically).    Hence the integral becomes an alter
 nating series with constantly diminishing terms, and its value
 is therefore less than the <U+FB01>rst term, which is itself in<U+FB01>nitely
 Small. That is, the integral vanishes. Again, let ¢(6) con
 stantly increase between 0 and h. Then its greatest value
 will be <;b(h), and                  will therefore constantly

equal to
               ¢(h)fhs1n0mdaa_fh¢(0) smgm<U+FB01>ae;
and therefore, since the <U+FB01>rst term and the difference of the
two are both in<U+FB01>nitely small, the second term must also be
in<U+FB01>nite]    small. Thus in both cases the integral vanishes,
so that t,,,=F(.7v). It is interesting to note that the alter
nating series which appears in Dirichlet’s investigation appears
also here, but in a different manner. For whereas in the
former case it appears with terms of <U+FB01>nite magnitude, here its
terms are in<U+FB01>nitely small, because the two portions of the
integral Sn which lie outside the in<U+FB01>nitely thin strip bounded
by ih have already been disposed of. There is therefore no
trouble in manipulating the series ; for all that we have to do
is to show that the terms decrease numerically, since the
series can then be neglected, the <U+FB01>rst term being in<U+FB01>nitely
 Small.
    29. Functions having an in<U+FB01>nite number of maxima and
 minima are of two kinds, according as to whether the ampli
 tudes of the oscillations are <U+FB01>nite or in<U+FB01>nitely small. In the
former case the functions are discontinuous, for they violate
 the de<U+FB01>nition in (24) ; in the latter case they are determinate
 and continuous. Dirichlet maintained that all functions
 which have only a <U+FB01>nite number of indeterminate values, and
 are elsewhere continuous, give rise to convergent Fourier
 series *; but Du Bois-Reymond and Schwarz have given
 examples of functions which are determinate and continuous,
 but for which Fourier’s series is divergent 1'. These functions
 are of the class mentioned in (26) for which the integral
              j” [F(0+w) -F (m 5—“        (21313036
 is in<U+FB01>nite or indeterminate.
    30. The condition that F(0+ar) must not have an in<U+FB01>nite
 number of maxima and minima is not a necessary condition
 in order that Fourier’s series may tend to the value F
 For Lipschitzi has shown that the series may be still con

vergent, and tend to the limit F(.r), even when F(9+.r) has
an in<U+FB01>nite number of maxima and minima, provided that at
all the points where the function oscillates, the numerical
value of F(a'+0i3) —F(:t'+9) is always less than B3“, when
8 tends towards the value zero, B being a <U+FB01>nite constant, and
a a positive exponent. Here again it is really necessary to
apply the condition only to the in<U+FB01>nitely small range of
values of the variable of integration which lie on either side
of 0:0; for if the condition is satis<U+FB01>ed for these values, the
integral
             f 1|IIIF(x+6)_F(w)] sin          ,.     i

vanishes, and therefore, as before, Sw=F(.z'). This integral
vanishes under the given conditions because its value cannot
be greater than the value it would have if sin (2n+1)-§0
were replaced by unity, and all the negative values of
F(.r+0)—F(.e) made positive. Hence, since for all values
of 0 between 0 and h, 11 being in<U+FB01>nitely small, the numerical
value of F(a:i0)—F(.r) is <B0“, the integral cannot be
greater than

the function may have an in<U+FB01>nite number of maxima and

Fourier series, whose converging limit is
   31. It is not necessary that F(6+.z') should be <U+FB01>nite
throughout between in. It may become in<U+FB01>nite at a <U+FB01>nite

The sum of the <U+FB01>nite number of elements of this form which
occur in the integral 8,, at the points 01 a2 . . . is therefore
 zero. Again, since F(6+.z) is continuous up to (a—ple) and

 (14), the elements p which occur in the neighbourhood of
 the in<U+FB01>nite values of F(0+w) are in<U+FB01>nitely small when n=eo ,
 and therefore, as before, A and C vanish when n=oo . 1f,
 then, F(0+.z') is not in<U+FB01>nite when 0:0, Sw=F(.2:), provided
 the conditions relating to the portion B are ful<U+FB01>lled; but if
 F(0+.r) is in<U+FB01>nite when 9:0, the value of B is w, and
 therefore Sw=oo, or the series is divergent, as we should
 expect. Hence, if the function contains a <U+FB01>nite number of
 in<U+FB01>nite values of the above kind, Fourier’s series is, ceteris
paribus, convergent forv all values of .r except those corre
 sponding to the in<U+FB01>nite values, and for these values of a: the
 series is divergent.
    32. If the function F(9+w) is indeterminate over a <U+FB01>nite
range of values of m-—for example, if it has an in<U+FB01>nite number
 of discontinuities, or maxima and minima of <U+FB01>nite amplitude,
 over that range—the coef<U+FB01>cients of the series and therefore
 8,, cannot be determinate.         But the function may have an
in<U+FB01>nite number of discontinuities, or maxima and minima of
 <U+FB01>nite amplitude, or singularities in the neighbourhood of a
 <U+FB01>nite number of points; for, since the range within which
 these singularities occur in the neighbourhood of one of
 these points is in<U+FB01>nitely small, and the function is never in
 <U+FB01>nite, the elements of the integrals which determine the
 coef<U+FB01>cients and S, corresponding to this range must be
 in<U+FB01>nitely small. Hence, since there is only a. <U+FB01>nite number
 of such points, the sum of the elements corresponding to them
 vanishes, so that the values of the integrals are determined
 only by the continuous portions of the function. Hence, the
 coef<U+FB01>cients of the series are <U+FB01>nite and determinate, and Sun
tends to a de<U+FB01>nite limit for all values of .2: except those corre

     (L) The coef<U+FB01>cients must be <U+FB01>nite and determinate ;
    (ii.) The nth coef<U+FB01>cient must vanish when n: =0 .
    These are conditions that hold in the case of every series,
independently of its particular character. They are therefore
necessary conditions, but they are not su<U+FB01>icient.
    34. The <U+FB01>rst condition is satis<U+FB01>ed if the function which
determines the coef<U+FB01>cients is not indeterminate or discon
tinuous over a <U+FB01>nite range of values of the variable, but is
continuous and determinate except, possibly, in the neigh
bourhood of a <U+FB01>nite number of points where it may have any
number Whatever of discontinuous, indeterminate, or singular
values. The second of the above conditions is also ful<U+FB01>lled
under the same circumstances.             For, if we take the coef<U+FB01>

Then breaking up each integral into n elements of range 2n
and applying the method of (14) we can show that the inte
grals vanish when n is in<U+FB01>nitely great.
    35. The condition given above to ensure that the coef<U+FB01>cients
of the series are <U+FB01>nite and determinate (namely, that F(v)

are greater than a given <U+FB01>nite quantity 0', however small,
must be in<U+FB01>nitely small when the intervals are in<U+FB01>nitely
small. If the oscillation within an interval 5 taken on either
side of a given point is always >0 when 8 is diminished
without limit, the function is said to be discontinuous at that
point, and the point is spoken of as a point of discontinuity;
and, on the other hand, if the oscillation is <o', the point is
a point of continuity. If every point within a <U+FB01>nite segment
is a point of discontinuity, the function is said to be discon
tinuous over that segment, as, for example, a function which
has an in<U+FB01>nite number of maxima and minima of <U+FB01>nite am
plitude over a <U+FB01>nite range of points. If within a given segment
the points of continuity are <U+FB01>nite in number, the segment
can be broken up into a <U+FB01>nite number of other segments,
over which the function is discontinuous. But if between two
points there are no segments of discontinuity, there may,
nevertheless, be any number whatever, <U+FB01>nite or in<U+FB01>nite, of
points of discontinuity. “In the <U+FB01>rst case the function is
not integrable, since the sum of the intervals of discontinuity
is <U+FB01>nite. 1n the second case, Hankel, who has investigated
this matter with the view of rendering Riemannls condition
less indeterminate in character, has shown that the sum of the
intervals of discontinuity cannot be <U+FB01>nite 1'. Hence, the
function is, in such a case, integrable, and accordingly, Rie
mann’s condition may be more precisely stated as follows :—
A function is integrable between a and b              it is <U+FB01>nite and de

termmale, and is not discontinuous over a <U+FB01>nite range of values
of the variable between a and b. Thus stated the condition is
more general than the one given above, for it does not imply
that the function is continuous: it may have any number
whatever of discontinuous points, but not of discontinuous seg
ments. The coef<U+FB01>cients of Fourier’s series are <U+FB01>nite and deter
minate, and the nth coefficient vanishes when n=oo whenever
Riemann’s condition as to integrability is ful<U+FB01>lled. For, if the
function integrated is never in<U+FB01>nite, and the sum of the.
intervals 31 82 . . . 5,, containing the points of discontinuity can
be made in<U+FB01>nitely small, the sum of the elements correspond
ing to these intervals in any integral can contribute nothing
to the value of that integral. For this sum cannot be greater
than the product of the greatest value of the function, which
is necessarily a <U+FB01>nite quantity, into the sum of the intervals
(51+3,+ . .. +5"), which is in<U+FB01>nitely small.           The value of'
the integral is therefore the same as the value it would have
if the function were not discontinuous at the given points.
But we have proved that in this case the coef<U+FB01>cients are
<U+FB01>nite and determinate, and that the nth=0 when n: w .
   36. Now, the conditions which ensure that the coef<U+FB01>cients
of the series are <U+FB01>nite and determinate are also the conditions
which ensure that the portions A and C of the integral Sn
vanish when n=oo , for we have only to replace F(o) sin no in
the coef<U+FB01>cients bn by                sin (2n+ 1E9 and apply the
reasoning of (14). Hence, whenever the coef<U+FB01>cients of the.
series determined by Fourier’s method are <U+FB01>nite and determi
nate, the value of the series depends only upon the in<U+FB01>nitely
thin strip

and therefore the remaining condition to be ful<U+FB01>lled in order
that the series may he convergent is that this integral must
have a determinate value when n=oo . Writing this integral

the value of the <U+FB01>rst term is F(a'). Hence, if the series is to
be convergent, the second term on the right must vanish or
tend to a de<U+FB01>nite limit. In the former case the series repre
sents the function for the given value of x. In the latter
case it does not.

in the above vanishes, or. has a <U+FB01>nite limitingvaluewhen

146                       Mr. W. Williams on the

tinuous, and
     i.      the continuity is ordinary continuity ; or
    ii. ]f the function has not an in<U+FB01>nite number of oscilla
            tions ; or
   iii. If the in<U+FB01>nitely numerous oscillations satisfy Lipschitz’s
            condition;
then the term vanishes, and Sm=F(.2:). In all other cases
the term must be treated as indeterminate. We may, of
course, investigate its values for different types of continuous
functions, and so widen the limitations of the function F. But
we cannot determine the general nature of these limitations
because we cannot evaluate the integrals
                  Kiwis —Fo>1—_si“<21;1)*”ae
by known methods of integration until we are provided with
conditions other than those involved in the de<U+FB01>nition of a
“ continuous function,”-—such other conditions, for example,
as i., ii., and iii. above.
   38. It is necessary to remark that a series of the form
                  a,sin.r+a,sin 2w+...+a,,sinn.r...
may be convergent, and tend to a de<U+FB01>nite limiting value
which we may denote by F(.r) for all values of x, and yet it
may be impossible to derive the coef<U+FB01>cients by Fourier’s
method from F(.r) because F(.r) may not be integrable
according to Riemann’s de<U+FB01>nition. Riemann has given an
example of such a series in the paper already mentioned. In
a case of this sort, however, since the coef<U+FB01>cients are not
determined by Fourier’s method, the series is not really a
Fourier series. For a Fourier series is one in which the
coef<U+FB01>cients are de<U+FB01>ned by the de<U+FB01>nite integrals
        a,,=l         F(v) cos 111181;, b":        F(v) sin nvbv,
              71'  _,|-                     77   —1r
and the object of our investigation is to determine the most
general conditions under which the series thus de<U+FB01>ned is
convergent.
 ' Hence, since it is necessary that the function should be
integrable in order that the coef<U+FB01>cients to be derived from it
may be <U+FB01>nite and determinate, we get when the function has
no in<U+FB01>nite values the following necessary and su<U+FB01>icient con
ditions for the convergency of a Fourier series :—

                  Convergency of Fourier’s Series.           147
    i. The function must not be indeterminate or discontinuous
over a <U+FB01>nite range of values of the variable ;

must vanish, 01- tend to de<U+FB01>nite limiting values, when n=00
and h is in<U+FB01>nitely small.
   39. This last condition is somewhat analogous to the con
dition which holds in the case of Taylor’s Theorem when applied
to numerical functions, namely, that the “remainder ” after the
nth term must vanish when n is increased without limit ;—a
sort of test to be applied to each individual function dealt
with, because we have no means of determining in a general
manner when the condition is ful<U+FB01>lled. If the <U+FB01>rst condition
is satis<U+FB01>ed, the coef<U+FB01>cients of the series are <U+FB01>nite and deter
minate, the nth coef<U+FB01>cient vanishes when n= 00 , and the value
of the series at any point .2: depends only upon the in<U+FB01>nitely
small portion of the function F which lies on either side of
that point. If the second condition is satis<U+FB01>ed, the series is
convergent, and if, further, the integral involved in this con
dition vanishes, the converging limit of the series is         If
the <U+FB01>rst condition is not satis<U+FB01>ed, the coef<U+FB01>cients of the series
are indeterminate and meaningless, and the series cannot
therefore be formed. Whether the function can still be
 represented by an harmonic series in such a case—the coef<U+FB01>
cients being determined otherwise—is a matter with which
we are not now concerned, nor are we concerned with deter
mining whether the same function can be expanded harmoni
 cally in more ways than one. We are concerned only with
determining the most general conditions under which Fourier’s
 method of expanding functions into harmonic series is appli
 cable. ln cases where it fails, we have no general method of
proceeding.
    40. If the function has in<U+FB01>nite values, two cases may arise
according as the function has or has not an in<U+FB01>nite number
 of maxima and minima where it is in<U+FB01>nite. In the former
 case, as shown above, the series is convergent (except, of
 course, at the points where the function is in<U+FB01>nite) pro
 vided the function becomes in<U+FB01>nite only at a <U+FB01>nite number
 of points, and that its integral vanishes when taken between
 limits in<U+FB01>nitel near to and on either side of each of these
 points. In t e latter case, for example in the case of
                    l . . . .                          l

 in<U+FB01>nite number of maxima and minima values, Riemann has
 shown in the paper already referred to that this condition is
 not suf<U+FB01>cient. For, although the integral of the function
 taken at the point where it is in<U+FB01>nite may vanish, this integral
 when the function is multiplied by cos nx or sin m: where
 n=oo may become in<U+FB01>nite. In the <U+FB01>rst case the oscillations
 of the function mutually compensate each other, but in the
 second case the factors sin rim or cos m: may destroy this
 compensation when n=oo , for the oscillations of the two
 factors may conspire to produce a resultant function which
 is in<U+FB01>nite without oscillations. The value of the integral in
  such a case is, of course, indeterminate, and so it is not suf<U+FB01>
 cient merely to know that the integral of the function vanishes
 at the point where it is in<U+FB01>nite.
     41. The complete investigation of the convergency of
  Fourier’s series ultimately resolves itself into a discussion of the
 conditions of integrability and the nature of functions. We
 thus see that the inquiry leads us to the very foundations of
 the In<U+FB01>nitesimal Calculus, and in this respect Fourier’s series
 differs essentially from Taylor’s. For in the case of the latter
 series the <U+FB01>eld of investigation is, at the very outset, restricted
 for us by the nature of the coe<U+FB01>icients, since the process of
 differentiation limits us to functions of a comparatively simple
 kind.
            XII. Dielectrics.     By Home APPLEYARD *.
 SOME experiments upon the change of resistance of certain
        dielectrics with the duration of the testing-current, and
 with the testing-voltage, were described in a paperT which I
 read before the Physical Society two years ago. In continua
 tion of this research some further tests have been made, the
 principal object being to determine the effect of temperature
 upon the dielectric resistance. For this purpose, mica and
 parafiined paper, in the form of condensers, have been
chosen.
     The resistances are measured by the “direct de<U+FB02>exion”
 method, and are expressed in megoh'ms pro inicrofarad. The
testing-voltage is the same throughout all the tests (450
volts), and each measurement is computed from the galvano
meter-reading noted after the testing-current has been
applied for one minute.

and eight mica condensers, each of half a inicrofarad, were
enclosed, separately, in water-tight cases, and submerged in
a tank of water, the temperature of which could be con
tinuously controlled. The platinum thermometers “ used for
determining the temperature within the dielectric of the
Condensers have already been described.
    Connexion between the condensers and the testing
apparatus was made by wires insulated with india~rubber;
these were twenty-<U+FB01>ve feet long. The connexions within
the condenser cases, where the wires were soldered to the
respective sets of tin-foil sheets, were carefully sealed with
paraf<U+FB01>n wax.      The ends of the leads were bared and cleaned
in the usual way, for about six inches. Two such insulated
wires were connected to each condenser, one to each set of
tin-foil sheets.
                            Smface Leakage.
    Suppose a current to enter one of these condensers at one
of its insulated leads, which we will call A ; and the second
lead, B, put to earth. It is clear that there are at least four
paths—(a), (b), (c), ((l)—for the current between A and
 earth :—
     (a) Surface leakage at the end of A where the current
          enters the lead.                                            '
     (6) Surface leakage at the end of A within the condenser.
     (0) Surface leakage over the dielectric within the con
           denser.
     (d) Through the dielectric of the condenser.
     The leads can generally be so chosen that there is practically
 no conduction through their dielectrics. When measuring
 the resistance of the condenser by the “direct de<U+FB01>exion”
 method, the current to which the galvanometer responds is
 that due to the sum of the currents through (a), (b), (c), and
 (d). We have to determine what the de<U+FB02>exion would be if
 all the current went by way of (cl). This can be done,
 approximately, by taking a preliminary test, with the end B
 disconnected from earth, and carefully cleaned ; noting the
 de<U+FB02>exion after the current has been applied at the end A
 for one minute.           The de<U+FB01>exion thus obtained must be
 deducted from the de<U+FB01>exion observed during the second
 operation, which consists in putting the end B to earth, and

again applying the current and noting the de<U+FB02>exion after
one minute.
     It sometimes happens that we want to separate (a) from
 (b) and (c) ; that is to say, we require to know what part of
the preliminary de<U+FB02>exion is due to the exposed lead, and what
part is due to internal leakage at the condenser. For this
purpose I have applied a suggestion made to me by Mr. W.
A. Price *, and have used a “ guard-wire ” to eliminate the
leakage at (a). The method, which was used for its <U+FB01>rst
 trial in connexion with these experiments, consists in winding
 one or two turns of bare wire around the cleaned end of A,
 at some point not very far from the middle of the cleaned
portion, intercepting the path of leakage. This wire is then
 connected to the testing-battery, as shown in Fig. 1.

     The ef<U+FB01>cacy of the “guard-wire” for the present tests
was proved by the following experiment. A copper earth
wire was given several turns around the insulated lead A,
just above the cleaned ends, to facilitate leakage; and the
preliminary test was then made in the usual way. The
observed deflexion, due to (a), (b), and (c), was 4 divs. The
cleaned end was then smeared with a mixture of glycerine
and blacklead, and the resulting de<U+FB02>exion was far off the
scale ; (a) had been increased enormously. A “guard-wire ”
was then applied at the middle of the smeared portion of the
lead, and the de<U+FB02>exion was at once restored to its original
value of 4 divs.
     In practice it was always possible to avoid leakage (a) by
giving a little care to the cleaning of the lead ; the “ guard
 wire ” was therefore used only as a check, and if it produced
no change in the preliminary de<U+FB02>exion it was concluded that
the preliminary deflexion was due to the effects of (b) and (0)
alone, and that there was no leakage (a).

Review,’ vol. xxxvii. no. 941,     . 702 (1895). In the appendix to the
present pa er I have evaluated t 6 possible errors, and shown that they

                             Results.
 - The results of the tests are given in Table I., which requires
little explanation. The “ Capacity,” “ Resistance,” and “' Elec
tri<U+FB01>cation” of paraf<U+FB01>n-paper and mica are there tabulated at
the various temperatures.
    Capacity—As standards of capacity two condensers were
used. These were mica of l and 0'5 microfarad capacity
respectively. They were submerged in water and kept always
at the same temperature, 27° 0., which is just above the
maximum air temperature. The object of using two standards
was to avoid shunts and to simplify the work.
   In the paraf<U+FB01>n-paper condensers there appears to be an
irregular variation of capacity with temperature. It is too
small to affect them in practical telegraphy; but it is suf<U+FB01>
ciently large to prohibit their use as standards. \Ve must
suppose that the softening of the wax, and the consequent
approach or recession of the tinfoil sheets, is responsible for
part of these changes, to which must be added the variation of
the speci<U+FB01>c inductive capacity of the dielectric. It is curious
that with paraf<U+FB01>n-paper condensers the capacit diminishes
as the resistance diminishes. With gutta-perc<U+FB01>a or india
rubber core the result is nearly always the reverse of this.
    Owing to the vibration of the building in which the tests
were made, the capacities could not be measured with a greater
accuracy than 1 per cent. ; but within this limit it is safe to
say that throughout the whole range of temperature mica
retains a constant capacity.

   It is usual to assume ‘ that the resistance R, of a dielectric
at any temperature 1- is represented by an equation of the form

from which may be deduced the resistance corresponding to
any temperature T. It is interesting to see how nearly the
results calculated from (3) agree with the observed values, as
can be done by drawing the two curves which represent the
observed and calculated resistances respectively.
   The agreement between these two curves is so close, consi
dering the conventions which always have to be adopted in
tests upon dielectrics, that it has been suggested to me that a
simple logarithmic curve may perhaps represent the true state
of affairs, the observed results being assumed more or less at
fault. This seems improbable for the following reasonz—ln
equation (1) a is really the ratio of two resistances at an
interval of 1° C., and it is presumed* that this ratio, i. e.

                                 RH’
is constant for all values of 'r. This might be true for some
ideal dielectric whose structure was perfectly de<U+FB01>nite at all
temperatures, and which made invariable contact with its
electrodes under all conditions ; but there is no reason why a;
should be constant for a substance having the instability of wax.

   One use of these results is to enable the resistances of
condensers to be reduced to the resistance at some standard
temperature. A similar correction has always to be applied
for gutta-percha and india-rubber cores. It is usual to
draw up a table, assuming a constant over a given range, and
to supply a correcting logarithm for each degree of tempe
rature. This may be suf<U+FB01>ciently accurate for small ranges of
temperature ; but I would suggest that a better way is to work
from the observed results directly, making no assumptions
                       * See Appendix II.

 whatever as to a. In order to do this, the “ observed ”
 results should be plotted as a curve, coordinating resistances
'and temperatures. The length of the ordinate corresponding
 to standard temperature on the “ observed ” curve is then to
 be taken as unity, and the lengths of the ordinates at every
 successive degree are to be expressed in terms of this unit.
 A table can then be drawn up giving acorrecting divisor cor
 responding to each degree. With the aid of a slide-rule such
 a table can be completed in little more than an hour; and it
 is certainly more expeditious and less arbitrary than the
 ordinary tables of dielectric corrections. As an example, I
 have given in Table II. the divisors for paraf<U+FB01>n-paper, from
 33° F. to 110° F., deduced directly from the “ observed ”

     The resistances of mica condensers at the different tempe
 ratures are also given on Table 1.; the curve drawn from
 them is not so smooth as that which represents the behaviour
 of paraf<U+FB01>n-paper condensers ; at the colder temperatures the
 resistance of the mica is so high that the preliminary de<U+FB02>exion,
 corresponding to (a), (b), and (c), is by no means small
 as compared to the second de<U+FB01>exion, due to (a), (b), (c), and
 (d) together. The results given are the best that could be

have been advisable to connect the eight mica condensers in
parallel; the de<U+FB02>exions to be observed would then have been ‘
greater, but the number of tests would have been fewer, and
there would have been less chance of comparison one with
another.
    Electri<U+FB01>cation—In Table I. the “ Elec. p.c.” is given for
paraf<U+FB01>n-paper and mica, at the various temperatures. This
is derived from the galvanometer de<U+FB02>exions taken respectively
at one minute and two minutes after the application of the
testing current, thus :—

    The following <U+FB01>gures (Table III.) may be useful as indi
cating the difference between the de<U+FB02>exions obtained in ca
pacity tests, using “charge” and “discharge” de<U+FB02>exions,
respectively, for paraf<U+FB01>n-paper, mica, gutta-percha, and india
rubber. The de<U+FB02>exions represented by “ charge ” are not so
uniform as the “discharge ” readings, that is to say, a repe
 tition generally gives a different reading, owing in part per
 haps to some of the last charge having remained. This,
 however, is scarcely to be observed with mica. “ Discharge ”
 readings can generally be reproduced accurately.

   If the temperature of paraf<U+FB01>n-wax is raised much higher
than is indicated in Table 1., the change of state, as melting is
approached, is characterized by a corresponding decrease in

diameter, was used. The lower plate was provided with a
projecting rim to retain the wax, and was rather larger than
the top plate. Three small wafers of thin ebonite sheet
(16 mils) were used as distance-pieces. Melted wax was
then poured in, <U+FB01>lling the space between the plates.
   There are so many disturbing in<U+FB02>uences affecting the resist—
ance during the change of state, connected with the latent
heat of solidi<U+FB01>cation, the unequal melting, the absence or not
of “ electri<U+FB01>cation,” and the contractions and expansions of
the wax, that only qualitative results can be given.
   Heating.—Starting at about 20° 0. below the melting
point, the resistance rapidly diminishes until actual melting
begins; there is then a de<U+FB01>nite fall to something like one
third of what the resistance was just before melting. If heat
is still applied to the condenser, the resistance keeps steady
until the melting is complete; after which the resistance
again diminishes steadily. So far as I am able to discover
there is no “ electri<U+FB01>cation ” while the wax is in the melted
condition.                        .
   The spark-resisting power of the melted wax is at least
one third that of the so]id. The melted wax in this particular
condenser broke down under 1200 steady volts; the insulation
heals, as in the case of oil, to break down again in a few
seconds.
   Cooling.——A converse process occurs during cooling; and
as the cooling is more uniform than the heating the effects
can be more easily noted. The resistance of the melted wax
gradually increases until the <U+FB01>rst crystals appear, at which
stage it remains more or less constant until the process is
nearly complete, when it very rapidly increases to about
three times the value it had during the partial crystallization;
it then behaves as solid wax.

XIII. On New Instruments for the Direct Measurement of the
   Frequency of Alternating or Pulsatiny Electric Currents.
   By ALBERT CAMPBELL, B.A.*
IN many experiments with alternating currents it is a very
       great convenience to be able to draw the supply from an
ordinary lighting circuit, but the value of such a source of
current is often lessened by the fact that the frequency of
alternation is usually variable, the limits of variation being
in some cases very wide indeed. It was for the purpose of
getting rid of this uncertainty that, about a year ago, I
devised the two instruments described below.
   Most methods of measuring frequency depend either on
Impedance measurements or on the production of Resonance
(or Synchronism). The former I avoided, for unfortunately
the wave-form as well as the frequency affects impedance, and
I aimed at an instrument which would give trustworthy
   Of theforResonance
readings        any kind of(orpulsatin   current whatever.
                                 SyncI<U+FB01>ronism)    methods two are
familiar. The <U+FB01>rst consists in running a small synchronous
meter and measuring its speed by a speed-counter or indicator.
This is a rather laborious way, and not very accurate if only
a tachometer is used.        In the second method'l' a stretched
wire carrying the alternating current is placed in a constant
magnetic <U+FB01>eld; by varying the stretching-weight the wire is

160         Mr. A. Campbell on the Measurement of the
tuned until it is set into strong vibration, and then the
frequency is calculated from the tension, length, and mass of
the wire. The original arrangement has been simpli<U+FB01>ed, I
 believe, by Mr. Alexander Russell, of Faraday House, who
uses a steel wire thrown into vibration by an iron-cored
choking-coil placed near it.           In both arrangements some
 uncertainty is introduced by the wire passing over a bridge
 or ulley.
     n my <U+FB01>rst type of instrument I developed the last
 mentioned arrangement. The working parts of the instru
 ment are shown in <U+FB01>g. 1:—
                                   Fig. 1.

     A. steel wire, W, is fastened at one end to a spring, S, and
  at the other to a rack, R, sliding in guides. Near the wire
  is <U+FB01>xed an electromagnet M with a laminated core ; this
  magnet is excited by the given alternating current. By
  turning the pinion P the wire can be tightened until it is
  thrown into vigorous vibration by the magnet. The pointer Q
  attached to the pinion then shows directly the frequency on a
  suitably graduated scale. Many varieties of this arrangement
  may be used ; for example, the pointer may be fastened to S,
  or other kinds of magnifying-gear may replace the rack-and
  plnlon.
      With careful use I believe that this type is accurate to
   within less than 0'2 per cent., but it is not so convenient as
   the second type, which I now proceed to describe. This more
   practical instrument is shown diagrammatically in <U+FB01>g. 2.
      Here M is a choking-coil <U+FB01>xed near a steel strip A*, which
   can be moved back and forward throu h the clamp B by a

<U+FB01>eld due to M causes the maximum resonance, and the fre
quency is read oft~ on the scale Gr.
   By proper choice of the dimensions of the vibrator and the
rack-and-pinion a very extended scale may be obtained. 1
have constructed one instrument in which the pointer goes
more than twice round the circumference from 40 periods per
sec. to 150 periods per sec., and at the middle part of the scale
the accuracy of reading is within 0'3 per cent.
   The electromagnet M is usually of <U+FB01>ne wire, and has a
non-inductive resistance in circuit with it, so that the current
taken is very small.
   The reading is usually taken at the point of maximum
resonance. This is observed by means of the sound given out
or by watching the variation in amplitude either directly or
by mirror, light-spot, and scale. Sometimes I <U+FB01>x near the
vibrator an adjustable piece, against which it rattles or jars
when the resonance is suf<U+FB01>cient. This jarring piece may be
made part of an electric circuit, including a lamp or an indi
cating instrument, in such a way that the circuit becomes
broken when the greatest resonance occurs.
   The instrument can be used as a speed-indicator for
machinery by attaching to the rotating shaft a suitable com
mutator to make and break an electric circuit carried to the
instrument, which may thus be at any distance.
   If we keep to simple English we might call such an
instrument a “ Wave-teller,” but to make the meaning clearer
I propose to name it a “ Frequency-teller.”
   In conclusion I may mention that since there is very little
inertia in the moving parts the readings can be taken rapidly,
and thus the instrument can be made to follow fairly quick
changes in frequency.

        XIV. Some Experiments with Rbntgen’s Rays.
          By SILVANUS P. THOMPSON, D.Sc., F.R.S.*
      HE following is a brief narration of points observed by
        me during the past three months, and which are now
brought before the Physical Society.
    1. Many experiments have been made to Observe polariza
tion of .r-rays, but no trace has been found. Tourmalines of
several colours, and thicknesses varying from 0'1 millim. to
6 millim., have been used. Andalusite, mica, calc-spar cut
in slices arallel to the axis, epidote, and ripidolite have been
tried wit out result. The method pursued has chie<U+FB02>y been
to cut the slice of crystal into three parts, laying two of them
upon the third, one of the upper parts having its axis parallel
to the axis of the under part, while the other had its axis laid
at right angles.    In this way equal thicknesses of crystal Were
compared side b side. Thinking that results might be
obtained from dic roic crystals containing a metal of consi
derable atomic weight, slices were tried of crystals of sulphate
of nickel, sulphate of nickel and potassium, sulphate of cobalt
and potassium, sulphate of cobalt and ammonium, <U+FB02>uosilicate
of cobalt, and <U+FB02>uosilicate of nickel, but no trace of polarization
was seen.
   Another method consisted in comparing the opacity of
tourmaline in a direction parallel to the axis with that of an
equal thickness in a direction at right angles to the axis.
Not the slightest difference was observed either in the photo
graphic shadows or with the use of a luminescent screen of
barium platinocyanide.
    2. For several weeks in the months of February and March
experiments were made with many different forms of bulb to
determine the source of the .r-rays and the form of tube most
favourable to their production. In common with the con
clusions of so many other observers, it was found that the
effective source was in every case a surface against which the
kathodic discharge was directed. A form of tube which gave
                              Fig. 1.
results superior to those of any Crookes tube at the time in
the market is shown in <U+FB01>g. 1, in which the kathode consisted

 of a number of iron wires spread out from a centre, and the
 antikathode, which also served as anode, was a spade-shaped
piece    of iron
bulbs were        or was
               tried  platinum.    Anotheranform
                          prov'idednwith          of which

                                                        kathode   of
 foil, and an internal anode projecting to about the centre,
terminating in a small spade of platinum‘foil as antikathode
 (<U+FB01>g. 2). This also gave good results, but was liable to he pierced
                                Fig. 2.
 at high stages of exhaustion. With this form various experi
 ments were tried as to the in<U+FB02>uence of the material of the
  antikathodic surface. Glass was found to work quite well,
  but to be more troublesome than metal. A phosphorescent
  enamel made by fusing together two parts of a soft lead-glass
  with one part of Balmain’s luminous paint was also tried.
  The result of these experiments was to show that, contrary to
  the opinion then current that the presence of much phospho—
  rescence or <U+FB02>uorescence was promotive 70f the production of
  the w-rays, the .v-rays were most freely emitted when the
  conditions were such as to waste as little as possible of their
   energy in internal fluorescent e<U+FB02>'e‘cts: that in fact a metal
   surface was preferable to a surface of glass, enamel, or por
   celain for receiving the impact cf the kathodic discharge.
      At about this time Mr. Jackson’s perfected form of focus
   tube was brought out, a tube which for photographic purposes
   was found superior to any other form, and has not yet been
   surpassed.
      3. Observing in some of these experiments that the metal
   spade used as antikathode became red-hot, a special tube was
 constructed for me by Mr. Gardiner to test the question
y_ whether the high temperature of the antikathode was, or was
“not, prejudicial to the emission of x-ravs. This special tube
   (<U+FB01>g. 3) was furnished with an antikathode of platinum-foil
   mounted so that while serving both as antikathode and as
   anode it could be heated by passing a current through it
   from an auxiliary battery. Observing the activity of the
   tube by means of a luminescent screen of platinocyanide of
   potassium, it was found that the heating of the antikathode,
-80 far from being disadvantageous, decidedly promoted the

164               Dr. Silvanus P. Thompson on
emission of .r-rays, and increased the continuity and brilliancy
of the luminescence.     Various amounts of current were sent
                                Fig. 3.
 through the platinum, the most effective result being obtained
 by currents which heated the surface to visible redness.
 Whether the effect is a direct one or an indirect owing to the
 driv'in‘glout of occluded gases is not yet determined.
    4.    hen watching with the luminescent screen the emis
 sion of .r-rays within bulbs connected with the ump, some
 observations were made of direct importance wit<U+FB01> regard to
 the state of exhaustion that is best. The degree of vacuum
 which suf<U+FB01>ces for the production of kathodic shadows is
 known not to be suf<U+FB01>cient for the production of x-rays. It is
 also known that when evacuation is pushed very far the
 internal resistance of the bulbs rises very high, so that they
 become almost non-conductive.        If a bulb is exhausted, and
 heated during exhaustion, and the vacuum pushed almost to
 non-conductivity, and if a little air is again admitted and the
 tube again exhausted, the high degree of vacuum is again
 very soon reached, probably because during the <U+FB01>rst ex
 haustion the gases absorbed upon the walls of the bulb were
 mostly removed. After three or four repetitions of this
 process the transition from the low state of vacuum to the
  high state is exceedingly rapid. If a bulb in such a condition
 is examined by the luminescent screen while the pump is at
  work, scarcely any trace of .r-rays can be noticed so long as
  the vacuum is such that the resistance is low. A pair of
  discharging-points arranged as a shunt to the tube serves as
  an approximate gauge.      Kathodic shadows can be seen when
  the resistance is so low that the discharge-points do not spark
  even when placed 3 millimetres apart. When the resistance
  rises so that the spark-points must be put 20 or 30 millimetres
  apart w-rays begin to be given off ; and are given off both
  from the back and from the front of the antikathode.        The
  bulb, as seen upon the adjacent screen, shows two pale lumi

            some Ewpew'ments with Rontgen’s Rays.            165
nous regions divided by a <U+FB01>ne oblique black line which is in
the plane of the antikathode (<U+FB01>g. 4). 1f the pump goes on
                              Fig. 4.
 working, in two or three seconds, or while only a few cubic
 centimetres of mercury pass through the pump, the pheno
 menon changes. The luminosity behind the antikathode dies
 out, and that in front of the antikathode increases; so that
 there is seen simply a bright anterior region ending at the
 oblique plane of the antikathode, beyond which all is dark
 (<U+FB01>g. 5).    This oblique delimitation can also be seen in the
  yellow phosphorescence upon the walls of the bulb.         This
  sudden transition occurs after the resistance of the bulb has
  passed its minimum. The brightest luminescence occurs
  when the spark-length exceeds 40—50 millimetres. The lumi
  nosity does not fall o<U+FB02>' much even at very small angles to the
  plane of the antikathode, proving that the emission of a:
  rays does not follow Lambert’s law of the cosine by any
  means.    Experiments on this point are still in progress,

   5. The phenomenon of diselectri<U+FB01>cation by :c-rays is very
readily demonstrated. For this purpose I have f'ounda very.
convenient instrument to be an electroscope consisting of
two strips of aluminium leaf (Which is lighter than gold leaf)
suspended in a thin-glass jar entirely covered with a <U+FB01>ne
metal gauze. It is charged with a dry pile, and a metal
cap is then plat ed over the charging knob, so that it is
entirely electrostatically screened from external electrical
in<U+FB02>uences. Positive and negative electri<U+FB01>cations are both
readily discharged, even at the distance of several feet from
the bulb.
   6. On the <U+FB01>rst announcement of the diselectrifying pro
perties of .r-rays, I attempted to obtain electric dust-<U+FB01>gures
as shadows of metallic objects by applying the asrays to dis
charge electri<U+FB01>ed surfaces of glass or ebonite upon which
mixed powders of red lead and sulphur were then dusted.
These were obtained almost at the <U+FB01>rst trial; but to produce
them satisfactoril requires a little care.
   The object whose shadow is to be obtained—a pair of
scissors, for example—is laid upon a thin sheet of aluminium
placed to stand on four feet at the height of about 20 millim.
over the sheet of ebonite or varnished glass upon which the
shadow is to be thrown. This sheet of ebonite is <U+FB01>rst-carefully
diselectri<U+FB01>ed by passing it over an alcohol flame, and then laid
upon an earthed sheet of foil upon the table. The aluminium
tray with the scissors upon it is placed over the ebonite. A
guard-box of lead with a rectangular hole in its top is placed
over all. Then the aluminium tray is charged electrically
by a small influence-machine which has one pole put to
earth and the other connected to the aluminium tray.          In
this state of things the ebonite plate lies in an electro
static <U+FB01>eld, but is not electri<U+FB01>ed upon its upper surface.

XV. 0n the Theory of Optical Images, with Special Reference
      to the Moroscope. By Loan RAYLEIGH, Sec. R. S.*
THE special subject of this paper has been treated from
        two distinct points of view. In the work of Helmholtz 1'
the method followed is analogous to that which had long
 been used in the theory of the telescope. It consists in '
tracing the image representative of a mathematical point in the
 object, the point being regarded as self-luminous. The limit
 to de<U+FB01>nition depends upon the fact that owing to diffraction the
 image thrown even by a perfect lens is not con<U+FB01>ned to a point,
 but distends itself over a patch or disk of light of <U+FB01>nite dia
 meter. Two points in the object can appear fully separated only
 when the representative disks are nearly clear of one another.
 The application to the microscope was traced by means of a
 somewhat extended form of Lagrange’s general optical
 theorem, and the conclusion was reached that the smallest
 resolvable distance 6 is given by

   The limit can be depressed only by a diminution in M, such
   as photography makes possible, or by an increase in p, the
   refractive index of the medium in which the object is
   situated.
       This method, in which the object is considered point by
   point, seems the most straight-forward, and to a great extent
    it solves the problem without more ado.                 When the repre
   sentative disks are thoroughly clear of one another, the two
   points in which they originate are resolved, and on the other
   hand, when the disks overlap the points are not distinctly
   separated. Open questions can relate only to intermediate
   cases of partial overlapping and various degrees of resolution.
   In these cases (as has been insisted upon by Dr. Stoney) we
   have to consider the relative phases of the overlapping lights
   before we can arrive at a complete conclusion.
       If the various points of the object are self-luminous, there
' is no permanent phase-relation between the lights of the
   overlapping disks, and the resultant illumination is arrived at
   by simple addition of separate intensities. This is the
   situation of affairs in the ordinary use of a telescope, whether
   the object be a double star, the disk of the sun, the disk of
   the moon, or a terrestrial body. The distribution of light in
   the image of a double point, or of a double line, was especially
   considered in a former paper *, and we shall return to the
  subject later.
      When, as sometimes happens in the use of the telescope,
  and more frequently in the use of the microscope, the over
  lapping lights have permanent phase-relations, these inter
  mediate cases require a further treatment ; and this is a
  matter of some importance as involving the behaviour of' the
  instrument in respect to the <U+FB01>nest detail which it is capable
  of rendering. We shall see that the image of a double point
  under various conditions can be delineated without dif<U+FB01>culty.

preceded that of Helmholtz, similar conclusions were reached;
but the demonstrations were deferred, and, indeed, they do
not appear ever to have been set forth in a systematic manner.
Although some of the positions then taken up, as for example
that the larger features and the <U+FB01>ner structure of a micro
scopic object are delineated by different processes, have since
had to be abandoned *, the publication of this paper marks a
great advance, and has contributed powerfully to the modern
development of the microscope 1'.              In Prof. Abbe’s method
of treating the matter the typical object is not a luminous
point, but a grating illuminated by plane waves. Thence arise
the well-known di<U+FB02>raction spectra, which are focussed near the
back of the object-glass in its principal focal plane. If the
light be homogeneous, the spectra are reduced to points, and
 the <U+FB01>nal image may be regarded as due to the simultaneous
 action of these points acting as secondary centres of light.
 It is argued that the complete representation of the object
 requires the co-operation of all the spectra. When only a
 few are present, the re rcsentation is imperfect; and w on
 there is only one—for t is purpose the central image counts
 as a spectrum—the representation wholly fails.
     That this point of view o<U+FB01>'ers great advantages, at least
 when the object under consideration is really a grating, is at
 once evident. More especially is this the case in respect of
 the question of the limit of resolution.            It is certain that if
 one spectrum only be operative, the image must consist of a
 uniform <U+FB01>eld of light, and that no sign can appear of the
  real periodic structure of the object. From this considera
 tion the resolving-power is readily deduced, and it may be
  convenient to recapitulate the argument for the case of
  perpendicular incidence. In <U+FB01>g. ]. AB represents the axis,
  A being in the plane of the object (grating) and B in the
  plane of the image. The various diffraction spectra are
  focussed by the lens LL' in the principal focal plane, SO repre
  senting the central image due to rays which issue normally
  from the grating. After passing So the rays diverge in a

     T It would seem that the present subject, like many others, has
  suffered from over specialization, much that is familiar to the micro
  scopist bein almost unknown to physicists, and vice versd. For myself
  I must con ess that it is only recently, in consequence of av discussion
  between Mr. L. Wright and Dr. G. J. Stoney in the ‘ English Mechanic ’

  Work, and have earned that it was conducted upon different lines to that

 The <U+FB01>rst lateral spectrum S1 is formed by rays diffracted from

the grating at a certain angle ; and in the critical case the
 region of the image illuminated by the rays diverging from
 S, just includes B. The extreme ray SlB evidently proceeds
from A, which is the image of B.                The condition for the
 co—operation at B of the <U+FB01>rst lateral spectrum is thus that
 the angle of diffraction do not exceed the semi-angular
aperture a. By elementary theory we know that the sine of
 the angle of diffraction is X/e, so that the action of the lateral
 spectrum requires that e exceed )t/ sin a. If we allow the
 Incidence upon the grating to be oblique, the limit becomes
 éh/ sin a, as in (1).
    We have seen that if one spectrum only illuminate B, the
<U+FB01>eld shows no structure. If two spectra illuminate it with
 equal intensities, the <U+FB01>eld is occupied by ordinary interference
 bands, exactly as in the well known experiments of Fresnel.
 And it is important to remark that the character of these
bands is always the same, both as respects the graduation of
 light and shade, and in the fact that they have no focus.
 When more than two spectra co-operate, the resulting inter
 ference phenomena are more complicated, and there is
 opportunity for a completer representation of the special
features of the original grating *.
   it These effects were strikin 1y illustrated in some observations upon
gratings with 6000 lines to t e inch, set up vertically in a dark room
and illuminated by sunlight from a distant vertical slit. The object-glass
of the microscrope was a quarter inch.        When the original grating,
divided upon glass (by Nobert), was examined in this way, the lines
were well seen if the instrument was in focus, but, as usual, a compara
tively slight disturbance of focus caused all structure to disappear.

     While it is certain that the image ultimately formed may
'be considered to be due to the spectra focussed at S0, S1 . . .,
 the degree of conformity of the image to the original object
 is another question. From some of the expositions that have
 been given it might be inferred that if all the spectra emitted
 from the grating were utilized, the image would be a complete
 representation of the original. By considering the case of a
very <U+FB01>ne grating, which might afford no lateral spectra at all,
it is easy to see that this conclusion is incorrect, but the
 matter stands in need of further elucidation. Again, it is not
 quite clear at what point the utilization of a spectrum really
 begins. All the spectra which the grating is competent to
 furnish are focussed in the plane S0 3,; and some of them
 might be supposed to operate partially even although the part
 of the image under examination is outside the geometrical
 cone de<U+FB01>ned by the aperture of the object-glass. For these
 and other reasons it will be seen that the spectrum theory *,
valuable as it is, needs a good deal of supplementing, even
 when the representation of a grating under parallel light
is in question.
     When the object under examination is not a grating or a
 structure in which the pattern is repeated an inde<U+FB01>nite number
 of times, but for example a double point, or when the incident
 light is not parallel, the spectrum theory, as hitherto developed,
 is inapplicable. As an extreme example of the latter case we
 may imagine the grating to be self-luminous. It is obvious
 that the problem thus presented must be within the scope of
 any complete theory, and equally so that here there are no
 spectra formed, as these require the radiations from the different
with bitumen, was substituted for it, very different effects ensued.  The
structure could be seen even although the object-glass were drawn back
through 15‘, inch from its focussed position; and the visible lines were
twice as close, as if at the rate of 12,000 to the inch.    The difference
between the two cases is easily explained upon Abbe’s theory.      A soda
flame viewed through the original showed a strong central image
(spectrum of zero order) and comparatively faint spectra. of the first and
higher orders. A similar examination of the copy revealed very brilliant
spectra of the <U+FB01>rst order on both sides, and a relatively feeble central
image. The case is thus approximately the same as when in Abbe’s
experiment all s ectra except the <U+FB01>rst (on the two sides) are blocked out.
   1' The specia theory initiated by Prof. Abbe is usually called the
“diffraction theory,” a nomenclature against which it is necessary to
protest. Whatever may be the view taken, any theory of resolving
power of optical instruments must be a. diffraction theory in a certain
sense, so that the name is not distinctive. Diffraction is more naturally
regarded as the obstacle to <U+FB01>ne de<U+FB01>nition, and not, as with some expo
nents of Prof. Abbe’s theory, the machinery by which good de<U+FB01>nition is
brought about.

 172     Lord Rayleigh on the Theory of Optical Images,
 elements of the grating to possess permanent phase-relations.
 It appears, therefore, to be a desideratum that the matter
 should be reconsidered from the older point of view, according
 to which the typical object is a point and not a grating. Such
 a treatment illustrates the important principle that the theory
 of resolving-power is essentially the same for all instruments.
 The peculiarities of the microscope arise from the fact that
 the divergence-angles are not limited to be small, and from
 the different character of the illumination usually employed;
 but, theoretically considered, these are differences of detail.
 The investigation can, without much dif<U+FB01>culty, be extended
 to gratings, and the results so obtained con<U+FB01>rm for the most
 part the conclusions of the spectrum theory.
    It will be convenient to commence our discussion by a
 simple inw stigation of the resolving-power of an optical
 instrument for a self-luminous double point, such as will be
 applicable equally to the telescope and to the microscope. In
 <U+FB01>g 2 AB represents the axis, A being a point of the object
 and B a point of the image.      By the operation of the object
 glass LL’ all the rays issuing from A arrive in the same phase
 at B. Thus if A be self-luminous, the illumination is a
 maximum at B, where all the secondary waves agree in phase.

                         L
B is in fact the centre of the diffraction disk which constitutes
the image of A.       At neighbouring points the illumination is
less, in consequence of the discrepancies of phase which there
enter. In like manner, if we take a neighbouring point P in
the plane of the object, the waves which issue from it will
arrive at B with phases no longer absolutely accordant, and
the discrepancy of phase will increase as the interval AP
increases.    When the interval is very small, the discrepancy
of phase, though mathematically existent, produces no prac
tical effect, and the illumination at B due to P is as important
as that due to A, the intensities of the two luminous .centres
being supposed equal. Under these conditions it is clear
that A and P are not separated in the image. The question
is, to what amount must the distance AP be increased in
order that the difference of situation may make itself felt in
the image.      This is necessarily a question of degree; but it
does not require detailed calculations in order to show that

             with Special Reference to the Microscope.    I   173
 the discrepancy <U+FB01>rst becomes conspicuous when the phases
 corresponding to the various secondary waves which travel
 from P to B range over about a complete period. The illumi—
 nation at B due to P then becomes comparatively small, in_
 deed for some forms of aperture evanescent. The extreme
 discrepancy is that between the waves which travel through
 the outermost parts of the object-glass at L and L’ ; so that,
 if we adopt the above standard of resolution, the question is,
where must P be situated in order that the relative retarda
tion of the rays PL and PL' may on their arrival at B amount
 to a wave-length (A).     In virtue of the general law that the
reduced optical path is stationary in value, this retardation
may be calculated without allowance for the different paths
pursued on the further side of L, L', so that its value is
simply PL—PL'. Now since AP is very small, AL’—PL’
is equal to AP . sin a, where a is the semi-angular aperture
L’AB.     In like manner PL—AL has the same value, so
that
                     PL—PL'=2AP . sin a.
According to the standard adopted, the condition of resolution
is therefore that AP, or e, should exceed §7t/sin a, as in (1).
If e be less than this, the images overlap too much; while if e
greatly exceed the above value the images become unneces
sarily separated.
    In the above argument the whole space between the object
and the lens is supposed to be occupied by matter of one
refractive index, and 7t represents the wave-length in this
medium of the kind of light employed. If the restriction as
to uniformity be violated, what we ave ultimately to do with
is the wave-length in the medium immediately surrounding
the object.
    The statement of the law of resolving-power has been made
in a form appropriate to the microscope, but it admits also of
immediate application to the telescope. If 2R be the diameter
of the object-glass, and D the distance of the object, the angle
subtended by AP is 6/1), and the angular resolving-power is
given by

    This method of derivation makes it obvious that there is no

forms. In the case of the telescope we have to do with 8.

linear measure of aperture and an angular limit of resolution,
whereas in the case of the microscope the limit of resolution is
linear and it is expressed in terms of angular aperture.
   In the above discussion it has been supposed for the sake of
simplicity that the points to be discriminated are self-lumi
nous, or at least behave as if they were such. It is of interest
to inquire how far this condition can be satis<U+FB01>ed when the
object is seen by borrowed light. We may imagine that the
object takes the form of an opaque screen, perforated at two
points, and illuminated by distant sources situated behind.
   If the source of light be reduced to a point, so that a single
train of plane waves falls upon the screen, there is a perma
nent phase-relation between the waves incident at the two
points, and therefore also between the waves scattered from
them. In this case the two points are as far as possible from
behaving as if they were self-luminous. If the incidence be
perpendicular, the secondary waves issue in the same phase ;
but in the case of, obliquity there is a permanent phase
di<U+FB02>'erence. This difference, measured in wave-lengths, in
creases up to e, the distance between the points, the limit
being attained as the incidence becomes grazing.
 ” When the light originates in distant independent sources,
not limited to a point, there is no longer an absolutely de<U+FB01>nite
phase-relationship between the secondary radiations from the
two apertures ; but this condition of things may be practically
maintained, if the angular magnitude of the source be not too
large. For example, if the source be limited to an angle 0
round the normal to the screen, the maximum phase-difference
measured in wave-lengths is esin 0, so that if sin 0 be a small
fraction of 7t/e, the <U+FB01>niteness of 0 has but little effect. \Vhen,
however, sin 9 is so great that s sin 0 becomes a considerable
multiple of 7t, the secondary radiations become approximately
independent, and the apertures behave like self-luminous
points. It is evident that even with a complete hemi
spherical illumination this condition can scarcely be attained
when e is less than 7t.
   The use of a condenser allows the widely-extended source
to be dispensed with.      By this means an image of a distant
source composed of independently radiating parts, such as a
lamp-<U+FB02>ame, may be thrown upon the object, and it might at
<U+FB01>rst sight be supposed that the problem under consideration
was thus completely solved in all cases, inasmuch as the two
apertures correspond to different parts of the <U+FB02>ame. But we
have to remember here and everywhere that optical images
are not perfect, and that to a point of the flame corresponds

            with Special Reference to the Microscope.         '   175
in the image, not a point, but a disk of <U+FB01>nite magnitude.
WVhen this consideration is taken into account, the same
limitation as before is encountered.
 _ For what is the smallest disk into which the condenser is
capable of concentrating the light received from a distant
point? Fig. 2 and the former argument apply almost
without modi<U+FB01>cation, and they show that the radius AP of
the disk has the value éA/sin a, where a is the semi-angular
aperture of the condenser. Accordingly the diameter of the
disk cannot be reduced below}; and if e be less than A. the
radiations from the two apertures are only partially inde-'
pendent of one another.                                   .
    It seems fair to conclude that the function of the condenser
in microscopic practice is to cause the object to behave, at any
rate in some degree, as if it were self-luminous, and thus to
obviate the sharply-marked interference-bands which arise
when permanent and de<U+FB01>nite phase-relations are permitted to
exist betWeen the radiations which issue from various points
of the object.                                        ‘ '

may arise. The origin of coordinates (E =0, 17:0) in the

 very incomplete representation of the object ; but it' the forma
 tion of a black line in the centre of the pattern be supposed
 to constitute resolution, then resolution occurs at all degrees
 of closeness‘. We shall see later, from calculations conducted
 by the same method, that a grating of an equal degree of
 closeness would show no structure at all but would present a
 uniformly illuminated <U+FB01>eld.
    * These results are easily illustrated ex erimentally. I have used
 two parallel slits, formed in <U+FB01>lms of tin-foi or of chemically deposited
 silver, of which one is conveniently made longer than the other. These
 slits are held vertically and are viewed through a small telescope, pro
 vided with a high-power eye-piece, whose horizontal aperture is re
stricted to a small width. The distance may <U+FB01>rst be so chosen that
when backed by a neighbouring <U+FB02>ame the double part of the slit just
manifests its character by a faint shadow along the centre. If the <U+FB02>ame
is replaced by sunlight s ining through a distant vertical slit, the e<U+FB01>ect
 depends upon the recise adjustment. When everything is in line the
 image is at its brig test, but there is now no sign of resolution of the
 double part of the slit. A ver slight sideways displacement, in my
 case e<U+FB02>'ected most conveniently y moving the telesco e, brings in the
half-period retardation, showing itself by a black bar dbwn the centre.
An increased displacement, leading to a relative retardation of three
halves of a period, gives much the same result, complicated, however, by
chromatic etlects.
    In conformity with theor the black bar down the image of the double
slit may still be observed w en the distance is increased much beyond
that at which duplicity disappears under <U+FB02>ame illumination.
    For these experiments I chose the telescope, not only on account of
the greater facility of manipulation which it allows, but also in order to
make it clear that the theory is general, and that such effects are not
limited, as is sometimes supposed, to the case of the microscope.

     But before proceeding to such calculations we may deduce
  by Lagrange’s theorem the interval e in the original object
  corresponding to that between u=0 and u=1r in the image,
  and thence effect a comparison with a grating by means of
  Abbe’s theory. The linear dimension (6) of the image cor
  responding to u=vr is given by f =7xf/a ; and from
  Lagrange’s theorem                     I

  Thus, corresponding to u=7r,

     The case of a double point or line represented in <U+FB01>g. 4
  lies therefore at the extreme limit of resolution for a grating
  in which the period is the interval between the double points.
  And if the incidence of the light upon the grating were
  limited to be perpendicular, the period would have to be
  doubled before the grating could show any structure.
     When the aperture is circular, of radius R, the diffraction
  pattern is symmetrical about the geometrical image (19:0,

geometrical images. The only difference in the calculations
is that represented by the substitution of 2.11 for sine. We
shall not, however, occupy space by tables and drawings such
as have been given for a. rectangular aperture. It may
suf<U+FB01>ce to consider the three principal points in the image due
to a double source whose geometrical images are situated at
n =0 and u: —vr, these being the points just mentioned and
that midway between them at u=—%7r. The values of the
functions required are
               2J,(0)/O =1-0000 = ./{1-0000}.
               2J1(7r)/1r = '1812: crosses}.
               2J1(12~7r)/12~1r= ~7217 = ~4-5209}.
    In the case (corresponding to i. <U+FB01>g. 4) where there is simi
larity of phase, we have at the geometrical images amplitudes
1'18l2 as against 1'4434 at the point midway between.
“7hen there is opposition of phase the <U+FB01>rst becomes i'8188,
and the last zero *. When the phases differ by a quarter
period, or when the sources are self-luminous (iii. <U+FB01>g. 4), the
amplitudes at the geometrical images are J{1'0328} or
1'0163, and at the middle point v’{1'0418} or 10207. The
partial separation, indicated by the central depression in
curve iii. <U+FB01>g. 4, is thus lost when the rectangular aperture is
exchanged for a circular one of equal width. It should be
borne in mind that these results do not apply to a double line,
which in the case of a circular aperture behaves differently
from a double point.
    There is one respect in which the theory is de<U+FB01>cient, and
the de<U+FB01>ciency is the more important the larger the angular
aperture. The formula (7) from which we start assumes
that a radiant point radiates equally in all directions, or
at least that the radiation from it after leaving the object
  lass is equally dense over the whole area of the section.
  11 the case of telescopes, and microscopes of moderate
angular aperture, this assumption can lead to no appreciable
error; but it may be otherwise when the angular aperture
is very large.         The radiation from an ideal centre of
transverse vibrations is certainly not uniform in various
directions, and indeed vanishes in that of primary vibration.
If we suppose such an ideal source to be situated upon the
axis of a wide-angled object-glass, we might expect the dif
fraction pattern to be less closely limited in that axial plane

which includes the direction of primary vibration than in that
which is perpendicular to it. The result for a double point
illuminated by borrowed light would be a better degree of
separation when the primary vibrations are perpendicular to
to the line of junction than when they are 'parallel to it.
   Although it is true that complications and uncertainties
under this head are not without in<U+FB02>uence upon the theory of
the microscopic limit, it is not to be supposed that any cons
siderable variation from that laid down by Abbe and Helm
holtz is admissible. Indeed, in the case of a grating the
theory of Abbe is still adequate, so far as the limit of
resolution is concerned; for, as Dr. Stoney has remarked,
the irregularity of radiation in different directions tells only
upon the_relative brightness and not upon the angular
position of the spectra. And it will remain true that there
can be no resolution without the cooperation of two spectra
at least. ~                        "
   In Table II. and <U+FB01>g. 4 we have considered the image of a
double point or line as formed by a lens of rectangular
aperture. It is now proposed to extend the calculation to
the case where the series of points or lines is in<U+FB01>nite, con
stituting a row of points or a grating. The intervals arev
supposed to be strictly equal, and also the luminous intensities.
~When the aperture is rectangular, the calculation is the same
whether we are dealing with a row of points or with a grating,
but we have to distinguish according as the various centres
radiate independently, viz., as if they were self-luminous, or
are connected by phase-relations. We will commence with
the former case.
   If the geometrical images of the various luminous points
are situated at u=O, u= iv, u= i211, &c., the expressions
for the intensity at any point u of the <U+FB01>eld may be written as
an in<U+FB01>nite series,                                                -

by plane waves of light. If the incidence be oblique, the
phase of the radiation emitted varies by equal steps as we
pass from one element to the next.          But for the sake of
simplicity we will commence with the case of perpendicular

    If the series (30) were continued ad in<U+FB01>nitum, it would
represent a discontinuous distribution, limited to the points
 (or lines) u=0, u=—_|_-v, u=i2v, &c., so that the image
formed would accurately correspond to the original object.
This condition of things is most nearly realised when v is
very great, for then (30) includes a large number of terms.
As 1: diminishes the higher terms drop out in succession,
retaining however (in contrast with (27)) their full value
up to the moment of disappearance. When u is less than 2n,
the series is reduced to its constant term, so that the <U+FB01>eld
becomes uniform. Under this kind of illumination, the
resolving-power is only half as great as when the object is
self-luminous.
 ‘ These conclusions are in entire accordance with Abbe’s
theory. The <U+FB01>rst term of (30) represents the central image,
the second term the two spectra of the <U+FB01>rst order, the third

 that the various terms representing the several spectra enter

 difference to be noted. In the case of the rectangular aper
 ture the spectra enter suddenly and with their full effect,
 whereas in the present case there is no such discontinuity,
 the e<U+FB01>'ect of a spectrum which has just entered being in<U+FB01>

parts of which radiate in the same phase, is independent of the
form of the aperture of the object—glass, being, for example,
the same for a circular aperture as for a rectangular aperture
of equal width. This case differs from that of a self-luminous

    Considering the latter case, and taking <U+FB01>rst the inte

Hence they must contain a self-conjugate subgroup of this
order when p >3 and 10957. We shall <U+FB01>rst consider all the
possible groups that contain such a self-conjugate subgroup.
   1' M. Levavasseur gives an enumeration of these groups, without ex
  laining how they were obtained, in Comptes Rendus, March 2, 1896.
   is enumeration is not uite correct. He states that there are three

196           Dr. G. A. Miller on the Operation Groups
The few groups which do not contain such a subgroup will
be considered afterwards.
     The eight systems of intransitivity* of the given self
conjugate subgroup are systems of nonprimitivity of the
required groups. Hence each one of these groups must have
a p, l isomorphism to some group of order 8.                    As all of
the latter contain subgroups of order 4, all of the former must
contain subgroups of order 4]).
     Since the average number of elements in all the substitu
tions of a group is n—a‘l', n being the degree and a the num
ber of systems of intransitivity of the group, every subgroup
of a regular group must be intransitive ; and an intransitive
subgroup of half the order of a transitive group must contain
two and only two systems of intransitivity, which are also
systems of nonprimitivity of the transitive group.
    Each one of the groups under consideration must therefore
contain a subgroup of order 4p, which may be formed by
making some regular group of this order simply isomorphic
to itselfi. Since the groups of order 4}) are known§, our
problem is reduced to the construction of the nonprimitive
groups containing as heads one of the <U+FB01>ve regular groups of
order 4}; in l, 1 correspondence to itself.
     In what follows we shall consider p>2, as the groups of
order 16 are well known               We shall <U+FB01>rst construct all the
groups which contain as heads one of the two commutative
groups of order 410 in l, 1 correspondence to itself. The
cycl<U+FB01>'cal head will be denoted by H cyc., and the non-cyclical
by      .
                      Groups containing H cyc.
   Since there are 2( p—l) positive integers which are less than
4}) and prime to 4p, H cyc. contains 2(p—l) substitutions of
order 4}). The largest group which transforms H cyc. into
itself without interchanging its systems transforms these
substitutions according to a regular commutative group (L)

of order 2(p—1), containing 3 and only 3 substitutions of
order 2. These correspond to the substitutions which trans
form those of order 4p in H cyc. into their
                    2p—1,         2p+1,        410—1
powers. We have therefore to examine four types of tails
that may be added to H cyc., viz. those which are commuta
tive to the substitutions of H cyc., and those which transform
these substitutions into one of the three given powers.
    Since half of the substitutions of H cyc. are the squares of
its substitutions there can be only two commutative groups ;
viz. the cyclical group (G1), and the group (G2) obtained by
adding to H eye. a substitution (t) which simply interchanges
its systems. The squares of the substitutions in the tail of
G2 are also the squares of the substitutions of H cyc.
    We represent the three substitutions* of the second order
which are commutative to t and transform the substitutions
of H cyc. into the three given powers by $1, 82, s,» . slt, s2t, sst
may be used to construct three distinct tails. The <U+FB01>rst of
these contains 2p substitutions of order 2 and 2}) of order 4,
the second contains 4 of order 2 and 4(p—1) of order 2p, the
third contains only substitutions of order 2. We represent
the groups containing these tails respectively by G3, G4, G5.
    Since .9, is commutative only with the subgroup of order 4
in H cyc., and half of the substitutions of this subgroup are
squares of its substitutions, there is only one more tail of this
type. This contains only substitutions of order 8. Similarly
 we see that there is only one additional tail of each of the
 other two types; and that the former of these contains 4
 substitutions of order 4 and 4(p—l) of order 4}), while the
 latter contains only substitutions of order 4. We represent
the three groups containing these tails respectively by
 G69 G77 G8
    Hence, when p> 2, there are always 8 groups and only 8
that contain a cyclical subgroup of order 4]). In what follows
 we need not consider the groups in which such a subgroup
 occurs. When p=2, 210—1 and 2p+ l are not congruent to
 1 and 3 respectively with respect to mod 4, as is the case
   4* That such substitutions can always be found follows from the fact
that we may transform a generating substitution of a transitive cyclical
group into any other generating substitution by a substitution whose
degree is at least one less than the degree of the group. Since the <U+FB01>rst
power of this substitution which is commutative to the group must be
contained in the group, its order must be equal to the exponent to which
the power into which it transforms the substitutions belongs with respect
to mod a, a being the order of the given cycle.

  for the other values of p. I Hence some of our remarks do not
  apply to this case.       In fact there are only 6 groups of order
  16 which contain a cyclical subgroup of order 8.
                            Groups containing H.
     By adding t to this head we obtain the third and last
 commutative group (G9) of order 8p. There are, therefore,
 three and only three commutative groups of this order for
 every value of p> 2. When p=2 there are <U+FB01>ve such groups.
 The tail of G, contains 4 substitutions of order 2 and 4(p—l)
 of order 2p. The squares of these substitutions are clearly
 the same as the squares of those of H. It remains to <U+FB01>nd
 the non-commutative groups that contain H.
    The isomorphic group of order 8 contains at least three
 substitutions of the second order. If this group is commuta
 tive the corresponding tail must transform the substitutions of
 H into their —1 powers, as 2}) has primitive roots*. \Ve can
 easily <U+FB01>nd a substitution (s’) of the second order which trans
 forms one of the 4 cycles of a substitution of order 2p in H
 into its —1 power. By making 8’ symmetrical in the ele
 ments of the other cycles of the same substitution we obtain
 a substitution (.9) which evidently transforms H into itself.
    The tail of the group (G10) generated h st and H contains
 only substitutions of the second order. gince s is commuta
 tive to the substitutions of the second order in H, we may
 construct a group (G11) whose tail contains only substitutions
 of the fourth order by using, in place of s, the product of a
 substitution of the second order in one of the systems of H
 into s. The other two groups which may be constructed in
 the same way as G11 are conjugate to it with respect to (s,),
 the pth power of two cycles commutative to t, these cycles
 being contained in some substitution of H whose order is 2;).
 It remains to examine the case when the isomorphic group of
 order 8 is not commutative.
    Since this group of order 8 contains at least 3 substitutions
 of the second order and is non-commutative, it is fully deter
 mined. The corresponding tail must interchange two of the
 divisions of the head and transform the substitutions of the
 other two divisions into their —1 powers. The group (G12)
 generated by H and ss2t clearly satis<U+FB01>es these conditions. Its
'tail contains 2p substitutions of order 2 and 2p of order 4.
The other possible group is conjugate to G1, with respect
to a substitution of the second order in one of the systems
of H.

    We have now found 12 groups of order 8;; which exist for
 every value of p> 2. As the remaining groups cannot con
tain a commutative group of order 4}), they must transform the
substitutions of the self-conjugate subgroup of order p accord
 ing to a cyclic group of order 4 or 8. Such groups can exist
only when p— 1 is a multiple of 4 or 8.       We shall examine
these two cases separately.
      Groups which exist only when 12—1 is a multiple of 4.
    We shall <U+FB01>rst consider the case when 39—1 is not also a
multiple of 8. The substitutions which are commutative to
those of the self-conjugate subgroup of order p form a com
mutative group of order 2p. This cyclical group is therefore
also a self-conjugate subgroup of the required groups, and its
four systems of intransitivity are four systems of nonprimi
tivity of the required groups. Hence we may regard it as
the head (H1) of the required groups.
    The tail to these groups contains 4p substitutions which
transform the substitutions of the head into a power a which
 belongs to the exponent 4, mod 2p. We can easily <U+FB01>nd a
substitution 5 which transforms the substitutions of the head
into their a power, and is of order 4 and commutative to t,
t representing a substitution of the 4th order which simply
interchanges the 4 systems of the head cyclically. H1 and
st generate a group (G13) whose tail contains 2}) substitutions
of the second order and 4}) of the fourth order.
    As s is commutative only with the subgroup of order 2
contained in H1 there can be only one more group of this
type. This (GM) may be obtained by using the product of a
substitution of the second order in one of the systems of Hl
into 8 in place of s.  The tail of G1, contains 2p substitutions
of order 4, and 4p of order 8.    It remains to consider the case
when 12—1 is a multiple of 8.
    The preceding 14 groups are all present in this case. If
there is an additional group it must transform the substitu
tions of the self-conjugate subgroup of order 1) according to a
cyclical group of order 8. We can easily <U+FB01>nd a substitution
 (8,) which is symmetrical in the systems of the given self
conjugate subgroup and transforms its substitutions into their
)9 powers, )3 belonging to the exponent 8, mod p.
    H, and sit (t being a substitution of order 8 which merely
interchanges the given systems cyclically) generate a group
 (G15) whose tail contains p substitutions of order 2, 2}) of
order 4, and 4p of order 8. As the tail of Gr,5 is not commu
tative to any substitution in the subgroup of order p, with

 200 Operation Groups of order 8p, p being any prime number.
 the exce tion of identity, there can be only one group of this
 type. lgence there are always 12 groups of order 8p (p>2)
 which contain a self-conjugate subgroup of order p ; when p—l
 is a multiple of 4 or 8 there are respectively 14 or 15 such
groups. It remains to consider the
      Groups of order 8p which do not contain a self-conjugate
                          subgroup of order p.
     ‘When 10: 7, the equation
 is satis<U+FB01>ed by k=b=l as well as by k=0, b=8. If the sub
 group of order p is not self-conjugate there must be 8 such
 subgroups.        These contain 8 x 6 = 48 substitutions besides
 identity. The subgroup of order 8 must therefore be self
 conjugate, and its 7 systems of intransitivity must be systems
 of nonprimitivity of the required groups.
     Since the substitutions of the group (H2) of order 8 cannot
 be commutative to the entire group, they must be trans
 formed according to a group of order 7. Hence all these
 substitutions are of the second order, and H2 is fully deter
 mined. If we add to H, a substitution (t) of order 7 which
 simply permutes its 7 systems cyclically, we obtain a group
 (G16) whose tail contains only substitutions of order 7. As
 no substitution of H2, besides identity, is commutative to t,
there can be no other group of this type.
     Hence there are 13 groups of order 56 ; 12 of these con
tain a self-conjugate subgroup of order 7. The remaining
one contains 8 conjugate subgroups of order 7 and a self
conjugate subgroup of order 8. The last group occurs for
the <U+FB01>rst time as a group of degree 8*.
    The only other value of p >2 for which there can be groups
which do not contain a self-conjugate subgroup of order p
is 3. In this case it is known that there are three such
groups 1'. Hence all the groups of order 8p are completely
determined.

     XVII. On the Theory qfMoving Electrons and Electric
                     Charges. By J. LARMOR*.
1N an interesting paper by Mr. W. B. Morton, communi
        cated by the Physical Society to the Philosophical
Magazine for June, there is a criticism of a portion of
my paper on “A Dynamical Theory of the Electric and
Luminiferous Medium ” T, which if valid would affect its whole
tenor. As, however, the formulae of that paper were to a
considerable extent obtained by two independent trains of
reasoning, it would have to be shown that both were wrong
before an error could be fully substantiated. As a matter of
fact, Mr. Morton’s criticism arises from his reading into the
analysis assumptions which are not there, but which had been
used, with the proper limitations to secure accuracy, in
another place in the previous part of the paper. As the point
is really fundamental, and as the analytical statement in the
memoir is no doubt too brief to convey at once a grasp of the
procedure employed, without somewhat detailed consideration
on the reader’s part, I beg leave to offer the following general
explanation.
    The facts of chemical physics point to electri<U+FB01>cation being
distributed in an atomic manner, so that an atom of electricity,
say an electron, has the same claims to separate and permanent
existence as an atom of matter. The fundamental question
then is, how far the conception of separate isolated electrons,
pervading the aether of free space, can provide an explanation
of electrodynamic and optical phenomena. In the paper re
ferred to l have gone further back, and have considered the
question how far such a simple underlying scheme is able by
itself to provide an explanation of physical phenomena in
general; for it will obviously not be permissible to import
into our dynamical notion of an atom of matter more than
simple electric properties, unless these latter prove to be in
suf<U+FB01>cient to include all actual knowledge of its relations.
The conclusion arrived at in the memoir is that there is
nothing in the ascertained laws of general physics which
points to insuf<U+FB01>ciency in that scheme ; while there are some
experimental results which somewhat militate a ainst the
existence of interatomic forces of any kind othert an those
included in it.
   The main feature of the theory referred to is that the aether

  202              Mr. J. Larmor on the Theory of
  is not matter, as ordinarily assumed, nor in any way like
  matter ; it is the uniform substratum (analytical basis, if one
  is disposed to use that term, for it can never be the direct
  object of perception) in which the atoms of matter consist as
  permanent con<U+FB01>gurations of strain and motion. As was to be
  expected, the relations of inertia and elasticity of this uniform
  medium are simpler than those of matter, which is merely a
  molecular aggregate involved in its constitution. In fact,
  the only way to arrive at a scheme of the relations between
  aether and matter which shall be a complete dynamical
  theory and not merely descriptive, is to abolish the apparent
  duality in the phenomena, either by taking as here the mole
  cules of matter to constitute singularities (in the mathe
  matical sense of the theory of functions) in the uniform
  aether, or else by trying to make out the aether to be ordinary
  matter, and so giving up any attempt to explain why matter
  is molecularly constituted. This molecular constitution of
  matter is essential to the former theory, just as it is to all'
  other theories or illustrations, like the vortex theories, which
  hypothecate a uniform underlying medium ; it is quite
  unintelligible—or rather quite unexplained—on the latter
 type of theory.                                                   -
     But however these things may be, the point criticised by
  Mr. Morton does not involve any considerations so refined,
 or—as possibly may be said—so ambiguous. The sections to
 which he objects claim to be a reconstruction of ordinary
 electrodynamic theory on the basis of permanent electrons
 associated with the atoms of matter. Whatever view one
 may entertain as to the presence of qualities other than electric
 in the atom, all are I think now-a-days agreed that the electron
 is there. And whatever view one may have as to the validity
 and suf<U+FB01>ciency of an aether with simple rotational elasticity,
the formal equations to which that theory leads for free space
 are just those equations of Maxwell w ich Hertz’s experi
 mental work has fully veri<U+FB01>ed. The problem of electrodynamics
 is then that of the free aether. whose properties are represented
 analytically by these acknowledged equations, disturbed by
 the action of the electrons of material atoms moving about in
it. The original Amperean electrodynamics, proceeding by
consideration of elements of current, has not proved valid or
suf<U+FB01>cient in matters involving electric radiation, or even
ordinary electrodynamic force. A most successful modi<U+FB01>cation
of it was that proposed by Weber, in which elements of current
were replaced, as the fundamental object of consideration, by
moving electric particles which acted on each other at a dis
tance according to a law- of force involving their velocities.

            Moving Electrons and Electric Charges.         ‘  203.
This theory was, however, shown long ago by Lord Kelvin
and Professor von Helmholtz to be untenable, on account of
its violating the principles of the modern theory of energy;
now, of course, direct action at a distance is altogether out of
court. The present question is whether a theory of electrons
which act on each other, not directly according to a law of
force, but mediately by propagation of the effect across the
intervening aether, suf<U+FB01>ces to avoid the discrepancies of earlier
theories and give a consistent account of electrical and optical
phenomena ; and it is maintained that the answer is altogether
in the af<U+FB01>rmative. This question is, presumably, suf<U+FB01>ciently
important and fundamental to ustify the present detailed
explanation.
   At the end of the <U+FB01>rst of the two papers referred to,
building chiefly on the analytical results of previous theorists,
the steady aethereal disturbance carried along by a moving
electron had been investigated, and also the law of the force
exerted on each other by two moving electrons through the
intervention of the aather between them. This was on the
hypothesis that each electron carried along with it a steady
trail of aethereal disturbance, but that no sensible derange
ment of this steady motion ever occurred such as would lead
to loss of the energy of the system by the starting of waves.
If the velocities of the electrons remain always small compared
with that of radiation, then, however their mutual in<U+FB02>uences
alter their motions, this steady trail will instantaneously adjust
itself to the new conditions without sensible excitation of
radiation, and the theory will apply. But if any of the elec
trons are moving with velocities comparable with that of
radiation, a change in velocity will involve derangement of
this steady trail of aathereal strain and motion, giving rise to
wave-motion which will carry 03 some of the energy by
 radiation. Accordingly in such a case it is altogether nuga
 tory to speak of laws of action between electrons : the complete
theory must then take account not only of the positions and
velocities of each of the electrons at each instant, but also of
the state of each volume-element of the surrounding aether.
And the theory of mutual actions of electrons as expressed in
the memoir was in fact thus restricted to cases in which their
velocities were small compared with that of radiation : unless
that condition is satis<U+FB01>ed there isvno such theory at all.
    In the second paper (§ 15, seqq.) the general problem is
attacked: it is now not a question of a set of electrons by
themselves, each with a de<U+FB01>nite steady trail, but of the
aethereal medium in general, including such electrons as exist
in it.    The analysis there given determines from foundations

 which all who adopt Maxwell’s electrical scheme for free
 tether must allow, expressions for the force (1”, Q’, R’) which
 acts on an element of volume of the free tether, and for the
 force e (P, Q, B), ordinarily called electric force, which acts
 on an electron e ; and it uses these forces for further develop
 ment of the theory. What Mr. Morton’s computation
 virtually does is to assume that the trail of each electron is
 steady, and then to transfer to the electron itself the forcive
 due to (P’, Q’, R’) acting on this aethereal trail. In the
 special case of no radiation, and of velocities small compared
 with that of radiation, this forcive can, as above explained,
 be transmitted through the aether to the electron itself, and
 be supposed there applied. But to so transmit it in general
 is to miss the point of the theory, and, as Mr. Morton himself
 remarks, to reach the absurdity that the force on a moving
 charge depends not only on the state of the surrounding aether
but on the state of the aether at a distance.
    As regards the main subject of Mr. Morton’s paper, it may
be of interest to state the following general theorem. Suppose
a system of charged conductors is in steady translatory motion
 through the quiescent aather with velocity u, and let a repre
 sent the velocity of radiation in free mther : consider a cor
relative system cf conductors obtained by uniform geometrical
 elongation of the actual system along the direction of motion
in the ratio of (l—1t2/122')—i to unity, and <U+FB01>nd the electrostatic
distribution of the same charges on this system supposed at
rest : then the actual distribution of the charges on the
moving system will be exactly correlative, viz., equal charges
will exist on all corresponding elements of the two systems.
This proposition is, however, limited to the case in which
none of the bodies of the moving system are dielectrics, but
all are conductors.
    Finally, I take advantage of the present opportunity to
draw attention to some special points in which the analysis
of the second part of my memoir is incomplete. In §§ 28, 29,
on the mechanical pressure of radiation, a statical forcive has
been overlooked ; when this is included the result practically
agrees with that given by Maxwell. In §§ 54—6, on the
material forcives in polarized media, the tractions on inter
faces of transition remain to be developed, and the theory
may be otherwise improved.        I hope presently to treat this
subject at length.

 James Clerk Maxwell and Modern Physics. By R. T. Gmzaeaoox,
     F.R.S. (Century Science Series.) London: Cassell & Co., 1896.
 SOME fourteen years have now elapsed since Prof. Campbell and
       Mr. Garnett published their biography and letters of Maxwell ;
 the shock occasioned by his death had then scarcely passed away.
 At that time, although all regarded him as one of the founders of
 modern physics, few even among physicists realized the magnitude
 of his discoveries and research, and probably none imagined that
 his ideas concerning the aether would so soon receive the remark
 able development which they have derived from the life-work of
 Hertz. For, so far as regards the problem of the tether, Hertz
 has been the chief exponent of Maxwell, just as Maxwell had
 previously explained and extended the views of Faraday. But
 Maxwell contributed by his labours to manyother physicalquestions,
 everywhere not only adding to the stock of knowledge but
 furnishing suggestions for future work. Mr. Glazebrook gives, in
 a form suited to the general reader, a brief account of Maxwell’s
 work in three of these departments of knowledge—the properties
 of Cartesian ovals, the theory of compound colours, and the
 dynamical theory of gases. He reserves :1. longer chapter for the
 electrical theories, of which a very concise account is given, as
 clear as the mathematical nature of the subject will allow in a
 non-mathematical volume.
    It should not be forgotten, however, that Maxwell was not only
a great thinker and experimenter, but also an organizer. The
 present school of physics at Cambridge owes its existence and
 much of its ef<U+FB01>ciency to him, and has served as a model for the newer
provincial colleges. It is <U+FB01>tting that the story of Maxwell’s work
should he told by one so intimately acquainted with his Cambridge
life as Mr. Glazebrook, and more especially by one who has had
the good fortune to call him master and friend.               J. L. H.

Solution and Electrolysis. By W. C. DAMPIEB WHETHAM, MA.
   Cambridge, University Press, 1895.
IN choosing the title of this volume Mr. Whetham has very aptly
 indicated the connexion of his subject with both physics and
chemistry; for while solution is essentially a chemical process
electrolysis is quite as closely allied to purely physical phenomena.
Such borderland subjects, apart from the fact that they interest two
sections of scienti<U+FB01>c workers, derive additional importance as being
the meeting-point of two theories, which, although originally
framed to eXplain phenomena totally different in nature, must
now be made to harmonize. The process of adjustment is not
usually an easy one, and many are the discussions which it
provokes, even when the experimental data have been carefully
ascertained. The subject of solution is passing through this stage
at the present time, but the accumulation of experimental evidence
has received a great stimulus by the adoption of a provisional
theory. According to this theory the molecules of a dissolved
substance move through the sohent independently of the latter, in
a manner comparable with the motion of gas molecules through
the space containing them ; in the case of electrolytes it is further
assumed that the molecules are dissociated into their constituent
ions to a greater or less degree according to the concentration of the
solution. The reconciliation of this so-called physical theory with
other doctrines of chemistry and physics is, h0vrever, not yet
complete. The author proposes to accept the hydrate theory of
solution, according to which solvent and dissolved substance form
a large complex molecule, making the assumption that the chemical
forces acting Within the molecule do not interfere with the physical
independence of its constituents.
   Mr. Whetham has followed Ostwald in giving an account of the
general properties of solutions, but his materials for the portion of
the treatise dealing with electrolytes were much more scattered,
the only previous attempts to collect them having been made by
Wiedemann (1883), and by the Electrolysis Committee of the
British Association. The author has selected the more important
parts of these reports and presents them, together with other and
more recent matter, in a form suited to the needs of students.

    The new survey of the western end of the Hampshire Basin
 shows that the Reading Beds become <U+FB02>uviatile and gravelly in
 Dorset (as was already known), and contain, in addition to Chalk
 <U+FB02>ints, many fragments of Greensand chert. The London Clay thins
 greatly and becomes more sandy, but is apparently still marine. The
 Bagshot Sands become coarser and more <U+FB01>uviatile, changing rapidly
 west of Moreton Station, till they consist mainly of coarse snbangular
 gravel. These gravels, formerly referred to the Reading Series, are
 now shown to be continuous with the Bagshot Sands, which as they
 become coarser cut through the London Clay and Reading Beds to
 rest directly on the Chalk. The Bagshot gravcls contain, besides
 Chalk <U+FB01>ints and Greensand chert, fragments of Purbeck marble and
 numerous Palaeozoic grits and other stones probably derived from
 the Permian breccias of Devon.
    Thus there is evidence of disturbance and overlap in Cretaceous
 or early Eocene times, causing Reading Beds to rest on Upper
 Greensand. Later disturbances allowed the Bagshot river to out
 into Greensand, Wealden, Purbeck, Permian brcccia, Culm Mea
 sures, and granite. Folding of the strata seems to have taken
 place during at least four different periods in the district between
 Dorchester and Weymouth, which appears to have been a region of
 special weakness.
    The Eocene gravels contain all the foreign rocks known to occur
 in the Plateau-gravels between Brighton and Dorchester. - The
fragments of Greensand chert, so abundant in the Plateau-gravels,
have not been derived, as supposed, from the central axis of the

          A LECTURE EXPERIMENT ON DIATHERMANCITY.
                        BY DR. SILVIO LUSSANO.
   A very simple and elegant method of showing to a large audience
the transparency or opacity of bodies for calori<U+FB01>c radiations is the
following, which is based on the change of colour some substances
experience by variations of temperature.
   Double iodide of silver and mercury is prepared in a <U+FB01>ne powder.
At the ordinary temperature it has a beautiful canary-yellow colour,
changing to a purple—red at the temperature of about 49°, and
resuming its original colour when cold. This double iodide is
prepared by mixing in molecular proportions the two substances
HgI2 and 2Agl, then adding to the mixture alcohol which partly
dissolves the mercuric iodide ; the magma is then well stirred
together in a mortar, alcohol being added from time to time.      The
mixture, which at <U+FB01>rst is red, then changes to orange, and, after
some time, becomes of a canary-yellow colour; the alcohol is
allowed to evaporate, the magma being stirred all the time.
   The double iodide thus prepared is spread on cardboard, forming
a screen of a canary-yellow colour sensitive to calori<U+FB01>c radiations.
If, then, this is placed below a metal ball strongly heated, the
colour of the screen changes, showing the heating due to the
radiations. The same thing takes place if a plate of ebonite is
interposed between the ball and the screen; but if a plate of a
substance opaque to thermal radiations is placed on the ebonite,
the shadow of this plate is projected on the screen, showing a
yellow colour on a red ground. In this way it can be understood
that it is easy to obtain the projections of athermanous substances
enclosed between two ebonite plates—Communicated by the Author

 XXI. On the Use of Bare Wire for Resistance-coils. By.
    F. W. BURSTALL, M11, formerly Scholar of St. John’s
    College, (7ambrz'dge*.
                          I. Introduction.
 IT is perhaps somewhat surprising that the form of
       resistance-coils as used in the ordinary box has, during
 the last twenty years, changed less than any other kind of
 electrical instrument. The most serious defects of the pre- '
 sent form of resistance-box are, <U+FB01>rstly, the dif<U+FB01>culty of ascer
 taining the temperature of the Wire forming the resistance,
 and, secondly, that the method of short-circuiting any
 required number of coils by means of divided brass blocks
 and taper plugs leads to contact-resistances which are often
 of very variable amount.        A resistance-coil, the wire of
 which is covered with silk wound very closely and then
 covered with para<U+FB02>in, of necessity conducts heat very badly,
and therefore the temperature, as shown by a thermometer
placed in the box, gives but little information as to the
temperature of the resistance-wire.       I have endeavoured to
overcome the temperature di<U+FB01>iculty by using manganin
wire, but the uncertain nature of this material has forced me
to abandon its use. The suggestion for the employment of a
bare 'wire immersed in oil is due to Mr. E. H. Grif<U+FB01>ths, and
it is with the developments of this suggestion that the

210             Mr. F. W. Burstall on the Use qf
present paper deals.     There can be no doubt that with a
bare wire immersed in    oil the heating by the testing current
is much less than with   oo'vered wire, and further, the tempe
rature of the wire can   be accurately measured ; but perhaps
one of the most important advantages in the use of a bare
wire lies in the fact that the wire can be annealed in a most
perfect manner by the passage of a suf<U+FB01>ciently large current
to heat it to a red~heat for a few seconds. It has long been
known that well-annealed coils are much less liable to change
than coils which have not been so treated.      Dr. Lindeck, of
the Reichsanstalt, has, in his various papers, laid great stress
upon the necessity for annealing standard coils, which is
 effected by heating the coil in an air-bath to about 140°, the
highest temperature a silk-covered coil can bear without
 material injury. The heating of the wire to a red-heat is, of
 course, much more ef<U+FB01>cient than the method adopted by
 Dr. Lindeck for freein the wire from undue stress.
    The wire which I ave employed for the whole of the
 resistance-box was drawn from one cast of platinum-silver, a
 material which experience has shown to be the most perfect
 for resistance—measurement.
    The two forms of resistance-box usually employed are the
 series form and the dial form. In the former a number of
 coils are placed in series, and any required number can be
 short-circuited. This form, though it requires comparatively
 few coils, has the disadvantage that any <U+FB02>uctuation in one
 plug causes an error in the <U+FB01>nal measurement, and if any
 considerable number he used, it is almost impossible to pre
 vent variation in the sum of the contact-resistances. For
 these reasons it seemed advisable to adopt the second form of
 box, the dial pattern, in which the number of plugs employed
 is a minimum, and remains the same whatever resistance is
 being measured.
    It is not essential to make standard resistances in order to
 calibrate a resistance-box, as each dial can be measured in
 terms of the preceding dial. This method, however, perpe
 tuates any errors that may have been made in the measure
 ment of any of the smaller coils, and it is not possible to
 measure the coils in the box with the same accuracy that can
 be attained in the determination of the standard coils. I
 have therefore constructed standard coils for every dial,
 and their values have been obtained from a 1 ohm coil inde
 pendently of the resistance-box.

                  Bare Wire for Resistance-coils.               211
      II. Construction of the Resistance-bow and Standards.
   The resistance-box has <U+FB01>ve dials, each consisting of nine
coils, ranging from {6 of an ohm to 1000 ohms, and four
pairs of proportional arms ranging from 1 to 1000 ohms.
   The 110 ohm coils have a length of 96 millim., the wire
having a diameter of '63 millim.        Being so short, there is no
dif<U+FB01>culty in supporting the coils.
   The wire of the 1 ohm coils has the same diameter and a
length of 960 millim.       These coils were at first wound into
short spirals, and were allowed to hang freely from their
terminals. It soon, however, became apparent that the con
volutions of the spiral required to be <U+FB01>xed rigidly to the
ebonite top. The method that has been <U+FB01>nally adopted is to
screw the spiral into holes pierced in a mica plate; this
plate being screwed top and bottom to a brass bar which is
attached to the ebonite top.
   In the coils of from 10 to 1000 ohms it is not easy to <U+FB01>nd
a form of bobbin on which to wind the great lengths of bare
wire required in such a manner as to avoid short circuits, and
to bring the wire in contact as little as possible with the in
sulator. The form I have ultimately adopted is as follows
 (<U+FB01>g. 1) :—To a central brass red are attached, for the 10 ohm
and 100 ohm coils, two small brass crosses at a distance of
about 150 millim. apart; to the ends of the arms of these
crosses are screwed serrated strips of mica, the pitch of the
serrations being about 1 millim. The resistance-wire is then
bi<U+FB01>larly wound into these serrations. The 1000 ohm coils
are of the same form, but from their greater length, 250
millim., it is necessary to employ a third cross in order to
strengthen the mica, and even then dif<U+FB01>culty has been expe
rienced owing to the mica bending under the coil-tension,
culminating in several cases in the breakage of the wire.
    For the 10 ohm coils wire having a diameter of '30 millim.
 and a length of 2400 millim. has been used. For the 100
 ohm coils, a diameter of '15 millim. and a length of 6200
 millim. For the 1000 ohm coils, a diameter of '075 millim.
 and a length of 14500 millim.
    The top is of ebonite, 86 centimetres long, 28 centim. Wide,
and 19 millim. thick.
    Instead of using divided blocks for the dials, conical plugs,
having a maximum diameter of 9 millim., and a taper of 1 in
 12, <U+FB01>tting into conical sockets have been employed *. The
   * This method of constructing the lugs is due to Mr. R. W. Paul,

Fig. 1.
          On the Use of Bare l/Vz'refor Resistance-coils.   213
plugs are connected with the zero socket of the previous dial
by means of heavy <U+FB02>exible leads, having a copper core, 5
millim. in diameter, composed of copper wires of diameter
'2 of a millim. It was found necessary to use comparatively
large wire, as the <U+FB01>rst set of connecting leads, built up of
wire '07 millim. in diameter, parted with the constant
turning and gave rise to a variable plug-resistance.        The
use of the conical plug in a solid conical socket is completely
free from errors caused by the change of shape of the insu
lating material ; further, such forms can be easily and accu
rately machined, a matter of no small importance to those
who make their own apparatus.
   The terminals are of large diameter (25 millim.), and are
arranged with the screw in the move-able part, so that the
top of the <U+FB01>xed part can be readily cleaned.
   The proportional arms are <U+FB01>tted with the usual divided
blocks.
   The whole of the metallic part is made of phosphor-bronze,
a material which is harder and less liable to oxidation than
ordinary brass.
   The containing box is lined with copper for the reception
of the oil.
   The form of bobbin and the wire for the standard resistance
coils are the same in the land 10 ohm standards; but in
the 100 and- 1000 ohm standards the mica is stiffened by
being slipped into a brass back, like the back of an ordinary
 tenon saw, which quite prevents any tendency to bend. The
 temperature is measured by means of a thermometer placed
 in a pierced tube which lies inside the coil. The coils are
 inclosed in an outer brass case and <U+FB01>tted with the usual
 copper terminals for use with mercury-cup connexions.
   The 116 ohm standard is of manganin, of the usual British—
Association pattern.
   The oil employed is a pure heavy hydrocarbon oil, obtained
from Messrs. Price’s Patent Candle Company ; it is free
 from any trace of alkali or acid, and experiments conducted
 by Messrs. Price prove that it has no action on the wire.
        111. Construction of Bridge and Galvanometer.
   The bridge employed was of the usual equal-armed pattern,
having a straight wire of platino-iridium 1'5 millim. in dia
meter and 500 millim. long.       The wire is stretched imme
diately over the scale by means of two brass split chucks,
 these chucks terminatin in circular brass rods, having a
 diameter of 6 millim.    T 1e rods slide in heavy brass blocks,

214              Mr. F. W. Burstall on the Use of
and the wire can be tightened by nuts on the ends of the
rods. Thus the wire is not soldered to the terminals, and can
be removed for repair. The scale is divided into 1000 parts,
and the divisions are then divided into 10 by estimation ;'
this is easily done with the aid of a good magni<U+FB01>er. The
 slider moves on the scale itself, and is provided with a <U+FB01>ne
 adjustment. The connexion t0 the galvanometer is made b '
 a platinum-tipped spring, resting on a platinum wire whic
 is laid parallel to the main wire.     The equal coils are made
 of manganin, and have a resistance of about 10 ohms. They
 have several times been adjusted to exact equality, but have
 never preserved that equality for a long period. This in
 equality, however, is unimportant, since it is eliminated by
 double balancing, which has been done at least once during
  each set of determinations.    The actual amount of inequality
  at the present time is shown by the facts that, with 1 ohm in
  each of the outer arms, the bridge centre (i. e. the mean of
  the readings when the coils are interchanged) is 50025,
  whilst 'with 1 ohm in each arm it is 5004, and with 10 ohms
  in each arm it is 5005.
     The wire is mounted on a stout marble base. To protect
  the wire as much as possible from heat radiated from the
  observer’s body two blocks of wood have been hollowed in
  such a manner that they can he slid over the wire ; the slider
  itself being wrapped in cotton-wool. These precautions re
  duce the e<U+FB01>'ect ot' the thermo-currents to a few scale-divisions
  on the galvanometer. The effect of thermo-currents on the
  galvanometer was eliminated by the galvanometer-circuit being
  kept closed, the battery-circuit being made and broken as
  required. In order to connect the box-coils and the standards
   to the bridge, three pairs of heavy <U+FB02>exible copper leads have
   been constructed; one pair has mercury-cups, intended for
   the reception of the standard coils, at one extremity ; a
   second pair has conical plugs, so that any particular coil in
   the box can be measured alone ; the third pair and the other
   six extremities of the leads are provided with heavy copper
   spades, by means of which connexion can be made with the
   terminals of the box and the bridge. The three pairs of leads
   are adjusted to exact equality one with another, and each has
   a resistance of 009% ohms at a temperature of ll°'8. The
   values of these resistances do not enter into any determination
   as the leads were always in pairs, one in each arm of the
   bridge.
      The galvanometer is a four-coil astatic instrument, the
   resistance of each coil being 60 ohms. The magnet system
   is supported by a <U+FB01>ne quartz <U+FB01>bre 260 millim. long. In

                  Bare Wire for Resistance-coils.             215
order to diminish as far as possible the effects of the vibration
caused by London traf<U+FB01>c, thick rubber blocks are placed on
the pier supporting the galvanometer; this precaution has
made it possible to work at any time except when large
masses of iron are being moved in the neighbouring goods
station. The scale is placed 3 metres from the mirror. The
motion of the mirror is observed by means of' a small electric
lamp which projects the image of a <U+FB01>ne wire on to the mirror,
thence it is re<U+FB02>ected on to a ground-glass scale. The observer
is at a considerable distance from the galvanometer, a matter
of some convenience since the zero is thus not so liable to be
changed. The galvanometer gives a distinct movement for
an alteration of '00001 of an ohm, with 10 ohms in every
arm, the battery being one Hellesen cell, together with an
added resistance in series with it of 10 ohms. The galva
nometer is connected to the bridge by 20 gauge rubber
covered high insulation wires ; the rubber covering is neces
sary as I have found serious errors introduced unless the
insulation of the galvanometer connexion is extremely good.
                 IV. Determination of Standards.
    The temperature dif<U+FB01>culties which are most liable to cause
 inaccuracy in resistance measurements have been greatly
 simpli<U+FB01>ed by the remarkable uniformity of temperature of
the room in which the measurements have been made. The
room is almost entirely underground, and is protected on all
 sides by other portions of the building from the heat of the
 sun. It is lighted by one small electric lamp, which gives
 rise to no appreciable change of temperature. The presence
 of one experimenter causes the temperature of the air to rise
 about '2 of a degree during the <U+FB01>rst half hour, and then it
becomes constant ; but the temperature of the resistance-box
and standards, the latter being placed in earthenware vessels
and surrounded by sawdust, takes several hours to rise as
much as '03 of a degree.
    The bridge-wire was calibrated by a method due, I believe,
 to Mr. Grif<U+FB01>ths. In one of the outer arms is placed, by means
 of mercury-cups, a coil of low resistance, called the gauge
 coil; on the other hand, the gap can be short-circuited by
 means of a thick copper bar. In the opposite outer arms are
 placed three resistance-boxes in parallel. The object of this
 arrangement is to secure the necessary <U+FB01>ne adjustment.
 Commencing with the slider at one end of the wire, the
   auge-coil being in place, a balance is obtained by adjusting
 t e- resistance in the boxes, the slider remaining <U+FB01>xed; The

216             Mr. F. W. Burstall on the Use of
gauge-coil is then removed and the copper bar substituted ;
the slider is then moved until a new balance is obtained. Pro
ceeding thus, the whole wire is divided into a number of parts
the resistances of which are equal. From these observations
a chart can be prepared showing the deviation in resistance
of the wire from a wire of uniform resistance per unit of
length.    One of the great advantages of this method is that,
when an abnormal value has been obtained, it is a simple
matter to come back to that particular portion of the wire
for a check measurement. The gauge-coil was equal to the
resistance of 22293 mean scale-divisions (each 0'5 millim.),
and the greatest error at any point of the wire amounted to
'4 of a scale-division. Throughout the whole of the com
parison of the coils this calibration of the wire has been
employed, and several apparently discrepant observations have
been thus brought into line.
   The temperature-coef<U+FB01>cient of the bridge-wire has been
found by raising the temperature of the room from 10°‘4 to
18°“1, the bridge having in one arm a coil of known tem
perature-coef<U+FB01>cient, and was found to be '071 per cent. per
de ree.
     he thermometer employed, which is of hard Jena glass, is
divided into tenths of a degree, each tenth being approxi
mately '5 millim. in length. By means of a small reading
telescOpe it can with ease be read to '01 of a degree.   It was
tested at the Reichsanstalt and, over the range employed, was
accurate to at least '05 of a degree.
   The temperature-coef<U+FB01>cient of the platinum-silver wire,
over a range from 10° to 25°, was determined by immersing
a coil of about 1 ohm in paraf<U+FB01>n-oil at 25°, and allowing
it to cool very slowly.   It was found to be "000274 per ohm
per degree.
   The 1 ohm coil from which the standards have been built
up is of manganin, and when tested in June 1894 by Mr.
Glazebrook had a resistance of 1'00026 ohms at 13°"4. I
was, however, so doubtful of the constancy of this standard
that in December 1895 I constructed a bare platinum-silver
 1 ohm coil. This was compared with the manganin standard,
and the mean of eleven determinations gave its value as
                  1-00000 +_-000274 (t- 14-96).
   No doubt the manganin coil had changed its value in the
eighteen months that had elapsed since it was tested, so that
the above <U+FB01> ures were not true ohms.
   The 10 0 m standard was obtained by the use of three

                   Bare Wire for Resistance-coils.                 217'
approximate 3 ohm coils *, <U+FB01>rst placed in. parallel and'
balanced against a 1 ohm coil, and then in series with the
 1 ohm coil and balanced against the 10 ohm coil. Instead
of connecting the legs of the coils by mercury-cups, as is
usually done, the fusible metal made by Mr. F. Thomas, of
  )ambridge, was used.        This metal, which melts at 60°, gives
very constant contact- resistances, and does not seem to injure
in any waythesmalgamated terminals of the coils.                I <U+FB01>rst
determined the value of a manganin 10 ohm coil, which had
 been made for nearly a year. The value obtained on
 December 20, 1895, was 9'9987 at 9°‘3. This coil was used
 as a standard to which to adjust the platinum-silver 10 ohm
 coil. The value thus obtained for the latter was 9'9895 at
 10°'3. On stepping up to the platinum-silver 10 ohm coil,
 the value found on December 30 was 9'9905 at 10°"6.
 Taking into account the known temperature-coef<U+FB01>cient, the
 latter at 10°'3 would be 9'9897, which differs by only two
 parts in 100,000 from its former value.                    ,
     To obtain the value of the 116 ohm coil, which was of man
 ganin, a bridge was formd of'two 1 ohm coils, a 10 ohm
 coil,'and the T15 ohm coil, and a balance obtained by shunting
 one of the 1 ohm coils T.
     On January 12th, a value of '099934 at 11°‘2 was obtained.
       ,,    ,,    13th,       ,, ,, ~099932 ,, 10°-2 ,,        ,7
     The. temperature-coe<U+FB02>'icient of the wire was known'to be
 '000004 per degree.        Between these two determinations the
 bridge had been dismounted.            This coil was again tested on
 April 8th, and had then a value of '099944 at l2°'l, whereas,
 it' it had remained unaltered, its value at that temperature
 should have been "099938. This change is, however,._too
 small to cause any error in the box-coils.
     For testing coils which are very nearly in the proportion
 of 1 to any power of 10 this method is extremely sensitive,
 and certainly more accurate than making the comparison by
 means of the wire bridge, provided that the resistances of
three out of the four 'coils forming the bridge are accurately
known.
     In obtaining the values of the 1 ohm and 10 ohm standard
 coils, not more than 50 scale-divisions of the wire had been
 employed, hence a small error in the total resistance of the
 bridge-wire would not cause any inaccuracy in the values so
 obtained.      The resistance of the bridge-wire was determined

sli htly smaller resistance than the bridge-wire ; the 116 ohm
coi was then removed, and the gap short-circuited The

    The 100 and 1000 ohm standard coils were determined on
 similar bridges.    The 100 ohm coil,—

    Whereas it should have been 99'960, according to the
 observation on the earlier date.        This discrepancy is, I
 believe, due to the fact that the shunt required on one of the
 10 ohm coils forming the bridge was greater than 12,000
  ohms, which was the largest resistance at my disposal: in
  order to obtain a balance one of the 10 ohm coils had to be

   The 1000 ohm standard coil was obtained by forming a
bridge with the 1, 10, 100, and 1000 ohm coils, and had a
value, on April 28, of 1000'24 ohms at 1208. No other
determination has, as yet, been made. The coils were
adjusted so as to be right at 15°.

                 I Considerable trouble was experienced in the determination
                of the 1 ohm coils in the proportional arms, owing mainly to
                variations in the resistance of the plugs, which were <U+FB01>tted into
                the usual divided blocks. The amount of this error is of

   Desiring to obtain a check measurement, I balanced the nine
'1 ohm coils against the l and 10 ohm standards in parallel,
and obtained the value '90224 at 13°, while the <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>ve
coils of the dial, when balanced against the two 1 ohm coils
in parallel, gave '50125 at 13°'2. The actual values for the
sums of the nine and <U+FB01>ve respectively, as found by the
separate determinations, were '90259 and '50147. Of course
any contact-error due to the plugs would appear when the
values of the coils are added up.                    When the separate values
of the nine coils are added up, the contact-error will have
entered 18 times into the result, and for <U+FB01>ve coils 10 times ;
on the other hand, when the coils are measured in series, the
contact-error will only enter twice in each case, and the
differences between the two sets of values in both cases are
explained by the ascertained result that the contact-resistance
of each plug is '00002.
    It is somewhat hold to assert that an error of '00004 ohms
has not entered into the determination of each of the TLO ohm
coils. The standard itself is certainly correct, as will be seen
by reference to its values on the various dates; the only
possible explanation would be that the connecting leads of
the two arms had not equal resistances. A subsequent test,
however, proved that they were equal. I was, therefore,
 driven to the conclusion that the contact-resistance as above
 found was real, and not due to an experimental error.
    The resistance of the box from terminal to terminal with
each plug in zero was obtained in three ways.                              Firstly, by
short-circuiting the mercury-cups in one of the arms of the
bridge, and measuring the resistance of the leads and plugs

222             Mr. F. W. Burstall on the Use of
on the bridge-wire. This gave a value of “00967 ‘ohm’at
l2°'8. Secondly, the <U+FB01>rst coil of the JU ohm'dial,-together
with the leads,-was-balanced against t e 11;; ohm standard;
subtracting from this resistance the known resistance. of the
box-coil, we get a value of '00964 ohm for the resistance of
the leads, at 12°“4. Thirdly, a similar method was employed
to measure the <U+FB01>rst coil in the 1 ohm dial, and this determi
nation gave the resistance of the leads as '00954 ohm at
10°‘3. In order that these three observations may agree it
is necessary to assume that the temperature-coe<U+FB02>icient of the
copper leads is about “00005 ohm per degree. This is rather
high, but the temperature range is too small for an accurate
determination.       '
   The values of the coils in the 100 dial were obtained on
the box itself.    In the gap A (<U+FB01>g.        the 1 ohm standard coil

 Wheatstone bridge, the two 10 ohm coils in the proportional
 arms formed two other arms, the fourth arm was any one of
 the 100 ohm coils, which was connected to the gap 0 by
 means of the two <U+FB02>exible leads with conical ends. The plu
 from the centre of the 100 dial was in the zero of the 1000
 dial so as to complete the circuit from the gap A to the gap
 0.   The smallest resistance in the box was 11 of an ohm, so
 that the last two <U+FB01>gures of the resistance had to be obtained
 by interpolation from the swings of the galvanometer. The
 battery employed was one storage-cell, and the current was
 commuted for each observation. With the coils of the gal
 vanometer placed in series an alteration of 115 of an ohm in
 the box caused a total galvanometer swing of about 116 scale
 divisions.

XXII. On the Wave-Surface and Rotation of Polarization
   Plane in an Aeolotropz'c Electromagnetic llfedium. By
   Prof. A. MCAULAY, University of Tasmania *.
   N the ‘ Philosophical Magazine ’ for J one 1885, p. 397 (also
      ‘Electrical Papers,’ vol. ii. p. 1), Mr. Heaviside has in
vestigated in a very instructive manner the properties of the
electromagnetic wave-surface and index-surface, and the
relations in a plane wave of the electric and magnetic forces
and the displacement and induction.
   In noticing that in one respect his investigation can be
simpli<U+FB01>ed, I have been led to some simple connexions between
the electromagnetic surface and Fresnel’s surface. The most.
important result is that the former can in two ways by a real
pure strain be converted into a Fresnel surface ; the axes of
the strain being in the two cases those of permittivity and
inductivity.
   Thus all the peculiarities—such as double sheet, singular
                 '~‘ Communicated by the Author.

point, &c.—of the Fresnel surface, and no more, are repeated
in the electromagnetic surface.
   I am not familiar with the details of experimental work in
Physical Optics, and therefore cannot say whether there is
conclusive evidence that the Fresnel surface is accurately
the form of the true optical wave-surface. \Ve see by the
above statement that the mere qualities of double refraction,
conical refraction, &c. will not serve to distinguish between
the Fresnel and general electromagnetic wave-surfaces.
   The notation and language of Quaternions will be used
below, and Mr. Heaviside’s valuable practice of denoting
(whenever desirable) vectors by Clarendon type will be
followed.
   Prof. Hathaway’s (‘Primer of Quaternions,’ Macmillan,
N.Y., 1896) term “ nonion ” for “linear vector function of a
vector ” will be used. [But I should like, in passing, to say
that I think the term a bad one. Some single term is almost
indispensable, and I had suggested “Hamiltonian.” Prof.
Hathaway rightly objected that Hamilton’s name should not
thus be appropriated to a minor function occurring in
Quaternions. I therefore prefer “nonion.” But there is
this serious objection to thus indiscriminately extending
the principle which underlies the formation of the word
“quaternion”-—that there will be many kinds of qua
ternions, many kinds of nonions, &c. For instance, a unit
rotor would be a quaternion, and what I have in Octonions
called a self-conjugate pencil function would be a nonion.]
   If x be a nonion, and 7" its conjugate, the strain corre
sponding to x’-‘ may be called the reciprocal conjugate of
t e strain corresponding to x. It is physically described as
follows :—If a given strain be eifected by <U+FB01>rst making a
pure strain and then a rotation, the pure strain may be
called the pure part of, and the rotation the rotation of,
the given strain. The reciprocal of a given pure strain is
naturally de<U+FB01>ned as the pure strain whose axes are those of
the given strain and whose elongations are the reciprocals of
those of the given strain. The reciprocal conjugate of a
given strain is then one whose pure part is the reciprocal
of the pure part of the given strain and whose rotation
is the same as that of the given strain.
   We require the following
   Lemma—If R be a given surface, and S its polar reciprocal
with regard to a given origin; and     by a homogeneous strain
which leaves the origin unmoved R become R', and by the
reciprocal conjugate strain S become S’, then S' is the polar
reciprocal of R' with regard to the same origin.

226    Prof. A. McAulay on the Wave-Surface and Rotation
   Fix the attention on a tangent plane of R and the corre
sponding point of S, and on the plane (tangential to R') and
point (of S') into which these are strained.
   Let p be the coordinate vector (the origin being the given
one) of any point of the tangent plane of R, p' the corre
sponding strained value of' p, a- the vector of the point on S,
and 0' the strained value of a'. Let x be the given strain, so
that x'" is the reciprocal conjugate.      Thus we have
                   p'=xp,     a'=x'-10',      .  .  .  .  .  (1)
and
                          Spa-=—1.......(2)
for all values of p (in travelling over the tangent plane). It
at once follows that
                          Sp'aJ = —1
for all values of p'. This proves the proposition.
   The equations that Mr. Heaviside uses in considering the
wave-surface are                  _      _

where c and ,u. are self-conjugate nonions, viz. permittivity
and inductivity respectively, and where H, E, B, D are as
usual. The medium is immovable, and c and ,u. have constant
values at all points.
   In order to bring these into harmony with the notation of
my paper “ On the Mathematical Theory of Electro
magnetism” (Phil. Trans. vol. clxxxiii. 1892, A, . 685:
this paper will be referred to below as “ M. T. E.”), prefer

value. If then we put

           B’ = m"1 XB,      D’ = 'm_1 xD,       ,           (8)

be veri<U+FB01>ed independently of “ M. T. E.”
    In the language of “ M. T. E.” this is equivalent to taking
for the standard position not the actual <U+FB01>xed position of
matter, but a homogeneously strained (9(1) state of that.
    By suitably choosing x we can make either 0 or ,u. a
constant scalar. It will be suf<U+FB01>cient to consider only one of
these cases.

             #=1,                 (lei/“Me‘s
    Since now in eq. (4) ,u.=1, we see at once that in the ideal
 space denoted by p, H, D, &c. the wave-surface of propagation
 ot'H and E or B and D will be a Fresnel surface, and the
corresponding index-surface will be its polar reciprocal.
    The equation of this ideal wave-surface being expressed in
 terms of p, the true wave-surface will be obtained by straining
 by the function x or m’ —$ n't because p’ = Xp. The ideal
 index-surface is the polar reciprocal of the ideal wave-surface,
 and similarly for the actual surfaces. Hence, by the lemma
 above, the actual index-surface is obtained from the ideal by
 straining by x’—1 or m't ,u.'-§.
     This change of variables from p to p’ thus enables us to
 reduce the <U+FB01>nding of the wave-surface from the index-surface
 to the ordinary Fresnel case, and thus saves us from the only
 part of Mr. Heaviside’s investigation which is very complex.
     If we notice that in equation (1) above the relation between
  a’ and a- is the ordinary intensity relation, and remember that
  p’ and cr’ are naturally taken as the coordinate vectors of
  points on the wave- and index-surfaces respectively; and if
  we bear in mind the fundamental properties of intensities and
  <U+FB02>uxes, we shall <U+FB01>nd that all Mr. Heaviside’s results for the
  actual case can be written down from the corresponding ones
  for the simpli<U+FB01>ed ideal case. For instance, if we show in the
  simpli<U+FB01>ed case that
                       a = VBD/§S(BH+DE),

228     Prof. A. McAulay on the Wave-Surface and Rotation
1t wrll follow that a, = VB,D,/%S(B,H,+D,E,),
because the expression on the right is an intensity.
    It can easily be veri<U+FB01>ed directly that Mr. Heaviside’s wave
surface strains by means of the function [17* into a Fresnel
surface and similarly for the index-surface.
    In writing the above it has occurred to me that it is easy by
the methods of “ M. T. E.” to construct any number of mediums
 which shall, accOrding to equations (5) and (6), rotate the
 plane of polarization of an electromagnetic plane polarized
 wave. It should be carefully noticed that the special electrical
 theory of “ M. T. El’ is not here involved.          We deal with
 Maxwell’s theory pure and simple, as exempli<U+FB01>ed by equations
 (5) and (6) above. It is only the mathematical methods of
 “ M. T. E.” that are about to be used.
    In the mediums in question )u.’ and c’ vary in space but not
 in time. I will <U+FB01>rst describe such a medium, and then
 indicate how it is constructed.
    p.’ and c’ vary spirally, according to a certain law to be
 mentioned directly, about a certain axis <U+FB01>xed in the medium.
 For the sake of conciseness, suppose this axis is vertical.
 Describe a circular cylinder of any radius R, having this axis
for its axis. On this cylinder describe a spiral making an
angle 6 (between 0° and 145°) with the horizon given by
the equation
                         tan 20 = 2h/R, . . . . . . (12)
where h is a given constant length (positive, say, to <U+FB01>x the
 ideas, though it must also be possibly negative). This spiral
will be referred to as the <U+FB01>rst spiral. A spiral on the same
cylinder cutting the <U+FB01>rst perpendicularly will be referred to
as the second spiral. Thus, through every point of the
medium we have a <U+FB01>rst spiral and a second spiral.
    The principal arses of permittivity and inductivity are the
tangents to these two spirals and the line at right angles to both
(i. e., the perpendicular from the point on the axis).
    The <U+FB01>rst axis will mean that along the tangent to the <U+FB01>rst
spiral, and the <U+FB01>rst permittivity will mean the corresponding
 principal permittivity, and similarly for the <U+FB01>rst inductivity;
 similarly also for the second axis, permittivity, and inductivity.
The third axis is of course the remaining one, and similarly
for permittivity and conductivity.
    The third permittivity and third inductivity have constant
values so and no throughout the medium. The <U+FB01>rst permittivity
and inductivity are (:0 cot52 6 and no cote 0 respectively, and the
second are 00 tan2 9 and no tan2 0 respectively.
   In this medium a plane polarized wave with normal along

        of Polarization Plane in an Aeolotropie Medium.        229
 the axis is possible, and will sufer rotation in the direction in
 which the <U+FB01>rst spiral goes round the axis. The rotation is one
 radian for every distance h travelled by the wave.
   It will thus be seen that for a point in<U+FB01>nitely near the axis
 the <U+FB01>rst and second spirals (and therefore the corresponding
 axes) are in<U+FB01>nitely nearly inclined at an angle of 45° to the
 horizon. As we recede to an in<U+FB01>nite distance from the axis,
the inclination of the <U+FB01>rst axis continuously diminishes to
zero, the second axis being, of course, always at right angles
to the <U+FB01>rst.    Also, in<U+FB01>nitely near the axis the permittivity and.
inductivity are in<U+FB01>nitely nearly isotropic, and as we recede to
in<U+FB01>nity the <U+FB01>rst permittivity and inductivity continuously
increase to in<U+FB01>nity, while the second continuously decrease to
zero. The geometrical mean of the <U+FB01>rst and second permit
tivities is always the constant third, and similarly for the
inductivities.
   We thus see that strictly within the four corners of Max
well’s theory we <U+FB01>nd room for the explanation of the rotation
of the plane of polarized light in crystals. We may instruc
tively picture (however far from the real truth the picture
may be) such a substance as quartz to be made up of a bundle
of parallel ropes (as they may be called), each rope being such
a medium as just described. To make the theory strictly
applicable the average diameter of a rope should be large
compared with the wave-length of light. There seems little
doubt, however, that even if the average diameter were com—
parable or even small compared with the wave-length there
would be a rotation of the plane of polarization.
   To construct the above medium, <U+FB01>rst note that for an
immovable medium equations (3) and (4) are precisely equi
valent to equations (5) and (6). Suppose the permittivity
and inductivity referred to the standard position (0 and a)
are constant scalars co and #0. Then many solutions of
equations (3) and (4) are known. But p’ may be taken as
any given function of p. Hence we have corresponding
solutions—which are fully known—for the actual position.
   Remembering the connexions of intensities and <U+FB02>uxes with
the position of matter, we see, among other things, that the
line-integrals of E’ and H’ referred to the actual position are
the line-integrals of E and H referred to the standard position.
In any particular case this fact enables us to see at once how
E’ and H’ areldistributed in the actual space when the solution
for E and H is known. For instance, the above statements
about the rotation of the plane of polarization in the medium
described are seen at once to follow from the following con
struction of that medium :—                 '

230     Wave-Surface and Rotation of Polarization Plane.
    Let the actual position be obtained from the standard
 position by the simplest kind of torsion round the axis
 (St.-Venant’s torsion-problem for a circular cylinder). Use
 columnar coordinates R, ¢, z for the actual position of matter,
 the axis being the axis of torsion. Let i,j, k (i and being
 functions of the position of a point) he unit vectors in the
 directions of dR, (I4), and dz respectively. Thus we put
                         p1=egk/2bPe—zkl2b’ , _ . . . (13)

    It will be found that these results together with equation

    It is possible that a torsion other than the simplest (from a
strain point of view) would give simpler electromagnetic
results. The above torsion is the only one I have examined.
    lnstructive results are obtained by considering the wave
surface and the ray in the p space and their associated wave
surface and ray in the actual p' space.              If a disturbance
emanate from a point on the axis of the medium, its wave
surface is a sphere both in the standard and. actual positions
of matter, but the ray, while straight in the standard position,
is a diverging spiral in the actual position that circulates
round the axis, one complete revolution taking lace while
the ray moves a distance 27rh in the direction of t c axis.

232      Mr. T. Preston on the Continuity of Isothermal
alters only slightly as the pressure is varied.     When the
pressure is gradually reduced, however (the temperature
  cing maintained constant), a point B is reached at which the
liquid begins to boil, and the whole mass may be transformed
into the gaseous state under constant pressure, if heat be
supplied to keep the temperature constant while the volume
is allowed to increase from B to D. The part BD of the
isothermal is consequently a right line parallel to the axis of
 volume, and at D the whole mass is in the condition of
 saturated vapour.   Beyond D the curve DE is approximately
 a rectangular hyperbola as it represents the isothermal of a
 gaseous substance which approximately obeys Boyle’s law.
    Very shortly after Andrews’ celebrated experiments on the
 isothermals of carbon dioxide, and on the continuous trans
 formation of matter from the gaseous to the liquid state,
 Professor James Thomson, in an ingenious speculation (sug
 gested by the shape of the isothermals immediately above the
 critical temperature), proposed an isothermal curve of the
form represented in <U+FB01>g. 2, which embraces the idea of conti

 Here, in passing from B to D, the substance is supposed to
 be homogeneous throughout, and not to be partly liquid and
 partly vapour as in the corresponding part BD of the iso
 thermal of <U+FB01>g. 1. The word homogeneous must here, how
 ever, be taken with some reservation, for although the mass,
 as a whole, may be apparently homogeneous—that is, one
 cubic centimetre may be on the whole the same as another,—
 yet when considered in ver small portions the mass may be
 intensely heterogeneous.      or example, small portions may

approach the gaseous state more nearly than the liquid, while
others may be more decidedly in the liquid condition ‘.
    Since the time of Andrews and Thomson, various attempts
have been made to deduce from dynamical principles a general
relation connecting the volume, pressure, and temperature of
a substance which will apply to the liquid as well as the
gaseous condition of matter, and which will also hold through
out the transformation t'rom one state to the other. Of these
the most notable examples are those of Van der “Taals and
Clausius, both of whom obtained equations'(founded on cer
tain assumptions) for the isothermal curves which, when
traced, presented the characteristics of the curve suggested by
James Thomson, as shown in <U+FB01>g. 2.
    A di<U+FB02>iculty which presents itself at once to the acceptance
 of such a curve as representing a realizable series of trans
formations, is that the part MN represents conditions of the
 substance in which the volume and the pressure increase
 together. As a consequence, this part of the curve has been
 generally regarded as unrealizable, and experimental evidence
 of it has been nowhere found in nature ; yet, the interesting
 phenomena of superheating and supersaturation are so well
 represented by the portions BM and DN that the whole
 curve has been admitted as a possible, if not a necessary,
 generalization.
     It is to this unrealizable part of the curve that I now wish
 to attract attention, and I shall endeavour to show that there
 is a conceivable condition of the substance which satis<U+FB01>es the
 extraordinary demands of the portion MN, viz., that the
 pressure and volume shall increase together, and that through
 out the transformation the substance shall be in equilibrium,
 although necessarily unstable.
     For this purpose, let us consider the condition of the sub
 stance at any point of the isothermal between B and D.
 What really happens in practice is, that bubbles of vapour are
 formed in the interior of the liquid mass, and by reason of
 the action of gravity these rise vertically upwards, and the
 result is that the mass becomes separated into two portions,
 the upper part of the containing vessel being <U+FB01>lled with
 vapour, and the lower part by the remaining liquid. The
 action of gravity is thus to separate the vapour bubbles from
 the liquid, and it is on this account, as we shall see, that the
 part BD of the isothermal is, in practice, a right line as shown
 in <U+FB01>g. 1. If, however, we imagine the action of gravity to
 be removed, then a “bubble of vapour when formed would

remain in situ, except in so far as it mivht dgift with currents
in the mass. The formation of bubbIes, under these con
ditions, would cause the mass to swell into a spongy condition
-—a heterogeneous mixture of liquid and vapour,—in which,
if the equilibrium could be maintained, the volume and pres
sure would vary according to laws very different from the
simple law of constant pressure which governs the transforma
tion of ordinary boiling under the action of gravity (<U+FB01>g. 1).
   In order to determine, under these conditions, how the
pressure varies with the volume, at constant temperature, let
us consider the case of a mass of liquid in which a spherical
 bubble of the vapour of the liquid has been formed, as shown
in <U+FB01>g. 3.    For the sake of clearness, let the mass be enclosed

in a cylinder by means of a piston, so that the volume and
external pressure can be varied at pleasure, then, if p be the
pressure, applied through the piston (which we may term the
external pressure of the mass, in the ordinary sense), the
pressure at any point in the interior of the liquid will be
p+c, where c is a quantity depending on the surface <U+FB01>lm, and,
as it arises from the mutual attraction of molecules well
within each other’s sphere of action, may be very large. But,
if or be the vapour-pressure within the bubble, the relation
connecting p and w is
                           w=p+7,          .   .   . . .  .  (l)

clear, therefore, that if 1::- remains sensibly constant, )0 must
increase as 1- increases, or in other words, the external pressure
and the volume must increase simultaneously, if equilibrium
is to be maintained.
    The saturated vapour-pressure er, however, is not quite
constant, but varies at constant temperature with the curva

taken to represent the normal saturated vapour-pressure, that

surface of its own liquid, then the saturated vapour-pressure

    In this equation all the quantities other than p and '1' may
 be taken as remaining constant during an isothermal trans
 formation, and consequently, within certain limits, the volume
 and external pressure of the mass should increase together.
    This equation, however, cannot be expected to hold in the
 extreme case in which the bubble is so small that the mass
within it ceases to possess distinctly the properties of a
 vapour, or in the other extreme case, in which the bubbles
 become so large and numerous that the remaining liquid, by
 reason of being drawn out into thin <U+FB01>lms, or otherwise, ceases
 to behave as a liquid in regard to the transmission of hydro
 static pressure &c. Within certain limits, however, equation
 (2) gives the relation between the external pressure and the
volume of the mass.
    Thus, in the case of a single bubble, if the whole mass be
 taken as unity, and the mass of vapour within the bubble be

Consequently, since the right-hand member of this equation
remains constant, the equation of the isothermal curve assumes
the hyperbolic form
                  (v—vl) (wo—p)3=constant.               . . . . (9)
This equation holds for a spherical bubble of vapour sur
 rounded by its own liquid, and in this case it is to be noted
that p must always be less than 'w-O, or the external pressure
of the mass must be less than the normal saturated vapour
pressure, and this is what is indicated by the portion MC of
the isothermal lying below the right line BD in <U+FB01>g. 2.
    So far we have considered the case of a single bubble,
surrounded by its own liquid, but the foregoing reasoning
will apply when a number of equal bubbles are formed. If
the bubbles are of different sizes, however, the capillary
pressures arising from the curvatures of their surface <U+FB01>lms
will be different, and equilibrium will be impossible—the
larger bubbles tending to expand, and the smaller to collapse.
    it would appear, therefore, that the mass might be gradually
transformed from the liquid to the gaseous condition, by
allowing a system of equal bubbles to gradually increase in
size while the volume increased to 222 and the external pressure
to we, and this value would be reached if the bubbles could
be supposed to increase gradually till the whole mass reached
the state of vapour. Long before this <U+FB01>nal condition could be
reached, however, the liquid portions of the mass, which
interlace the bubbles and <U+FB01>ll the spaces between them, would
be drawn out into thin <U+FB01>lms, and the conditions would be such
that the foregoing reasoning could not be applied. The
action of the distended surface <U+FB01>lm, in fact, will be such as to
draw the liquid parts which <U+FB01>ll the spaces between the bubbles

into spherical drops, so that a stage is ultimately reached in
which the mass consists of a system of spherical drops sur
rounded by their own vapour (<U+FB01>g. 4).
    The state of aEairs is now reversed, for instead of having
vapour in contact with a concave liquid surface, and therefore

at a pressure loss than arc, the normal saturated vapour-pressure,
 we have saturated vapour in contact with convex liquid sur
 faces, and therefore at a pressure w, greater than wo.
    Hence, in this limit, we may take the pressure on the
enclosing piston to be that of the saturated vapour, namely 1:,
 the mass will be subject to an external pressure greater than
we, namely p=ur, and this brings us into the region ON
 (fig. 2) of the isothermal which lies above the normal pressure
line BD.       In this it is assumed that the mass is largelyin
 the condition of saturated vapour, and that the liquid exists as
 a system of equal spherical droplets, swimming in their own
 vapour.
    1f the drops were of different radii equilibrium would be
 impossible, as evaporation would take place at the surfaces of
 the smaller drops, and condensation at the surfaces of the
 larger. This instability is made evident by the equation
 which shows how the vapour-pressure increases as the radii
 of the liquid drops diminish, and when the drops are small, or
 ma exceed are by a considerable quantity.
      here is a limit, however, beyond which, if the radii of

238      Mr. T. Preston on the Continuity of Isothermal
the drops be diminished, the foregoing equation will cease to
apply, and the pressure w, after reaching a maximum, will
gradually diminish, and <U+FB01>nally recede to the value we, when
the drops of liquid vanish. This is the process which takes
place along the falling part ND (<U+FB01>g. 2) of the isothermal.
Similarly, in the initial phases of the transformation here
imagined, namely, when small bubbles are beginning to be
formed within the mass, it is clear that equation (2) ceases to
apply when the bubbles are so small that they cease to possess
the distinctive properties of vapour, and it consequently
follows, that although w may be very much less than two, at
some part of the branch BMC, yet a condition is attained
with bubbles of a certain diameter in which or is a minimum.
and from which it increases in both directions to the normal
vapour-pressure wo.
   Thus, the part BM (<U+FB01>g. 2) of the isothermal is accounted
for, and therefore the whole succession of conditions repre
sented by an isothermal, such as that imagined by James
Thomson, is rendered conceivable. Such a succession, of
course, cannot be regarded as realizable, for although the con
dition represented by every point of the curve is shown to be
possible, and one of equilibrium, when the bubbles (or drops)
are all of the same size, yet the equilibrium is essentially
unstable, for when there is any departure from uniformity,
all differences tend to become exaggerated, and the mass may
depart from the condition of equilibrium with explosive
violence.
    It is interesting to note that the mass may be transformed
from the condition B to the condition D by two distinct
routes of transformation—one along the right line BD, in
which the condition is stable, and the other along the curved
path BMCND, in which the condition is unstable,-—yet the
 principle of conservation of energy forces us to conclude that
the work done against external pressure, while the mass
 expands from B to D, must be the same in the two cases, and
 for this reason it has been concluded that whatever the shape
 of the curve AMND may be, the area of the loop BMC
 must be equal to the area of the loop OND. At <U+FB01>rst sight
we might apply the same reasoning to the transformation
from B to C, or from D to C, and rush to the conclusion that
the area of each loop must be zero, or else that we are here
presented with a violation of the principle of conservation of
energy.
    But it must be remarked that although at the point C of
 the diagram the mass, in both cases, has the same tempera
ture, pressure, and volume, yet in one case all the. vapour is

      Trans<U+FB02>rmationfrom the Liquid to the Gaseous State.      239
collected into one portion of the chamber, and all the liquid
into the other, whereas in the other case the vapour and
liquid are not distinctly separated from each other, but inter
-mixed in some way so as to occupy the whole space as an
apparently homogeneous mass. Hence the point C represents
 two distinct conditions of the mass in which the ressure,
 volume, and temperature are the same, but in w ich the
 internal energies may differ very considerably. Thus, althou h
 less external work is done in passing from B to C along the
 curve BMC than in passing along the right line BC, yet in
 virtue of the arrangement of the mass, the internal energy at
 C in the former case may be considerably greater than in
 the latter.
     This, indeed, must be the case if the arrangement of the
 mass be of the bubble and drop nature here suggested. For
 if a given mass, existing partly as liquid and partly as
 vapour, be arranged in such a way that the liquid is collected
 together in one part of the containing vessel, while the
 vapour is all collected. in the remainder (as ordinarily occurs),
 and if we desire to change it from this arrangement into one
 like that described above, in which the vapour is disseminated
 through the liquid in bubbles, or in which the whole vessel is
 <U+FB01>lled with vapour and drops, a certain amount of work must
 be done in order to effect the transformation—namely, the
 equivalent of the surface energy possessed by the enormously
 increased surface area of the bubbles and drops in the new
 condition. Thus, although less external work is done in
 passing along the isothermal BMC than along the rectilinear
  path BC, yet the mass in the former case possesses more
  surface energy than in the latter, and the excess of external
  work in the latter transformation is represented in the former
  by an excess of internal work spent in generating the excess
  of surface <U+FB01>lm.
     Similar remarks apply to the portion CND, for in passing
  along this curve the external work done is greater than that
  performed in passing along CD, but this is compensated by
  the destruction of the surface <U+FB01>lm. Thus, along BMC there
  is on the whole a creation of surface <U+FB01>lm with less external
  work, and along CND there is destruction of surface <U+FB01>lm
  accompanied by increased external work—the excess in the
  former being equal to the defect in the latter.
      In conclusion, it may be remarked that the views here put
  forward seem to have an important bearing on many interest
  ing questions connected with the boiling-points of liquids, and
  the manner in which they are affected by the presence of
  dissolved salts. It is su<U+FB01>icient to merely point out, at present,

240      Prof. J. Cr. MacCrregor on Abstract Dynamics and
that obviously any operation which increases the surface-ten
sion of the <U+FB01>lm separating a liquid from its own vapour will
also raise the boiling-point, for when T is increased, a greater
vapour-pressure or within a bubble will be required in order
to enable it to expand against a given external pressure.
This prediction of the theory appears to be in accordance with
the observed facts.
XXIV. The [Iypotheses of Abstract Dynamics and the ques
    tion ofthe number of the Elastic Constants. By Prof. J. G.
    MAOGREGOB, 0.80., Dalhousie College, Ilalzfax, N.S. *
IN a former paper 1- an attempt was made to formulate the
       hypotheses employed in Abstract Dynamics, when bodies
are considered as consisting of particles exerting forces upon
one another at a distance. As these may be expressed in
various ways, Newton’s Second Law of Motion, owing to its
very general employment, was selected as one of them, and it
was sought to determine what others are required in order to
establish both the equations of motion and the law of the
conserVation of energy. It was shown that the following
independent assumptions are both necessary and suf<U+FB01>cient for
this purpose, viz., (a) the Third Law in its wide sense, i. e., as
asserting that action and reaction are not only equal and
opposite but also in the same straight line, and (b) the law
of the conservation of natural forces, 2'. e., that natural forces
are such that the work done during any change of the con
<U+FB01>guration of a system depends only upon the initial and <U+FB01>nal
con<U+FB01>gurations, or that Z(Xd.2:+Ydy+Zdz) is a complete
differential. Both (a) and (b) are assertions about natural
forces, (a) referring to magnitude, direction, and action-line,
and (b) to ma nitude. They may be combined in one by
noting that w en (a) holds, E(Xd.z*+Ydy+ Zdz) becomes
ZSds, where S is the stress between any pair of particles
and 8 their distance from one another, and that the condition
that ESds shall be a complete di<U+FB01>'erential is that each S shall
 be a function of all the s’s, or in more precise terms, that the
stresses between the various pairs of particles shall be propor
 tional to the rates of change, with respect to the corresponding
distances respectively, of a function of the distances of all the
pairs of particles of the system.
    Thus the requisite hypotheses reduce to two, viz., (l) the
   * An abstract (with some additions) of a. pa )er read before the Royal
Society of Canada. Communicated by the Aut or.
   1' Trans. Roy. Soc. Canada, vol. x. see. iii. (1892) p. 3.

          the question of the number of the Elastic Constants.        241
 Law of Force—Newton’s Second Law, and (2) the Law of
 Stress, just enunciated. To these, however, must be added
 a third, viz., (3) the Law of the constitution of bodies, that
 bodies may be regarded as consisting of particles acting on
 one another at a distance.
      In the paper* of which thisis an abstract, a similar attempt
 is made to formulate the hypotheses employed when, as in
 the study of <U+FB02>uids and elastic solids, bodies are considered as
 consisting of elements which exert forces on contiguous
 elements only, across surfaces of contact. In obtaining the
 equations of motion, in this case, the Third Law is applied,
 when, the traction at .z', y, z on one end of a parallelopiped
 with dx, dy, dz as edges being called P, the traction on the
 other end is put equal to —(P +                        The Second Law
 is partially applied when the quotient of the force on an
 element by its acceleration is put equal to p da: dy dz, p being
 the density.       It is only partially applied, however; for as
p varies with the time, there is nothing in the resulting
 equation to show that the quotient of force by acceleration is
 constant, as the Second Law states. Accordingly the equa
 tions of motion thus obtained are insuf<U+FB01>cient completely to
 determine the motion. An additional equation is necessary,
 viz., one which completes the application of the Second Law
 by expressing in some form or other, that the pda: dy dz of
 the equations of motion is constant.               This is the so-called
 equation of continuity, which is thus onlya partial application
 of the Second Law. It was regarded by Rankine as re
 quiring an independent axiom 1', and is derived by other
writers by asserting, in a vague kind of way, the impossibility
 of the annihilation and the creation of matter, the constancy
of mass, or the continuity of the motion considered.
     In order to obtain the law of the conservation of energy,
it is necessary to assume, in addition, that the work done I

242    Prof.    G. MacGregor 0n Abstract Dynamics and
results in the production of an equivalent amount of potential
energy. This is equivalent to the assumption that the above
expression is a complete differential, which is again equiva
lent to the assumption that the stress components, P, Q, R,
S, T, U, at a point, are proportional to the rates of change,
with respect to the corresponding strain components, e, f, g,
a, b, 0 respectively, of a function of all these strain com
ponents.
    The Third Law and the hypothesis just enunciated are both
 statements partially specifying natural stresses. We may
 combine them in one by assuming that natural forces may be
 regarded as stresses between contiguous elements of a body
 (or medium), the components of the stress at a point having
 the relations as to magnitude just speci<U+FB01>ed.
    Thus in cases of contact-action also, the purely dynamical
 hypotheses reduce to two,—(l) The Law of Force—
 Newton’s Second Law, and (2) the Law of Stress, as just
 enunciated. In such cases also there is, however, a. third
 hypothesis, viz., (3) the Law of the constitution of bodies,
 that bodies may be regarded as consisting of elements exerting
forces upon contiguous elements only, across their surfaces
of contact.
    The above results have a bearing on the controversy with
regard to the rari-constant and the multi-constant theories of
elasticity.   For in order to form an estimate of the relative
probability of deductions from the two theories, accuracy-in
deduction being assumed, we must compare the hypotheses
employed.
   The multi-constant theorists, in applying the contact-action
conception of bodies, have usually employed as dynamical
hypotheses the Second and Third Laws of Motion and the
 Law of the conservation of energy, which together are equi
 valent in hypothetical content to the above Laws of Force and
of Stress, or to the Laws of the conservation and the trans
ference of energy.
   The rari-constant theorists have used the molecular, or
rather the oinbatom, conception of bodies, and have em
ployed as dynamical hypotheses the Second Law and the
assumption that the stress between any pair of particles is a
function of their distance, not of the distances of all the pairs
of particles of the system. Their dynamical tiypotheses have
thus a greater hypothetical content than the laws of Force
and Stress, and therefore also than the Laws of Energy.
   It would appear, however, that the discrepancy between
the results deduced from the two theories with regard to the
number of the elastic constants is not due to the additional

       the question of the number of the Elastic Constants.        2113
assumption which the rari-constant theorists have employed
over and above those equivalent to the laws of energy. If
we take Mr. Love’s account of Cauchy’s deduction of the
stress-strain relations * as being fairly representative of de
ductions of the kind (I have not access to the literature of
the subject), this seems obvious. For if, in this deduction,
the stresses between particles be regarded as functions of the
distances of all the pairs of particles of the system, not of the
distances between the attracting particles themselves only,
while the expressions for the elastic constants will be changed,
they will still reduce to <U+FB01>fteen. Hence, so far as the number
of independent constants is concerned, the rari-constant
theorists may be said to have employed dynamical assump
tions equivalent to the'laws of energy.              "
    This being so, the apparent discrepancy between the
results of the two theories must be due to the difference in
the assumptions made as to the constitution of bodies. Now
the distance-action conception of the constitution of bodies
involves a larger assumption than the contact-action concep
tion. This is obvious from the fact that if we assume the
molecular hypothesis, or rather the point-atom hypothesis, it
can then be proved that bodies may be regarded as consisting
of elements exerting forces on contiguous elements only,
across surfaces of contact, while the molecular hypothesis
cannot be thus deduced from that of contact-action. Thus
the point-atom hypothesis may be regarded as consisting of
two parts, (a) that bodies may be regarded as consisting of
elements exhibiting contact-action; and (b) that this is due
to their consisting of point-atoms acting on one another at a
distance. Moreover, in the deduction of the rari-constant
result, the second part of the hypothesis has been employed.
For it is obvious from Mr. Love’s sketch of Cauchy’s reason
ing, that the possibility of reducing the constants to <U+FB01>fteen
is due to the simplicity, one is tempted to say arti<U+FB01>ciality, of
the point-atom conception. It follows at once that unveri<U+FB01>ed
deductions from the molecular hypothesis must have a lower
degree of probability than similar deductions from the rival
hypothesis.
    While the multi-constant result is thus the more probable
of the two, it cannot be said to be certain. Mr. Love repre
sents the opponents of the molecular theory as urging
against it, “that the known laws of energy lead to results
which are certainly true whether the molecular hypothesis be
correct or no” 1'. Even, however, if we regard the laws of

energy themselves as certainly true, the results of their
application to the study of elasticity cannot have the same
certainty, because of the additional hypothesis (3) which, as
seen above, is made in applying them.
   As the point-atom hypothesis may be expressed in the two
parts given above, it follows, if the conclusion reached above
is correct, viz., that the dynamical hypotheses practically
employed in the two theories are of the same hypothetical
content, that the rari-constant theorist must accept the multi~
constant result. He must hold that with the assumption (a)

According to the one, all bodies which may be regarded as
exhibiting contact-action will be capable of having their
elastic qualities completely characterized by 21 constants, and
unless we have further data with regard to these bodies,
21 constants will be requisite for this purpose.             According
to the other, in the case of bodies which may be regarded as
exhibiting contact-action because of their consistin of point
atoms, the number of the constants may be reduce to 15.
   It would seem to be a simple matter, not indeed to devise
and execute conclusive experiments to settle the question of
the existence of relations among the 21 constants, but to
interpret such experiments when made.               For if the elastic
constants were found to be reducible to 15, the multi-constant
theory would obviously be proved to be inadequate. If other
relations were found to hold than those deduced from the
point-atom hypothesis, the point-atom conception would be
shown to be erroneous and the contact-action conception to
be inadequate.     If it were found that there were no relations
among the 21 constants, the point-atom hypothesis would be
disproved and the contact-action conception would be shown,
so far as the number of the elastic constants is concerned, to
be adequate. Simple logical considerations of this kind are
sometimes overlooked by writers in the enthusiasm produced
by successful application of the contact-action conception.
Thus Mr. Love says * :——“ Even if the experimental evidence
were all fairly interpretable in favour of the other side, if
there were a general consensus that Cauchy’s relations hold
good, and that Poisson’s ratio is 1;, for materials carefully
examined, that would not amount to a proof of the molecular
hypothesis. It would still be open to us to reject that hypo
thesis as not axiomatic, and in the present state of science we

          The Electric Discharge in a Magnetic Field.        245
must so reject it. . . . Unless the hypothesis were axiomatic,
there could be no reason to adopt it to-day. Modern Physics
is perfectly capable of deducing a theory of elasticity from
 the known laws of energy, without the aid of a subsidiary
hypothesis about intermolecular force, and being in that
position, it is bound to discard the hypothesis. Such a device
is merely a phase in the development of scienti<U+FB01>c thought,
and, having served its turn as a means of introducing gener
ality into the subject, it must give place again to a still more
general method.” It is of course quite obvious that the
experimental veri<U+FB01>cation of Cauchy’s relations ‘ would not
prove the molecular hypothesis; but it would show the
contact-action conception to be inadequate. It would still
be open to any one with a preconceived idea as to what is
axiomatic to discard the former, but in doing so he would
<U+FB01>nd himself unable to account for known facts which had
been predicted by the aid of the discarded hypothesis. That
modern physics is capable of deducing a theory of elasticity
from the known laws of energy without the aid of a molecular
hypothesis is surely a mere assertion, if as doubtless is the
case, a satisfactory theory is meant. The experimental deter
mination of any general relations among the 21 constants
would prove the theory in its present state to be inadequate
and unsatisfactory, and the veri<U+FB01>cation of Cauchy’s relations
would show that, while the molecular hypothesis must of
course be regarded as merely a phase in the development of
scienti<U+FB01>c thought, it has not yet quite completely served its
turn as an'instrument of generalisation.
      XXV. The Electric Discharge in a Magnetic Field.
                   By Sir DAVID SALOMONS*.
THE study of the electric discharge in vacuo does not
       appear to have been followed with the same energy as
has been applied to other branches of electrical science,
until quite recent times. I would venture to divide the
historic period of the subject into four, as follows :—
   (1) The time when Messrs. Warren De La Rue, Gassiot,
Spottiswoode, and Moulton were working upon the subject.
   (2) When Professor Crookes made his discoveries.
   (3) The still more recent investigations of Professor J. J.
Thomson.
   (4) The application to photography by employing the so
called .c-rays which are abundantly produced by special forms
of tubes.
                  * Communicated by the Author.

246             Sir David Salomons on the Electric
    I do not intend to deal with the last three periods ; but in
regard to the <U+FB01>rst, although many interesting facts were
brought to light, the subject does not appear to have been
systematized, nor am I able to <U+FB01>nd a great deal published on
the subject before the period of Professor Crookes, perhaps
 for the reason that no one has taken the pains to collect all
 the information and publish it together.
      Many important discoveries were no doubt made and the
 facts published in some obscure quarter, where they probably
 remain to this da . The general interest which now exists
  in science and t e large technical Press were non-existent
  but a very few years ago.
      I now propose to describe brie<U+FB02>y a number of points of
  interest in connexion with vacuum-tubes and some classes of
  work which may be performed by their use, the outcome of
  work extending over twenty-<U+FB01>ve years.
      It appeared to me that two points required settling in
  re ard to these tubes, which, however, are not completely
  exhausted as the name would suggest; viz. :—
       (1) “ That the number of bands produced in a given tube
   should be brought under control, that is to say, that the
   conditions under which they are formed should be solved.”
           “That the reason for their existence should also be
   found out.”
       In regard to the <U+FB01>rst point, I believe that this question is
   solved and the results given in a paper by me published in
   the ‘Proceedings of the Royal Society,’ in volume lvi.
       The origin of the bands has been surmised by many of the
   early workers, in fact they have assumed that they are ro
    duced in consequence of self-inductive effects; but I ave
    not been able to discover any proof that such is the case. I
    shall be able to show by experiments to be described that this
    view is correct; and from the methods adopted, which are
    probably the only means available for the purpose, give the
    clue why the <U+FB01>rst investigators did not advance beyond a
    state of conjecture.
        The tubes I employed contained rare<U+FB01>ed air and various
    other gases; but I found for the particular class of experi
    ments that rare<U+FB01>ed air suf<U+FB01>ced in all cases, and that it was
    not necessary to proceed to very high exhaustion.
        The great efforts made by earlier investigators in trying to
    obtain enormous electromotive force appeared to me wron
    for the class of experiment they were entering upon. I
     therefore tried the opposite course—one which has proved so
     successful in mathematics, viz. the reduction of the leading
     factor to the smallest quantity possible,~—and obserVed what

                    Discharge in a Magnetic Fieldri            247
  took place.     I soon found that a vast number of the pheno
  mena described as fundamental were superposed phenomena ;
  and that when exceedingly small E.M.F. was employed the
  various phenomena were seen in their purity, and on raising
  the            the various changes could be seen, up to the
  complex appearance described in some of the early papers.
  The E.M.F. employed in the following experiments was
  sometimes as low as 700 volts and rarely over 2000.            ~
      It has been known for a long time that the discharge
  through the vacuum-tube is a<U+FB01>'ected by the magnetic <U+FB01>eld,
  but beyond this circumstance I cannot <U+FB01>nd anything that has
  been published upon the subject classifying results.
      Having worked to that point when I could control what
  took place within the tube, it became a comparatively easy
  matter to investigate the discharge in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld
  provided a suf<U+FB01>ciently powerful magnet could be obtained.
      All the electromagnets in existence were built on the
, Faraday-magnet type, and this pattern was found incon
  venient. I therefore had a special magnet constructed
  weighing 13 cwt., with a <U+FB01>eld probably far more powerful
  than any'which had been made before, with the polepieces
  capable of being approached and distanced by means of
   screws, and a variety of other details introduced which made
  the apparatus a piece of engineering work as well as one
  suitable for scienti<U+FB01>c investigation. This magnet is shown
       <U+FB01> . l. not repeat what I have already published on the
   in Igwill
   subject beyond referring to two points :—
       Firstly, that the glass of the tube has a considerable in<U+FB02>u
   ence in creating the bands ; and
      Secondly, that the bands as generally seen are spurious,
   and can only be viewed in their purity at the moment when
   the current is so reduced that they disappear from view.
      There may be other stages beyond this point which the eye
   cannot see, and that such is probable is shown from the fact
   that when the tube is made of <U+FB02>uorescent glass the current may
   be still further reduced and the bands be visible.
        For producing the current I employed Apps’s coils of
    various sizes, the contact-breakers being special mechanical
   forms devised by myself, and worked by an electro-motor.
    I also employed the alternate current from an alternator,
    raised to a suitable pressure by means of a transformer.
       The induction-coils had primary coils so wound that a 100
    volt current could be put on direct, without the insertion of
    a resistance. The number of turns of wire in the primaries
    is so great that the self-induction reduces the length of the

248            Sir David Salomons on the Electric
spark from the secondary, because no large amount of current
can traverse the primary coil.

   But there is a point in favour of using an induction-coil such
as described which does not appear to have been taken ad
vantage of. The spark at the vibrator is far more pronounced
than if a lower electromotive force were employed for the
primary current. Indeed, so much energy can be developed
at the vibrator on the “break ” that it is possible to obtain
the equivalent to a direct intermittent current in the tube, or
at any rate, so far as the eye is concerned this only exists, the
effects due to the current in the opposite direction not being
visible. Consequently two types of current can be produced
by means of the induction-coil.                                          -

                 Discharge in a Magnetic Field.             249
   The phenomena were the same whether the alternate
current from an induction-coil, or the alternate current pro
duced by the alternator, was used, so far as the visible e<U+FB01>'ects
were concerned.

the bands are produced in the usual way.        Now excite the
magnet, the switches having been so adjusted that one pole is
N. and one S., a great change is now observed within the
 tube. If the E.M.F. of the current is very small, the bands

250              Sir David Salomons on the Electric
will disappear altogether and no current will pass. This stage
will 'be referred to later. In such an event raise the E.M.F.
until the bands are plainly seen. It will then be noticed that
the bands which at <U+FB01>rst extended across the tube have now
divided into two columns, and are very much smaller
than before, their position being equatorial. It will further
be noticed that the convex sides are all one way in one
column of bands and in the opposite direction in the other
column of bands, indicating that the two currents have been
completely separated and travel through the tube at opposite
sides, meeting only at the electrodes.      Moreover, the bands
are smaller where the <U+FB01>eld is strongest.      Also they will here
be placed closer together and be more numerous. In fact,
the condition of things can be made such, that where the <U+FB01>eld
is most powerful the bands disappear and a line of light only
is visible.      But a low-power microscope will resolve this
line of light into bands, that is to say, they are so close
together that the eye alone does not appreciate their
existence.
   Probably the best way to make the experiment is to place
the tube between the poles of the magnet when excited.
Then out of} the exciting current, and watch the tube during
the time that the magnetism is falling. The various stages
can be seen better this way, as they take place slowly. Fig. 4

 the appearance of the tube when the magnetism ceases to
 have in<U+FB02>uence.
      Before proceeding to describe other experiments it is well
 to analyse what takes place. My own view is that we have
 here shown in a very pretty way Ampére’s well-known
 experiment of the influence of a current <U+FB02>owing in one con
 ductor upon a current <U+FB02>owing in an adjacent conductor.
 This experiment is usually shown by wires, one arranged as a
  moving conductor. In the instance of the vacuum-tube the
  current is passing through a conductor perfectly free to move,
  or, perhaps, it would be better to say that the current is free
  to place itself, without any appreciable opposing resistance,
  in the position it tends to take up under the in<U+FB02>uence of the
  magnetic <U+FB01>eld, which latter may be regarded as a current
  travelling in a circular conductor, which may be resolved into
  straight line currents parallel to the tube currents.
     The experiment described, therefore, shows that the two
  currents try, not to move out of the <U+FB01>eld, as it might be ex
  pressed, hut tend to take up de<U+FB01>nite positions, which naturally
  must be in opposite directions, when in<U+FB02>uenced by certain
  powerful currents in their proximity, i. e., the magnetic <U+FB01>eld.
   It might appear that the resistance of the gas in the centre
  of the <U+FB01>eld, where no hands appear, has been increased,
   and therefore the current chooses a path of least resistance,
   viz., at the sides of the tube, farthest from the strongest
   portion of the <U+FB01>eld. This may, or may not, be an accessory
   in the case. I venture to believe, for the reason that the
   alternate current has been separated into its two constituents
   on opposite sides, that the true explanation is that ot'Am
   pére’s theory. When the resistance of the tube is actually
   measured it is found to be higher when the magnet is excited,
   and this, of course, would be expected, since the current is
   then travellin through a much smaller sectional area.
   Consequently 518 test of resistance has no value to prove that
   the gas contained within the tube has a higher resistance,
   because under no circumstances can the resistance of the gas
   in the strongest part of the <U+FB01>eld be measured, as the current

252            Sir David Salomons on the Electric
refuses to travel that road, though possibly some indirect
method might be devised.
   Another conclusion may also be deduced from this experi
ment. It is that since the bands become more numerous in the
strongest part of the <U+FB01>eld, they are produced by self-inductive
effects.   To put this in unscienti<U+FB01>c lan uage, the discharge is
comparable to that of a lightning-disc arge through a good
conductor, the eculiarities of which were <U+FB01>rst pointed out by
Professor Hugiies; that is to say, the discharge of the current
through the gas is checked, and then proceeds again, checked
again, and so on ; and it is fairly evident that at the points of
these various checks heat is developed,und the residual matter
in the tube raised to a high temperature, producing what are
termed bright bands. That the bright bands consist of heated
matter is most probable for the reason that they may be seen
from all points of view.
   If instead of employing the alternate current the induction
coil is so adjusted as to produce an intermittent direct one,
only one line of bands appears, equatorially placed, on one
side or the other, according as the current is in one direction
or the opposite one. The analysis of the column of bands is
the same as that of one of the columns when the alternate
current is employed.     Reversing the current through the tube
has no e<U+FB01>'ect upon the appearance of the tube, since the
currents change sides. But if the poles of the ma net are
reversed, then the convexity of the column of hands ecomes
reversed; and this, of course, would be ex ected.
   It has already been stated that when the current <U+FB02>owing
through the tube is exceedingly small, the tube remains dark
and no current would appear to pass. It seems to me that
the probable explanation for this is that the current is, so to
speak, driven into the glass, which has so high a resistance
that no appreciable amount asses.      In fact, the whole of the
experiments show that the larger the amount of the current
which <U+FB02>ows through the tube, the more nearly do the bands
approach to the centre, or, in other words, the smaller is the
space at the centre of the tube which appears dark.
   If the tube, with the current <U+FB02>owing through it, is placed
in an unsymmetrical <U+FB01>eld, then the lines of bands become
distorted, more or less spiral in form. This is because the

<U+FB01>eld being unsymmetrical the currents tend to take up dif
ferent positions in various portions of the tube (see <U+FB01>g. 10).

   If both poles are made N., or S., and the tube placed
between them, the bands in the tube will cross at the centre
and appear as in <U+FB01>g. 11, the dotted lines representing bands
to avoid confusion.
                               Fig. 11.
   Let us now consider what takes place when the same tube
is placed between the poles N. and S. with an increased
current. The bands now stretch nearly across the tube. In
the strongest portion of the <U+FB01>eld there stand out very bright
and well de<U+FB01>ned the magnetic lines of force <U+FB01>lling the tube
in a three-dimensional form.       The effect is very striking and
pulllllistakable.   Besides, the whole tube is <U+FB01>lled with a faint
 1g t.
   Fig. 12 is a general diagram showing what takes place ;
and <U+FB01>g. 13 illustrates the tube in greater detail. The pheno
menon is beautifully shown in the globular tube, <U+FB01>g. 14.

   Of course, what appear to be the lines of force are not really
the lines made visible but the effects due to the Form of the
<U+FB01>eld; since if an effect is due to the <U+FB01>eld at any given point and
varies with the strength of the <U+FB01>eld, the result will take upon
itself the form of the lines of force. It is known that the re
sistance to the passage of the current is less with the lines of
force than across them, which e<U+FB01>ect may have some in<U+FB02>uence
in producing the phenomenon.          The bright lines are nothin
more than bright bands very closely packed; and the form is
due to self-induction.

    In fact, all points on similar lines of force in a magnetic
<U+FB01>eld lying between the N. and S. poles make up a <U+FB01>gure
 somewhat like the shell of an egg; and the appearance of
what I term the visible <U+FB01>eld appears to be like a vast num

ber of transparent coloured egg-shells placed symmetrically
one within the other, although, of course, each shell is not
symmetrical with any other, the inner ones being more elon
gated and the outer ones more spherical, the centre one of
all being a straight line.
   By holding the tube which has been experimented with in
various positlons in regard to the poles of the magnet, whether
they be N. and 3., or both N. or both 8., a variety of appear
ances are seen in the tube according to the position in which
it is held. All the e<U+FB02>'ects can be traced to what I term the
Amperian explanation.
   From the experiments which have been described it is
evident that a very important opening suggests itself as to
the practical use of vacuum-tubes, viz. that of exploring the
magnetic <U+FB01>eld. I have used such tubes for this purpose for
many years past, and have been able to plot out in a few
minutes mentally that which takes a long time b the methods
generally employed.       I am ready to admit t at the usual
process is more accurate when absolute determinations are
required ; but usually all that is wished for is to ascertain the
general character of a <U+FB01>eld and the extent of the leakage, and
this can be done at once by employing vacuum~tubes.

   The question naturally arises whether in the case of solid
conductors the current becomes displaced when such con
ductors are placed in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld.         It is well known
that metals, bismuth in particular, o<U+FB02>'er considerably more
resistance to the passage of the current in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld,
everything else being equal. It occurred to me that this
increased resistance is possibly spurious, and due simply to
the disPlacement of the current. the displacement being easier
to effect in some metals than in others. I made a large
number of experiments in regard to this question, and found
that this displacement does take place, although in a very
small degree when compared with that which results in the
case of a conductor consisting of rare<U+FB01>ed gas. A few years
ago the displacement was noticed by Mr. Hall, and is gene
rally known under the name of the“ Hall effect ;” but the
phenomenon had been observed by myself many years pre
viously, although 1 did not publish it, believing it to be a
known fact.
    1 made a large number of experiments with galvanometers
 built on the D’Arsonval-Deprez type, and obtained very vary
 ing results by modifying the magnetic <U+FB01>eld. By increasing
 the <U+FB01>eld a maximum sensibility was reached, which decreased
 on further increasing the <U+FB01>eld.
    The various experiments described no doubt indicate the
 cause of this, viz. that the <U+FB01>eld being made too powerful, less
 current passes through the coil, and the sensibility begins to
 fall. I had a special galvanometer-apparatus made to <U+FB01>t my
 large magnet, converting it probably into the largest galvano
 meter of the type extant; but the sensibility is exceedingly
 small when the magnet is fully excited, and increases rapidly
 when the excitation is somewhat diminished.
     A pretty way to illustrate the sensibility is the following.
 A small current is passed through the galvanometer-coil when
 the magnet is excited, and the coil-current increased until a
 small de<U+FB02>exion is produced. The exciting current is then
 turned off to permit the magnetism to fall gradually. The
 de<U+FB01>exion will then become greater and greater, until the dot
 of light passes the end of the scale, after which the sensibility
 again decreases as the magnetism falls.
     From all that has been said up. to this point, I think it is
 worth while for a course of experiments to be made on the
 varying resistances of different metals in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld with
  varying currents. It is probable that it will be found that
 there is no constant for any given metal ; and if this should
 be shown to be the case, my view that the increased resistance
 of the metal in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld is spurious will be proved.

   Returning once more to the vacuum-tube, we observed the
separation of the alternate current within it into two distinct
paths. It occurred to me that it might be possible to com
pletely separate the two currents. I therefore constructed
tubes as shown in <U+FB01>gs. 15, 16, and 17, in order to observe

suf<U+FB01>cient, provided that the plane of the tube was placed
equatorially.
   When such a tube was placed axially, as in <U+FB01>g. 17, the two
columns of bands appeared in each section of the tube.
   A tube constructed as in <U+FB01>g. 18 was then employed, the

end electrodes being joined together, the currents separated
from the centre to the end electrodes. But in this case the
path traversed by each current was practically equal in
resistance.
   Another tube therefore was employed where the distances
were unequal, as in <U+FB01>g. 19, the result being the same, and

 tube was again analysed by another large electromagnet;
 and it was found that only one type of current existed in each
 arm of this analysing-tube. Consequently, the current tra
 versing the connecting-wires must of necessity have been an
 intermittent direct current.
    Another double tube was now taken ; but instead of being
 a vacuum-tube it contained water, the analysing-tube still
 being a vacuum-tube. The results were the same, although
 less marked.
    It would therefore appear that we have a magnetic means
 of converting the alternate current into two currents of a
 direct intermittent type, which two currents can be coupled
 up so as to form one intermittent direct current in one direction.
 So far, 1 have only succeeded in producing this result with
 very small currents.

   These experiments led me to try another, which may have
some bearing on the reason for the zigzag form of the dis
charge in air.     Taking once more the vacuum-tube and
placing it in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld, I permitted a very consider
able alternate current to traverse the tube. First, the two
columns of bands appear; then the lines of force ; and
<U+FB01>nally these phenomena remain, with an additional one,
namely, a series of zigzag discharges throughout the tube,
permanent in character, but varying their form continually.
It is quite possible that these zigzag discharges consist of de
formed bands which meet and form zigzag or sinuous lines.
That they should vary in form may possibly be in consequence
of the ever-changing temperature of the gases within the tube,
due to so large a current passing. Hence it is not impossible
that the zi zag discharge in air is due to the magnetic pro—
perties of tie current itselt'. Of course further experiment is
needed to demonstrate the truth of what I have suggested as
a probability.

XXVI.      0n the Longitudinal Component in Light.          By
   Prof. GEORGE FRANCIS FITZGERALD, M.A., Sc.D., F.R.S.,
   F. T. C.D.*
1N most investigations on the propagation of light attention
      has been concentrated on the transverse nature of the
vibration. Longitudinal motions have been relegated to the
case of pressural waves, and investigators have devoted them
selves to separating the two as much as possible. In Sir George
Stokes’s classical paper on Ditl'raction, and in Lord Kelvin’s
Baltimore Lectures, the existence of a longitudinal component
is mentioned ; but it is mentioned only to show that it is very
small and that the motion is mostly transverse. Now the
longitudinal component is no doubt generally small except in
the immediate neighbourhood of a source ; but it by no means
follows that, as a consequence, the actual direction of motion
is transverse at all points in a wave. In every complicated
wave there are points and often lines along which the trans
verse component vauishes, and at all these places the small
longitudinal component may be, and often is, of great relative
importance, so that the actual motion is largely in the direc
tion of wave propagation at these places.
   I. The simplest case is that of a simple oscillator whose
theory has been completely worked out by Hertz. There are
two kinds of oscillator, an electric and a magnetic one. They
are exactly complementary, the magnetic forces in one cor
responding exactly with the electric forces in the other.

It is particularly to be observed that P and Q arise entirely
from J, which was dismissed by Maxwell as not coming into
consideration in cases of wave propagation on account of
there being no varying electri<U+FB01>cation. This is true as regards

cases of origination we have to do with conduction, or its
equivalent convection, and in most such cases we have

This is no doubt very small at a distance from the oscillator
compared with the transverse component which involves ;,
 and in consequence the motion is transverse at most places.
 ()n the axis of z, however, the transverse component, which
 is proportional to p the distance from the axis, vanishes
 entirely. Hence along the axis there is a beam of purely
 longitudinal vibration, of no doubt small amplitude, but
 nevertheless existing necessarily in order that there may be
 no compressions. This all appears on the face of Hertz’s
 investigation. He carefully studied the forces as represented
 by the above equations, and has plotted them and shown that
 they represent a series of whirl rings thrown off from the
 oscillator and growing gradually thinner and thinner until at
 a distance the rings become nearly plane waves, and the
 opposite sides being always a
 wave-length apart are the two
 Opposite phases of the wave.
 The accompanying diagram
 roughly represents this state of
 affairs. It is evident on the most
 cursory consideration that these
 waves must have a longitudinal
 region. The lines of force in
 any one wave are up to the axis
 along any one spherical surface             (6%) @
 all round; and if there is not to
 be concentration anywhere, i. e.
 if there is no electri<U+FB01>cation of the
 medium, they must turn round
 and be continuous with the return
 phase of the wave. The reason
 why they are so feebly concen
 trated in this return region is
  because it is so enormously extended. If the wave-length be
  small compared with the distance from the origin, the <U+FB02>ows

262              Prof. G. F. FitzGerald on the
up and down along the equator are very close to one another
and consequently the force is concentrated ; while this same
force which is concentrated within a wave-length has the whole
hemisphere to return in, and so the longitudinal concentration
is quite small, and that is what is represented by the small
value of the longitudinal component at any point. The total
quantity of longitudinal component must be, on the whole,
equal to the transverse component at the equator. 4
   11. In the case of several simple oscillators oriented in dif
ferent directions the resultant vector potential can be repre
sented by
               A=U cos (pt—qr) +Vsin pt—q'r"
                            r               1-     .
where U and V are vectors at right angles to one another.
The effect is the same as if two opposite electrons were
moving on opposite sides in an elliptic orbit whose plane was
that of U and V and whose axes were these two lines.
   It is interesting to observe that this case, coupled with a
slow rotation of the ellipse which would be produced by
almost any small disturbing force in its plane, has been
shown by Dr. Stone to be a suf<U+FB01>cient cause for the double
lines in spectra which are so common and which are familiar
to everyone in the double sodium line.
   If the directions of U and V be taken as those of .c and y,
and z be taken perpendicular to the plane of this ellipse, we
may take
     F=Fo cos (pi—qr),        G=Grosin (pg—gr),      H=0,
and we get a sort of corkscrew wave with a longitudinal
component which can be represented by
                      si
                        ;¢{Lcos(pt—qr+l)};
where if; is the angle between 1' and z, and L and lare func
tions of FD, G0, 1', 0, and g.
   This component vanishes along the axis perpendicular to
the plane of the ellipse, and is a maximum in this plane.      If
F0=G0, this simpli<U+FB01>es to

of the earth’s magnetic poles.
    The more complex wave thrown out by the earth with its
two magnetic poles comes under the next head; but it is
waves of this type which must be thrown off by the planets
rotating round the sun, if they are electri<U+FB01>ed, and by their
gravitating property if gravitation be propagated in the same
way as electromagnetic disturbances.

we get as a typical case,
     _                 F = 8a,    G = H = 0.
    Also, remembering that Agu +q9.u=0, we have for the
electric force corresponding to this typical case of a vector

    Now this operation will introduce all sorts of powers of %
 and of q, and I only want to calculate the principal term in
 the longitudinal component. In making this approximation
 we may simplify the calculation by observing that the largest
 terms are. always due to ditferentiations with respect to the
 circular part of u, and that differentiation with respect to
 w, y, z, or 'r lowers a term by one.           We may then leave
 out all differentiation with respect to coordinates outside the
 circular part in terms of the second order, and it is well to
 reduce the di<U+FB01>'erentiations represented by 8 so as to produce

In general it is quite evident that the motion along the radius
 does not vanish.
    On considering the general case, we may observe that if
the ditierentiations involved in 5 are such that for every term
 a+B+y is either even or odd, then there will be a complex
 surface all over which the normal component will vanish t0
 the second order of small quantities; but that if a+,8+'y be
 even in some terms and odd in others, we shall have 6' of the
 form
                   d-=Ucospt—gr+V sinpt—qr,
 and this will only vanish over the curve of intersection of
 U=O and V=O.
     IV. If we now consider the case of diffraction through a
 narrow aperture, it is simpler to take the case of the electric
 displacement of the incident wave as parallel to the edges.
  In this case the electric force is everywhere parallel to the
  edge, and consequently its longitudinal component every
  where vanishes. On the other hand the magnetic force is
  perpendicular to the slit and has a lon itudinal component
  everywhere except in the plane through t e slit perpendicular
  to the wave-face. In considering the more complicated case
  of the electric displacement being perpendicular to the slit, it
  is necessary to take account of the nature of the edges, whether
  they are non-conductors or conductors, whether they are
  crystalline, and so forth, because their electri<U+FB01>cation &0.
  must come into consideration. Similarly, in the case of the
  electric displacement being parallel to the slit the magnetic
   properties of the edges may be important. In this case, too,
  their conductivity in<U+FB02>uences the effective width of the slit, as
  is evidently the case when we are dealing with wire gratings
  in the path of the Hertzian radiations. These questions are
   involved in a complicated way in the whole discussion of the
   e<U+FB01>’ect of a grating on the plane of polarization of the incident

266               Prof. G. F. FitzGerald on the
light. I will take the simple case of a slit bounded by obstacles
which completely stop all action. Although such do not
exist, very close approximations to them do exist.
     If we take the slit as parallel to z, and make this axis the
centre of the slit, and assume the phase the same all over the
slit, we have for the vector potential at a point .ro, yo, 0, due
to any line of the slit at a distance y from its centre,

    Without going into the question as to the best series to ex

dynamics from which it is derived that it must represent a
wave propagation. In fact by integrating by parts it could
 be expanded in the form
               J=Jl cos (pt—qp) +J2 sin (pt—qp).
    In any case we can see that for any constant value of p H
passes through a series of values giving the alternate lights
 and darks on a screen illuminated by a narrow slit.
    Considering now the magnetic force we have

268              Prof. G. F. FitzGerald on the

H is a function of p only. Thus we get
                 m=4H0Jbfg lfecos eel—sin e.

It is evident that this longitudinal displacement is necessary
at the edge of the beam in order to prevent any concentration
of the magnetic force. So far as our it priori knowledge of
pure aather is concerned there seems no suf<U+FB01>cient reason for
not supposing a concentration of magnetic force just as
probable as one of electric force. It would certainly com
plicate our equations very much to suppose both. If both
existed we might have two kinds of pressural waves, one a
wave of electric condensation and rarefaction, and the other
a wave of magnetic condensation and rarefaction.
    It is quite evident from all these cases and from general
considerations that the edge of every beam of light is bordered
by a region where there are longitudinal vibrations taking
  lace.
    V. As a <U+FB01>nal example I take the case of a series of slits
formin an optical grating.
    In t is case the simplest supposition is to assume that the
opacity of the grating varies in a simply periodic manner.
This leads to the same sort of equation for H as in the last
case except that the intensity in each line is proportional to
 (l +cos ly), where 1: 2; and s is the interval between the
lines.
    This leads to the integral

whirls whose length is a; and breadth Wag.            The length
is the same as the width of the lines of the grating, and the
breadth somewhat greater than the length of a wave: 2'3 .      It
is especially obvious in this case that some longitudinal com
ponent exists.             '      ‘
   The existence of the terms depending on e-VmYP—r'r
shows that there may be something analogous to total re
<U+FB01>exion with its extinction wave in the case of a grating in
respect of the spectra that are of a higher order than can be
transmitted by the grating. It would seem, then, that the
whole energy of the wave might not be distributed over the
spectra unless the variation of opacity in each line he
judiciously made.     This may also be connected with the
high absorbing and radiating powers of rough surfaces and
with the action of coherers.
   It is a matter for consideration whether it would not be
worth while manufacturing photographic ratings by causing
the two <U+FB01>rst spectra on each side of t e central image,
together with this central image, or without it, to interfere on
the surface of a sensitive <U+FB01>lm.     We might thereby produce a
grating which had such a distribution of opacity as to repro
duce only these <U+FB01>rst order spectra and have all the light that
passed through concentrated in them. Similarly we might
manufacture a grating which would have the light concen
trated in any desired pair of spectra, though this would
practically come to the same thing as the <U+FB01>rst proposal, with
the lines closer together.   This comes to the same thing as
producin gratings by means of the interference of two beams
of paralle rays of monochromatic light in the manner that
Wiener has shown to be possible.
   In all these cases it is quite evident that a longitudinal
component of either electric or magnetic force is essential
to the existence of waves whose intensity is not constant all
over their surface, and that it is a practically universal con
Comitant of all waves of noncondensational type. That in the
case of short waves which vary slowly from point to point,
the intensity of the longitudinal component at any place will
be in general very small, because the area is very large over
which the motion along the surface at one place has at its dis
posal in which to turn and be continuous with the motion
back along the face of the next wave.     This does not make it
unimportant, however. In a great many cases the total <U+FB02>ow
along the face of a wave must- somewhere <U+FB02>ow longitudinally

  Measurement of large and small Alternating Currents.                 271
so as to be continuous with the <U+FB02>ow back along the other
face of the wave. Unless these longitudinal <U+FB02>ows are taken
into consideration the whole energy' of the wave is not
accounted for.        If the rate of variation of intensit            over;
the surface be comparable with a wave-length, as in tlie case
of <U+FB01>ne gratings, the longitudinal component is a large part of
the phenomenon, and, in fact, represents a large part of the
energy in this case transmitted to the secondary image. This
is all quite obvious in the case of gratings from the ordinary
theory, for the equations given as a solution of this case
represent a series of waves being transmitted in diHerent
 directions from the grating corresponding to the directions
of the secondary spectra.
XXVII; 0n the ilfeasuremcnt of wry large and very small
      Alternating Currents. By ALBERT CAMPBELL, B.A.*
      IR-core transformers, although quite inef<U+FB01>cient for
         ordinary lighting circuits, are yet much more valuable
for testing purposes than most people are aware of. By the
help of such transformers it is possible to extend almost
inde<U+FB01>nitely the ranges of many ordinary measuring instru
 ments. If the secondary of an ironless transformer be kept
in open circuit the secondary volts are accurately proportional
to the primary P.D. if the frequency is constant, and hence
by using an electrostatic voltmeter on the secondary we can
 transform either up or down, and thus measure volta es above
 or below the range of the electrostatic instrument.              f course
the arrangement would have to be calibrated ; this might
 sometimes be done by taking a reading for which both the
 primary and secondary voltages lay within the range of the
 voltmeter used.
    The above way of using an air-core transformer was sug
 gested to me some time ago by Mr. Hugh Erat Harrison, of
 Faraday House.         I hear since from Mr. Mather that it has
 been also used at the Central Technical College ‘I'.                     -
    If We attempt to measure current (in the primary) by
 observing the voltage on an open-circuit secondary, we <U+FB01>nd
 that for a given primary current the readings depend also on
 the frequency.      It therefore occurred to me that the secondary

 the “ True Resistance of the Electric Arc,” by Messrs. FYith and Rodgers.
 Their beautiful application of an air-core transformer to measure a small
 alternating current superimposed on a large direct current might, I think,
 be also employed to separate a large alternating current from a much
 smaller direct current.

In practice this was found to work with perfect success, the
primary current being proportional to the secondary current,
which latter was measured by an ammeter.

temperature.

curve. Then                 5 = MR22+P2Na ' u ' . ~ (1)

its resistance, so that we may neglect the term It} in com
parison with p2N’. In this case we obtain

     i. e. the ratio of the primary current to the secondary current
 is independent of the frequency of alternation and the resistances
 of the coils. We shall see below to what extent this valuable
 result can be realized in practice. It is clear that in the
 above case,s1nce  .     h = w , the secondary current I2 is
                        P—                                        . exactly

     Now suppose the primary RD. to be no longer a pure sine
 function of the time but to follow any periodic curve. The
 curve of primary current can then be decomposed into a
 number of sine curves of various frequencies; each of these
 will produce a secondary of opposite phase, and the ratio of

     Accordingly the total secondary current curve will be of
 the same wave-form as the primary and in opposite phase to
 it, while the ratio of current trarzsforlrlation will be the same as
for a. pure sine-curve alternating current *.
    1‘ In this I have assumed that the Fourier series for the wave-form
 contains no constant term, i. e., that there is'no constant com onent in the
 current. If there is such a component, nothing corresponding to it will
 ap ear in the secondary circuit, and the ratio of current transformation
 wi 1 be by no means the same as if the current were purely alternating.
 In fact an air-core transformer affords a good means of separating out the
purely alternating part of any periodic current.

of about 10 when the balance is the only load on the secondary.
The electrodynamometer is inserted in the primary circuit, and
a primary current of (say) 98'2’amperes is found to produce
(say) 10 amperes in the secondary. If the electrodynamometer
be now taken out of circuit, any. primary current up to 1000
amperes can be measured by reading the balance in the
secondary and multiplying by 9'82.                    -' ,         '

   In an exactly similar way very small alternating currents
may be measured.
   In order to avoid errors due to stray magnetic <U+FB01>elds the
transformer may be wound with double coils laced side by
side with their axes parallel and reversed in t e well-known
manner.
   It might also be well to have the position of one or more
turns of the primary or secondary adjustable with a scale to
show the proper position for each particular frequency.
   For the purposes of calibrating at any frequency a second
primary of a ditferent number of turns from the <U+FB01>rst may be
 wound on the transformer, and the relationship of the two
 primaries may be determined once for all.
   For exam le, if the <U+FB01>rst primary is for 1000 amperes the
 second may ave 100 times the number of turns and be suit
able for 10 amperes. The correction for any particular
frequency or wave-form may then be found experimentally
by using the second primar only.

                    Transformers ‘ with Iron Cores.
   I have recently investigated the case of transformers with
iron cores whose secondary circuits were made highly induc
tive. This was done by short-circuiting the secondary in each
case through a Kelvin 100-ampere balance.
   Two transformers were thus tested—an iron-ring trans
former with very small magnetic leakage, and a small trans
former with open -iron circuit. Y The <U+FB01>rst of these had a
primary of' 764 turns of N0. 16 S.W.G. wire, and over this a
secondary of 48 turns of 7/16 wire. The core of the second
was a short bundle of iron wires, over which were wound the
primary of 38 turns of No. 16 S.W.G.'wire, and over it a
secondary of about 3000 turns of No. 26 S.W.Gr.
   The ring transformer was <U+FB01>rst tested with a Kelvin 10
ampere balance as secondary load, the frequency being 84 ~
per second; The balance had a resistance of about 0'55 ohm
and an inductance of about 00016 henry. The results given
in Table II. show that with this amount of resistance in the
secondary the % is by no means constant.

 some of the actually observed ratios, it will be seen that the
 ratio of current transformation is practically constant.

 these two researches, entirely independent of each other, and
 published at an interval of about ei ht ears, have led to the

where a is an unknown constant, and b and c are constants
easily determined for each period.
    The views of the two authors di<U+FB01>'er somewhat ; whilst
F. Flawitzky, in agreement with L. Meyer *, considers V, Cr,
Mn, Nb, Mo as electronegative or acid-forming, and Cu, Zn,
Ga, Ag, Cd, In as positive, according to Thomsen V, Cr,
Mn, Nb, Mo are electropositive, and Cu, Zn, Ga, Ag, Cd, In
negative ;' From this it follows at once that Mendelee<U+FB01>’s eighth
group of positive metals, Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, Pt,
must be left out of consideration by F. Flawitzky, whilst
J. Thomsen takes these metals into consideration.
    F. Flawitzky remarks further that in his method of repre
sentation N, O, F appear just as well as analogues of P, S,
Cl, As, Se, Br, Sb, Te, [has of         Cr, Mn, Nb, Mo, —, Di,
—, —, Ta, W, which latter analogy is true in fact only in a
remote sense ; according to Thomsen, on the other hand, this
is not the case, since the elements. analogous to V, Cr, Mn,
&c., ought to fall into the period Li—F between B and C,
and in that from Na—Cl between A1 and Si.
    If we might take these views of J. Thomson as valid be
yond dispute, then the question "of the analytical representation
of the periodic system of the elements would be nearly solved.
But if we hold with the views of L. Meyer the matter is
somewhat di<U+FB02>'erent '; the cotan ents can then serve only as a
rough approximation to the truth.             /
    Since I, as a physicist, cannot venture to enter upon details
of chemical views, I permit myself here'lto show only by way
of experiment how the general character of the chemical
elements. as given byL. Meyer may Joe-represented geometri
cally or analytically.                                   ‘       _
    In'the system of Mendeleeit we have, as is well known,
six periods : Li+Cl ; K—Br; Rb—l ;. Cs—? ; PBi ?; ?— ?.
After the electropositive alkaline metals Li, Be 'we have in
the <U+FB01>rst period a gradual passage through B, C to the electros
negative acid-forming N, O, F ; from f a rapid passage to
the positive Na, Mg, and then again after Al, which has some
claim to possess negative properties, a series of more and
 more: decidedly negative elements Si, P, S, 01.
   iFr‘om 01 to the positive K, Ca, Sc we have obviously a leap
 in-the properties of the elements ; then follow negative V, the
 partly negative partly positive Cr, Mn, positive Fe, Co, Ni,

 Cu, Zn, Ga, the “ positivity ” <U+FB01>rst increasing then decreasing
 (a maximum occurring somewhere between Cu and Zn),
then follow elements becoming more and more negative, As,
 Se, Br. Ti and Ge ease the passage through the zero-point.
In the remaining periods we have a complete analo y with
the second; it will be sufficient, therefore, to consiser this
period a little more closely.
   Let us express the general connexion between e and p by
e=F(p), and let us regard e and p as rectangular coordinates
of a point in the plane e, p ; then e=F(p) is the equation of a
periodic curve. As we do not know any numerical values of e,
it is only possible to form some opinion as to the shape of the
curve by our knowledge of the properties of the elements.
If we assume that e: i-oo between Cl and K, Br and Rh,
I and Cs, &c., as F. Flawitzky and J. Thomson assume, then
we conclude that our curve must consist of as many separate
parts as there are periods of elements. But, as we know, the
periods are unequal ; thus, for the elements of the second,
third, and <U+FB01>fth periods the number 48 (atomic-weight units)
<U+FB01>ts, whilst for the caesium-period this number seems to be
1'5 times too great. Hence we see that the separate portions
of the curve cannot be identical ; only in form do they re
semble each other.
   The curve (<U+FB01>g. 1) drawn with two asymptotes, agrees with
the properties of the elements of the second period ; for the
following periods we have exactly similar curves, each con
sisting of six portions, AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, and FG.
   We remark next that the analogous elements are represented
by the points of the corresponding portions of the curve ; thus
upon t 0 portion AB we have the positive elements

the transition elements Ti, Zr, Di (1’), -——, Th (?) corresponding

   From the properties of V, Cr, Mn we may further conclude
that these elements are represented by the points of the
portion of the curve CD ; thus upon the portion CD we have
the negative elements

 whilst the transition elements Ge, Sn, —, Pb fall at the point
 F. In all these periods the portion of the curve BC remains
 free from known elements ; but if we compare the portions of
 the curve AC, EG, which corres 0nd pretty well amongst
 themselves, and if we observe thatt e elements corresponding
 to the portion EF <U+FB01>nd their analogues (if imperfect) in the
 elements corresponding to the portion AB (Ca—Zn, Sr—Cd,
 Sc—Ga,Y—-In, &c.) it is easy to draw the following con
 clusion :—the elements which may possibly exist between
 Ti and V, or Zr and Nb, or Ce and Di ought to appear as
 imperfect analogues of the elements As, Se, Br, Sb, Te, I.
    As to the period Li—Cl, which is much smaller than the
 rest (only 30—32) it is easy to surmise that here also the curve
 possesses the form ABODEFG. In fact, Li, Be, evidently
 correspond to the portion of the curve AB, the transition ele
 ments B, C, correspond to the point B, but the next following
 negative elements N, O, F, possess exactly the character they
  ought to have if N, O, F, are to be represented by the points
 of the portion B0 of the curve ; N, O, F are imperfect ana
 logues of As, Se, Br, &c. Further, we <U+FB01>nd in the period
  Li—Cl a su<U+FB01>icient place between F and Na for a series of
 elements which would fall upon the portion CDE of the
 curve ; these would be analogues'of'V", Cr,‘ Mn, Fe, Co, Ni ;
 the newly discovered element argon. would perhaps correspond
 to the point D.                                           .'    '
    It is well known that sodium is not a good analogue of
  Cu, Ag, Au ; this indicates that sodium falls somewhere about
  the point E, and is thus much nearer to Li, Rb, Us.         We
 have also, exactly as bef0re, the positive metals Mg, Al for
  the portion of the curve EF ; for the point F the transition
  element Si, and <U+FB01>nally the negative elements P, S, 01, corre
  spondin to the portion of the curve FG.
     For t e atomic weights smaller than that of lithium we
  have only hydrogen and helium ; but since H stands nearer

            of the Periodic System of the Elements.           281
to Na than to K, and helium appears to be a suf<U+FB01>ciently in
active clement, we may infer that in the            eriod P—Li we
have only the portion of the curve EFG ; t en H would fall
about the point E, and helium at the point F.
                                 Fig. 1..
    So far we have left the valency of the elements out of sight.
 But, as we know, there exist for each chemical value two
 series of elements analogous amongst themselves; according
 to the usual manner of writing we have, for example, the
 bivalent and trivalent elements arranged according to in
 creasing atomic weight :
               Be,     Ca,    Sr,       Ba,    —,     —— 7

 where the elements of the lower series in each set appear to be
 more metallic in melting-point and other properties than the
 elements of the upper series ; the same holds good also for nega
 tive elements ; thus we have, for example, for the valency 6
              0,     Cr,     Mo,     —,    W,      U,
                 S,      Se,     Te,    —,
although here the relations are of a somewhat complicated
character. At all events it is clear that for each determined
 value a of the valency the properties of the elements alter
periodically with increasing atomic weight, so that e=f(a,p)
 represents for each a a wave-shaped or zigzag curve. The
question now arises whether we really have two different
relationships between e and p in the form e=F(p) and
e=f(a,p) ; the true answer can, of course, only be furnished
by the theory of the elements to be developed. But if we
recall certain problems of theoretical physics, for example, in
heat-conduction, sound, and light, we perceive at once that we
have there also at least two relations of a similar kind ; the
one relationship appears as the integral of a differential
equation, the other as a so-called limiting condition inde
pendent of the <U+FB01>rst ; the two contain an undetermined para
meter, which often appears as a whole positive number (0. 9.,
in the theory of the vibration of strings). Hence it appears
not improbable that the chemical theory of the future will
also lead to two relationships,
                 e=f(a:P)>     and    e=¢(a917)1'     '    '  '  (2)
where a—the valency—a whole positive number plays the
part of an undetermined parameter. It is to be remarked
that so far we always <U+FB01>nd a<8; but in any case it is not
impossible that certain special conditions of the problem might
exclude certain values of a. If we now eliminate a from both
equations we obtain the relationship of the form
                             e=F(p),
that is our curve of <U+FB01>g. 1.
   Now we are in position to take another step.         If the rela
tionships (2) are really independent, then e may be eliminated
from them ; this leads to the relationship of the form
                           \[r(a,p)=0, .   . .   .   .    .  .   (3)
which will give for each a a completely determinate series of
values p, the values of 10 thus obtained represent, then, the
atomic weights of the actually existing elements. It may
well happen that the number of the real and positive roots of
equation      will be <U+FB01>nite for each a, hence also the number

                           Geological Society.                    283
of the actually existing elements will be <U+FB01>nite and perfectly
determinate. The question is ot'tenZasked , “ Why do there exist
only elements of a few de<U+FB01>nite atomic weights?”             From our
point of view the question is similar to the one, “ Why can a
string give only de<U+FB01>nite notes ?”
   From the above considerations it appears to result clearly
that an analytical expression for e=F(p) is more complicated
than is the case for the simple cotangent: an expression of
the form
                 e=a cos WP—HKA + cotan wp—+d\l
                                c                   f /
might suit better.        But since the periods of the elements turn
out to be unequal (O to ?, ? to 36, 36 to 84, 84 to 132,
132 to 168 P, 168 to 216, 216 to 264 ?) the constants b, c, d,f,
A would be themselves independent of p. In such cases
trigonometrical functions offer no special advantage.                It
might perhaps be simpler to take

     2. ‘On the Geographical Evolution of Jamaica.’          By J. W.
 Spencer, M.A., Ph.D., F.G.S.
     The object of the paper is to set forth the physical and geological

284                     Geological Society :—
characteristics of Jamaica which bear upon the problem of its late
high elevation and former connexion with the continent, and to
trace across the neighbouring seas and islands to the mainland the
evidences of the former linking of Jamaica to North and South
America. The <U+FB01>rst part of the paper treats of the growth of the
island, and the following events are described. After the formation
of the mechanical sediments, limestones, and igneous rocks which
constitute the basement of the ‘ White Limestones,’ the latter group
was accumulated in later Eocene and early Miocene times to a
thickness of 2000 feet, and they indicate a subsidence of 3000 feet
below sea-level. Their formation was followed by a Pliocene or
Mic-Pliocene elevation in an epoch of long duration ; the uplift was
inferior to a later (post-Layton) one, but suf<U+FB01>cient for the removal
of Miocene limestone below sea-IeVel. The period was one of
general elevation, general dislocation of strata, and great erosion.
The formation of the Layton marly beds with loams and gravels
which succeeded this period is referred to the end of Pliocene times.
In early Pleistocene times the ‘post-Layton’ elevation occurred,
causing an uplift of from 7000 to 11,000 feet above sea-level. The
strata were not greatly deformed, but the epoch was one of enormous
erosion. A subsidence somewhat resembling that of the Layton
formation followed this erosion in late Pleistocene times, and caused
the accumulation of thc loams and gravels of the Liguauea forma
tion. In modern times minor changes have occurred, causing the
formation of terraces, of channels over banks, of coralline limestone,
and of the modern coral terraces.
   The second part of the paper treats of the continental connexions
of Jamaica. The author gives details of the submerged plateaux
and drowned valleys which are analogous to those still existing
 above sea-level. Tl.ey indicate that the former altitude of the
 West Indian plateau, and some portions of the adjoining continent,
 reached 2% miles. But the <U+FB02>oors of the Mexican Gulf and Honduras
 and the Caribbean Sea formed 10w plains draining into the
 Paci<U+FB01>c Ocean, for at that time the eastern region was high, while
the Mexican area was generally low.
   There was a generally high elevation of the Antillean region during
the great Mic-Pliocene period, with probable continental connexion ;
 at the close of the Pliocene period a general subsidence <U+FB02>ooded the
 coastal plains of the continent, and reduced the West Indies to
 fewer and much smaller islands than those which now exist. But
 the earlier portion of the Pleistocene period was that of the great
 continental elevation, when the lately formed Pliocene topography
 was deeply dissected by rain and rivers, yet there were apparently
several pauses of terrestrial movements at different altitudes, as
indicated by the various base-levels of erosion. At this time
Jamaica and other islands formed a mountainous tableland bordering
 the Mexican and Caribbean plains. Afterwards the later Pliocene
 continent was depressed, so as to <U+FB02>ood most of the coastal plains of
 the continent and reduce the islands to small proportions, and

                 Dundry Hill.- its Upper Portion.                   285
since then the minor oscillations have brought the old continent to
the present conditions. While the east was going down, the
Mexican region and western lands were being raised to form high
tablelands.

Inferior Oolite (G5) in the Maps of the Geological Survey.’ By
S. S. Buckman, Esq., F.G.S., and E. Wilson, Esq., F.G.S.
   The authors give an account of previous geological work relating
to Dundry Hill, especially that which refers to the correlation of its
strata. Then they describe the different exposures on the Hill,
together with the results of various excavations carried out by
quarrymen under their superintendence for the purpose of the
present communication. Besides demonstrating the sequence of
the strata of Dundry Hill, the authors are able to show as special
 results :—
    The rapid easterly attenuation of the Freestone.
    That there is a non-sequence in the Dundry deposits.
    That the chief fossiliferous bed—the [ronshot Oolite—extends
      over a very small area.                          -
    That the absence of this bed is due to removal by almost contem
      poraneous denudation.
    That in the easternmost portion of the Hill this bed and all other
       subjacent beds of what is called ‘Inferior Oolite’ have been
       removed by this denudation, so that only a thin cap of what
       would be called ‘ upper beds of Inferior Oolite ’ rests on a thick
       clay-bed of the age of the Midford Sands.
    That deposits contemporaneous with what are called ‘ Upper
       Lias ’ and ‘ Midford Sands’ in other places are found in some
       thickness at Dundry Hill, attaining as much as 65 feet.
    That the Lias Marlstone—rock is present at Dundry Hill and
       crops out in many places on its <U+FB02>anks, but that this rock—bed is
       also wanting from many parts of the Hill.
    That the Geological Survey have presumably mistaken this
       Marlstone-rock (which is an Iroushot stone) for the Ironshot
       Oolite—the chief fossiliferous bed of the Dundry Inferior
       Oolite, and formerly called Humphriestanum - zone —- beds
       nearly 100 feet apart.
    That, as a consequence, the map of the Geological Survey shows
       round the greater portion of the Hill the boundary—line of the
       base of the Inferior Oolite drawn as much below the Marlstone
       as would have been correct if this rock had actually been the
       well—known Ironshot Oolite.
    That, as a further consequence of this, the map of the Geological
       Survey shows coloured as Inferior Oolite strata which are
       mapped as Lower Lias, Middle Lias, Upper Lias, and Midford
       Sands in other localities ; and that in places the limit for
       Inferior Oolite, according to the Survey, is as much as 600 yards
       beyond that of the authors.

     The following communications were read :—
     l. ‘ On the Pliocene Deposits of Holland, and their Relation to
 the English and Belgian Crags ; with a Suggestion for the Establish
 ment of a new Zone “ Amstelien,” and some Remarks on the
 Geographical Conditions of the Pliocene Epoch in Northern Europe.’
  By F. \V. Harmer, Esq., F.G.S.
    The author draws attention to some papers by Dr. J. Lorie', of
  Utrecht, describing the strata met with in some deep borings in
 Holland, which show that the Newer Pliocene is in that country
 nearly 500 feet thick, and that it has been depressed more than
 1000 feet below its original position. He enquires whether this
 subsidence can be connected with the elevation of the Older
 Pliocene in Belgium and Kent, and how far these earth-movements
 can be traced in East Anglia and in<U+FB02>uenced the deposition of the
 English Crag.
    He gives particulars of the alterations in level which have taken
 place during and since the Crag period in England and on the
 Continent, showing that the two movements of upheaval and
 subsidence have much in common, and especially that they re
 gularly increase in degree to the north and south respectively.
    He gives a map showing the extension of the Diestien deposits of
 Belgium, and their probable connexion with the Lenham Beds, and
 opposes the view of M. Dollfus that the Diestien sea was closed to
the south, though the connexion with it was probably out off by the
 elevation of the southern part of the area. at the close of the Diestien
 epoch, which also caused the Scaldisien sea to retreat to the north.
At the close of the Scaldisien period the sea retired from Belgium
altogether, no beds equivalent to the Upper Crag of England being
known in that country. A similar alteration of the margin of the
Crag sea can be traced in East Anglia.
    He analyses the fauna of the Scaldisien and Poederlien, and shows
its close correspondence with that of the Walton bed and the
difference between it and the Upper Crag, which contains Arctic
shells.
    He describes the beds met with in the Dutch borings, regarded by
Dr. Lorié as Diestien and Sealdisien, and their fauna, at some length.
He concludes that a large part of them are altogether newer than
the latter formation, and are equivalent to the Butley Crag, and
he proposes for them the term ‘ Amstelien.’
   He doubts whether any deposits of similar age to the Norwich
Crag or Chillesford Beds have been met with in the sous-sol of
Holland, which he considers became at that time a land-area ; and

  he gives a section to show wherein his classi<U+FB01>cation of the Dutch
  strata differs from that of Dr. Lorie'.
     The distinction between the divisions adopted by the author
  comes out more clearly from the consideration of the abundant and
 characteristic species only, of each of which he gives lists.
     Although the Amstelien beds are more than 400 feet in
 thickness, they contain a shallow-water fauna, and were deposited
 in a basin which subsided pari passu with their accumulation.
     In the map an attempt is made to show the limits of the sea of
 the ./\nglo-Dutch basin during the various stages of the Pliocene
    och.is suggested that the Chillest'ord Clay was deposited in an
  epIt
 estuary through which the Rhine discharged into the North Sea, its
 presence in the western portion of the Pliocene basin being caused
 by the elevation of Holland after the deposition of the Amsteline
 and a subsidence in Suffolk, which carried the Chillesford Beds over
 an area which was not covered by the Norwich Crag sea.
    No equivalents of the Weybourn Crag or of the Cromer beds
 (Forest Bed series) have been found in the Dutch borings. These
 are to be referred to the Pliocene, as pointed out by Mr. Reid, but
 possibly some of the unf0ssiliferous pebbly gravels of Norfolk and
 Suffolk may be Pleistocene.
    The Weybourn Crag marks a re-invasion of East Anglia by the
 sea; but previously to the deposition of the Cromer beds the southern
 margin of the Pliocene gulf had again retreated to the north, and an
 estuary, similar to that of the Chillesford Clay but situated farther
 east, received the waters of the Rhine, which brought down the
 drifted remains of mammalia and some southern mollusca.
    The newest portion of the Cromer deposits is of an Arctic
 character, and seems to show that no great interval separated the
 Pliocene and the Pleistocene periods.
    A second subsidence of the Dutch area took place in Pleistocene
times; the Glacial and post-Glacial beds being 600 feet thick under
Amsterdam. N0 Till or Contorted Drift similar to the deposits
occurring in East Anglia and in the district north~east of the Zuyder
Zee has been met with in these boriugs. The glaciation of Holland
proceeded from the Baltic and not from Norway, and the Baltic ice
does not seem to have reached the Dutch coast; still less could it
have travelled thence in the direction of East Anglia.
    The two prominent physical features of the Pliocene period were
the Rhine and the basin of the North Sea. The hypothesis of a
permanent basin with shifting shore-lines, in contiguity to which
the shallow-water deposits of the Upper Crag were dep0sited, seems
to agree with all the facts of the case, and to throw light on the
geographical conditions of the Pliocene epoch.

   ON A DAMPING ACTION OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD ON ROTATING
                 INSULATORS.      BY WILLIAM DUANE.
 1T results from the experiments described by the author, that if
       an insulator is made to rotate in a magnetic <U+FB01>eld about an axis
 at right angles to the lines of force, a damping action is exerted
 in opposition and nearly proportional to the angular velocity.
     It the insulator is paramagnetic, such an action might be ex
 plained on the assumption that the magnetic axis of the insulator
 does not coincide with the magnetizing force of the <U+FB01>eld, but is
 displaced in the direction of the rotation. A somewhat more
 general assumption suthcing for the explanation is, that for an
 insulator at rest the induced magnetism does not vanish at once,
 but after an appreciable time. If it vanishes very rapidly we get
 the proportionality observed between the damping force and the
 Velocity.
    For a diamagnetic insulator with true diamagnetic polarity the
 corresponding assumption would give a force accelerating the rota
 tion. Nevertheless, according to several theories of diamagnetism,
 even a diamagnetic body has paramagnetic polarity. According
to such theories the explanation given applies also to diamagnetic
b0dies.—-Wiedemann’s Annalen, No. 7, 1896.
      THE ACTION OF MAGNETISM ON ELECTROMOTlVE FORCE
                       BY ALFRED H. BUCHERER.
    The results of this investigation may be stated thus :—
    1. In neutral ferrous salts, if one of the two equal iron elec
trodes is magnetized, there is no electromotive force produced
which amounts to 000001 volt. The currents observed by Gross
and others could not be referred to a change of the electrochemical
potential of the magnetized iron.
    2. The forces produced by magnetizing a circuit which contains
magnetic substances as electrodes are to be ascribed to variations
of concentration which the magnetized electrode produces when
dissolved.
    3. In the case of ferric salts, the direction of the currents pro
duced by magnetization depends almost exclusively on their degree
of concentration at the two electrodes.
    4. If only ferrous salts are present, the direction of the currents
produced by magnetization depends on the total concentration of
the iron salts.
   5. The currents designated by Rowland as primary ones are
agitation-currents.—Wiedemann’s Annalen, No. 7, 1896.

XXXI. Osmotic Pressure. By J. H. POY.NTING,Sc.D., FR.S.,
      Professor of Physics, Mason College, Birmingharn*.
QINCE the osmotic pressure of a solution is of the same
k      order as the “gas pressure ” of the dissolved substance
at the same density, we are naturally tempted to think of it
as an extra pressure produced by the motion of the dissolved
molecules. But if we start from this supposition we soon <U+FB01>nd
ourselves surrounded by the dif<U+FB01>culties of the dissociation
hypothesis. These are so great that it appears worth while
to examine our ideas of liquid structure in the hope that they
will suggest to us some hypothesis which will free us from
the necessity of assuming dissociation.                        »
   I shall try to show in this paper that osmotic pressure may
be accounted for as an indirect result arising, not from disso
ciation but from its very opposite, the greater complexity of
the molecules in the solution, due to some kind of combination
between salt and solvent.
   The facts of liquid viscosity, diffusion, and surface conver~
sion to vapour may apparently be represented by imagining
a liquid to be, in the main, a solid structure, inasmuch as the
molecules cohere and resist strain of any kind.         But the
molecules have so much energy, potential or kinetic or both,
that they are not very far from instability.       In a mass of
connected molecules irregularly distributed and irregularly
vibrating, concentrations of energy must occur, and at the

points of concentration individual molecules may receive so
much energy that they are able to do the work needed to free
them from their immediate surroundings. Such molecules
will travel off, and as they lose their energy will form new
connexions with new surroundings. Thus the solid structure
is continually breaking down and renewing itself. If we
impose a shear strain on the structure, the strain will of
course disappear with the structure in which it is produced.
But the breaking down will always lag slightly behind the
imposition of the shear, and the still surviving shear strain
will be accompanied by a resistance the same in kind as the
resistance to shear in a solid, though in a liquid it is only
recognized as viscosity. This is the view <U+FB01>rst set forth by
Poisson and developed by Maxwell, and it is to be noted that
it gives an explanation of liquid viscosity entirely different
from the diffusion explanation which so satisfactorily accounts
for gaseous viscosity.
    We may obtain an expression for the coef<U+FB01>cient of viscosity
by the following method, which is perhaps rather simpler
than that of Maxwell. We must assume that a certain frac
tion, say 7t, of the molecules of the liquid get free per second,
and that this fraction remains practically the same when the
liquid is sheared. Hence if s is the strain still existing at any
instant, it is breaking down at the rate he per second. If the
liquid is moving steadily in parallel planes perpendicular 'to
an axis along which a: is measured, and if the velocity is v at
a distance .r from the reference plane,         is the rate at which
shear is being imposed on the liquid. But since the steady
state is reached the rate of imposition equals the rate of decay,

  the “displacement” or “induction ” in an electrolyte, and if
  ,u, is the factor of decay per second, [ID is the quantity dis
 appearing per second and dissipating its energy as heat. This
  may be equated in the steady state to the new “displace

      Returning to equation (3), we see that it' n is constant, n
 varies inversely as 7t. For instance, when the temperature
 rises the molecules have more energy, the breaking down of
 structure is more frequent, and 7t is greater. Probably n is
 not very much altered, though it doubtless tends to decrease.
 Hence 17 should decrease, and this is in accordance with
 observation. On the other hand, when a salt is dissolved in
 a liquid, if, as we are going to suppose, it makes the mole
 cules on the average less energetic by partially combining
 the more energetic solvent molecules with the less energetic
 salt molecules, they are on the average rather further from
 instability, 7t is less and 1) is greater. This again agrees with
 observation.
     At the same time the speci<U+FB01>c electric resistance p is dimi
nished. This would require that in (6) either [1. or K, or
both, should be increased, probably both ; and this brings out
a point which must be noted, that the factor of decay 7L in (3)
is not likely to be the same as ,u. in (6) ; for while one relates
rather to the molecules and their relative positions, the other
most probably relates to the atoms and their positions in the
molecules.
     Maxwell (Proc. Roy. Soc. cxlviii. 1873) gave an account
of some experiments which he made to test this view of liquid
viscosity by shearing a liquid and looking out for double
refraction. He could only observe it in the case of Canada
balsa-m, in which it had already been found by Mach, and
here the “rate of relaxation ” was so greatvthat he could not

observe any double refraction after the shearing motion ceased.
Kundt (Ann. Phys. Chem. xiii. 1881) made a series of expe—
riments and found double refraction in many sheared liquids,
notably in olive-oil, but never in a pure liquid with a de<U+FB01>nite
chemical constitution. The more complex the molecules
apparently the less is 7t, and the greater is the shear strain
still remaining at any instant of the motion. But in liquids
such as water or glycerine, the decay is so rapid that no
optically appreciable amount remains.
    Still it is very possible that olive-oil is only an extreme
case, and that water and other apparently inactive liquids
would show the e<U+FB02>'ect if we could suf<U+FB01>ciently increase the
shear, and I think Kundt’s results may be claimed as sup
porting the hypothesis. Possibly, too, the observation of
Quincke, that double refraction is observed in a liquid close
to a very hot wire, gives further support. The unequal
heating may perhaps be regarded as producing shear strains
in the solid structure which are renewed by the supply of
heat as fast as they break down.
    In the case of breaking down of structure near the surface
of'a liquid the moving molecules may succeed in escaping
altogether, and may <U+FB02>y of? as gas molecules if they are
directed upwards and have enough energy. Of course there
may be many molecules able to move about and yet not able
to evaporate ; for though they may be able to travel when in
the body of the liquid, they may not have energy enough to
get clear away from their neighbours when these are all on
one side and all pull in one direction as they do at the surface.
In the case of practically non-evaporating liquids, such as
mercury at ordinary temperatures, we must suppose that only
a very minute fraction are thus able to do the Work needed
to overcome the large cohesion of their neighbours.
   It will be convenient to use the term “mobility” to de
scribe the number of “ free” or “mobilised ” molecules
crossing a square centimetre per second in a liquid, where by
“ free” or “mobilised ” we mean those which are changing
their surroundings and forming new connexions. Evidently
we may extend the term to a gas, remembering that then all
the molecules are mobilised, and that the mobility is propor
tional to the pressure.
   When a square centimetre is taken on the surface of a
liquid, the mobility upwards is the rate of evaporation, and
the mobility of the vapour downwards is the rate of conden
sation.    When the two mobilities are equal the pressure of
the vapour is the vapour-tension.
   The mobility in the body of the liquid is probably far

           Prof. J. H. Poynting on Osmotic Pressure.        293
 greater than that at the surface for the reason already given;
viz. that in the one case the neighbouring molecules entirely
surround one which tends to get free, while at the surface they
are all on one side and so tend to pull back and retain a mo
lecule which may be inclined to move away.         If, however,
the internal mobility at a given temperature is altered, say
by the pressure, or by the presence of some substance in
 solution, the surface mobility will be altered too. We shall
assume that it is altered in the same ratio as the internal
mobility, an assumption which appears to be justi<U+FB01>ed by the
account which it will enable us to give of the effect of pres
sure and of solution.
   Let us now apply this idea to the familiar case of rise in a
capillary tube standing in a liquid having only its own vapour
above it. Or let us take the more general case of a liquid in
a vessel with tubes which are wet rising above the <U+FB02>at sur
face, and with tubes which are not wet coming out of the side
                              Fig. 1.

 theorem shows that there is ultimately a balance between
 evaporation and condensation at each surface, or that the
 vapour-tension is less at the surfaces a and 1) than the normal
 amount existing at 0, while at d, e, and f it is greater. In
 other words, the surface mobility gradually increases as we
 go downwards. This is usually connected with the curvature
 of the liquid surface, but, as I have tried to show in a former
 paper (Proc. Phys. Soc. vol. iv. p. 271, Phil. Mag. July 1881),
 it should rather be connected with the increased pressure of
 the liquid just under the surface as we descend ; the curva
 ture of the surface is a non-essential accompaniment.
    Taking the pressure of the vapour at the <U+FB02>at surface 0 in
 <U+FB01>g. 1 as w, and the densities of liquid and vapour as p and a
 respectively, then at a level h below or above 0 the hydro
 static pressure is greater or less than at e by gplz, =P say,

 we descend is proportional to the increase in hydrostatic pres
 sure just under that surface. This is accounted for if we
 suppose that the increased hydrostatic pressure results in
 increased mobility, and therefore increased evaporation from
the surface. The vapour-pressure increases from w to
                      w+ P—U =w(l+ ET) ;

or the coef<U+FB01>cient of increase of its mobility is g— pcr unit of
hydrostatic pressure, and this is the coef<U+FB01>cient we must
assume for the increase of internal liquid mobility to account
for the facts on this theory.
    We have no direct evidence that increase of pressure does
thus increase liquid mobility. The justi<U+FB01>cation is to be
sought in such explanations of known facts as that just
given*.
    It is perhaps worth noting that we obtain the true state of
affairs externally if we picture the liquid in <U+FB01>g. 1 as a kind
   * Liquid viscosity should decrease if mobility increases, and should
therefore, in our view, decrease with increase of pressure were mobility
alone concerned. But rigidity also comes in, and we must ascribe to this
complication the result that, in water, pressure lessens the viscosity
while in turpentine it increases it (Cohen, Wied. Ann. No.4,1892).
But it would appear fair to seek support for the supposition of increased
mobility in the “<U+FB02>owing” of solids under great stresses, as in the stamp
ing and wiredrawing of metal, when the molecules undoubtedlv change
their positions with very greatly increased rapidity 'when under great
strain.                                    .

of open framework, or as a spongy structure through which
the molecules of vapour pass freely so that they are at the
same pressure within and without the liquid at the same level.
Butthis conception must be used only to give us the net
result, and not as representing the actual condition.
   If, in addition to the vapour, any soluble gas is present in
the vessel, it too will exist both inside and out in quantities
increasing as we descend, and it must he in equilibrium at all
levels. So that if near the <U+FB02>at surface the density of the gas
in solution is n times the density at the same level outside,
the same ratio will hold at all depths. Again the net
external result is the same as if we picture to ourselves a
spongy structure through which the gas passes freely.
   As a further illustration of the change of mobility with
pressure, we may take the alteration of the melting-point
which I have discussed in the paper mentioned above. Thus,
in the case of water, water and ice are in equilibrium under
1 atmo. at 0°, and therefore have equal vapour-tensions and
equal surface mobilities. If, however, we put on pressure,
the coef<U+FB01>cients of increase of mobility are, as we have just

is increased less than the ice mobility, and so at the surface
of contact the ice sends more molecules to the water than it
receives in return, that is to say, it melts. Below 0° the
vapour-pressures and mobilities at atmospheric pressure are
di<U+FB02>'erent, the mobility of water being greater than that of ice.
But if we put on suf<U+FB01>cient pressure we may once more equa

     Now let us consider the case of a dilute solution of a non
  evaporating salt. “7e know by direct observation that the
  vapour-tension is reduced by the presence of the salt, and we
  must suppose, on the hypothesis here advocated, that this
  reduction is due to a decrease in the mobility of the liquid.
  Let us follow out this idea by imagining that we have in the
  same chamber maintained at a constant temperature two deep
  vessels, one containing the pure solvent the other a dilute
  solution. In this chamber we shall suppose that above the
  liquids there is only the vapour of the solvent. To begin
  with, we may suppose that each vessel is half full and at the
  same level. Then the pure solvent will distill over into the
  solution, and will continue to do so until the difference in
  level in the two vessels is such that each surface is in equili~
  brinm with the vapour at its level. The hydrostatic pressure
  in the solution at the level of the surface of the pure solvent
  will then be the osmotic pressure.        If we imagine a number
- of non-wettable tubes inserted, as in <U+FB01>g. 1, in the sides of the
  two vessels at various depths and turned upwards, the diame—
  ters being so adjusted that the liquid does not <U+FB02>ow out of any
  of them, then in any pair at the same level we realize Fitz
  gerald’s semi-permeable membrane ; and at each level the
  two liquids must have equal vapour-tensions, which implies
  that their mobilities are equal at each level. This also comes
  out from our equations. Let a, Q’ be the <U+FB02>at surface vapour
  tensions of solvent and solution, p the density of the liquid—
  practically the same for each—and H the <U+FB01>nal difference in

 whence M” =M, or at the level of the solvent surface the
 mobilities are equal. This equality will be maintained if we
 descend equal distances in the two liquids below that level.
 So that if we now connect the two vessels at any level by a
 horizontal tube with a semipermeable membrane in it, the
 solvent mobilities on the two sides of the membrane are equal,
 and therefore the solvent diffuses through at equal rates in
 the two directions.
    We may then explain in the following general terms the
 rise which occurs when we place a semipermeable vessel con
 taining a solution into a solvent. The solvent molecules are
 entering the membrane on both sides, but the mobility or
 number set free per second from the pure solvent is greater
 than the number set free from the solution. The membrane
 goes on absorbing the solvent from each side till it becomes
 saturated, i. e. holds so much that it returns as many mole
 cules as it receives.    It is receiving more from the pure
solvent side, and therefore when saturated for that side it is
 supersaturated for the other. Consequently more molecules
are sent into the solution than are received from it, and the
 solution grows until the growing pressure so much increases
the mobility that it is equal on both sides of the membrane.
    If the solution and solvent are in two vessels separated by
an inde<U+FB01>nitely produced vertical and semipermeable membrane,
it is evident that ultimately the two will be in equilibrium at
every level, whether in liquid or vapour.
    We may apply the same idea to the change of melting
point in a solution. In the solution the solid mobility is
unchanged, but that of the solution is lowered by the fraction
11;“, where P is the osmotic pressure; and to <U+FB01>nd the new
melting-point, we must <U+FB01>nd the temperature d9 below the
normal melting-point at which this is equal to the difference
between the liquid and solid mobilities.

     It now remains to see if we can give any reasonable
  account of the decrease in mobility in a liquid when a salt is
  present in solution. If the molecules of salt were simply
  mixed with those of the solvent, or if they combined to form
  stable non-evaporating compounds with the solvent, which
  compounds were simply mixed, then the mixture should have
  the same vapour-tension as the pure solvent. For we might
  regard the salt or compound molecules at the surface as equally
  reducing the effective evaporating and the effective condensing
  area, somewhat as aperforated plate or gauze laid on the sur
  face would do. But the salt probably combines with the
  solvent to form unstable molecules which continually inter
  change constituents, so that when near the surface they may
  serve equally with those of the pure solvent to entangle the
  molecules of vapour coming downwards, these descending
  vapour molecules taking the place of molecules attached to
  the salt. Probably, however, they are less energetic than the
  pure solvent molecules and do not contribute so much to
  evaporation. We shall make the supposition that they do not
  contribute at all.
     Let then each of the salt molecules combine on the average
  with a of the solvent molecules, and in such a way that it
  prevents those a molecules from evaporating while the com
  pound molecules formed will entangle returning molecules,
  each of the a being replaceable by a vapour molecule. Then
  we may regard the solution as solvent, having a number of
  molecules simply mixed up and inactive as ~ regards evapora
  tion but active in effecting condensation.
     If N is the numberof gramme molecules of solvent per
  litre, and n the number of gramme molecules of salt added,
  the number of solvent molecules left is N —an. Were the 1:.
  compound molecules quite inactive both as regards evaporation
' and condensation the mobilities outwards and inwards would

be altered in the same ratio and the vapour-tension would
be unaltered. But we are supposing that they are inactive
for evaporation only and that their a molecules of combined
solvent are still active for condensation. So that in the
solution there are only N—an active for evaporation, while
there are still N active for condensation. Hence the vapour

such as change in density in the solution, have led to such
complicated results that much more extrava ant suppositions
had to be made to reconcile these results wit experiments. I
therefore leave the hypothesis in this crude form, in which it
will at least serve to show that it is not necessary to ascribe
osmotic pressure to dissociation but rather to association or
some kind of combination of salt and solvent.
            XXXII. Admittance and Impedance Loci.
                    By FREDERICK BEDELL“.
 II‘HE quantities chie<U+FB02>y considered in the discussion of
        alternating currents are electromotive forces and cur
rents, the values of these being determined for different con
ditions. Electromotive forces and currents are commonly
 represented by vector diagrams; and the change in these
 diagrams, as some one quantity is varied, is shown by the
 loci of the vectors which are altered thereby. What may be
termed electromotive force and current loci are thus deter
 mined. The numerical values for which these are constructed
necessarily depend upon some condition involving an assumed

value either of the current or of the electromotive force : thus
we may assume a certain current to be constant (as the pri
mary current of a transformer), and construct an electromotive
force diagram with loci showing the changes in the various
electromotive forces as some part of the circuit is changed ;
or we may assume the impressed electromotive force constant,
and ascertain current loci for the same variation. Let us
limit ourselves to the transformer. In the <U+FB01>rst case above it
will be found that the constant assumed primary current II is
a factor in the value of every line representing the compo
nents of the primary electromotive force El. By factoring
out II we have an impedance diagram similar to the electro
motive-force diagram, and without any assumption as to the
value of the current or electromotive force. Similarly each
line in a current diagram, constructed for a constant impressed
electromotive force E1, represents a current which is a mul
tiple of an admittance (the reciprocal of an impedance) and
the factor E1. By factoring out El an admittance diagram
is consequently obtained, similar to the current diagram but
with no assumption as to the current or electromotive force.
Admittance and impedance diagrams accordingly correspond
to current and electromotive-force diagrams respectively,
differing from them only by a factor.
   Impedance and admittance loci, or electromotive force and
current loci, for the primary of a transformer will in general
be arcs of circles for changes in any one of the constants of
the primary or the secondary circuit.
   Some interestin relations ariSe from the reciprocal nature
of admittance an      impedance.    Let us note the following
relations between reciprocal vectors :—
   If any vector has an arc of a circle for its locus, a vector
proportional to its reciprocal will have an arc of a circle for
a locus. In <U+FB01>g. 1 let p1 be any vector from the origin 0,
having its locus as shown upon the arc of a. circle. The
vector p2, drawn in the direction of pi and proportional to its
reciprocal, will have its locus upon an arc of a circle, which
may be shown as follows. Let p1 and pl’ represent the vector
in any two positions, OA and OA’. The intercepts 0a and
Oa’ will represent the reciprocal vectors p2 and p,’ ; for in the
similar triangles OA’a and OAa’,
                        p1:p1’::p2’:p2.
Hence
                  pl'p2’=plp,= a constant.
   The value of this constant product of p1 and p2 is O—G2.

   By a suitable selection of scale, the loci of PI and its reci
procal p2 may be represented as arcs of the same circle, as in

         2. In the latter case,
                   p1p2=OG1 . 0G2 = a constant.       \‘
       As the origin 0 approaches the circle which represents the
  locus of p,, the centre of the reciprocal circle becomes more
  distant and its radius becomes greater. When the origin 0
 is a point in the circumference of the <U+FB01>rst circle, the centre
  of the reciprocal circle is at an in<U+FB01>nite distance ; that is, the
  reciprocal locus is a straight line.
       Let us apply these principles to the transformer diagrams.
 The locus of the primary impedance, as some particular quan
 tity is varied, is a portion of a circle. For example, this may
  be shown to be the case when the secondary resistance is
 varied. Since the admittance of the primary is the reciprocal
 of its impedance, the admittance may be represented by the
 vector p, in the above construction, if the impedance is repre
  sented by p,. These loci may be drawn to scale for actual
  values. In a constant current transformer the primary elec
  tromotive force varies directly as the primary impedance.
  In a constant potential transformer the primary current varies
  directly as the primary admittance. But the admittance is
  the reciprocal of the impedance ; hence if we have an arc of a
  circle for the locus of the primary electromotive force when
  the primary current is maintained constant, we may employ
  the above method to obtain the arc of a circle which will be
  the locus for the primary current when the transformer is
  supplied with a constant electromotive force. The converse
  operation may likewise be performed.
      In <U+FB01>g. 3 let the circle 0, represent the locus of the primary
 electromotive force E1 during some particular change of con
‘dition, the primary current meanwhile being maintained
 constant and in the direction 0A. The difference in phase
 between the current and electromotive force is the angle ¢1.
 The locus of the primary current under the same change of
 conditions, if the primary electromotive force is maintained
 constant, is the dotted circle 02, which is reciprocal to 01.
 If the constant electromotive force is drawn in the direction
 0A, the locus of the primary current is the circle 02/, drawn
 so that the angles AOG, and AOCz’ are equal.
      An application of the method of reciprocal vectors is shown
 in <U+FB01>g. 4. Positive rotation is counter-clockwise. The semi
 circle JKN represents the locus of the primary electromotive
 force of a transformer, when the primary current is constant

   The electromotive force has the position OJ on open circuit
and ON on short circuit. OH is the power electromotive
force on open circuit, and includes the effects of primary
resistance and the losses due to hysteresis and eddy currents;
HJ is the electromotive force to overcome the primary self
induction. These are in the direction of the primary current,
and at right angles to it, respectively. A line from J to K,
at right angles to the secondary current, would show the
reaction of the secondary upon' the primary. It is to be
noted that the line NH represents the effects due to magnetic
leakage.    It is desired to <U+FB01>nd the locus for the primary cur—
rent when the primary electromotive force has a constant
value, and is drawn in the direction 0A. The angle of lag 01,
between the primary electromotive force and current on open
circuit, is JO H. Accordingly, with a constant electromotive
force in the direction 0A, the open circuit current 10 is laid
o<U+FB02>' lagging behind the electromotive force at an angle of
AOjl=91=JOH. The open circuit current IO may be laid
off to any convenient scale. To construct the locus for the
primary current proceed as followsz—Lay off the line 00,
so that the angles AOC1 and AOC2 are equal. The point ()2
is located so that 0C2 : 0C1 : : Oj’:         The primary current
locus is then drawn as the arc of a circle with 02 as a centre,
passing through j’.
   The limits of the primary electromotive force locus are the
points J and N. The corresponding limits of the primary
current locus are the points j’ and n’.      It will be noted that
these points correspond to the pointsj and n on the circle 01,
which are reciprocal to the points J and N.
   In the absence of magnetic leakage the points N and H
coincide. The point n’ would then lie in the line 0A. The
deviation of the primary current locus from the line 0A is
produced by magnetic leakage.
   An experimental curve showing the primary current locus
for a constant potential transformer, as affected by magnetic
leakage, is shown in <U+FB01>g. 5.
   The reciprocal relation between admittance and impedance
vectors gives a simple method for determining the conditions
for consonance and resonance in transformer circuits *.
    Figure 6 is given as a particular instance in illustration of
the statement given above that loci produced by the variation
of any one constant are usually arcs of circles. The primary
loci are always arcs of circles. The diagram shows the
changes due to a variation in the secondary self-induction.

   In an actual transformer the magnetic leakage is not con
stant, but varies with the load.        The locus represented by the
dotted curve JK”N is for such a case in which the magnetic
leakage is zero on open circuit and increases to the maximum
at short circuit.       Where the magnetic leakage is variable, it
is determined for any point as K” by the ratio of JK” to JKO.
Thus let us suppose that the back electromotive force J K”,
actually induced in the primary by the secondary current 12,
is eighty-one volts ; and that J K0, which would be the back
electromotive force in the absence of magnetic leakage, is
100 volts. We then have the equation

XXXIII. Electric Images in the Field ofa Hittmf’s (Crwkes’)
            Tube. By N. OUMOFF and A. SAnoi'LorFi.
THE in<U+FB02>uence exercised by a Hittorfs tube on electri<U+FB01>ed
         bodies shows that the electric <U+FB01>eld created in the interior
of the tube extends also to the exterior. Evidently the
objects brought into this <U+FB01>eld, whether to explore its elec
trical properties or, as in the experiments of Lenard and
Rontgen, to produce or to receive shadows acquire a new
electrical condition and by their presence modify the primi
tive <U+FB01>eld. It is impossible to estimate a priori this modi<U+FB01>
cation and the part it- plays in the production of the pheno
mena observed. In investigating these questions we <U+FB01>nally
adopted an experimental method intended to furnish us with
the means of forming a general idea of the electrical pro
perties of the <U+FB01>eld of a Hittorf’s tube and the modi<U+FB01>cations
 which it undergoes.

     Images in the Field of a Ifittorf’s (Crookes’) Tube.  309
   With this end in view we replace the photographic plate
or the <U+FB02>uorescent screen by a plate of ebonite. The electric
<U+FB01>eld is maintained for two or three minutes, after which the
action of the tube is arrested and the ebonite plate withdrawn
from its position. By a quick movement the objects on the
plate are thrown to the ground and we proceed to develop the
images by sprinkling over the plate a mixture of sulphur and
minium. As is well known, the sulphur adheres to those
portions which are positively, the minium to those which are
negatively electri<U+FB01>ed. Thus the colour of the spots shows
the electric condition of the shadows, and the comparison of
their con<U+FB01>guration with that of the objects indicates the
modi<U+FB01>cations introduced in the mode of action of' the <U+FB01>eld.
   The tube used in our experiments had the shape of a pear
with <U+FB02>attened base (<U+FB01>g. 1) ; k is the kathode, a the anode.
                             Fig. 1.

In the central part of the base there was a <U+FB02>uorescent spot
about a centimetre in diameter ; and at some distance there
was a less intense <U+FB02>uorescent zone concentric with the spot.
At a few centimetres below the tube is placed a plate or
screen of ebonite b, which rests ordinarily on the rim of' a
glass vessel 13 cm. in diameter and 21 cm. in depth. The
manner of supporting the plate is quite immaterial provided
that the support is clear of the central portion of the plate.
Thus the screen, or at any rate its central portion, is sur
rounded by air on both sides. The objects are placed either
above or below the plate; in the latter case they are held
by projecting arms which are bent over the rim of the vessel.
The images were developed on both faces of the screen ; we
have also employed two screens placed one on the other and
developed the images on the four faces of the screens.

310           MM. Oumotl' and Salno'ilott' on Electric
    We proceed to the description of the experiments :—
    (1) N0 object being interposed between the tube and the
screen we obtain on the two faces of the latter an intensely
red spot corresponding to the <U+FB02>uorescent spot in the tube;
the remainder of the plate acquires a reddish tint. The same
effect is obtained on the four faces of two ebonite plates placed
one on the other and making good contact. Thus the <U+FB02>uo
rescent spot of the HittorFs tube sets up a negative electri<U+FB01>
cation on the faces of dielectrics in its neighbourhood, whether
these faces are turned towards the tube or away from it. On
the portions of juxtaposed plates which are not in intimate
contact we <U+FB01>nd yellow spots and red ones opposite to each
 other. The spot formed on the front face of the plate is
 sharply de<U+FB01>ned; for this reason we must conclude that the
action of the tube is propagated by trajectories emanatmg
from its surface.
     (2) On covering the ebonite plate by a sheet of zinc the
plate appears red on both sides. On putting the same sheet
below the plate and in contact with it the face of the plate
turned towards the zinc acquires a yellow hue, the opposite
face an inde<U+FB01>nite tint. We may say in short, that every body
introduced into the <U+FB01>eld, if in perfect contact with a dielec
 tric, does not change the negative electri<U+FB01>cation of the latter
produced by the <U+FB01>eld, provided the body is between the
tube and the dielectric; when the dielectric is between the
tube and the body, the negative action of the <U+FB01>eld is replaced
by a positive action. This conclusion is con<U+FB01>rmed by the
following experiments :—
    (3) Figures cut out of metal (lead, zinc, aluminium), glass,
and paper in perfect contact with the screen give, when they
are placed above it, red images, and when they are beneath,
yellow images. The images are bordered by a neutral band ;
the rest of the screen is red.
    On placing a glass plate beneath the plate of ebonite on
which the cuttings are arranged the red ground which sur
rounds the images of the objects changes to an intense yellow
<U+FB01>eld ; as to the images, their colour appears to tend to black.
Occasionally yellow tufts are seen which come from points
corresponding to projecting points of the objects. The rim
of the glass vessel which supports the ebonite plate always
gives a circle of an intense yellow except at the points which
are not in contact with the ebonite; to these points corre
spond red arcs.
    (4) A rectangle cut from a sheet of lead and having a.
rectangular opening in the middle was placed above the plate
and in contact with it.    The image of the metallic portion is

       Images in the Field of a Hittorf’s (Crookes’) Tube.   311
  red, as usual, the image of' the opening is black. On raising
  this object to a height of one centimetre above the screen by
  a metal stalk cemented by wax to a glass disk (<U+FB01>g. 2), we
  obtain the image <U+FB01>g. 3.      The white parts are the neutral
                                     Fig. 3.
 portions ; they are black in the image and correspond to the
 solid parts of the object which were not in contact with the
 screen. The image of the disk, which was in contact with
 the screen, is red, which is indicated in the <U+FB01>gure by parallel
 lines. The image of the opening is markedly larger than the
 opening itself and of an intense yellow colour. The rest of
 the plate is also yellow; this colour is represented in the
 <U+FB01>gure by a network of lines crossing one another at right
 angles. The rectilinear margins of the object show them
 selves in the image as curved lines: in the image of the
 exterior rectangle these curves turn their convexity inwards ;
 while in the image of the interior rectangle the curves de
 scribed have their convexity directed outwards. The fact
 that the image of the opening is markedly larger than the
 opening itself shows that we could construct the image by
 imagining curvilinear rays which, on passing the aperture,
 converged towards certain points of the tube.
    (5) A rectangle cut from a sheet of lead with a rectangular
opening in the middle was placed beneath the ebonite plate
and in contact with it. The image of the solid parts is intense
yellow; the image of the opening is black; the rectilinear
margins of the opening are replaced by curves which are
convex inwards. The same object (<U+FB01>g. 4) was lowered one
centimetre beneath the screen. The image is represented by
<U+FB01>g. 5. The solid parts of the object (white in the <U+FB01>gure)
are black in the image.      The image of the opening is red,
smaller than the opening, and bounded by four curves which
turn their convex sides to the centre of the <U+FB01>gure.        We

312          MM. Oumo<U+FB02>' and Samoilo<U+FB02>“ on Electric
should therefore obtain this by constructing curvilinear rays
emerging from certain points of the tube in the direction of
                   Fig. 4.       Fig. 5.
the opening. Thus we see generally that transporting the
object from one side of the screen to the other results in the
interversion of the phenomenon.
   We may mention that a metallic strip with parallel mar
gins, curved into a circular arc and <U+FB01>xed by its summit on
the screen (<U+FB01>g. 6), gives a black shadow (<U+FB01>g. 7) enlarged at
its two ends and surrounded by a reddish <U+FB01>eld.
           Fig. 6.
   (b') Fig. 8 shows the image of a lead band, curved and
<U+FB01>xed vertically on the screen by one of its margins. Fig. 9
                                          Fig. 9.
shows the change which the image undergoes when a glass
plate is placed beneath the ebonitc screen.
   (7) Lead strips of equal length but different widths were
bent into circular cylinders of the same diameter (about 2 cm.) .
On placing one of these cylinders vertically on the ebonitc
screen its base is represented by a red circle ; in the interior
there is a thin black band (neutral) which surrounds a yellow
spot. On placing a glass plate beneath the ebonite the central
yellow spot diminishes markedly and the neutral bands in the
interior, as well as at the exterior, increase in width.     The

     Images in the Field of a Hittorf’s ( Crookes’) Tube.   3135
dimensions of the central spot diminish when the height of
the cylinder is increased.   Comparing this phenomenon with
that described in (4) we see that the yellow spot should be
regarded as the image of an aperture. On covering the
cylinder by a metal disk the central yellow spot disappears
and we obtain red traces in the central part of the image.
The diminution experienced by the spot when a glass plate
is brought under the ebonite screen would apparently lead us
to seek the aperture towards which the rays proceeding from
certain points in the tube converge in the optical image of
the circular section of the cylinder nearest to the tube and
obtained by regarding the glass as a mirror.
   The central spot of the image of a cylinder placed beneath
the ebonite plate is red ; its size remains the same whatever
he the height of the cylinder provided that its diameter
remains the same. The phenomena are not altered if the
lead cylinders are replaced by glass ones.
   The following additional experiments correspond to those
described above :—on placing on the ebonite brass weights of
500 grams, 200 grams, and 5 decigr., it is only the last,
which represents a thin piece of metal, that gives a red image;
the <U+FB01>rst two do not give distinct images. In the image of a
coin placed above the screen we <U+FB01>nd red portions correspond
ing to the points which were in contact with the screen, and
black and yellowish portions corresponding to the depressions
of the coin. If this last is placed beneath the ebonite, the red
colour is replaced by yellow. We obtain in this manner the
 design on the faces of the coin.
   In all these experiments the duration of the action of the
Hittorf’s tube has an influence on the clearness and intensity
of the image ; prolonged action imparts a red or yellow colo
ration (according to the circumstances) to the neutral bands.
    By obtaining the images of objects by our method and by
 the photographic method we have proved that the yellow
 colour corresponds to the parts of the <U+FB01>gure directly attacked
 by the x-rays; the red colour to the ima es of the objects,
 and the neutral bands to the shadows w ich surround, for
 example, the images of the cylinders.
   Preliminary experiments have shown us that analogous
 phenomena are obtained on replacing the Hittorf’s tube by a
 metallic point connected to the conductor of an electric
 machine. Like phenomena, under slightly di<U+FB02>'erent con
 ditions, have been obtained by means of electric discharges by
 M. Augusto Righi (Memorie della Accademia delle scienze
 dell’Istituto di Bologna, (4) iii. 1881, pp. 291 to 304, and
 pp. 461 to 496) ; there is in this memoir a sketch of a

314         , B. Rosing on the Participation of Matter
theory. We think that it is indispensable to complete the
experiments above described in order to elucidate the various
questions which present themselves, and we limit ourselves to
a general conclusion that the phenomena observed should be
attributed to electric <U+FB02>uxes proceeding from the Hittorf’s tube
and the objects in its neighbourhood, together with a dielec
tric polarization; in this sense the similarity of the electric
<U+FB01>elds of a Hittort°s tube and of an electri<U+FB01>ed conductor must
be admitted; we must therefore take it into account in the
study of the electric properties of Rontgen’s rays.

XXXIV. On the Possibility of explaining the Phenomena of
     <U+FB02>Iagnetis-m by the Hypothesis of Participation of hfatter in
    the hlotion of the Magnetic Field. By B. ROSING, Fellow
    of the Russian Physico-chemical Society*.
ALL theories of magnetism, whatever their physical foun
         dations, are founded from the point of view of dynamics
on the supposition of the existence of two principal types of
physical coordinates; the one <U+FB01>xing the intensity and the
distribution of magnetic induction, the other de<U+FB01>ning the
state of the magnetized matter.         But the coordinates, as is
known, can be in general either of positional or of kinosthenic
characterf; 2'. e. they can occur in the expression for the
energy of a system either explicitly or only through their
differential coef<U+FB01>cients. Therefore we may imagine three
combinations of our magnetic coordinates, and consequently
divide all possible hypotheses on magnetism into three cate
gories. The <U+FB01>rst category, when both types of coordinates
are positional ; Weber’s hypothesis, for instance, of Molecular
Magnets belongs to it. The other, when the one type is
positional and the other kinosthenic; such is Ampére’s hy
pothesis of Molecular Electric Currents in Maxwell’s versioni:
the latter takes the energy of the electric currents to be kinetic.
A third combination is still possible—when both types of
coordinates belong to the kinosthenic type, i. e. when it is
supposed that matter when magnetized is put into the same
motion as the surrounding magnetic <U+FB01>eld.          'e shall take this
third assumption—Have we the right to consider the magne

 tizatiou of matter as a purely kinetic process, and to explain
 all magnetic phenomena—such as polarity of paramagnetic
 and diamagnetic bodies, magnecrystallic force, hysteresis—as
 simple mechanical consequences of the participation of matter
 in the motion of aether which takes place in magnetic induc
 tion tubes? Of this we have no positive proof; but this
 hypothesis is attractive by reason of its simplicity, and at the
 same time does not contain anything improbable. To explain
 all phenomena by means of the properties of matter in motion
 and to deduce all laws from the laws of kinetic energy—
 has not this always been what natural philosophy has striven
 to achieve? The idea of connecting the motion of matter and
 aether dynamically is also not novel: in this way only was
 Helmholtz enabled to explain the phenomenon of anomalous
 dispersion. Magnetism also possesses its own anomalous dis
 persion : it is paramagnetic polarity of some bodies in relation
 to diamagnetic polarity of others. And in reality, as we shall
see further on , the paramagnetic retraction of lines of mag
 netic force—to use Faraday’s deep and expressive language——
is just the same mechanical consequence of absorption of
energy as is the anomalous dispersion of lines of the light—
radiation. Diamagnetism of matter, as is known, is explained
very easily by admitting the existence of molecular electric
currents, excited by the surrounding magnetic <U+FB01>eld and cir~
culating freely and without resistance on the surface of the
particles of matter. Electromagnetism' shows that the energy
of a system of spherical currents, referred to one of these
currents, is equal to

where the integrals are extended over the surface of the
current in question, ¢ is the stream-function, and Q and .Q‘
are the magnetic potentials due to the present current and
the surrounding ones respectively. The sign 2 refers to all
the surrounding currents.                               "

      The formula (5) of magnetic permeability is found by
 assuming the hypothesis of molecular currents, excited by
 the magnetic <U+FB01>eld on the surface of particles which are
 themselves absolutely impermeable.                It is remarkable that
 the same formula can be found by assuming another hypo
 thesis, namely that which takes magnetic induction to be a
 <U+FB02>ux, prepagating through media of different conductivity. In
 reality, as is known, the problem of distribution of magnetic
 induction in space corresponds exactly with that of electric

    Applying this formula to our case of magnetic induction
existing in a space amongst particles of matter absolutely

to 0. The formula (6) will then take the following form :—

   The magnetic energy of unit of volume is, as we know
from electromagnetlsm, expressed in terms of the magnetic

 the terms IH+         (g + l) 12 represent the magnetic energy

 as we see, identical with those found before. Such a coinci
 dence in the results of the hypothesis of Magnetic Flux with
 those of the hypothesis of Molecular Electric Currents permits
 of our concluding that a system of spherical currents excited
 without resistance on the surface of particles of matter is merely

a mathematicul<U+FB01>ction, representing the conditions of the propa
gation of lines of induction in the space occupied by the particles
of matter, namely the conditions of their re<U+FB02>ewion at the surface
of these particles.
   Formula. (3) or (8) shows that neither of the hypotheses,
when excluding the participation of matter, can explain para
magnetic phenomena: the <U+FB01>rst, because the magnetic moment
of induced currents always appears in a direction opposed to
the magnetic <U+FB01>eld; the second, because the presence of abso
lutely impermeable matter always lessens the magnetic per
meability of space. Consequently we are obliged to introduce
a supplementary hypothesis expressing this participation in
some way or other.
   \Ve introduce it here by supposing that the matter, when
in a magnetic <U+FB01>eld, is itself put into some motion ; and con
sequently, besides the system of coordinates representing
molecular electric currents, coordinates also exist which <U+FB01>x
this magnetic motion for each particle. As these new coor
dinates, we suppose, are of kinosthenic character, the new
terms, appearing in the magnetic energy of a substance, are
of the form
                         LIJ and evJa;
where J is the vector de<U+FB01>ning in every point the velocity of
magnetic motion of matter, and the coel<U+FB01>cients 7t and vdepend
on the nature of a. substance, and denote—the <U+FB01>rst, 7t, the
connexion between the motion of magnetic induction and the
magnetic motion of matter, and the second, 11, the inertia of
this latter motion.
   Thus the magnetic energy of unit of volume will be repre
sented by the following expression :—
             W=            + 1)I’+IH+>»IJ+-§—vJ". . . (10)
   By applying to this expression the principle of Least Action,
we obtain Lagrange’s equation in a new form :

Formula (15) now contains both cases of magnetization: that
of magnetic and that of paramagnetic bodies. In reality, when
the coefficient 7» is suf<U+FB01>ciently large and v su<U+FB01>iciently small,
x assumes positive values and we enter the sphere of para
magnetism.
   From the equations (13) we obtain besides this

whence it is evident that—given a comparatively large value
to 7t and small value to v—the velocity of magnetic motion of
matter and its energy under the same magnetization I are
comparatively greater. We conclude from this, that the
absorption of energy by motion of matter in paramagnetic
bodies is comparatively greater than in diamagnetic ones, as
has been already pointed out, and that in consequence thereof
appears that anomalous propagation of the magnetic induction
tubes which is observed in paramagnetic bodies. Besides
that, as we already decided to regard the phenomenon of
diamagnetism as the reflexion of lines of induction at the sur
 faces of particles of matter, we must now consider paramag
 netism to be also the re<U+FB02>exion of the induction lines, but
 taking place without change of sign. Thus we <U+FB01>nd here the
 same phenomenon of double-signed re<U+FB02>exion with and with
 out change of sign as we also see in other branches of physics,
 as for instance in the reflexion of waves of light and sound at
 the surfaces separating media of different nature.
    In the case of a crystalline substance the magnetic energy
 of unit of volume is expressed by a formula which is analogous
to formula (10), but the vectors 1, J, H are replaced here by
their components (A, B, C), (L, M, N), and (a, B, 7) re—
 spectively. By applying to it Lagrange’s equations we get a
 system of equations :

These are, as we know, the fundamental equations for mag
netization of a crystalline substance. The coetiicients x1, x2, K3
. . . here may have both positive and negative values depending
upon the values 6,, 62, e3, XII, 7w, 7L”, . . . v11, wry, v”, . . . for
the different axes of the crystal.
    Lastly, by introducing into the formula of energy values of
L, M, N from the above equations, and by adding siHi,
we get                                                           w

                              871'
Thus we see that the results found by means of the hypothesis
of mechanical participation of matter in phenomena of mag
netic induction answer well enough to the fundamental
requirements of the theory of magnetism.
    However, these suppositions are not sufficient to explain
all phenomena of magnetism, for instance the phenomena
which take place when iron and such metals are magnetized.
The phenomenon of magnetic remanescence forces us, on the
other hand, to suppose the existence of magnetic deformations
that take place at the magnetic motion of matter, and therefore
to accept a new type of coordinates which would de<U+FB01>ne
them.
    Actually, whatever the magnetic motion of matter, it is, of

                  in the Motion of the Magnetic Field.                      321
  course, a periodic motion round the axis of the vector J.
  Arising inside matter, it must produce there a kind of
  pressure, counterbalanced by the elastic forces of matter,
  and must therefore be accompanied by certain deformations.
  We suppose that this pressure is kinetic in character, i e., it
  passes on by collisions from particle to particle.
     Now it is easy to prove that such a kinetic pressure must
  be proportional to the square of the velocity J, and that at
  the moment of the change of this pressure forces of reaction
  appear which act backward on the vector J.
     Actually, the hypothesis of the existence of kinetic pressure
  produced by the magnetic motion of matter is dynamically equi
  valent to supposing that a connexion exists between this motion
  of matter and the motion arising at its deformations. There
  fore, if we denote the coordinates <U+FB01>xing magnetic deformations
  by the letters Pa, 105, . . ., then the above hypothesis will mean
  that terms exist in the formula of Lagrange’s function of the
  following kind :—
                         paibaJ+ppj><U+FB01>J+ . . ., .      .     .       .     . (17)
  where pa, p5, . . . are coef<U+FB01>cients de<U+FB01>ning the connexion be
  tween the two motions.
     Therefore, in Lagrange’s equation for the vector J, besides
  the forces contained already in formula (12), new forces
  appear and the equation is :—
     d                 d      .      .            a             .

   This system of equations represents the general conditions
of static magnetization on the supposition of the existence of
magnetic pressure and magnetic deformations.        We will pro
ceed to examine these formulae.

                         I=KH—IC;        —J—
shows that the process of magnetization is composed of two
processes, one, expressed by term xH, is a process which can
be completely reversible and which represents, as we have
already had occasion to see, a simple re<U+FB01>exion of induction
lines from matter ; the other process is expressed by the
term
                           _. >~ a
                               v    J ’
and arises in consequence of absorption of energy by the mag
netic deformations. The value of this term wholly depends
on the free energy F of deformations. It is in the nature of
these deformations that the explanation of all the complex and
intricate phenomena which appear in the magnetization of
iron must be sought.
   It is evident from equation (25), that in a paramagnetic
substance—given I and H positive—the vector J has the oppo
site sign to the coef<U+FB01>cient X, and I: having a positive value, the
product —rc:’ltlTis greater than nil.        On the other hand,
when I and H are increased, and consequently J too, the de
formations likewise increase, and with them F. Therefore
the integral
                          _,,’i 8_F
                               11   J
taken from thebeginning of magnetization I=J =H=O is a
positive quantity.
   Thus, owing to the absorption of energy in a paramagnetic
substance, magnetization increases.
   To show this still more clearly, we will put the equations

                in the Motion of the Magnetic Field.        325
into differential form. Let us suppose that the process of
magnetization takes place at constant temperature. In this
case the free energ F is a function only of the coordinates
pa, pp, . . . . But t ese coordinates can be expressed by the
system of equations (27) as a function of J". Therefore the
 energy F may also be considered as a function of the same
quantity J2.     In this way we have
                          8F=g—£dJ’.       . . . . . . (28)

deformations were not existing, the magnetization of iron would
not difer much from the magnetization of other paramagnetic
bodies. But that in consequence of these deformations, —2

quantity 713—, exists as long as the deformations change ,- when
the deformations cease to change, the differential coef<U+FB01>cient
(2% again takes small values.            This ceasing of change of
deformations must he therefore supposed in order to explain
so-called magnetic saturation. But if we take into considera
tion that magnetic deformations most likely do not represent

changes of volume or form, but of the structure of matter—
like that which takes place in recalescence, as is most pro
bable,-—then there is nothing impossible in this hypothesis.
The explanation of another very important phenomenon—
magnetic hysteresis—is based on the same phenomenon of
magnetic deformations ; we must only suppose that the
same hysteresis exists in the chanying of magnetic defor
motions.
   It is also interesting to see to what our hypothesis could
lead in the case of a diamagnetic substance. In this last case,
when x<0, i. e. the re<U+FB01>exion of magnetic induction from the
particles of matter takes place with the changing of the sign,
the absorption of energy by deformations gives rise to a quite
opposite effect. Formula              shows that when K<0, the
absolute value of 3% cannot be more than n,

because, as it is very easy to see from this formula, the fol

                              5    6
   Further, the same formula shows that ((7% is lessened always
with increasing of         ; and therefore in all such cases, when
magnetic deformations increase the most the differential
coefficient glg- falls to its least value.
   Owing to this, when we assume the character of the change
of deformations in a diamagnetic body to be the same as in a
paramagnetic one, we shall have for a diamagnetic substance a
curve of magnetization of quite a different form, namely, like
the line 0 M N shown in the <U+FB01>gure. Similarly, when the mag
netizing force is decreased, the deformations change more
slowly, in consequence of hysteresis, than when it is in
creased, and the return curve N P Q descends below the
curve OMN and intersects the axis of H before 0 in the
point P. Again, with a further decrease of H, magnetization
becomes positive, and the body at H=O has a paramagnetic
residual. This, as is known, was observed by Messrs. Quintus—
Icilius, Tumlirtz, Lodge, and others.
   Besides the differential equation of magnetization, it is

               in the diction of the Magnetic Field.           329

_, -But in the case of deformations produced by exterior forces
SSF is, in natural conditions, either nil ora poSitive quantity.
 Therefore SIdH is a negative quantity, and magnetization
proceeds along the curve in a direction opposite to that in
which clock—hands move ; and the work performed by the mag
 netic<U+FB01>eld is positive, and leaves the body in the form of heat.
      Thus, in conclusion, we see that, from the point of view of
  the hypothesis which considers the magnetic induction as a
  kind of motion of tether communicated also to matter, we can
  explain the phenomenon of magnetization as a simple re
 <U+FB02>exion of tubes of induction from matter, where this re<U+FB02>exion
  appears with or without a change of sign, with this or
  that intensity, depending on the forces of reaction of matter
  which exist at the moment of re<U+FB02>exion. These forces of
  reaction depend, in their turn, <U+FB01>rstly, on the inertia of
  matter in relation to the magnetic motion and on the coef<U+FB01>
  cient of connexion of aether and matter, which determine the
  sign of re<U+FB02>exion; secondly, also on the elastic forces in these
  substances‘ in which magnetic motion is accompanied by
  magnetic     deformations.     In   those bodies which have a
  comparatively large magnetic inertia, the re<U+FB02>exion takes place
  with change of sign and the intensity of re<U+FB02>ectedinduction is
  greater, the less the inertia and other forces of resistance; this
   is a normal magnetization, and these bodies are so-called dia
  maynetic bodies. In others where the inertia is less than a
   certain quantity, the re<U+FB01>exion takes place without change of
  sign, and every increase of resistance of matter is accompanied
   by increase of re<U+FB02>erion. These are so-called paramagnetic
  bodies.
      By following in this way the hypothesis treated of here,
  one can reduce to the same principles the phenomena observed
  at rapid and alternate magnetization and <U+FB01>nd an answer to the
  very important question of the existence of magnetic inertia
  and viscosity, and of their role in the magnetic circuit. This
  question, however, necessitates very minute study, and we
  shall return to it in the future. At present we will only
  remark that the results to which this hypothesis brings us are
  directly opposed to those which are arrived at from the point of
  view of Weber-Ewing’s theory. In opposition to this theory,
  the magnetization of iron here rises with the increase of
  resistance offered by the forces of inertia or viscosity. In
  this way inertia, when the magnetizing current is closed
  rapidly, must involve a greater magnetization; the same is to

  this entitles us to suppose that with an alternate magnetization
  the maximum of it does not reach that quantity attained by a
  static process. And certainly the most recent observations on
  the exhaustion of iron in transformers seem to corroborate this.
  From the point of view of the present hypothesis, the exhaus
  tion of iron is nothing but the rearrangement ot'its particles,

  a smaller absorption of energy, and therefore calls for a less
  pronounced magnetic e<U+FB02>'ect.

    XXXV. illicroscopic Vision. By G. JOHNSTONE STONEY,
                         MA, 1).Sc., F.R.S.*
               PART I.—FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES T.
  1. VISION, whether by the naked eye or with the as
              sistance of optical instruments, may be studied in
 many ways; since a correct investigation may start from any
 one of the innumerable possible resolutions of the disturbance
 which exists throughout the nether in front of and close to the
 object. But two only of these will be here considered, viz.:
 that most obvious resolution in which the aether in front of
 the object is regarded as traversed by undulations of hemi
 spherical wat'es emanating from each physical point of the
 surface of the object, and that other equally general but less
 obvious resolution of the disturbance in this portion of the
 acther into undulations of uniform plane waves transmitted
forwards in all or some directions from the whole extent of
the obiective <U+FB01>eld.
    2. The <U+FB01>rst of these modes of resolution-~~that into sphe
rical waves—is the foundation of Airy’s method of studying
the images formed by telescopes, in which the image is re
garded as arising from the overlapping and interference of
the spurious disks with attendant rings which in the image
take the place of points on the object. This method has on
this account been sometimes called the Spurious Disk Theory.
The second mode of resolution—that into plane waves—is the
foundation of Abbe’s method of studying the images formed
   * Communicated by the Author.
   T Part II. deals with the application of these principles to the micro
scope as at present made.

             _Dr. G. J. Stoney on illicroscopic Vision.             333
by microscopes ; and has usually been called the Diffraction
Theory, because it gives a special prominence to the fact that
when we pass beyond the meagre hypotheses of geometrical
optics, we <U+FB01>nd that diffracted light“ is “the machinery by
which good de<U+FB01>nition is brought about.” It was undoubtedly
desirable to emphasise this fact, because an error prevailed
and is not yet extinct that diffracted light intervenes only to
impair the image ; and it can scarcely be made any objection
to the name that it runs counter to this error. As, however,
both processes are only methods of investigation, it would
perhaps be desirable to avoid calling either of them a theory.
On this account, and to avoid cavilling about mere names,
the two methods of investigation are in the present memoir
distinguished as the Airy and the Abbe modes of pro
cedure 1'.
    3. In a recent paper by Lord Rayleigh the generality of
Abbe’s method seems not to have been appreciated (see Phil.
Mag. for last August, p. 167); and the main object of the
present communication is to offer a fuller account of this
generality than the writer has elsewhere given (see “On the
  oundation of the Diffraction Theory ” ; ‘ English Mechanic ’
for December 13, 1895, p. 380), and to trace its consequences.
    4. Two terms have been used above in the <U+FB01>rst paragraph
which need to be de<U+FB01>ned.
     (a) By a physical point is to be understood an element of
the volume of the object (if the object be translucent), or of
its superficial layer (if it be opaque), which element of volume
is small enough to justify us in substituting for it in our
investigation a mathematical point regarded as a centre of ‘
an undulation of hemispherical waves. The physical point is
small enough for this use of it, if its linear dimensiOns are in
any considerable degree less than )t/i, where )t is the wave
length of the light employed. To give de<U+FB01>nite form to our
conceptions we may suppose its dimensions to be comparable
with M10. This is a convenient size ;' since if an opening of
this size were made in a thin opaque screen, and if a pencil
of light were incident from any direction upon it, the hole is
small enough to ensure that the light which gets through
shall spread on the other side of the screen in the form of
  4* Light which advances in other directions than those prescribed by
geometrical optics is called di<U+FB01>'racted light.
   1' Lord Rayleigh suggests the name Spectrum Theory for the method
of investigation which proceeds by resolving the light into plane waves ;
but will   erha s not less this name on the acceptance of scienti<U+FB01>c men
when he 'nds t at the imitation which the name implies has no existence.

334            Dr. G. J. Stoney on McroscoIiic Visioh.
hemispherical waves; and at the same time the opening is a
large one when compared with the transversal* of the light
waves, since molecular considerations indicate that this trans
versal (or rather these transversals, since there are two, an
electric and a magnetic one at right angles to one another)
must be regarded as of a length which is from the thousandth
to the ten thousandth of a wave-len th. Hence the directions
of transversals will not be affected in passing through the
opening. On this account, if the incident light be a beam
of plane waves, whether polarized or not, the intensity of the
light will differ on the various parts of the hemispherical
waves which spread beyond the screen, being a maximum in
the direction of the prolongation of the normal to the in
cident waves. This must be taken into account in attempts
to apply Airy’s method of investigation to microscopic vision,
since until this is. suf<U+FB01>ciently done the investigation is too
imperfect for us to be justi<U+FB01>ed in relying on its results except
so far as 'they can be con<U+FB01>rmed by Abbe’s method or some
other which does not involve the above consideration. A
further and more serious imperfection is introduced when
Airy’s method is applied only to the light between the
objective and the image, and not also to the light between
the object and the objective. An inquiry conducted in this
Way begins too late, after the more important of the events
that atfect the image have occurred.             Nevertheless it seems
to be the only one which has as yet been made by Airy’s
 method; see, for example, the investigation on p. 176 of
 Lord Rayleigh’s paper.         We shall learn in the second part
of this memoir what it is that in this case is being ascertained.
    (b) The other term in paragraph 1 that requires de<U+FB01>nition
is the objective <U+FB01>elzl.     By this term is to be understood the
whole of the object and its surroundings of which an image
is formed by the telescope or microscope, or in the eye of the
observer. Accordingly the objective <U+FB01>eld at and surrounding
the object corresponds to ‘ the <U+FB01>eld of view ’ at and surround
ing the image of it which is formed in the eye, or at the
focus of an optical instrument.
    “ The word transversal is here and elsewhere used for the transversal
of the displacement under the dynamical wave theory of light.
   The dynamical wave theory is that used throughout this memoir,
 except where otherwise stated ; since, in the present state of our know
 ledge, it is more easily handled than the electromagnetic wave theory,
 and since, except in special cases (as for example the distributinn of
 intensity over a spherical wave), it furnishes the same results. Besides,
 the dynamical theory usually carries us as far as we can go, for, in the
 special cases where the electromagnetic theory may yield a different
 result, it seldom happens that we yet know that result.

  '5. The following important optical theorem may now be
enunciated, which in its generality compares with Fourier’s
Theorem, of which it is, in fact, in ultimate analysis, an
extension.                                                       -
                         PROPOSITION 1.
   However complex the contents of the objective <U+FB01>eld, and
whether it or parts of it be self-luminous or illuminated in any
way, however special, the light which emanates from it may be
resolved into undulations each of which consists of uniform
plane waves ; on the hypothesis that each point of the object
emits continuously the same light: an hypothesis the suf<U+FB01>
ciency of which will appear in Part II. of this memoir.
   By an undulation is meant a succession or train of waves,
and by a uniform wave is meant one which is at each instant
alike in every part of each wave surfaces
   6. To prove this theorem we proceed very much in the
same way as in dealing with Fourier’s Theorem.         We begin
by positing repetitions of the objective <U+FB01>eld.      For this pur
pose let a plane be drawn through some point of the objective
<U+FB01>eld, and preferably perpendicular to the line of sight. This
plane may be called the Objective Plane. Let a square be
drawn in this plane which may be of any size, provided that
it shall include within it the projection upon the plane, from
the point of view of the observer, of the contents of the ob
jective <U+FB01>eld: in other words, the square is to be large enough
for the whole of the objective <U+FB01>eld—the whole of what the
observer can see—to fall within that square, and preferably
well within it. Divide the whole plane up into squares of
this size by two systems of equidistant parallel lines, and
imagine an exact repetition of the contents of the objective
<U+FB01>eld to occupy the position relatively to each of these except
the <U+FB01>rst, which is the same as the position actually occupied
by the contents of the real objective <U+FB01>eld in reference to the
<U+FB01>rst square. Next suppose light to be emitted from every
 point of each of these replicas, which is at each instant similar
 in every respect—i. e. the same in direction, intensity, phase,
and position of transversal—as is the light from the cor
 responding point of the original objective <U+FB01>eld at that
instant.
    Under these circumstances a point p in the original objec
tive <U+FB01>eld, along with the corresponding points 12' p” &c. in
the replicas of the objective field, form a system of points
 equally spaced over a plane which is parallel to the objective
 plane. Now it is known, from the theory of diffraction
 gratings (see the <U+FB01>gure on p. 340), that such a system of

336            Dr. G. J. Stoney on Microscopic Vision.
points equally spaced in a plane, and all emitting light which
at each instant is exactly similar, will produce a disturbed
condition of the aether which is resolvable into plane waves
advancing in certain de<U+FB01>nite“ directions.                     The same is true
of each other point of the original objective plane with its
replicas. Hence, and since by the principle of the super
position of small motions the total disturbance in the aether
caused by the whole contents of the objective <U+FB01>eld and of all
its replicas is the resultant produced by a simple geometrical
summation of the disturbances which would be produced by
the several points of the original <U+FB01>eld and their replicas, it
follou's that in ultimate analysis the total disturbance is re
solvable into the undulations of plane waves into which its

investigating the disturbance within a layer of limited thickness, the layer
between the objective plane and the plane in which the front of the
objective lies; and the luminous energy expended on any e<U+FB01>ects within
that layer, other than those producing the plane wave dealt with in the
text,vcan be made relatively as small as we please by increasing the
spacing between the replicas.
   This will perhaps be made clearer by considering the analogue in a
Fourier’s expansion.      If the <U+FB01>rst n terms of a Fourier’s expansion of any
function be added together, they furnish an approximation to that
function which is nearer the larger n is, and which can be made as close
an approximation as we please by increasing n. Now the sources of
similar light p, p', p", &c., furnish a number of fans of undulations of
  lane waves, each fan analogous to a limited number of terms of a
li‘ourier’s expansion, this limitbd number being proportional for each fan
to 6/A, where 8 is the spacing ofp, p', p”, &c., and A is the wave-length.
They are therefore susceptible of inde<U+FB01>nite increase by increasing 8.
Moreover, the fans which have the smaller number of terms become
rapidly the fainter: see the <U+FB01>gure on p. 340, in which the closer the ruling
the smaller will be the number of terms of the corresponding fan.
   The outcome of these considerations is that the aetherial disturbance in
flout 0f the objective plane may be such that to resolve the whole of it
with absolute accuracy into undulations of plane waves would require
that these undulations shall spread in all (corresponding to 8 being in
de<U+FB01>nitely large) instead of some (corresponding to 6 being <U+FB01>nite)
directions. But, practically, a very moderate value for 8 is suf<U+FB01>cient;
since the approximation is carried far enough when the outstanding
luminous effects are too faint either to be seen by the eye or to affect a
photographic plate sensibly.
   EVen if the closest of the replicas were much closer in than we havs
supposed, they would not sensibly interfere with the vision of the original
object. Two or more diatoms seen together within the same <U+FB01>eld of
View do not sensibly interfere with the most satisfactory vision of each
of them, nor would they if they all emitted light from their correspond—
ing points which was strictly the same at each instant in phase, direction
of transverse], and intensity. Each would still be as fully seen as our
eyes are capable of seeing, notwithstanding the presence of the others.

              Dr. G. J. Stoney on lllicroscopic Vision.       337
  constituent disturbances are resolvable. The number of
  these undulations may be reduced wherever any of them
  travel in the same direction, since any number of undulations
 of plane waves of wave-length a travelling in the same direction
 may be combined into a single undulation of plane waves
 travelling in that direction. Hence the total disturbance is
 resolvable into undulations of uniform plane waves, only one
 of which for each value of 7t travels in each direction.
    7. This valuable optical theorem bears a remarkably close
 analogy to Fourier’s Theorem for the expansion of an immense
 class of functions. Thus by Fourier’s Theorem a portion of

in which the values of the constants A0, A1, A2, &c., 13,, B2,
&c., depend on what direction has been selected for the line
over which the repetitions are to be disposed, and on what
interval has been chosen for a (a being mm’, the spacing of
the curves from one another). So in our optical theorem, the
plane waves into which the light emitted by a point p in the
objective <U+FB01>eld is to be resolved will depend on what plane has
been chosen for the objective plane, and on the intervals at
which 1), p’, p”, &c., are to occur in that plane, as well as on
whether the lines joining them lie (as we have placed them
above) at right angles to one another, or in other available
positions. However, just as in a Fourier’s ex ansion the
original curve is always correctly represente           whatever
assumption we may have made as regards the orientation of
the axis of a: and the length of the line a, and it is only the
situation of its replicas which is affected by this choice; so
under our theorem the light in front of the objective <U+FB01>eld is
always adequately resolved whatever selection we may have
made as regards the optional matters (provided the conditions
laid down in the footnote on p. 336 are observed), and it is
only where its replicas are to be regarded as situated that is
affected by that choice. Moreover, when once we have made

338         Dr. G. J. Stoney on Microscopic Vision.
our choice as regards these optional matters, the plane waves
emanating from the whole <U+FB01>eld into which the light emitted
by the point p is to be resolved under our theorem, become
as de<U+FB01>nite and unique as do the coef<U+FB01>cients of a Fourier’s
 series when once we have decided on the direction of the line
 mm’ and have selected a value for a. This, however, still
 leaves a considerable latitude under our theorem, as to what
 the undulations of plane waves shall be, since the objective
 <U+FB01>eld may be variously chosen, and the only conditions which
 limit the positions to be selected for the replicas are that they
 and the original objective <U+FB01>eld be equally spaced relatively to
 the objective plane, and that the nearest of the replicas shall
 lie far enough outside the objective <U+FB01>eld to ensure that
 whether sources of light exist in them or not shall not sensibly
 interfere with what is seen by the observer. They are to
 him stars below his horizon, whose positions or even existence
 in no perceptible degree affect the distinctness with which he
 sees the stars that are above his horizon.
     8. Principles of Reversal.——A further insight into what it is
 that occurs may be gained by a simple expedient. Picture a
  portion of the objective plane, of limited but large size—large
  enough to have the original objective <U+FB01>eld near its middle,
  and a great many of its replicas disposed round it. If all of
  these emit light that is exactly similarly circumstanced, then,
  as already explained, it appears that they, acting together,
  will produce undulations of very nearly uniform plane waves
  which will become more and more disentangled from one
  another the farther out they go. It is in fact when thus
  disentangled that their consisting of almost quite plane waves
  becomes most obvious. The approximation to accurately
  uniform plane waves can, of course, be carried as far as we
  please by increasing the number of replicas engaged in
  emitting the light.
     Let now all the aetherial motions be suddenly reversed, and
  let at the same time the objective <U+FB01>eld and its replicas be got
  out of the way. The distant undulations which were before
  advancing outwards will now travel inwards without ceasing
  to be uniform plane waves, and will by simple geometrical
  superposition, according as they overlap one another, repro
  duce at each step of their inward journey exactly the same
  disturbed state of the aether as had prevailed at the same
  stations on the outward journey, except that the directions of
  all motions are reversed. Hence plane waves Converging in
  wards would by their superposition produce precisely the same
  disturbance in the aether, except only with reversed motions,
  as that which on the outward journey prevailed close in front

              Dr. G. J. Stoney on illicroseopio Vision;              339
of the object in the objective <U+FB01>eld ; and, <U+FB01>nall , if the travelling
backwards is continued long enough for t e undulations to
reach the positions that had been occupied by the original
object, they will there produce an image of it the most perfect
which the light that had been emitted by the object is capable
of producing.       This image thus becomes a standard of per
fection which may be approached but cannot be exceeded by
{behimages formed by any optical contrivance from the same
      t. the way in which the standard image is formed it is
 igFrom
manifest that it is an image of the same size and general
shape as the object or group of objects represented by it.
The further excellence of this image depends upon the amount
of detail upon the object which it is competent to reproduce ;
and this varies, as we shall <U+FB01>nd presently, with the wave
length of the light employed, and with the way in which that
light has been supplied to the object. The standard image
may be regarded either as viewed from beyond, or as being
transformed into a picture by being thrown 011 a screen able
to scatter whatever light falls on it. The screen should not
be <U+FB02>at, but with such prominences and depressions as will
enable it to catch the light everywhere exactly where the
image is formed. Such a picture is entitled to the name of
the standard picture, since it has on it all that part of the
detail on the real object which the light is capable of
showing*.
    9. Theorem 2. The Standard Image—Let us consider
somewhat more closely how the standard image is formed.
It is formed by the coalescence and mutual interference of
uniform plane waves. Now when we consider how these
same undulations originated when starting on their outward
journey and remember that the condition of the aether is the

the motions; when we further remember that the point p
   5* Another way of conceiving the standard image which is for some
purposes more convenient is to imagine the retreat of the luminous
undulations to be carried farther backwards (the condenser of the
microscope and any other obstruction being of course removed); and
then, at a. given instant, to conceive the aetherial motions to be again
reversed. The undulations will thereupon travel forwards (i. e. in the
direction in which the light originally moved), will re-form the standard
image when they reach the position that had been occupied by the
object, and will thence proceed to the objective of the microscope in
precisely the same state as was the light that was transmitted to it by
the real object. It thus appears that the source of light, the condenser,
and the object may be all removed, and that the standard image emitting
its light forward may be substitutedfor them.

and its replicas emitted portions of light which at the instant
of starting were exactly alike, and that the undulations which
result from this state of things may be thrown into groups
of undulations, each of which is the same as would have been

lines represented in the accompanying <U+FB01>gure, as well as the

  vast number of others that would arise from suf<U+FB01>ciently ex
  tending the <U+FB01>gure ; when we further bear in mind that every
  equal element of any one of the lines in each such ruling
  emits the same amount of light, which is in the same state as
  that emitted by p except as regards intensity : when all these
  things are taken into account we <U+FB01>nd that. the entire of the
  standard image may be regarded as built up of such luminous
  rulings superposed upon and interfering with one another—
  each of these rulings being due to the convergence and
  mutual interference of two or more undulations of the uniform
  plane waves which (since the reversal) have been travelling
  inwards, and each ruling accordingl        being uniform and
  extending across and even beyond the whole range of the
  objective <U+FB01>eld.
      This is our second theorem.      It may be enunciated as
   follows :—
                           PROPOSITION 2.
      The standard image may be regarded as      resulting from the
   superposition and mutual interference of      uniform luminous
   rulings of equidistant parallel bright lines  extending over the
   whole <U+FB01>eld of view; each ruling being          produced by the

 convergence upon it, after the reversal, of two or more of
 the undulations of uniform plane waves into which the light
 emitted by the object may be resolved.
   10. Of course other resolutions than the two hitherto
considered—that into spherical waves thrown off from the
several points of the surface of an object, and that into plane
waves thrown off from the surface as a whole—are possible:
and in fact, if a resolution of the disturbance in the aether
between the object and the objective of a microscope is made
into plane waves, these will become curved while passing
through and after emerging from the-objective ; and it is as
curved waves that they reach and produce the microscopic
image. They, in fact, become convex waves that are nearly
spherical. The centres of these nearly spherical waves are
obviously the points of the focal plane (or rather, focal sur
face, for it is slightly curved) of parallel light incident on the
objective. This focal plane lies between the objective and the
microscopic image, and in all the cases that need to be con
sidered it lies near the objective, and therefore suf<U+FB01>ciently far
from the microscopic image to render the curvature of the
waves where they reach that image but slight.
   1] . ZlIagni<U+FB01>cation.—Let us now return to the standard
image. It is of the same size as the object. If we could by
any contrivance increase the wave-lengths of the light that
forms it—if, for instance, we could make the wave-lengths a
thousand times larger, making them the same fractions of a
millimetre which actual light-waves are of a micron—we
should in this way enlarge the image 1000 times, since the
interference of the longer waves coming in the same directions
as before would produce rulings all of which would be 1000
times coarser than before.          This enlarged image would
obviously contain precisely the same amount of detail as the
standard image.
   This method of enlarging an image is only practicable on a
small scale, since we can but slightly increase wave-lengths
(as when we place the object in a highly refracting medium
and its image in the air) ; but what is very much the 1 same
result may be brought about in another way, viz., by dimi
nishing the inclination of the beams of plane waves to one
another, without altering the lengths of the waves ; since the
rulin which results from the interference of two such beams
may e made coarser either by lengthening the waves of
which each beam consists, or by diminishing the inclination
of the beams to one another.
   12. Useful work done by the objective—The useful part of
what is accomplished by the objective of a microscope is that

342           Dr. G. J. Stoney on Microscopic Vision.
it diminishes the inclination of these beams to one another.
This brings about two desired results : it enlarges the image,
and it makes it possible for its constituent beams, after they
have passed the focal image, to be collected by the eyepiece
and transmitted through so small an opening as the pupil of
the eye, instead of diverging over the great extent to which
they were spreading when they left the object.
    13. Useless war/c done by the 0?;jectz're.—But the objective
cannot accomplish this useful work without at the same time
 producing other effects which are undesirable. Thus, it
transforms the beams of plane waves into convex beams, as
explained in § 10. This somewhat distorts the image. The
image is still more distorted in the direction of the line of
 sight, whereby any elevation on the object is shown as unduly
prominent in the image *.           Neither of these distortions,
however, would cause the amount of detail in the microscopic
image to fall short of that in the standard image.
    That which above all produces this defect, and produces it
 however well the spherical and chromatic aberrations of the
 objective may have been corrected, is that the angular aper
 ture of the objective falls short of 180°. With the best
 immersion-lenses the angular aperture is about 120° or 130°,
 so that little more than half the light would be caught by
 the objective, if the light were emitted equally in all direc
 tions. One part of the light thus excluded is that which
 in the standard image brings out the <U+FB01>nest part of the detail
 which that image can reach, since it is the light which pro
 duces the <U+FB01>nest of the rulings that form the standard image.
    There is another imperfection consequent upon this exclu
 sion of part of the light emitted by the object, viz., the
 intrusion into the microscopic image of intercostal markings,
 false resolutions, a general haze of light, and so on—additions
 to the image and other alterations of it which have nothing
  to correspond to them either in the object under examination
  or in its standard image.    The following is perhaps the easiest
 way of understanding how they arise.‘
     14. The Visual Substitute—In order to study microscopic
 vision, or vision of any kind, with full effect, it is well to
 begin with the consideration that what we seem to see with
 the naked eye is never the natural object itself, nor is it an
 enlargement of it when we examine it through a microscope
 or telescope. What we see is, in fact, only a visual substitute
 for the real object in the <U+FB01>rst case, and for an enlargement of
 the same when we use an instrument; and the study of
       This distortion may be traced by an elementary investigation in
 geometrical optics.

              Dr. G. J. Stoney on Microscopic Vision.                 343
vision, whether microscopic, telescopic, or with the naked
eye, is in fact the study of what this visual substitute is and
how it stands related to the real object, 2'. e., what alteration
the real object would have to undergo to be transformed into
its visual substitute, which is what seems to us to be the
object presented to us.
    The real object, 0, sends forward the light which enters the
eye, and, in addition, other light which does not enter the eye,
whereas its visual substitute, S, is to be de<U+FB01>ned as that other
object from which would emanate the light which enters the
eye and it only. It is evident that objects 0 and S will seem
to us exactly alike, but that whereas we receive the whole of
the light which S is competent to dispense, we receive only a
part of that emitted b 0.          Similarly, when we use a micro
scope or telescope, w at we seem to see is a visual object, O,
which would emit exactly the light which the eye takes in,
and it only ; and this is in all cases less than the light which
an enlargement of the object would emit, and may differ from
it in other respects also. It is, accordingly, to the study of
wlllat these visual substitutes are that we should apply our
se ves.
    But as this is a branch of optics which is as yet almost
wholly unexplored *, we must, for the present, be content
with the inferences we can draw from such general considera
tions as the following :—
    15. Proposition 3.—The objective of a microscope has an
angular aperture which is necessarily less than 180°. Hence
the ima e formed by it is formed by a part only of the light
emitted y the object.
    Imagine a hemisphere in front of the object, of so large a
size that the whole object may be treated as though it were
   * In one simple case investigated by the writer the visual substitute
fora thin line of light proved to be a double line with a, narrow interval
and with very thin appendage-lines on either side. Here we have some
 of the phenomena presented by microscopes—a spurious resolution into a
 double line, and ap endage-lines which are of the same nature as inter
 costal markings.     ee abstract of communication to British Association,
 at p. 583 of the ‘Report’ for 1894.

  344            Dr. G. J. Stoney on Moroscopic (Vision.
  at its centre.      The luminous beams * of plane waves, each
  emanating from the whole front of the surface of the object,
  spread over this hemisphere, and the only case we need at
  present consider is where the pupil of the eye (in naked-eye
  observations) or the front lens of the objective (when we use
  a microscope) takes in only the beams A, viz., those beams of
  parallel waves thrown off from the surface of the object which
  are directed towards the middle sector of the hemisphere, and
  fails to admit the beams B, which are directed towards the ma r
  ginal parts of the hemisphere. The excluded beams are partly
  Ba, those which, if reversed, form the <U+FB01>ner of the rulings that
  go to build up the standard image. The rest of these beams,
   viz. Bl), are the more oblique members of those fans of beams
   which produce the coarser rulings—the whole of the standard
  image being made up of these <U+FB01>ner and coarser rulings (see
   § 9), whereas the image seen by the observer is made up by the
  beams A alone—by those which the front lens of the objective
  can catch.
,     Let us now de<U+FB01>ne -—B to be the same light as +B, except
   that all the phases in —B are at each instant the reverse of
   what they are in + B. In other words we get the light —B
   by adding 7r to all phases in the light B ; hence if the light
    +B and the light — B are both present, they exactly cancel
   one another.
      Now the whole light emitted by the object is A+B; and
   it is this light which forms the standard image.            Hence, if we
   add the light —B to the standard image, and can <U+FB01>nd what
   modi<U+FB01>cation of that image is thereby effected, we thus arrive
   at the best image which the light A can form: an image
   which the image actually formed on a large scale by the
   objective may approach in perfection, but cannot exceed. We
   may appropriately name it Standard Image No. 2.
       In order to arrive at standard image No. 2, we may add
   the portions of light —Ba and —Bb in succession to standard
   image No. l, as these together make up the whole of the light
    —B. The addition of —-Ba simply obliterates the <U+FB01>ner of
   the rulings out of which the standard image is constructed.
      4* It is convenient to use the word undulation where the waves extend
   to an in<U+FB01>nite or to an inde<U+FB01>nite distance in their plane, and to employ the
   terms beam and encil where we intend the lateral extent of the waves
   to be regarded as imited.
      Practicall    luminous beams of plane waves emanating from the
   objective <U+FB01>e d, which is, of course, of imited extent, may be used instead
   of the undulations of the theory, which emanate from the entire objective
   plane; since the waves of a beam, unless very narrow, do not differ
   sensibly from the waves of the undulation, except close up to its bounding
   cylinder.

            Dr; G» J. Stoney on Microscopic Vision.              345
The chief (though not quite the only) effect of this is simply
to render the image incapable of exhibiting some very <U+FB01>ne
detail upon the object which before it was able to reach. But
the addition of —Bb has a worse effect. It adds to the image
an entirely new set of <U+FB01>ne rulings which do not represent any
of the features which exist upon the object, and by this light
such false effects as intercostal markings, spurious resolutions,
a general haze of light, &c., are apt to be, and often are, pro
duced.    Hence we may enunciate Proposition 3 as follows:—
                           Psorosrrros 3.
    When, of the light emitted by the object, only part is employed
to form the microscopic image, then features may intrude them
selves into the microscopic image which are not present in the
standard image, and which do not represent anything upon the
object.
    16. Proposition 4. False Colouration.—Another deceptive
effect which is to be referred to the limited apertures of
objectives is the appearance given to uncoloured objects of
being coloured. Only the general principle to be kept in
view will be stated here, as a fuller treatment of this phe
nomenon can be more conveniently made in connexion with
individual instances which will be dealt with in Part II. of
this memoir.
    The whole light of wave-length k which is sent forward by
the object may be divided into AA which is admitted to the
objective, and BA which is excluded. A similar partition
into these two portions is to be made of the whole light
of each wave-length, but the proportion in which the whole
light is divided between them in general varies from one
wave-length to another. Hence, if the illumination is_by
white light and the object uncoloured, there may be a pre
 ponderance of light of some colours in A as compared with
 others, and an equal de<U+FB01>ciency of these same colours in B.
 In such cases the image seen in the microscope, since it is
 exclusively formed by the light A, has not got the colours
 mixed in the same proportions as they are in white light, and
 accordingly appears coloured. Hence
                           PROPOSITION 4.
     Under the same circumstances as in Proposition 3, the par
 tition of the light between the portions received by and excluded
 from the olgjectirc, will in general be diferent for di<U+FB01>'erent ware
  lengths; and when the di<U+FB01>'erence is marked a colourless object
 will appear to be coloured in the microscope.             '         '

 346          Dr. G. J. Stoney on Meroscopic Vision.
     17. Pro osition 5. The Condenser.—The standard image
 admits of eing either better or worse. It manifestly admits
  of being improved by forming it out of light of shorter wave
  length ; and this may be accomplished either by exchanging
 the colour of the illumination employed for a colour of higher
 refrangibility, or by mounting the object in a highly refracting
 medium.                                                      7
     But the degree in which the standard image correctly
 represents the object usually depends even more upon the
 condenser. In fact, the disturbance of the eether in front of
 the object is determined partly by the features of the object
 and partly by the condition of the light which illuminates it.
 This is evident because if the reversal spoken of in § 8 were
 to take place without removing the object, the li ht in re
 tracing its steps would <U+FB01>rst reproduce the disturbe state that
 had existed in front of the object ; would next form the
 standard image upon the surface of the object; and would
 then pass through the object and form be 0nd it whatever
 disturbed state of the aether had existed etween the con
 denser and the object. Hence, that the standard ima e may
 represent the features of the object unmixed wit L other
 appearances not belonging to the object, it is essential that the
 light provided by the condenser shall be as nearly uniform
 and featureless as possible where it reaches the part of the
 object which is being scrutinised. Hence the importance of
 thin sections, and of a very well-corrected condenser.
    The management of stops, and their function, can be better
treated of in Part II. of this memoir, when we can enter into
details. For the present we content ourselves with a very
general proposition, viz. :—
                           PROPOSITION 5.
     The standard image is the outcome, partly of the features
upon the object, and partly of the state of the light by which the
object is illuminated. It may be improved by increasing the
degree in which the <U+FB01>rst qf these factors, and by decreasing the
degree in which the second, contributes to produce, 'to modify,
or to e<U+FB01>‘ace detail in the image.
    18. Proposition 6.—When an object is mounted in a more
refractive medium than that in front of the objective, standard
image No. 1, which depends on the wave-length of the light
as it quits the object, is thereby improved ; but standard image
No. 2 is not enabled to grasp any <U+FB01>ner detail upon the object
than it would have grasped if the object had been in a medium
of the same refractive index as that in front of the objective.

            “Dr. G. J. Stoney on Microscopic Vision.         347
That is, none of the luminous rulings which form the useful
part of standard image No. 2—n0ne of those that represent
any feature of the object, excluding those which produce
false effects like intercostal markings—are made any <U+FB01>ner by
mounting the object in a medium of extra high refractive
index. But nevertheless an important effect is produced, viz.
that the <U+FB01>ner of the rulings are made relatively brighter than
they were before, so that, cceteris paribns, the detail which
they portray becomes more conspicuous.
   This is evident from the accompanying diagram, in which
ab is the front of the objective and o the object.   Both <U+FB01>gures

 parallel waves from the whole surface of the object, the <U+FB01>rst

 a medium of the same refractive index as the cover-glass and
 immersion oil, and the second <U+FB01>gure representing what occurs
 when the object is mounted in an optically denser medium.
  Cwteris paribus, the ratio of the brightness of the beam that
 reaches the objective in the two cases is as cos i/cos r, which

   This is a fraction which the more deviates from unity the
  greater r is, Le. the more oblique the beam. Hence, the
  more oblique beams, which bring out the <U+FB01>ner detail, are
  more increased in brightness than the less inclined, which
  deal with the larger features of the object. Hence
                           PROPOSITION 6.
      Mounting the olg'ect in a Medium of extra high refractive
  index will, caeteris paribus, increase the conspz'cuousness of the
 <U+FB01>ner detail to be seen upon it.
      Of course other factors, some of which may be even more
  potent, have to be taken into consideration, such as the ratio
  of the index of refraction of the Object to that of the medium
  in which it is mounted ; for the farther this ratio is from
 unity, the more conspicuous do all the features of the Object
 become.
      19. Proposition 7. Optical Contact.—Another proposition
  which is of use in interpreting the phenomena presented by
 the microscope is a consequence of the condition of the aether
 in the rare medium when light is totally re<U+FB02>ected from a
 surface separating a dense and a rare medium. What then
 occurs has been investigated by Sir George Stokes, in his
  masterly paper “On the Formation of the Central Spot of.
 Newton’s Rings beyond the Critical Angle ” (vol. ii. Of
 Stokes’s Collected Papers, p. 56). It is therefore only
 necessary here to enunciate the result of that investigation in
 the form in which it explains optical events which the micro
 scopist has occasion to make use of.
      Normally, when a microscopic object is “mounted dry,”
 2'. e. is situated in an air-space between the slip and the
 cover-glass, no rays from it can, while traversing the cover
 glass, be more inclined to the vertical than the “ critical
 angle.” Now immersion objectives are specially designed to
 admit rays that have passed upwards through the cover-glass
 in more inclined directions. Accordingly, when an object
 that is mounted dry is examined by an immersion objective,
 what normally happens is that only a part of the aperture of
 the objective is made use of. The event is, however, different
 if the microscopic object is excessively close to the cover
    lass, owing to the phenomenon investigated by Sir George
    tokes.
      It follows from Sir George Stokes’s investigation that when
 a plane separates an optically dense from a rare medium, then
‘there is a very thin layer of the rare medium of which the
  optical properties are peculiar.    In cases of total re<U+FB01>exion, the

             Dr. G. J. Stoney on Moroscopic Vision.              349
aether within this layer is brought into a disturbed condition. '
The disturbance in reality penetrates further clown, but fades
out by a law so rapid that it is only sensible within a very
short distance (which depends on the wave-length) of the
plane separating the media. The layer of this small thickness,
within which the disturbance is sensible, may be called the .
 Stokes’s Layer.
    It further follows from the investigation, that if light
 emanates from a point within the Stokes’s layer, it will be able
 to pass up through the dense medium at angles that exceed
 the critical angle. It is easy to verify this experimentally.
 Take a glass prism—one of the pendants of a glass chandelier
 is suf<U+FB01>cient. Hold it at the distance of distinct vision from
 the eye, and turn it till the light of the sky is seen like
 a silvery sheen, totally re<U+FB02>ected from the inside of one of its
 faces. Then, without moving the prism or the eye, press a
 piece of chalk against the outside of that face. A small
 portion of the chalk can thereby be brought so close to the
 glass that the intervening chink is less than the thickness of
 the Stokes’s layer.     This small portion of the chalk will then
 be seen through the face Of the prism, while the rest of the
 chalk and the hand that holds it, which are beyond the Stokes’s
 layer, are quite unseen. The light from the chalk, by which
 it is seen, has obviously passed through the glass at an angle
  which is beyond the critical angle. Similarly :

      XXXVI. The Genesis of Dalton’s Atomic 'I'heory.
               By HENRY DEBUS, Ph.l)., F.R.S.*
   IR H. E. ROSGOE and Mr. A. Harden have lately
      published a book 1‘ entitled ‘A New View of the Origin
of Dalton’s Atomic Theory,’ with the following introductory
remarks :—
   “ It may seem remarkable that, after the lapse of nearly a
century,‘since John Dalton <U+FB01>rst applied the atomic theory of
matter to chemical phenomena, it should be possible to <U+FB01>nd
anything new respecting the genesis of his ideas. The ex
planation is to be found in the unlooked for discovery, in the
rooms of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester,
where the whole of Dalton’s experimental work was carried
out, of his Laboratory and Lecture Note-Books contained in
a number of manuscript volumes. A careful study of these
has led us to conclusions concerning the origin of the atomic
theory of Chemistry which differ widely from those which
have been generally accepted.        It has hitherto been supposed
that it was the experimental discovery of the law of combina
tion in multiple proportions which led Dalton, seeking for an
explanation of this most remarkable fact, to the idea that
chemical combination consists in the approximation of atoms of
de<U+FB01>nite and characteristic weight, the atomic theory being thus
adopted to explain the facts discovered by chemical analysis.
. . . The actual relations are, therefore, precisely the inverse
of those which are usually accepted. It was the theory of the
existence of atoms of different weights which led Dalton to
the discovery of the facts of combination in multiple pro
portions.”
   This view of Roscoe and Harden is not new! Two years
ago 1 published a pamphleti, wherein it is clearly stated that
the atomic theory led Dalton to the discovery of the law of
multiple proportions. It is gratifying to me that Dalton’s
Note—books con<U+FB01>rm the view expressed by me in May 1894.
In the same essay (p. 58), I have shown that several years
before Avogadro Dalton had formed the hypothesis that equal
volumes of different gases contain under normal conditions of
temperature and pressure an equal number of molecules.

            The Genesis of Dalton’s Atomic Theory.           351
   According to Roscoe and Harden this latter statement of
mine is not correct. My argument rests, they assert, on a
confusion between the relative density of the atoms and the
relative density of the gases made up of these atoms.
   I cannot allow Dalton’s merits to be set aside in this
manner, and I feel at the same time obliged to show that I
am not guilty of the mistake attributed to me.
   The atomic theory and the law of equal volumes (law of
Avogadro‘) constitute the basis of scienti<U+FB01>c chemistry.     As it
is a matter of importance for everyone to know how the
foundation of his house has been laid, I believe the following
discussion will not be unacceptable to scienti<U+FB01>c chemists,
especially on account of some new matter considered in it.
As Dalton’s nomenclature and views differ in several points
from those now in vogue, a few explanations will be necessary.
The elementary gases consist, according to Dalton, of very
small, indivisible particles, called atoms. Each atom is sur
rounded by an atmosphere of heat of from one to two
thousand times its own size. Whatever, therefore, may be
the shape or <U+FB01>gure of the solid atom abstractedly, when sur
rounded by such an atmosphere it must be globular ; but as
all the globules in any small given volume are subject to the
same pressure, they must be equal in bulk, and will, there
fore, be arranged in horizontal strata, like a pile of shot (NS.
 145). The volume of the molecule of a gas is equal to the
volume of the solid nucleus plus the volume of the atmosphere
 of heat. Compound molecules result from the juxtaposition
 of two or more different atoms. A molecule of oxygen is
composed of only one atom of oxygen, a molecule of carbonic
 oxide of an atom of carbon and one of oxygen. Dalton
 usually employs the word atom ; he calls a molecule of water
 an “atom of water ;” a molecule of ammonia an “atom of
 ammonia.”     I shall express Dalton’s ideas in modern phrase
ology.

                      1. DALron’s ATOMIC THEORY.
      The opinion used to be common amongst chemists * that
 Dalton had originated the idea of indivisible particles (atoms)
 for the explanation of the law of multiple proportions. This,
 however, is not the case. The idea that the objects of ob
 servation are a gregates of exceedingly small indivisible par
 ticles is oldert an science itself; it is attributed to a Phe
 nician philosopher, Moschus, living at Sidon at about 1100 B.G.
 (D. 35). His views, developed by the Greeks, were forgotten
after the destruction of the Roman empire, but resuscitated
by Gassendi about the middle of the 17th century. Boyle,
 who called the atomic hypothesis the Phenician philosophy 1',
 applied it to the explanation of chemical phenomena, and
 Newton to the explanation of_ Boyle’s law.         Also the chemists
 of the last century employed the atomic doctrine for the
illustration of chemical change (D. 38—40). Dalton, who
seems to have obtained the idea of atoms from Newton (R. 13,
123), applied it, almost from the beginning of his scienti<U+FB01>c
career, to the explanation of physical phenomena, such as
diffusion, absorption, and expansion.          In '1803-he discovered
a method how to determine the relative weight of atoms, and
added to the atomic philosophy a series Of principles.            The
group of principles so added by Dalton I propose to call
Dalton’s “ atomic theory.”
     The‘main points are :—

vol. i. p. 228.

                    Dalton’s Atomic Theory.                 353
   (1) When only one combination of two bodies, A and B,
         can be obtained, it must be supposed to be a binary
         one, a compound of one atom of A with one atom of
         B, unless some cause appear to the contrary.
       When two combinations are known, they must be pre
         sumed to be a binary (A+B) and a ternary (Ari-B)
         or (A—l— B2).
   (3) “Then three combinations are obtained, we may expect
         one to be a binary and the other two ternary.
   (4) When four combinations are observed, we should ex—
         pect one binary, two ternary, and one quaternary
        (A3+ B) or (A + Ba).
   (5) A binary compound should always be speci<U+FB01>cally
         heavier than the mere mixture of its two ingredients.
   (6) A ternary compound should be speci<U+FB01>cally heavier than
         the mixture of a binary and a simple which would,
         if combined, constitute it ; &c.
   (7) The above rules and observations equally apply when
         two bodies, such as (C+D) and (D+E) are com
         bined (N.S. 214).
   The question is : How did Dalton arrive at these principles ?
Roscoe and Harden think that the answer to this question is
contained in some notes which Dalton had written down for
a lecture delivered in London on Jan. 27th, 1810 (R. 13).
   The pertinent passages of the notes are as follows :—
   “As the ensuing lectures on the subject of chemical ele
ments and their combinations will perhaps be thought by
many to possess a good deal of novelty as well as importance,
it may be proper to give a brief historical sketch of the train
of thought and experience which led me to the conclusions
about-to be detailed.
   “ Having been long accustomed to make meteorological
observations, and to speculate upon the nature and constitu
tion of the atmosphere, it often struck me with wonder how a
compound atmosphere, or a mixture of two or more elastic
<U+FB02>uids, should constitute apparently a homogeneous mass, or
one in all mechanical relations agreeing with a simple atmo
sphere.”
    In explanation of the foregoing remarks it may be men—
 tioned that the molecules of all gases, therefore the atoms of
 the constituents of the atmosphere, oxygen and nitrogen, were
 at the time assumed by Dalton to be of equal volume: in
 other words, equal volumes of oxygen and nitrogen gas would,
 under normal conditions, contain an equal number of mole
 cules (NS. 188). Hence the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of an atom of
   Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 42. N0. 257. Oct. 1896.        2O

354               Dr. H. Debus on the Genesis of
oxygen must be greater than the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of an atom
of nitrogen.
    This view, in connexion with the general theory of gases
then in vogue, led to the conclusion that, in a mixture of
oxygen and nitrogen, the heavier atoms of oxygen ought to
form a layer at the bottom of the vessel and the lighter
nitrogen atoms a separate layer at the top.
    Experiments, on the other hand, proved that air, taken
 from different heights, was of uniform composition. Dalton
 also found that a lighter gas, placed above a heavier gas, will
 gradually diffuse downwards (N.S. 151). To explain these
 observations a weak chemical affinity was assumed between
 the molecules of different gases. The globular molecules
 Dalton considered to be arranged like a pile of shot (N .S.
 145, 147), and as all the molecules are subject to the same
 pressure and exert the same counter-pressure, the must be
 all, independent of their nature, of the same size ( .S. 188),
 ‘               M/S_T_M//Sl=Mll/Sll___lyl/ll/SlllI
 The air is composed of 77'88 vols. of nitrogen, 21'2 vols. of
oxygen, and 0066 vol. of carbonic acid. Hence, according
to the above law, for every molecule of carbonic acid there
are 31'8 mols. of oxygen and 118 mols. of nitrogen present in
our atmosphere.                                                 '
    Now, if a weak chemical a<U+FB02>inity is the cause of di<U+FB01>'usion,
 then compounds of a very complicated nature must result.
 This appeared to Dalton very improbable, and accordingly he
 rejected the chemical explanation of the diffusion of gases.
    Dalton goes on with his notes as follows :—
    “In the year 1801 I hit upon an hypothesis (NS. 153)
 which completely obviated these dif<U+FB01>culties. According to
 this, we were to suppose that the atoms of one kind did not
 repel the atoms of another kind, but only those of their own
 kind. This hypothesis most effectually provided for the dif
 fusion of any one gas through another, whatever might be
 their speci<U+FB01>c gravities, and perfectly reconciled any mixture
'of gases to the Newtonian theorem (R. 15). Every atom of
 both or all the gases in the mixture was the centre of repul
  sion to the proximate particles of its own kind, disregarding
 those of the other kind. All the gases united their effort in
  counteracting the pressure of the atmosphere, or any other
  pressure that might be opposed to them. This hypothesis,
   owever beautiful might be its application, had some impro
‘bable features. We were to suppose as many distinct kinds
  of repulsive power as of gases; and, moreover, to-suppose

                     Dalton’s Atomic Tlieory.                 355
that heat was not the repulsive power in any one case ;
positions certainly not very probable.
   “ Upon reconsidering this subject, it occurred to me that I
had never contemplated the effect of difference of size in the
particles of elastic <U+FB02>uids, or when the expression M/S=C is
of different value for different gases. And if the sizes be"
different, then on the supposition that the repulsive power is
heat, no equilibrium can be established by particles of unequal
sizes pressing against each other.
   “This idea occurred to me in 1805. I soon found that the
sizes of the particles of elastic <U+FB02>uids must be different. For
a measure of HZOtiO gas and one of oxygen, if chemically
united, would make nearly two measures of nitric oxide, and
those two could not have more molecules of nitric oxide than
one measure had of oxygen or nitrogen.
   “Hence the suggestion that all gases of different kinds
have a difference in the size of their molecules ; and thus we
arriVe at the reason for that diffusion of every gas through
every other gas, without calling in any other repulsive power
than the well-known one of heat.
    “This then is the present view which I have of the consti
tution of a mixture of elastic <U+FB02>uids (year 1810). The different
 sizes of the particles of elastic <U+FB02>uids under like circumstances
 of temperature and pressure being once established, it became
 an object to determine the relative sizes and weights, together
 with the relative number of atoms in a given volume. This
 led the way to the combinations of gases, and the number of
 atoms entering into such combinations, the particulars of
 which will be detailed more at large in the sequel . . . . . "
 (R. 13—17).                                                      ‘

    “The balance of evidence is, therefore, strongly in favour of
 the statement made in London by Dalton himself in 1810, that
 he was led to the atomic theory Of chemistry in the <U+FB01>rst
 instance by purely physical considerations in opposition to
 the view hitherto held by chemists, that the discovery by
 Dalton of the fact of combination in multiple propOItions led
 him to devise the atomic theory as an explanation. It, there»
 fore, becomes necessary for us to modify our view as to the
 foundation of the atomic theory. There seems to be no
 doubt that the idea of atomic structure arose in Dalton’s
 mind as a purely physical conception, forced upon him by
 his study of the physical properties of the atmosphere and
 other gases. Confronted, in the course of his study, with
 the problem of ascertaining the relative diameters of the par

356               Dr. H. Debus on the Genesis of
ticles, of which, he was <U+FB01>rmly convinced, all gases were made
up, he had recourse to the results of chemical analysis.
Assisted by the assumption that combination always takes
place, in the simplest possible way, he thus arrived at the idea
 that combination takes place between particles of different
 weights, and this it was which di<U+FB01>erentiated his theory from
 the historic speculations of the Greeks. The extension of
 this idea to substances in general necessarily led him to the
 law of combination in multiple proportions, and the com
 parison with experiment brilliantly con<U+FB01>rmed the truth of his
 deduction ” (B. 49—51).
   - The problem of ascertaining the relative diameters, or rather
 the relative volumes, of the molecules of different gases, led
 Dalton, according to Roscoe and Harden, to the invention of
 the atomic theory. In the pamphlet mentioned before (p. 350),
 I have stated that Dalton wished to verify the hypothesis
 M/S=C, viz. to ascertain whether the molecular volumes of
 different gases are of equal or of different magnitudes. For
 this purpose he required to know the respective molecular
 and atomic weights. This necessity led him to the formation
 of the atomic theory (D. 58).
     I am much pleased to observe that, with regard to the
 problem which originated the atomic theory, Roscoe and
 Harden, after a careful study of Dalton’s note-books, arrive
 at the same view which I published two years ago, but I
 regret very much that I cannot approve the reasons which
 have guided their judgment.
     The <U+FB01>rst assertion of Roscoe and Harden, “the balance of
  evidence is, therefore, strongly in favour of the statement
  made in London by Dalton himself in 1810, that he was led
  to the atomic theory of chemistry, in the <U+FB01>rst instance, by
  purely physical considerations,” I have not met, nor do I
  remember to have seen in any of Dalton's writings, nor am I
  able to deduce such an assertion from Dalton’s notes, quoted
  before. These notes treat of two distinct subjects, the
' theories of gaseous diffusion and the problems of the atomic
  theory. The description passes abruptly from the one to the
  other without any connecting link.       How did Dalton get
  over the chasm which separates the two?        We want to know
  the genesis of Dalton’s methods of determining atomic weights.
  This, the essence of the matter, Messrs. Roscoe and Harden
  pass over in silence I
      Dalton explained the diffusion of gases on the assumption
  that the molecules of different gases are not of the same size.
  The question, therefore, was, Are the molecules of diHerent
  gases really of unequal volume? “I soon found,” says

                     Dalton’.9 Atomic Theory.                357
Dalton,” that the sizes of the particles of gases must be dif
ferent. For a measure of azotic gas and one of oxygen, if
chemically united, would make nearly two measures of nitric
oxide, and those two could not have more atoms (molecules)
of nitric oxide than one measure had of azote or oxygen.
Hence the suggestion that all gases of ditferent kinds have a
diiference in the size of their molecules ; and thus we arrive
at the reason for that diifusion of every gas through evvry
other gas . . . . ” (B. 16—17). The old view of Dalton, that
in gases the force of cohesion is quite overcome by the force
of repulsion, and that, in consequence, the particles of the
elementary gases consist of single atoms, would lead to the
conclusion which he drew from the volumetric proportions of
nitrogen and oxygen in nitric oxide, without requiring the
atomic theory as described on p. 353.
   Passing on to the atomic theory we have the remarks :—
“ The ditferent sizes of the particles of gases, under like ,
circumstances of temperature and pressure, being once estab
lished, it became an object to determine the relative sizes and
weights together with the relative number of atoms in a given
volume.”
   If we remember that these quotations are not from a running
narrative, but from notes intended for a. lecture, where the
lecturer could at any moment make verbal explanations and
additions, then we may ask whether, between the notes on the
diffusion of gases and those on the atomic theory, there is, or
there is not, a connexion similar to the one between cause and
etfect, as Roscoe and Harden assume? On this point Dalton is
absolutely silent.   We wish to know the origin of the methods
by means of which Dalton determined the size, weight, and
numbers of the atoms ; and we cannot discern how he arrived
at these methods from his theory of gaseous diffusion. Messrs.
Roscoe and Harden do not say one word on this subject. May
not Dalton have been engaged in the calculation of molecular
and atomic weights and molecular volumes before he recog
nized that the size of the molecules of different gases MUST be
different? A few facts show that he was so engaged.
   The idea of considering the in<U+FB02>uence of the size of the mole
cules on difusion occurred to Dalton, according to his own
statement, in 1805. The result of his consideration was the
abandonment of the theory of diffusion formed in 1801 (de
scribed on pp. 354, 355), and the formation of a new view,
which ascribed ditfusion to difference of size of the molecules
of the diffusing gases.              .
   This new view is, according to Roscoe and Harden, the
source of Dalton’s atomic theory. If so, then the atomic

358              Dr. _H_, Debus on the Genesis of
theory cannot have been formed before the year 1805.           But
Roscoe and Harden found in Dalton’s note-book a table of
atomic weights dated the 6th of September, 1803.         This date
 shows that the theory is at least two years older than it ought
to be according to Roscoe and Harden’s view (R. 29). hi
 order to get over this dif<U+FB01>culty, they assume (R. 25) that
 Dalton committed a clerical error by writing 1805 instead of
 1803 in his description of the formation of the theory of
 diffusion based on an unequal size of the particles. Dalton
 does not say that the theory of diffusion led him to the con'
 ception of the atomic theory. The statement that it did do so
 is only an inference of Messrs. Roscoe and Harden. Therefore
 they are not justi<U+FB01>ed in attributing a clerical error to him, and
 transferring the conception of the theory of diffusion from 1805
 to 1803.
    Dalton’s paper, “ Experimental Enquiry into the Pro
portions of the several Gases or Elastic Fluids constituting
the Atmosphere,” was printed in the ‘ Memoirs of the Literar
and Philosophical Society of Manchester,’ second series, vol. 1.
1805, under Dalton’s supervision as Secretary of the Society
 (R. 31). We have in this paper the following remarks on the
principle that the elastic or repulsive power of each molecule
is con<U+FB01>ned to its own kind :—“ This principle accords with all
experience, and, I have no doubt, will soon be perceived and
acknowledged by Chemists and Philosophers in general”
(Al. 5). Now this principle is the principle of the theory of
diffusion formed in 1801 (pp. 354, 355); consequently he must
have still held this theory in 1805, at the time when the aper
was printed, and the theory of diffusion which superseifed it
must have been formed at a later period in the year 1805.
Therefore this later theory of the diffusion of gases cannot have
been the origin of the atomic theory of 1803. The conclusion
we arrive at is : “ The opinion of Roscoe and Harden that the
theory of the diffusion of gases of 1805 led Dalton to the con
ception of his atomic theory is not in accordance with facts.”
          II. The Genesis of Dalton’s Atomic TMary.
    The notes published by Roscoe and Harden enable me to
render my view of the genesis of this theory, described on

    In order to explain equilibrium in a mixture of gases,
Dalton had adopted, in the year 1801, the hypothesis M/S: C.
But he was not able for several years to test his conception by
experiments, as no method was known for the determination
of M, the molecular weight. The desire to discover such a.
method made him, probably, very observant of all circum
stances which could promote his wish (N.S. 187—188).

    Two factors determine every great advance in science—a
 fact, and a mind prepared for the full and complete appre
 ciation of the fact. Moreover, the fact must be at hand when
 it is wanted by the mind. These conditions were satis<U+FB01>ed
 when Galileo observed the oscillating lamp in the Cathedral
 of Pisa; when Newton saw the falling apple; when Malus
  observed the ray re<U+FB02>ected from the window of the Luxem
  bourg ; when Lavoisier was informed of the discovery of
 oxygen by Scheele and Priestley (D. 20—21).
    The discovery of oxygen is the great fact with which the
 history of scienti<U+FB01>c chemistry commences ; but neither of the
 discoverers—neither Priestley nor Scheele—recognized the
 signi<U+FB01>cance of the discovery. Lavoisier’s mind was the good
 soil wherein the seed bore fruit, because it was well prepared
 by a careful repetition of the experiments of Black and Meyer.
These experiments prove that carbonates are combinations of
 a gas which can be transferred from one base to another.
 Quicklime absorbs carbonic acid from the atmosphere and
 turns into carbonate of lime. These facts raised in Lavoisier-’s
 mind the question : Do metals absorb a gas from the atmo
 sphere during calcination? The answer from his own expe
 riments was a decided “ Yes.” But as he could not prepare
.the gas absorbed, the investigation could not proceed. Then,
just at the right moment, Scheele and Priestley informed
 Lavoisier of the discovery of oxygen, and the antiphlogistic
 chemistry was born (D. 21).
    Dalton, the meteorologist, wished to determine the compo
 sition of the atmosphere.       For this purpose be tried the
 absorption of oxygen with nitric oxide. In his note-book
occurs the following memorandum, dated August 4th, 1803:—
    “ It appears, too, that a very rapid mixture of equal parts
 of common air and nitric oxide give 112 or 120 residuum.
 Consequently, that oxygen joins to nitric oxide sometimes
 1'7: 1 or at other times 3'4: 1 ” (R. 38, Al. 8).
_ In the Essay on the Composition of the Atmosphere occurs
the remark, “These facts clearly point to the theory of the
process ; the elements of oxygen may combine with a certain
portion of nitric oxide, or with twice that portion, but with no
intermediate quantity ” (R. 33, Al. 9).
    A month after the date of the above note, on September 6th,
 1803, the note-book contains a list of atomic weights (R. 29),
and on the 19th of the same month the diameters of the
molecules of a certain number of gases were written down
  H.111).
 ( May we venture to conclude, on the strength of these facts,
that the observations of the proportions in which nitric oxide
and oxygen combine over water originated in Dalton’s mind

360              Dr. H. Debus on the Genesis of
the idea that the atoms combine chemically only according to
very small numbers—one atom ofA with one, two, or three atoms
0 B ? There are strong reasons in support of this conclusion.
   alton, who for some years had held the hypothesis M/S=O
(NS. 188), who was accustomed to explain expansion, diffu
sion, solution, &c., in a mechanical way by means of the old
atomic theory, as Boyle did 120 years before Dalton’s time,
was naturally led by the observation of the combining pro
portions of oxygen and nitric oxide to the view that in simple
compounds one atom of A is united to one or two atoms of
B. His previous speculations and observations (p. 354) had
prepared him for this conception, and once the idea was
formed the transition to the tenets described on p. 353 was
easy.    Proust and others had made observations like Dalton,
but to none had this explanation occurred.
    My present view of the origin of Dalton’s atomic theory
is :—
    Dalton wished to verify the hypothesis M/S=C ; for this
purpose he endeavoured to <U+FB01>nd methods for the determination
of the atomic and molecular weights. The observations of the
combining proportions of nitric oxide and oxygen sug ested
to him a principle which enabled him to form such met ods.
    In judging this view, one has to remember that the obser
vations on the combining proportions of oxygen and nitric
oxide noted on August 4th, 1803, were followed within a
month by calculations of atomic weights and the diameters of
atoms and molecules.      (R. 38 and 41.)
              III. Roscoe and Harden’s Critique.
    The <U+FB01>rst part of my view of the genesis of Dalton’s atomic
theory, described above, is, according to Roscoe and Harden,
not correct. They say :—
    “ The view expressed by Debus, that the use of the term
speci<U+FB01>c gravities by Thomson in his account of the atomic
 theory implied the acceptance of the law M/S: C by Dalton in
 1804, is also seen to be incorrect.   Dalton expressly states in
 1803 (R. 27) that the speci<U+FB01>c gravities of different gases and
 the speci<U+FB01>c gravities of their particles are not the same thing.
 He never appears to have believed in the law M/S=O, and
 this only occurred to him as a possible alternative, at once
 shown to be inconsistent with fact, to the statement which he
 recognized as the true one, viz. that no two gases agree in
 the size of their particles” (R. 47).
    In order to form a correct opinion of the assertions contained
 in this quotation, we must go back and consider the statements
 of Dalton on which these assertions are founded.

                   Dalton’s Atomic Theory.                    361
   Dalton, in his Notebook, i. p. 246 (B. 27), has the following
memorandum :—
   “ Though it is probable that the speci<U+FB01>c ravities of different
elastic <U+FB02>uids (gases) has some relation to t at of their ultimate
particles, yet it is certain that they are not the same thing;
for the ulterior particles of water or steam ' are certainly
of greater speci<U+FB01>c gravity than those of oxygen, yet the last
is heavier than steam.”
    Instead of building on the dictum contained in this quotation
weighty conclusions, as Messrs. Roscoe and Harden do, I
confess that I do not understand it. What is the difference
between the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of a gas and that of one of its
ulterior particles or molecules? According to Dalton, the
molecular volume is =M/S (N.S. 226, note). The speci<U+FB01>c
gravity of a molecule, 8, is expressed by the quotient of the
molecular weight and molecular volume :
                Molecular weight _ M_ __
                                                S=s.
                Molecular volume _ M/S _
 Hence, S, the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the gas, =8, the speci<U+FB01>c
 gravity of one of its molecules ; or, in other words, both are
 the same thing. This result follows from Dalton’s de<U+FB01>nition
 of the molecular volume, and is opposed to his assertion that
 the speci<U+FB01>c gravities of gases and the speci<U+FB01>c gravities of their
 molecules are not the same thing, and also to the conclusions
 of Roscoe and Harden, based on this erroneous assertion.
 Therefore it does not follow that Dalton did never believe in the'
  hypothesis M/S =0, or that the <U+FB01>rst part of my view stated on
  p. 360 is incorrect.
     Messrs. Roscoe and Harden assert that he (Dalton) “never
 appears to have believed in the law of equal volumes (hypo
 thesis M/S=C), and this only occurred to him as a possible
  alternative, at once shown to be inconsistent with fact, to the
  statement which he recognized as the true one, viz. that no
 two gases agree in the size of their particles ” (R. 47).
     What does Dalton himself say on this subject ?—-“ At the
  time I formed the theor of mixed gases (year 1801) I had a
  confused idea, as many have, I suppose, at this time, that the
  particles of gases are all of the same size, that a given volume
  of oxygen contains just as many particles as the same volume
  of hydrogen ” (NS. 188). And with regard to the statement
  “that no two gases agree in the size of their particles,” he
  says, “This idea occurred to me in 1805.” Therefore the
  idea that a given volume of oxygen contains just as many
  particles as the same volume of hydrogen occurred to Dalton
  at least four years before the time at which he recognized

 362               Dr. H. Debus‘ on the Genesis of
 ‘-‘ that no two gases agree in the size of their particles.”   Con
 sequently, the <U+FB01>rst idea (M/S=C) did not “ occur to him only
 as a possible alternative, at once shown to be inconsistent with
 fact, to the statement which he recognized as the true one, viz.
 that no two elastic <U+FB02>uids agree in the size of their particles,”
 but was held by Dalton, more or less, from 1801 to 1805, and
 only abandoned when he could not bring it into agreement
 with his later atomistic views.
  . It has been shown on p. 361 that the memorandum in Dalton’s
 Note—book, i. p. "246, is not correct, and that the speci<U+FB01>c gravity
 of a gas and the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of one of its molecules are the
 same thing. But how, we may ask, could Dalton contradict
 his own de<U+FB01>nition? On p. 260 of his Note-book, i. (R. 42),
 occurs a table with the following heading :—“ The molecules
 of gases arranged according to their speci<U+FB01>c gravities ;” and
 then follow in arithmetical order the molecular weights of
 eleven gases. The speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the molecules and the
 molecular weights are therefore expressed by the same
 number.
      If M represents the molecular weight, s the speci<U+FB01>c gravity,
 and o the volume of a molecule, we have
                               M/v = 8.
As M is put :8, 1: must be =1 ; and as this relation is
assumed to be general, all gases have the same molecular
volume, or M/S=C. Hence the molecular weight and the
speci<U+FB01>c gravity of a molecule are then, according to the table,
“the same thing.”
      If we now substitute in Dalton’s memorandum quoted on
p. 361, which is not intelligible by itself, for the words “ spe
ci<U+FB01>c gravities of molecules” the words “molecular weights,”
we obtain :—“ Though it is probable that the specific gravities
of different elastic <U+FB02>uids (gases) has some relation to their
molecular weights, yet it is certain that they are not the same
 thing ”       27)-—a perfectly intelligible statement.
      Therefore,on p. 246 of Note-book, i., the hypothesis M/S: C
      HJOW are and
is re'ected,            p. 260 accepted.
               theseoncontradictory  statements to be explained?
      On . 188 of his celebrated work, ‘ New System of Che
mical hilosophy,’ Dalton says :—“ At the time 1 formed the
theory of mixed gases, I had a confused idea, as many have,
'I suppose, at this time, that the particles of gases are all of the
same size.” Consequently there was a time when Dalton
believed in the hypothesis M/S=C, and his endeavour was
to verify the same by experiment. Accordingly, he lost no
time in calculating M for oxygen and steam, as soon as he had

                         Dalton’s Atomic Theory.                                       363
formed his atomic theory. According to this theory, the mole
cular weight of steam ought to be greater than the molecular
weight of oxygen, and this result in connexion with the hypo
thesis M /S==O would require the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of steam to
be greater than the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of oXygen. Experiments
gave opposite results ; they made the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of
oxygen reater than the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of steam. Hence,
one of t e two—the new atomic theory or the hypothesis
M/S=U—must be wrong. Dalton rejected the latter (Note
book, i. p. 246).
   The extension of the investigation to other gases, however,
furnished several examples which gave nearly the same value
for M/S=C. Note-book, i. p. 258 (R. 41), contains a table of
12 gases with their speci<U+FB01>c gravities and Dalton’s molecular
weights. I have recalculated the speci<U+FB01>c gravities on the
unit of hydrogen, and in place of the diameters of molecules
calculated by Dalton I have deemed it suf<U+FB01>cient to give the
molecular volume, M/S.

364              Dr. H. Debus on the Genesis of
 ' The values of M/S=C are dependent on the speci<U+FB01>c
gravities, the chemical composition, and the theories about the
constitution of gases. The composition of water is, according
 to Lavoisier, 85 pts. of oxygen and 15 pts. of hydrogen,
according to Gay-Lussac and Humboldt 874 pts. of oxygen
and 126 pts. of hydrogen. Lavoisicr’s numbers make the
 atomic weight of oxygen =5'66, Gay-Lussac’s and Hum
boldt's =7. The errors of observation in Dalton’s time were
so considerable that he might have assumed for from 50 to
 66 per cent. of the gases in the above list the same molecular
volume. The num ers obtained for M/S=C, therefore, left
it undecided whether the hypothesis, that equal volumes of
different gases contain the same number of molecules, is true
or not true. The probabilities are, perhaps, slightly in favour
of the hypothesis. This seems to have caused Dalton to
return to his old view, that the particles of gases are all of
the same size, or M/S=C. This is my explanation of the
contradictory statements on two pages, 246 and 260, of his
Note-book, i. (R. 27, 42) (pp. 361, 362). The near agreement
of several of the numbers of M/S in the last table caused a
series of new experimental investigations. Dalton, who up
to this time had done very little practical work in chemistry,
now began with great zeal to determine the composition of
important substances, such as ammonia, marsh-gas, and ole
<U+FB01>ant-gas. The results of these investigations, as far as they
concern gases, are collected in a table at the end of the second
part of the New System.
   Five out of 16 gases, or 31 per cent., and if errors of ob
servation of 2 per cent. are allowed three more, or, together,
50 per cent. of the gases examined, possess the same molecular
volume. Dalton’s experiments have not explained why
50 per cent. of the gases examined do not conform to the
hypothesis M/S=C, and they could not do so, the chemical
knowledge of the day not being suf<U+FB01>ciently advanced. As a
matter of fact, it has required the practical work of half a
century to convert the hypothesis M/S=C into an empirical
law. -
   Thomas Thomson, the author of the celebrated work “ Sys
tem of Chemistry,’ himself a chemist of eminence, paid a visit
to his friend Dalton in August 1804. On this occasion the
latter communicated to him the principles of the new atomic
theory and the results obtained by their application. In
1807 a new edition of the ‘System of Chemistry ’ came out,
in which Thomson, with Dalton’s permission, published a.
sketch of the new theory (vol. iii. p. 424). Thomson’s de
scription is extremely clear' and accurate, and Dalton has, as

                    Dalton’.s Atomic Theo'r'y.               365
far as I know,never taken exception to any of its statements.
Now Thomson always calls the relative weight of atoms the
“ density of atoms.’ His table of molecular weights is called
table of the density of atoms (molecules) (vol. iii. p. 429).
Elementary physics teaches that the weights and densities of
substances are proportional when the substances under con
sideration are of the same volume. If we say for density
speci<U+FB01>c gravity, then Thomson’s report of Dalton’s atomic
views, and Dalton’s statement in Note-book, i. p. 260 (R. 42)
are in perfect agreement. Accordingly, Dalton had not, in
August 1804, thrown the hypothesis M/S=C overboard. He
did so in the followin year, 1805, when he could not bring it
into agreement with is atomistic views (p. 35l) ; and when
he found it refractory in this respect, he called it “ a confused
idea” (NS. 188).
    Messrs. Roscoe and Harden charge me on pp. 10—11 of
their book with a “confusion of ideas.” They say :—“ Debus
further argues that when Dalton communicated his theory to
Thomson, he must have held the opinion that these two
relations, the relative density and the relative weight of the
atoms, were identical, or what Debus appears to consider to
be the same thing, that the relative densities of the gases
were identical with the relative weight 'of their atoms. . . .
 (_)n the strength of this argument, which appears to rest
on a confusion between the relative density of the atoms and
the relative density of the gases made up of those atoms. . . .”
 1 have not asserted that the relative weight and the relative
density of the atoms were IDENTICAL. I have expressed my
 self in the following manner :—“ We must conclude that
 Dalton, at the time when he communicated his ideas to
 Thomson, considered that the molecular weights of the gases
 stand to each other in the same ratio as the densities of their
 molecules” (D. 51) . As for the confusion between the relative
 density of the atoms or molecules and the relative density of
 the gases made up of those atoms or molecules, I must refer
 to p. 361, where it has been shown, if we write for densitv
 speci<U+FB01>c gravity, that according to Dalton’s own de<U+FB01>nition,
t e speci<U+FB01>c gravity of a gas is equal to the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of
 one of its molecules. Therefore, the cmlfusz'on is not on my
side!
     The Italian physicist Amadeo Avogadro became acquainted
 with Dalton’s atomic theory throu h Thomson’s report (0.
 no. 8, p. 7, note). He puts on Thomson’s statements the
 same interpretation as I do. Dalton’s object is to <U+FB01>nd the
 atomic weights of the elements, and the molecular weights of

 366             Dr. H. Debus on the Genesis of
 the compounds formed of these elements. The sum of the
 weights of the atoms in a molecule is his molecular weight.
    Avogadro determines the molecular weights directly from
 the speci<U+FB01>c gravities of the gases. The molecular weight is,
 if I may say so, the end of Dalton’s and the beginning of Avo
 gadro’s work.     About the constituents of the molecules, the
 atoms, Avogadro is absolutely silent.         He knows only mole
 cules and parts of molecules. Whether there is or is not a
 limit to the division of a molecule he does not say. Avogadro
 treats the subject like a theoretic mechanician, who considers
 his particles divisible or not, according to the nature of his
 problem.    The unit of Dalton is the indivisible atom, the unit
 of Avogadro the divisible molecule (D. 70).
    It is worthy of notice that Avogadro is not conscious of
 these differences between Dalton and himself. He criticises
 Dalton’s work as if he and Dalton were engaged with the
 solution of the same problems, and calling attention to the
 agreement of some of his results with those of Dalton, he
 says :—“ This agreement is in favour of our hypothesis,
which is essentially nothing else but the system of Dalton
improved by a sure expedient*-to which we have been led by
 the facts diSCOVGI‘ed by Gay-Lussac ” (0. no. 8, p. 22).
   Avogadro could only identify his system with Dalton’s on the
assumption that both systems rested on the same principle.
This principle is the hy othesisM/S = 0. As Avogadro received
his information about alton’s work from Thomson, it follows
that he put the same interpretation on Thomson’s words as I
have done, and as the latter published his book in the year
 1807, and Avogadro his essay in 1811, it appears highly
probable that Avogadro received the <U+FB01>rst intimation of the
hypothesis M/S = C from Dalton.                 The great merit of
Avogadro is founded on his proposal to consider the mole
cules of the elementary gases divisible into two or more parts,
because thereby the hypothesis M/S=G became of practical
importance.
    But are the hypothetical molecular weights of Avogadro
the real molecular weights? This question could only be
answered by the synthesis of the molecules from the con
stituent atoms.    The sum of their weights is the molecular
weight.    Therefore, logically considered, the atomic weights
must precede the molecular weights. The determination of
the atomic weights was, accordingly, the task of Dalton and
his generation.     This is the real reason why the hypothesis

    Chemists have often wondered why Dalton did not acknow-'
ledge as correct the observations of Gay-Lussac that gases
always combine in simple volumetric proportions.              Various
improbable or absurd reasons* have been assigned for his
reluctance to adopt the. results of the distinguished French‘
chemist.     The real reason is near at hand.           Dalton could
not accept Gay—Lussac’s law of the combination of gases in
simple volumetric proportions, because, if he had done so, he
would have abandoned the chief principle of his atomic theory;
I will illustrate this assertion by an example. The <U+FB01>rst
principle of Dalton is, that when two elements form only'
one compound, the compound is a binary one unless some
cause appears to the contrary.
    Only one compound of hydrogen and oxygen and only
one compound of hydrogen and nitrogen were known, hence~
the formula of the <U+FB01>rst would be HO and of the second HN.
Nitric oxide, on account of its low speci<U+FB01>c gravity, was like.
wise considered to be a binary compound of the formula N0.
 (N5. 317.) Water, according to Gay-Lussac, is a compound
of one volume of oxygen and two volumes of hydrogen. If we
assume one volume of hydrogen to contain 1000 atoms
 (molecules), then, if Dalton’s formula H0 is right, one
volume of oxygen must contain 2000 atoms.
    Nitric oxide is formed, according to Gay-Lussac, of one
volume of nitrogen and one volume of oxygen. Therefore,
if Dalton’s formula NO is correct, one volume of nitrogen,
like one volume of oxygen, must contain 2000 atoms. Hence
we have :—
               one volume of hydrogen 1000 atoms,
               one volume of oxygen 2000
              one volume of nitrogen 2000 ,,
Now Gay-Lussac asserts that ammonia is a compound of one
volume of nitrogen and three volumes of hydrogen—
              one volume of nitrogen           2000 atoms,
               three volumes of hydrogen 3000 ,,
and its formula would be N2H3 if Gay-Lussac’s observations
are correct.
    Dalton’s principle requires the formula NH. Hence the
alternative presented itself to Dalton either to reject his <U+FB01>rst
principle or Gay-Lussac’s observation. As the atomic theory

was strongly supported by experience he rejected Gay
Lussac’s law, and considered his own inaccurate observations
to be correct and the more exact results of the French chemist
to be faulty.
     Some of the results of this investigation are :—
     (1) Dalton was investigating the state of equilibrium in
mixed gases in the year 1801. This investigation caused him
to adopt the hypothesis M/S=C.
     (2) it is highly probable that the hypothesis M/S=C and
the observations of the proportions in which nitric oxide and
oxygen combine led Dalton to the invention of his atomic
theor    .
     (3 yAtomistic  views caused Dalton to abandon the hypothesis
M/S=C in the year 1805.
     (4) If we remember that all theories in chemistry are of a
provisional character, and that they are subject to changes in
course of time, then we cannot deny our admiration to the
great work of "Dalton. It was he who <U+FB01>rst attempted to
weigh molecules and atoms and measure their volumes.

The Intellectual Rise in Electricity; a. History.    By PARK BEN
    JAMIN, Ph.D., LLB.      London: Longmans, 1895.
THE electrical properties of rubbed amber and the phenomena
        exhibited by the lodestone have been known since the very
earliest historic times; their discovery was probably coeval with
those of amber and lodestone. While the electrical fact remained
for many centuries isolated and apparently useless, the orientation
of suspended lodestone or of magnets derived from it soon sug
gested the mariner’s compass and led to important advances in
magnetic science, followed later by theories of attraction and repul
sion. In the work before us Dr. Benjamin traces in a very inter
esting manner the development of these facts and theories up till
 the time of Franklin, when the recognition of electricity as a
natural force led to its being more universally studied. The
author has searched among the manuscripts and books of many
 lands and all ages in order to <U+FB01>nd material for his history, and he
 has even been assisted by the labours of those who have investi—
 gated the ruins and records of ancient civilization in Phoenicia,
 Egypt, and Scandinavia. Such a search necessarily occupies many
years, and we owe its satisfactory termination to the author’s
 patience and enthusiasm for his subject.
   - A very plausible theory is put forward to account for the intro
 duction of the lodestone into Europe. It is supposed that the
 inhabitants of Central Asia <U+FB01>rst became acquainted with its pro
   erties; migrating eastwards as Mongols they carried the know
 ledge into China, and travelling north-westward as Finns and

               lVotz'ces respecting New Books.                     369
Lapps they introduced navigation by compass into Scandinavia.
The subsequent dissemination of the knowledge to various Euro—
pean ports took place through the medium of traders to the Baltic.
“ Viwere fortes ante Gilbertum,” if we may be pardoned for altering
Horace; the author has discovered at least two such philosophers,
Neckam and Peregrinus. We cannot agree with Dr. Benjamin
in his criticism of a statement by Peregrinus (p. 174), which he
considers erroneous. Concerning the rubbing of iron against lode
stone or a magnet Peregrinus writes: “ You will infer what part of
the iron is attracted to each part of the heavens from knowing
that the part of the iron which has touched the southern part of
the magnet is turned to the northern part of the sky. The con
trary will happen with respect to that end of the iron which has
touched the north part of the stone, namely, it will direct itself
towards the south.” For the thirteenth century this is surely a
very concise and straightforward description, contrasting greatly
with the author’s confusion of true north polarity and north-seeking
magnetism.
   The volume contains several reproductions of interesting old
prints and good portraits of Gilbert, von Gucricke, and Franklin.

An Introductory Treatise on the Lunar Theory. By E. W. BROWN,
   M.A., Professor of Applied Mathematics in Haverford College,
   Pa. (Cambridge University Press.)
11‘ may be said, and indeed it has been remarked by foreign and
English writers alike, that the English student of mathematics is
exceedingly fortunate in the excellence and abundance of the
mathematical text-books at his disposal. It is therefore not a
little curious that the only elementary exposition of either the
Lunar or the Planetary Theory has existed in the form of a
single and, it must be admitted, very inadequate introductory
treatise. At the same time, the <U+FB01>eld for original research offered
by these particular cases of the general problem of Three Bodies
has been, with notable exceptions, singularly neglected by English
mathematicians; and it is at least doubtful if the contributions of
Lubbock, Airy, Cayley, and Adams are suf<U+FB01>cient to relieve English
mathematics of the serious charge of having neglected an im
portant branch of the science.      For this state of things the \\ ant
of a good elementary and, at the same time, comprehensive treatise
was doubtless largely responsible, for there was apparently little
to attract the student to take up a subject in which it would be
necessary for him at an early stage to master the contents of a
great number of scattered and exceptionally obscure original
memoirs. It is therefore with reason that we extend a special
welcome to Prof. Brown’s treatise. The author, who, although
holding an appointment abroad, was formerly Fellow of Christ’s
College, Cambridge, is already favourably known both on account
of his own contributions to the most modern form of the Lunar
Theory and also for his elucidation of the work of the older
theorists.
   The work divides itself practically into two distinct parts, the

<U+FB01>rst part forming an introduction to the second, which contains
accounts of the various theories in detail, although it must be
understood that the author adheres strictly to his intention of
giving an explanation of the methods, and not the actual results
obtained from them. After the necessary force functions have
been found, the ordinary simpli<U+FB01>cations introduced by neglect
ing the Moon’s mass, and assuming the Sun to describe an
elliptic orbit round the earth according to Kepler’s laws, together
with the consequent corrections, are examined, and a numerical
estimate of the resulting error is given.     The equations of motion
are next found as they are required for the methods of de Ponté
coulant, Laplace, and Hill, and in addition the ten <U+FB01>rst integrals
arising from the equations in the problem of Three Bodies. The
third chapter is devoted to a discussion of undisturbed elliptic
motion, the expansions being made with the aid of Bessel’s func
tions, and the question of convergence being taken into considera
tion. The two principal methods of obtaining a. solution, namely,
by continued approximation, and the Variation of the Arbitrary
Constants occurring in any orbit which may be taken as “ inter
mediate,” can now be considered, and the equations for the
variations of the elements in disturbed motion are obtained in an
elementary way and also by Jacobi’s more elegant method. In
this connexion some description is given of Lagrange’s canonical
system with Hansen’s extension, and some theorems of Jacobi,
Hamilton, and Cayley are also included. The development of the
forms and properties of the disturbing function brings the reader
to the point at which it becomes necessary to study the principal
methods separately. De Pontécoulant’s method is very properly
selected by Prof. Brown as a basis for the elucidation of properties
common to all, and consequently receives the fullest treatment,
the inequalities being grouped according to their origin, and the
 consideration of the arbitrary constants, to which a whole chapter
 is devoted, being particularly lucid. Delaunay’s method, which is
 next described, is important mainly on account of the high order
 of approximation to which the literal developments are carried,
 but also because it possesses very wide applications and possibilities
 for development which, according to Dr. Hill, have not yet been
 fully realized. It should be mentioned that Prof. Brown has suc
 ceeded in simplifying many of the explanations as they appear in
 the Théorie (lu Mouvement ole Ia Lune, as he has also done in
 his account of Hansen’s method. The latter has peculiar dif<U+FB01>culties
  and obscurities, and these the author has taken pains to remove,
 by no means without success.
     Last of all the theories considered in detail is the one initiated by
  Dr. Hill and based on the use of rectangular coordinates referred to
  moving axes. It is interesting to note that these were <U+FB01>rst applied
 to the Lunar Theory by Euler, although he had originally used
  cylindrical Coordinates for the purpose, and it is also remarkable
  that their power in the analysis of geometrical as well as dynamical
  problems is only now becoming generally recognized. It is in
  this most modern method of treatment of the lunar inequalities
  that Prof. Brown’s own investigations have been made. An

historical account of the work of other theorists is appended; and
the last chapter is devoted to the inequalities in the moon’s motion,
arising from the action of the planets, the <U+FB01>gure of the earth, and
the motion of the ecliptic. Comparative tables of notation, which
will certainly be found useful, together with an index complete
the volume.
   The peculiar dif<U+FB01>culties of the Lunar Theory arise mainly from
the fact that the original investigators have generally con<U+FB01>ned
themselves strictly to their own methods, and this independence of
thought among the classical theorists may be fairly said to warrant
Prof. Brown in his peculiar treatment of the subject. Neverthe
less, while in our present state of knowledge he does well in
recognizing the importance of some acquaintance with the older
methods and the necessity for a. separate treatment for each in
order to show the relations which exist between them, the subject
cannot be considered to be in a perfectly satisfactory state until a
single uniform mode of treatment becomes possible without loss of
rigour or completeness. There can be no doubt that the time for
this will be hastened by Prof. Brown’s work. A highly commend
able feature of the book consists in the ample references, which
will enable the reader to continue his study of the more recent
theoretical investigations. It was of course impossible to include
all of these developments, and the author has shown excellent
judgment in his selection. If the work of Professor Gylden is
passed over almost without remark, this course is probably justi<U+FB01>ed
by practical considerations of expediency, although it is to be
regretted that his work is not better known in this country. The
question of convergence being as it is of the utmost importance
for the legitimate use of in<U+FB01>nite series, has scarcely sufficient stress
laid on it, although the absence of certain knowledge is a plausible
excuse. The remarkable contributions of Cauchy to this subject
might, however, with great advantage have been considered. But
with this single exception, we have nothing but praise for the
manner in which Prof. Brown has carried out his task, and we
recognize his book as a most important and valuable contribution
to a highly interesting branch of mathematics. It should be
mentioned that the volume in the matter of type and general
arrangement is quite up to the high standard we have learnt to
expect in books published under university auspices, and this fact
serves no small part in the lucidity of the explanations.

    The area dealt with in this paper lies south and west of
 Dolgelly, between the Arthog road and the hill called Mynydd
 Gader, which lies in front of the precipices of Cader Idris. The
 strati<U+FB01>ed rocks belong to the Middle and Upper I/ingula-Flags and
Tremadoc Slates. The Middle LinguZa-Flags (Ffestiniog Series)
 consist of bluish slates wilh grit-bands containing the usual Lingu
 lella, passing into Upper Lingula—Flags (Dolgelly Series) consisting
 of dark slates with Orthis Ienticularis, Parabolina spinulosa, etc.,
 and containing two andesitic lavas. These pass into the basal
 Tremadoc Slates with Dictyograptus <U+FB01>abell'tformis, surmounted by
 an upper volcanic series with rhyolitic lava. Subsequent intrusions
 of diabase occurred, of a laccolitic character, but of such a nature as
 to lead the authors to suggest the possible intrusion of the diabase
 along a line of unconformity in one case; there is, however, no
 newer rock above the diabase to indicate of what date the overlying
 beds would be if such unconformity occurred. It is further shown
that the important faults in the area were produced both before
 and after the diabase-intrusions, and in one case the movement
 appears to have been in one direction before the intrusions, and in
 the opposite direction afterwards.

and C. I. Gardiner, Esq., M.A., F.G.S.
    The area described in this paper is occupied by four prominent
hills composed of Lower Palmozoic rocks rising as an inlier from
beneath Carboniferous beds. The authors give the following suc
cession of rocks in descending order :—
          6. Green and grey micaceous grits and shale: of Dunmurry.
          5. Red and black shales.

          2. Fossiliferous ash of Grange Hill House.
          1. Green gritty shales (unl'ossiliferous).
    Nos. 5 and 6 are referred with some doubt to the Llandovery
Series, and perhaps also to higher series. The gap may conceal the
uppermost beds of the Bala succession. The limestones of the
Chair of Kildare are separated by the authors into four subdivisions
of the same general age, and Agnostus irinodus, Illamas Bewmamai,
Remoplcm'icles longicostatus, and Cyphonisous serialie range through
out. The contemporaneous igneous rocks of Grange Hill and of the
Hill of Allen are shown by the fossils found in the pyroclastic rocks
to be of Middle Bala age. The lavas consist of basalts and andesites
which the authors separate into four groups distinguished by their
lithological characters. Petrographical details of these various
rocks are given in the second part of the paper. The age of the
lowest beds which have not yielded any fossils is doubtful.

 XXXIX. Thermal Yh'anspiratz'on and Radiometer Motion.
                 By WILLIAM SUTHERLAND*.
              PART I.—— Thermal Transpz'ration.
THE comparative neglect into which the radiometer has
       fallen is probably the natural compensation for the
exalted interest of its two or three years’ reign over the
scienti<U+FB01>c imagination twenty years ago. In reading amongst
the papers about it published at that time, one gets an im
pression of the laboratory of Crookes as of an arsenal where
night and day the equipment of a great expedition into the
unknown was being pushed on under the sleepless eye of a
patriot leader; but in the answering bustle outside, Stokes,
Schuster, Stoney, Fitzgerald, Pringsheim, Reynolds, and
others soon showed that the new conquest was simply an
outlying part of the Kinetic Theory of Gases. Or, to vary
the <U+FB01>gure, Crookes appears as a friendly counsel subjecting
Nature to a passionate and eloquent cross-examination with
his fellow physicists as judge and jury bringing in a verdict
for Kinetic Theory. And then the interest died away rapidly,
perhaps mostly on account of Reynolds’s great paper “ On cer
tain Dimensional Properties of Matter in the Gaseous State”
(Phil. Trans. c]xx.), which was probably held to settle the
essential points of general interest in radiometer motion as
consequences of the kinetic theory of gases, especially as the
same train of reasoning had led him to his discovery of
                  * Communicated by the Author.

374            Mr. W. Sutherland on Thermal
Thermal Transpiration with the beautiful experimental estab
lishment of its simple quantitative laws, simple in the illumi
nation of his theory, but complex enough without it. Unfor
tunately the mathematical form of Reynolds’s theory is wearily
cumbersome ; one gathers that Maxwell found it distasteful,
and Fitzgerald (Phil. Mag. [5] xi.) describes it as inelegant
and unnecessarily elaborate.
   A great objection to Reynolds’s mathematics is that it does
not join on naturally with that developed for the general pur
poses of the kinetic theory of ases ; it has a certain interest
of individuality about it, but t is fails to compensate for the
waste of mental energy to the reader who has to adapt himself
to it. But what appears to me to be the fatal objection to
Reynolds’s mathematical method, is that it takes the mind away
from de<U+FB01>nite physical concepts of the actual operation of the
causes of thermal transpiration and radiometer motion ; and
the object of the present paper is to construct a theory of
these that will fall into line with the current kinetic theory
of gases and keep the physics of the phenomena to the fore.
    The most convenient starting-point is the laws discovered
by Glausius (Pogg. Ann. cxv. 1862) for the conduction of
heat in gases. In a vertical cylinder of gas, bounded by a
solid wall impermeable to heat and two conducting plane
ends, the lower at temperature 01 and the upper at a higher
temperature 92, when the <U+FB02>ow of heat has become steady, the
pressure throughout the cylinder is constant, and the tempe
rature 0 at distance a: from the lower end of the cylinder
whose whole length is l is given by the equation                 -
                     63:61i+(92i—613).r/l,
and the distribution of density is determined in accordance
with these two results. Now in the establishment of the law
 of the temperature, it was shown by Ulausius that in a mass
 of gas which is not uniform in temperature there is motion of
 the gas in the direction of variability ; but it is assumed (as
 it can easily be proved) that under ordinary circumstances
 this motion can never produce an appreciable de arture from
 uniformity of pressure, because the rate at which a variation
 of pressure throughout a mass of gas is etfaced is so rapid in
 comparison with the motion which might produce a variation
 of pressure, that such a variation can never get itself estab
 lished to an appreciable extent. But when in place of an
 ordinary cylinder we consider a very <U+FB01>ne tube, we must take
 account of the effect of viscosity in reducing the velocity with
 which an inequality of pressure along the tube can get itself
 effaced; and if the tube becomes <U+FB01>ne enough, this velocity

             Transpi'ratz'on and Radiometer Motion.         375
may be reduced till it is merely comparable with, or even
much smaller than, the velocity with which motion caused by
varying temperature may be tending to establish inequality
of pressure. Thus, then, in discussing the conductivity of
gas in a nonconducting tube of capillary dimensions, we
could no longer enjoy the convenient simpli<U+FB01>cation which
comes into the problem of Clausius when he writes the pres
sure constant as one of his fundamental equations, but from
purely kinetic considerations we should have to determine the
laws both of the variation of pressure and of temperature
associated with the steady <U+FB02>ow of heat.      But in the actual
problem of thermal transpiration if we lose one simpli<U+FB01>cation
we gain another, because we have to do, not with noncon
ducting walls, but with walls conducting so well and with so
large a thermal capacity compared to that of the gas, that the
law of variation of temperature is <U+FB01>xed entirely by the pro
perties of the solid; so that the gas, if subject to varying
pressure, is also subject to a <U+FB01>xed law of temperature which
we are freed from having to <U+FB01>nd.
   In the kinetic theory the molecules which are considered
characteristic of an element are those that have experienced a
collision in it; those passing through without collision are
taken account of in the elements where they do collide. 1f
the element is a short length of our tube, we do not consider
the molecules rebounding from the solid wall as characteristic
unless they also encounter other molecules in the element,
and thus we might appear to be neglecting the most charac
teristic molecules of the element. But this is not really so,
because those re<U+FB02>ected from the side of the tube and moving
to a cooler element, as a rule collide with those coming from
a still cooler element and including an equal number that
have come from its walls, so that the colliding pairs on the
average possess the qualities that are to characterize the ele
ment in which they collide.       Thus, then, if we do not have
to take account of re<U+FB02>exion from the walls of the tube, we
can consider the gas in it as part of an inde<U+FB01>nite mass such
that the temperature throughout a plane erpendicular to the
axis is the same as that in the section 0ft e tube made by the
plane.   \Ve wish to <U+FB01>nd the number of molecules crossing
any section of the tube.      This is done by ()lausius in his
theory of conduction in gases, and with greater re<U+FB01>nements
of accuracy by Tait (Trans. Roy. Soc. Edinb. xxxiii.) ; but
for the sake of clearness we will make the calculation here to
a degree of accuracy suitable for present requirements.
   If there are n molecules per unit of volume in a small
element dB, and each has v encounters per second, then the
                              2E2

376            Mr. W. Sutherland on Thermal
number of molecules colliding in a second in dB is nvdB. It
is not worth while to take account of Maxwell’s law of velo
cities ; and all molecules will be supposed to have the average
velocity 'v and travel the mean free path 7t between two
encounters, so that v=v/)t. But we must take account of the
variation of 7t with direction ; for a molecule travelling from
a particular point has a longer path in the direction of dimi
nishing density and a shorter path in that of increasing
density, with a maximum parallel to the axis in one direction
and a minimum in the other ; while the path at right angles
to the axis is the mean of the maximum and minimum, and
is indeed the mean path 7t of all molecules leaving that point.
Let A," be the maximum value there ; then it is equal to the
minimum at distance 7t," along the axis of the tube, and must
therefore be equal to the mean value at distance Am/2 ; thus,
then, Am=7\,+>\md7t/d.v 2, or M=7t+h¢lk<U+FB01>lrv2=h<U+FB02> +7V/2).
 On the same principle, the free path of a molecule that leaves
the point in any direction so that the projection of its path on
the axis of the tube is 1:2, has a value )t+ ell/2. Of the num
ber 1w dB/X of molecules that in unit time have a collision in
 dB, the fraction that cross a plane at any distance is found
by drawing from the centre of dB as origin the surface whose
 polar equation is p=7t+ avN/ 2, and estimating the solid angle
 subtended at the origin by the segment of this surface cut off
 by the plane, supposed to be at distance x, as a fraction of 4w.
 This is the required fraction, namely {l—.r/(7\+zv>t’/ 2) }/2, or
 (l—w/k+w27t’/27t2)/2 nearly.
    Thus the number of molecules colliding in dB and crossing
 the plane before colliding again is in unit time
                     nvdB(1—w/7t—x27t’/2>»2)/2k,
 in which we have changed the sign of N so as to transfer the
 origin from dB to the plane.      Now dB may be taken as Adz
 where A is the area of section of the tube ; the total number
 crossing the plane from the tube on one side of it in unit time
 is the integral from O to M of Anv(l—.r/>t—x9X’/27t2)dx/27t,
 where 7&1 is the maximum free path at such a distance from
 the plane that a molecule after colliding there and travelling
 perpendicular to the plane collides again just at the plane.
 Now k=c/n, where c is a parameter depending only on the
 size of the molecules ; thus the number is

along the tube ,- but the result holds not only for a tube, but
for any space <U+FB01>lled with gas and for any direction in it in
which n' and v’ are the rates of variation of n and 1:. The
law connecting n and v with position in the general case
must be complicated, but for a gas in contact with a solid the
thermal capacity of the latter is so great as to make 0’ and v
for the gas at the surface the same as for the solid there, so
that the problem simpli<U+FB01>es to that of etting the law of n.
At a distance z from the solid surface t e conditions of n and
v are still such as to tend to produce a velocity like u, so that
in the general case we have to consider the effect of viscosity
in causing these velocities to in<U+FB02>uence one another. The
friction per unit area parallel to the surface at z is ndu/dz, and
the state of the gas cannot be steady till this is constant.
Returning to the case of a tube, we see that the steady state
will be reached when the velocity v and n are constant
throughout a section, and the velocity u is therefore also
constant throughout the section.          Now under ordinary
circumstances there would be friction between the gas and
the tube over the whole surface, and therefore in this case
there must be an action between the solid and the gas equal
and opposite to the friction, that is to say, that the solid wall
of a tube along which heat is being conducted in constraining
the gas to take its temperature and share in the conduction
of heat exercises a traction on it. The total friction does not
exactly neutralize the total traction, but leaves a small
resultant part of it which we can determine thus: suppose
the tube connects two in<U+FB01>nite spaces at the same temperature

  378              Mr.W. Sutherland on Thermal
  as the ends of the tube, the gas enters at one end with
  velocity 0 and leaves at the other with velocity u ; in unit
' time the mass nmAu passes out with momentum nmAu‘t, and
  this therefore is the force exerted by the tube on the gas in
  it ; this force acts only near the entrance in the part where
  the velocity is rising from O to u, so that in this part the total
  traction exceeds the total friction by nmAug.      In the velocity
   u we have the cause of thermal transpiration, while that of
   radiometer motion is implied in the equation
                total unequilibrated traction=nmAuQ. . . (5)
      If the spaces at the ends of the tube instead of being
   in<U+FB01>nite are <U+FB01>nite, the gas will <U+FB02>ow till a fall of pressure is
  established to arrest it, but we cannot secure that u=O all
   over any section of the tube by an application of pressure,
   because the <U+FB02>ow established by excess of pressure at one end
   of a capillary tube is not of uniform velocity throughout each
   section, but has a maximum velocity at the axis and a
   minimum at the surface ; hence to secure that there shall be
   no total <U+FB02>ow in such a tube we have to establish a difference
   of pressure which acting alone would discharge a volume Au
   per unit time in the opposite direction to that of u. Thus,
   then, our solution for the motion in a conducting tube when
   there is no total <U+FB02>ow of gas along it consists of the super
    position of a uniform velocity u and opposite velocities varying
    in conformity with the laws of <U+FB02>ow in a capillary tube of
    uniform temperature, the result being to give a surface of
    zero velocity somewhere between the axis and the wall, with
    a circulation going up between this surface and the wall, and
    backward between this surface and the axis.
       According to the theory of the flow of gas in a capillary
    tube, if dp/dx or 10’ is the rate of fall of pressure along the
    tube, where the pressure is p and n is the viscosity, then B,
    the volume measured at p delivered in unit time from a
    circular tube of radius R (O. E. Meyer, Pogg. Ann. cxxvii.) , is

                          B=7rp'R4(l +4;/R)/81; . . . . . (7)
    As the importance of 1; depends entirely on its ratio to R, and
    as we wish to discuss tubes of any minuteness whatever, a
    discussion of slipping becomes of <U+FB01>rst-rate importance to the
    subject in hand.

              Transpiration and Radiometer Motion.           379
   Kundt and Warburg (Pogg. Ann. clvi.) showed experi
mentally the existence of slipping by its effect on the apparent
coef<U+FB01>cient of viscosity at low enough densities of the gas in
an oscillating disk apparatus for measuring viscosity, and
they adduced theoretical reasons for the necessity of its
existence and for some of its properties; they also measured
its amount and veri<U+FB01>ed some of its laws, and a little later
Warburg demonstrated the slipping of gas on the walls of
capillary tubes (Pogg. Ann. clix.)
   That slipping is a necessary consequence of the kinetic
theory can easily be shown.     Consider gas between two solid
parallel planes, one <U+FB01>xed and the other moving parallel to
itself with velocity w; then in the steady state there is a
constant rate of diminution of velocity dw/dx in the gas
between the plates.     Suppose the molecules of the solid, like
those of the gas, to be smooth spheres oscillating, but their
centres at the surface having a mean position formin a
plane.     Consider a molecule of gas in collision witi a
molecule of solid; if its velocity of rebound makes an angle
less than 'n'/2 with the normal to the plane, the molecule has
little chance of colliding with another surface molecule of the
solid and is directly re<U+FB02>ected; the majority of these directly
re<U+FB02>ected molecules of gas must strike the molecules of solid
near their most prominent points, and therefore acquire from
them very little of their velocity parallel to the plane ; thus
a certain fraction f of the molecules of gas that encounter the
surface leave it with practically the same velocity parallel to
it as that with which they approached ; the remaining fraction
 l—f, or those which at the instant of rebounding from a surface
molecule have directions making an angle greater than 1r/2
with the normal to the surface, must each penetrate into the
hollow between two neighbouring solid molecules and suffer
a second encounter with one of them under conditions which
necessitate its taking up on the average any motion that the
surface has parallel to itself.
   Now suppose that on the average the molecules of gas
which collide With the solid come a distance M2 since their
last collision with molecules of gas ; then their average
distance normally from the surface at the instant of last
collision with their fellows will be the average distance of a
hemisphere of radius 7t/2 from its base, which is M4, and thus
the molecules of gas which collide with the solid, which is
<U+FB01>xed, reach it with a relative molar velocity Mw/da‘4; but
after the collision only the fraction f retain this, so that the
gas in contact with the solid surface may be said to retain as
a whole the velocity fkdw/dwé, which constitutes a velocity of

slipping, and shows how slipping arises, but does not give its
amount correctly ; this, however, can soon be obtained. Let
w, be the sudden change of velocity on passing from solid to
gas ; then the Mw/dxli just given must be increased by w,, and
then the avera e loss of momentum experienced by a molecule
encountering t e <U+FB01>xed surface is m(_f>\.dw/d.z:4+w1) ; but the
number encountering unit surface in unit time is (2) nv/4,
and therefore the frictional force exerted by unit surface of
solid on the gas is nnw(f)tdw/dw4+wl)/4, which is equal to
ndw/dz, the friction on parallel unit surface in the gas when
the motion is steady : thus

 ax or § is called the coef<U+FB01>cient of slipping ; under ordinary
 circumstances it may be neglected, but when D is comparable
 with 7t, as it mostly is in connexion with thermal transpiration
 and radiometer motion, slipping becomes of fundamental
 importance. \Vhen D is only a fraction of 7t viscosity
 practically ceases, because the molecules traf<U+FB01>c backwards
 and forwards between the solids with so few encounters
 amongst themselves that they hardly affect one another’s
 motion, but they still exercise friction on the solids whose
 amount is easily calculated. Suppose that the gas between
 two parallel solid planes at rest is also at rest, except of course
 for the velocities of agitation, and then let one of the planes
 be set moving parallel to itself with velocity w ; then, as we
 have seen, the molecules colliding with it leave on the average
  with velocity <U+FB01>n, and when they reach the <U+FB01>xed plane a
 fraction f will have this velocity reduced to zero, while 1 —f
 will retain it unaltered, so that on the average the molecules

leaving the <U+FB01>xed surface after their <U+FB01>rst encounters with the
moving and with the <U+FB01>xed have velocity (l—f)fw ; but
without following up this process any farther we see that it
implies that when the steady state has been reached the
molecules leave the moving plane with velocity w, and the
<U+FB01>xed plane with an average velocity 10,, and these must be
connected by the relations
            (1_f)w1+fw=w2,         and (1_f)wz=w1;
whence        wl=w<1—f>/<2—/>. w.=w/(2—/>,
which give (w1+w2)/2=w/2, as of course they ought.
   Each molecule that encounters the moving plane gains
momentum m(w,—wl) or mwf/(2—f), and nv/4 molecules
encounter unit surface in unit time, so that the friction
 between solid and gas is
                       F=nmvwf/4(2—f);.         .  .  .   . (11)
if f: 1/2 this becomes nmvw/ 12, it is a limiting value of
mu/D(l+2§/D) when D is negligible in comparison with §,
and it is independent of the distance between the moving and
<U+FB01>xed planes.     We see therefore that we can carry the ex
pression n/(D + 2;) into the consideration of cases either where
 D is made very small or L' very large.
    The expression (11) shows that in capillary tubes whose
 diameters are only a fraction of the mean free path—that is
 with very <U+FB01>ne tubes such as the passages of porous plates and
gas at ordinary pressures, or with ordinary capillary tubes
and gas at low pressures, or in any tubes at low enough
 pressures—the flow of gas under pressure will not obey
 Poiseuille’s laws ; indeed in a line or two we can show that
 (11) leads at once to Graham’s laws of transpiration of gases
 through porous plates veri<U+FB01>ed and extended by Reynolds.
 For if the gas is passing through a <U+FB01>ne tube of radius R with
 velocity to at distance a: from one end, then when the <U+FB02>ow is
 steady
                 'rrRnm-vuf/2 (2 —f) = wRgdp/dw,
and taking account of the conditions at the two ends of a

  7rR2wnm = 7rR2w|n1m=1rR2w2n2m = 2 (2 —f)'rrR3(p2 —p1)/lv;
 thus the time of transpiration of unit volume measured at the
pressure p2 being l/wR’wg is énimrl/(2—f)1rR3(p2—pl).
    Now Reynolds made some experiments in which [12—11,
 was kept a constant fraction of 102, and therefore proportional
 to n2, under which conditions the time of transpiration should

382               Mr. W. Sutherland on Thermal
by our last ex ression be constant for a given gas and all
values of 102, w ich was the experimental result obtained by
Reynolds; moreover if we wish to compare di<U+FB01>'erent gases,
as at a given temperature 0 is proportional to l/mi we see
that the constant time of transpiration for each gas ought to
to be as the square root of its molecular mass, which is Graham’s
well-known experimental discovery veri<U+FB01>ed by Reynolds.
   This digression into the properties of a gas in spaces where
the linear dimensions are small compared to the free path has
been made as an appendix to our consideration of slipping in
order to clear up the limiting conditions towards which we
tend in treating of high vacua.             We can now return to
thermal transpiration as we left it at (4). To secure no total
<U+FB02>ow on account of it along a tube of radius R we are to have
B=7rplR4(l +4§/R)/817=7TR9u= —7rRQv)\(n//n+v'/v)/6; (12)

(17) by'Reynolds’s experiments, we may remark that if the
mean pressure (p, +110/2 is made so small that R/X is negligible
in comparison with unity, then in (14) p’/p=v’/v, that is
112/121 =v2/ul, a result in accordance with the following common
sense argument that when the mean path of a molecule is a
large multiple of the radius of the tube, the molecules of the
tube have practically no in<U+FB02>uence on one another; and the
 number that wander in at one end during unit time being
n1v1/4 and at the other met/4, thermal transpiration will con
 tinue till these are equal, that is till nlvl=ngv2 or pl/ 01 = 122/112.
     So far, our theoretical treatment has related to cylindrical
 tubes, while in Reynolds’s experiment the passages "through
 which the gases transpire are the irregular chains of cavities
in a porous plate; now to a <U+FB01>rst approximation these irregular
cavities may be replaced by uniform tubes whose sectional
area is equal to the average section of the cavities, but it is
obvious that a better approximation to the natural cavities
 would be a. succession of frustra of cones of length L and

 while for a uniform tube we have seen that the solution (17) is
 what this becomes when R2=R1=R. The simplicity of the case
of frustra breaks down when R, becomes only a small fraction
 of R2, for then we cannot neglect (Hg—Bl)“ as we did above.
    To make clear the comparison between (17) and (19)
and experiment a brief description of Reynolds’s arrange
ments is necessary : imagine a cylinder divided into <U+FB01>ve
compartments by planes perpendicular to its axis, the middle
one <U+FB01>lled by a plate of porous material, those on each side of it
made into small gas-holders connectable with gas supply and
manometers and separated from the end chambers by metal
plates, the end chambers being intended to act as a sort of
jacket to each of the gas-holders, the one having a stream of
steam carried through it and the other a stream of cold water.
 When a stationary state of temperature is established along
 the cylinder, the two faces of the porous plate come to <U+FB01>xed
temperatures (92 and 91, corresponding to the molecular veloci
 ties v2 and cl, and the gas transpires from the cooler face of
 the plate to the hotter, till the pressures become [22 and 121
 as given by the equation. The internal diameter of the
cylinder was 38 mm. and the thickness of the porous plates
varied from 1'5 t0 14'2 mm., the materials being meerschaum
and stucco. Reynolds gives the temperatures of the two
jacket-chambers, but not those of the faces of the porous
 plate, which are the ones we require ; we will show afterwards
how to obtain these approximately, but for the present it
 suf<U+FB01>ces to know that in any one series of experiments it, and r1
 remained constant, while the mean pressure (122 +121) /2 in the
 passages of the porous plate varied from about 760 mm. of
 mercury down to about 4. From any three sets of values of
1),—p1 and (p2+p1)/2 for any gas, it is possible by equation
 (19) to calculate (1'2+r1)/(vg—vl) and A' and B’, or from the
whole series of measurements mean values of these can be
 calculated, and then at all mean pressures p2 —p1 can be
 calculated for comparison with the experimental values.
     For Reynolds’s meerschaum plate 11., having a thickness of
  6'3 mm. and with the temperature of the steam-jacket at
  100° C. and that of the water-jacket at 8°, the values of the

    These comparisons show that the equation (19) represents
the facts of thermal transpiration, for the discrepancies
 between calculation and experiment are mostly of the same
 order as the experimental uncertainty, as can be seen from a
 careful comparison of the experimental data amongst them
 selves.
    We have now to consider the relation between the experi:
 mental values of the parameters (r2+v1)/2 (02—271), B’, and A’
 and their theoretical natures. First, as to (v2+ v1)/2(rg-—r1),
 which is equal to (62i+91i)/2(9§—01i) where 02 and 91 are
 the temperatures of the two faces of the porous plate; now
 the walls between the jackets and the air-chambers are of
 thin metal, and the chambers are of the same shape and size,
 so that the mean of the temperatures 62 and 01 must be
 nearly equal to that of the two jacket temperatures 2', and
 i1; thus 02+l91=i2+ih which, with the values given for
 (v,+v1)/2 (oz—01), suf<U+FB01>ces to determine 0, and 61.

388           . Mr. W. Sutherland on Thermal
   The temperatures 6, and 61 are determined by the <U+FB02>ow
of heat from the thin metal wall of the hot jacket to that
of the cold one, by conduction along the rubber walls of the
cylinder, by radiation across the two gas-chambers, by con
vection-currents in the gas-chambers, and also by conduction
through the gas of the chambers, but the conductivity of
gases is so small compared to that of even badly-conducting
solids, that the direct effect of gaseous conduction may be
neglected, although the indirect effect of the conductivity of
the gas in determining the amount of heat carried by con
vection may be appreciable, as would appear to be the case
with hydrogen and meerschaum plate II. It would be
possible to make a rough calculation as to what 62 and 61
ought to be according to the theory of conduction, but Rey
nolds states that the condition of the radiating surfaces and
the sizes of the chambers were altered during the experi
ments, so that it is not worth while to do more than not-ice
that the values obtained for the temperatures of the faces of
the porous plates are consistent in a general way with what
we should expect from the temperatures of the jackets, the
thickness of the gas in the two chambers which was about
5 mm., and the given thicknesses of the plates.
   As to the values of B’, which stands for
                   6a1’0(R2+ R1)/"Io(l‘2+v|)2;
since me2 is proportional to 6, and (62i+615)2 is nearly the
same in all the experiments, we should expect B'nO/mi to be
constant for different gases with the same plate, and propor
tional to the mean radius of the passages in the plate; thus,
using the viscosities as obtainable from Graham’s experi
ments in terms of that for oxygen as unity, and the molecular
masses in terms of that of hydrogen as 2, we have :—

   This shows that the values yielded by hydrogen, instead of
being equal to those given by air, are between t and §of
them, a discrepancy whose cause will be found immediately;
but it is to be noted that while the results for hydrogen

              B'anspz'ration and Radiometer Motion.          389
make the mean radius of the passages in stucco 4'2 and 5'1
times those in meerschaum II. and III., those for air make it
4'8 and 4'8 times, and the a reement of the means 4'65 and
4'8 is close enough to show t at our expression
                    6al‘0fR2 + Bil/"0092 ‘l' 002
is right enough as regards the occurrence of the mean radius
of the passages in it ; and moreover our equation (14) showed
that R entered in the form B/X, so that the discrepancy just
found must be due to some considerations being ignored in
connexion with 7t.        '
   Now it is a well known fact established by experiment
that gases are condensed in the passages of porous bodies.
The condensing action exerted by a solid surface on a gas is
easily expressed quantitatively, for near the end of section (8)
of my paper on the Laws of Molecular Force (Phil. Mag.
[5] xxxv.) the attraction of a cylinder of radius a, length It,

a formula which makes the density of the gas in contact with

formula will be investigated a little further in my next paper,
on “ Boyle’s Law at very Low Pressures.”
   A rigorous investigation for condensation in a tube would
be simple enough, but it suf<U+FB01>ces for our present purposes to
see that in most cases the density at the surface of the tube

obtained by putting surface-density and axial density in
place of p’ and pa in the last formula.
   It is easy also to obtain an expression for the average density,
but as it is evident that for a given tube at a given tempera
ture the average density remains proportional to the density
at the axis, which is the same as if there was no attraction
between gas and solid, we see at once that the effect of sur
face condensation on our investigation of thermal transpiration
is to multiply the density by a factor which remains nearly
constant for a given tube or to divide 7t by the same factor,
and the effect of ignoring this factor as we have done is to
produce values of lO’B’nO/m" which ought to be divided by
the factor before they should be expected to be constant for
any one plate. Now experiment has shown that hydrogen is
much less condensed on solid surfaces than other gases, so
that with hydrogen the factor will be nearly unity (probably),
and therefore, from the last little table, that for air between 2
and 3; the factor for 002 ought to be larger still, as this gas
is much more liable to surface condensation than air, while
the last table would make the factor to be 137/68 0r 2; but
too much reliance must not be placed on the value of B’ for
C02, as Reynolds found the trouble caused by the condensa
tion of the CO, to be so great as to discourage him from
making any further experiments with it. Thus the apparent
discrepancy in the last table has furnished some new evidence
in connexion with condensation of gases in the passages of
porous solids.
   As to the values of A’, which stands for
                        9B2R1’Uog/1102 (v2 + 1’1)‘;
We see that as a is nearly 1 the value of B'2/16A’ ought to be
nearly equal to (R2 + R1)2/4B2Bl, and ofcourse the value of the
ratio B’2/16A’ is not affected by our ignoring condensation in
the establishment of the fundamental equations. In the case of
hydrogen, the values of B’ and A’ for stucco 1. lead to an unreal
value ofBg/Rl, and thus we see that the formula (19) for conical
passa es is too much of a re<U+FB01>nement for present purposes;
and t erefore abiding by the formula (17) for cylindrical
passages we may say that B’2/16A’ ought to be not much
different from unity. For stucco I. the values of B’2/16A'
 are '86 for hydrogen and 2'5 for air, while for meerschaum II.
and C02 the value is 1'8; these values are near enough to
 1'0 to give satisfactory evidente of the general soundness of
the details in the theory.                          -
   Reynolds, guided by his theory, formulated his experimental

             Transpiration and Radiometer Motion.           391
results in a number of laws, but there is no occasion for us to
follow these seriatim as they are all contained in the sym
bolical statements of equations (17) and (14), which we have
already tested by the experimental results.
   An interesting result of thermal transpiration experiments
is that they enable us to calculate the mean radius of the
passages in porous materials, for in the case of hydrogen the
measurements must be but little complicated by molecular
force ; thus the values given for B’ in the case of hydrogen,
if multiplied by 760 to pass from the mm. of mercury to the
atmo as unit of pressure, and then divided by 1033'3 X 961 to
pass to the dyne per sq, cm. as absolute unit of pressure, give
us the values of lQavOB/no(v2+vl)2; now as r2+vl may be
taken as relating to a mean temperature of 57° 0.,
                    (02 + 'L'l)2= 47102
and v0=184400 cm. per sec. and 170='OOOO9, while a is
nearly unity; thus for the mean radius of the passages in
Reynolds’s meerschaum II. we get '0000112 cm., in meer.
,schaum III. '0000092, or say l/l05 cm. for lneerschaum, while
for stucco I. the value is “000047 cm. Thermal transpiration
gives no information as to the number of passages, but this
 could be found from a measurement of the volume of air
transpired by a plate in unit time under a measured excess of
 pressure on one side, or by other measurements relating to
transpiration under pressure such as those made by Graham
and Reynolds; for the delivery of gas could be calculated as
that due to N tubes of radius R, the discharge of each being
calculated according to O. E. Meyer’s equation given in (7).
In thisway thermal and pressural transpiration measure
ments can be made to yield a measure of the average porosity
of any solid through which hydrogen can pass.         By arti<U+FB01>
cially altering the porosity in a series of preparations, as for
instance by hardening stucco under different pressures and
 similar means, so that speci<U+FB01>c gravity would give a measure
 of relative porosity, it might be possible to <U+FB01>nd a porosity
at which hydrogen just failed to pass, which would furnish
an independent measure of the diameter of the hydrogen
molecule.

XL. On the Passage of Electricity through Gases exposed
    to Ronfgen Rays. By J. J. THOMSON, 31.11., F.R.S.,
     Cavendish Professor of Experimental Physics, Cambridge,
    and E. RUTHERFORD, MA, Trinity College, Cambridge,
    1851 Exhibition Scholar, New Zealand University“.
 THE facility with which a gas, by the application and
        removal of Rontgen rays, can be changed from a con
 ductor to an insulator makes the use of these rays a valuable
 means of studying the conduction of electricity through gases,
 and the study of the properties of gases when in the state into
 which they are thrown by the rays promises to lead to results
 of value in connexion with this subject. We have during
 the past few months made a series of experiments on the
passage of electricity through gases exposed to the rays, the
results of these experiments are contained in the following
paper.
    A gas retains its conducting property for a short time after
the rays have ceased to pass through it. This can readily be
shown by having a charged electrode shielded from the direct
in<U+FB02>uence of these rays, which pass from the vacuum-tube
through an aluminium window in a box covered with sheet
lead; then, though there is no leak when the air in the neigh
bourhood of the electrode is still, yet on blowing across the
space over the aluminium window on to the electrode the
latter immediately begins to leak.
    To make a more detailed examination of this point we used
the following apparatus.                               -
    A closed aluminium vessel is placed in front of the window
through which the rays pass. A tube through which air can
be blown by a pair of bellows leads into this vessel : the rate
at which the air passed through this tube was measured by a
gas-meter placed in series with the tube; a plug of glass wool
was placed in the tube leading to the vessel to keep out the
dust. The air left the aluminium vessel through another
tube, at the end of which was placed the arrangement for
measuring the rate of leakage of electricity (usually a wire
charged to a high potential placed in the axis of an earth
connected metal tube through which the stream of gas passed,
the wire being connected with one pair of quadrants of an
electrometer). This arrangement was carefully shielded from
the direct effect of the rays, and there was no leak unless a
current of air was passing through the apparatus ; when,
   * Communicated by the Authors, having been read before Section A of
the British Association, 1896.

           On the Passage of Electricity through Gases.        393
 however, the current of air was <U+FB02>owing there was a consider
 able leak, showing that the air after exposure to the rays
 retained its conducting properties for the time (about t second)
 it took to pass from the aluminium vessel to the charged
 electrode.
    We tried whether the conductivity of the gas would be
 destroyed by heating the gas during its passage from the
 place where it was exposed to the rays to the place where its
 conductivity was tested.    To do this we inserted a piece of por
 celain tubing which was raised to a white heat ; the gas after
 coming through this tube was so hot that it could hardly be
 borne by the hand ; the conductivity, however, did not seem \
 to be at all impaired. If, however, the gas is made to bubble
 through water every trace of conductivity seems to disappear.
 The gas also lost its conductivity when forced through a plug
 of glass wool, though the rate of <U+FB02>ow was kept the same as
 in an experiment wTiich gave a rapid leak; it' the same plug
 was inserted in the system of tubes before the gas reached
 the vessel where it was exposed to the Rentgen rays, in this
 case the conductivity was not diminished. This experiment
 seems to show that the structure in virtue of which the gas
conducts is of such a coarse character that it is not able to
survive the passage through the <U+FB01>ne pores in a plug of glass
wool. A diaphragm of <U+FB01>ne wire gauze or muslin does not
seem to a<U+FB02>'ect the conductivity.
    A very suggestive result is the c<U+FB02>'ect of passing a current
 of electricity through the gas on its way from the aluminium
vessel where it is exposed to the R6ntgen rays to the place
where its conductivity is examined. We tested this by inserting
a metal tube in the circuit, along the axis of which an insu
lated wire was <U+FB01>xed connected with one terminal of a battery
of small storage-cells, the other terminal of this battery was
connected with the metal tube ; thus as the gas passed throu h
the tube a current of electricity was sent through it. T e
passage of a current from a few cells was suf<U+FB01>cient to greatly
diminish the conductivity of the gas passing through the
tube, and by increasing the number of cells the conductivity
of the gas could be entirely destroyed. Thus the peculiar
state into which a gas is thrown by the R6ntgen rays is
destroyed when a current of electricity passes through it. It
is the current which destroys this state, not the electric <U+FB01>eld ;
for if the central wire is enclosed in a glass tube so as to stop
the current but maintain the electric <U+FB01>eld, the gas passes
through with its conductivity unimpaired. The current pro
duces the same effect on the gas as it would produce on a very
weak solution of an electrolyte.    For imagine such a solution

   394    Prof. J. J. Thomson and Mr. Rutherford on the Passage
1
   to pass through the tubes instead of the gas ; then if enough.
   electricity passed through the solution to decompose all the
   electrolyte the solution when it emerged would be a noncon
   ductor ; and this is precisely what happens in the case of the
   gas. We shall <U+FB01>nd that the analogy between a dilute solution
   of an electrolyte and gas exposed to the Rontgen rays holds
   through a wide range of phenomena, and we have found it of
   great use in explaining many of the characteristic properties
   of conduction through gases.
     ‘Thus Bontgen rays supply a means of communicating a
   charge of electricity to a gas. To do this, take an insulated
   wire charged up to a high potential and surrounded by a tube
   made of a non-conducting substance : let this tube lead into
   alarge insulated metallic vessel connected with an electro
   ineter. It now air which has been exposed to Rontgen rays
   is blown through the tube into this vessel the electrometer
   Will be de<U+FB02>ected. This proves that the gas inside the vessel
   is charged with electricity. l f the Rontgen rays are stopped
   and the gas blown out of the vessel the charge disappears.
   In these experiments we took precautions against dust.
      The fact that the passage of a current of electricity through
   a gas destroys its conductivity explains a very characteristic
   property of the leakage of electricity through gases exposed
   to Bontgen rays; that is, for a given intensity of radiation
   the current through the gas does not exceed a certain maxi
   mum 'value whatever the electromotive force may be, the
   current gets, as it were, “saturated.” The relation between
  the electromotive force and the current is shown in the fol
  lowmg curve, where the ordinates represent the current and
                               Fig. 1.
  the abscissae the electromotive force.   It is evident that this
  saturation must occur if the current destroys the conducting
  power of the gas, and that the maximum current will be the
  current which destroys the conductivity at the same rate as

     of Electricity through Gases ewpased to Rontgen Rays.      395
  this property is produced by the R'ontgen rays. IF we regard
  the gas as an electrolyte, then the passage of a quantity 0 of
  electricity will destroy e/e of the conducting particles, where
  e is the charge carried by one of these particles. Let n be the
  number of conducting particles in unit volume of the gas,
  q the rate at which these are produced by the rays, cm2 the       8;;
  rate at which these disappe ll‘ independently of the passage of
  the current, L the current through unit area of the gas, l the
  distance between the electrodes. Then we have

  \Vhen the current is small this equation gives
                               n”===q/a ;
  and as the number of conducting particles is independent of
  the current, the current will be proportional to the E.M.F.
  This corresponds to the straight part of the curve.
     In the general case the current is proportional to the pro
  duct of n, the number of conducting molecules, and the
  potential gradient. If E is the dill'erencev of otential between
  the plates, U the sum of the velocities of tie positively and
  negatively electri<U+FB01>ed particles when the potential gradient is
  unity, we have

  We see from this that L approaches the limit gel.        Thus the
  limiting current is proportional to the distance between the
  electrodes ; so that when we approach saturation the current
  will increase as the distance between the electrodes increases,
  and we get what is at <U+FB01>rst sight the paradoxical result that a
  thin layer of air o<U+FB01>'ers a greater resistance to the passage of a
  current than a thicker one. This is, however, easily accounted
  for if we remember that the current destroys the conducting
- power, and that as in a thicker layer there are more con
  ducting particles than in a thinner one the current required
  to destroy them all will be greater.

    The experiments show that the eHect of the distance between

    In this case the effect of distance is not so well marked as
in the previous one, where the                  was suf<U+FB01>cient to satu
 rate the current at all distances.
   The measurement of the rate of leak when the current is
saturated enables us to form an estimate of the number of
 conductin particles present in the gas ; as in this case the
number 0 conducting particles produced in unit time by the
rays is equal to the quantity of the electrolyte destroyed by
the current in the same time. Let us take the case of hydro
 gen; when the current was saturated, the rate of leak between
'two plates each about 10 sq. cm. in area and 1 cm. apart
'was about 1 volt per second when a capacity of about 30 cm.
 was in connexion with the electrometer.            Thus the quantity
 of electricity passing between the plates in 1 second was

   of Electricity through Gases exposed to Réatgen Rays. 397
about 10‘1 electrostatic units, or 1/3>(10l1 electromagnetic
units, and this quantity is suf<U+FB01>cient to electrolyse all the
electrolytic gas produced by the Rb'ntgen rays. Now 1 elec
tromagnetic unit of electricity sets free 10“ grammes of
hydrogen, or about 1 c. c. at atmospheric temperature and
pressure.    Hence 1/3 x 10'l electromagnetic units correspond
to about the same number of cub. centim. of hydrogen ; the .
volume ofthe space between the electrodes was about 10 0.0., so
in this experiment the fraction of the gas electrolysed was only
1/3 x 10“, i.e., one three billionth of the whole amount of the
gas. It is not surprising that some experiments we made to
see if any alteration in pressure was produced when a gas
was transmitting Rontgen rays should have given negative
results. The preceding estimate gives the average number of
conducting particles ; if the conducting state is intermittent
there may at certain times be a much larger number of these
molecules present. It is probable that at all events, when the
current is saturated the conducting power is intermittent.
The action of the coil used to send the discharge through the
vacuum tube is intermittent ; thus, if between the passage of
two sparks the conductivity has time to vanish (and when any
current is passing through the gas the rate at which it
vanishes is very rapid) the gas will be alternately an insulator
and then a conductor.                                          '
   The following experiment is explained by the intermittent
character of the discharge. The gas exposed to the Bontgen
rays Was in a piece of lead tubing open at both ends ; this
was connected with one terminal of a battery, the other
terminal of which was connected with a wire running down
the axis of the tube. A blast of air was blown through this
tube, and it was found that when the current between the
wire and the tube was small, the blast diminished the current
to a large extent, though a current approaching saturation
was hardly affected by the blast. When the current was
affected the gas blown out of the tube was conducting; when
the current'w'as not affected the gas did not conduct. If the
gas were exposed to steady radiation it would not be affected
by blowing unless the time taken by the gas to acquire the
conducting state under the in<U+FB02>uence of the rays was com
parable with the time taken by the gas to pass through the
tube ; this is inconsistent with what we know from other
experiments as to the rapidity of action of the rays. If, how
ever, the state of the gas is intermittent, then, since the blast
continues when the rays are not acting, it blows out conduct
ing gas, and so diminishes its average conductivity.
    To return to equation (3), if I is the value of 1, when E

is in<U+FB01>nite, we may write the equation in the form

    As these measurements require the intensity of the radia
 tion to be maintained constant during each series of observa
tions, 2. condition which it is very di<U+FB02>icult to ful<U+FB01>l, we think
the agreement between theory and observation is as close as
 could be expected.
   We have seen how from the measurement of the limiting
current we could form an estimate of the proportion which
the conducting particles bear to the rest of the molecules of
the gas. We can, in addition, get from the curve represent
ing the relation between the current and the electromotive
force an estimate of the velocity with which these particles
move. Taking equation (3)

we shall endeavour to express the coef<U+FB01>cients in terms of
quantities which our experiments enable us to estimate. Let
I be the limiting current when the electromotive force is
in<U+FB01>nite, then
                              I = qle.

    Now EU/l is the sum of the velocities of the positively
 and negatively charged particles in the electric <U+FB01>eld. Hence,
equation (6) shows that the current bears to the maximum
 current the same ratio as the space described by the charged
 particles in time T bears to the distance between the elec
 trodes. In an experiment where l was about 1 cm., the rate
 of leak through air for a potential-difference of 1 volt was
 about 315 of the maximum rate of leak, hence the charged

402    Prof. J. J. Thomson and Mr. Rutherford on the Passage
particles must in the time T have moved through about 316 of
a centimetre. The time T will depend upon the intensity of
the radiation ; it could be determined by measuring the rate
of leak at different points on the tube through which the
conducting gas was blown in the experiment mentioned at
the beginning of this paper. We hope to make such experi
ments and obtain exact values for T ; in the meantime, from
the rough experiments already made, we think we may con
clude that with the intensity of radiation we generally
employed, T was of the order of 116 of a second.       This would
make the velocities of the charged particles in the air about
'33 cm./sec. for a gradient of one volt per cm. This velocity
is very large compared with the velocity of ions through an
electrolyte ; it is, however, small compared with the velocity
with which an atom carrying an atomic charge would move
through a gas at atmospheric pressure; if we calculate by
the kinetic theory of gases this velocity, we <U+FB01>nd that for air
it is of the order 50 cm./sec.; this result seems to imply that
the charged particles in the gas exposed to the Rijntgen rays
are the centres of an aggregation of a considerable number of
molecules.
   The relation between the current and electromotive force
given by equation (4) corresponds to that obtained by experi
ment for a number of gases ; it does not, however, exhibit a
peculiarity which we ha\e sometimes observed, especially
when the radiation was strong, 1'. e., the existence of a part of

at di<U+FB01>'erent points in the curve. When the intensity of these
rays is diminished, the saturation current is diminished in a
larger proportion than the current for small electromotive
forces.     This is shown by the following diagram, WlllCh
represents the t and E curves through chlorine gas for dif
ferent intensities of the Rontgen rays; the weak radiation was
got by interposing a thick aluminium plate.       In this diagram

 the ordinates for the weak radiatioii have been increased so
 asto make the ordinate for the saturation current of the
 Weak radiation the same as that of the strong. When this is
 done the rest of the “ weak” curve is above the strong,
 showing that the diminution in the radiation has affected the
 saturation current to a greater extent than the weaker cur
 rents. The saturation current depends only on the number
 of conducting particles produced by the rays ; for the smaller
 currents the diminution in the number of molecules is to
 some extent compensated for by the increase in the time
 taken for these to recombine ; thus T is increased when the
 intensity of the rays is diminished, so that, as we see from
 equation (6), the proportion between a small current and the
 saturation current is increased when the intensity of the rays
 is diminished.
    Whatever is the magnitude of the. electromotive force, a
 diminution in the intensity of the rays is accompanied by a
 diminution in the current, so that the l and E curves for two
 intensities

               of same  scale. wouldI not intersect if both were
     If, however, instead of keeping the gas the same and
  altering the intensity of the radiation, we alter the gas and

40-!     Prof. J. J. Thomson and )Ir. Rutherford on the Passage
keep the intensity of the rays constant, then the I and E
curves for two different gases may intersect. This effect is
shown in the following diagram, which represents the I and
E curves for hydrogen and air. “'e see that for small
electromotive forces the current is greater in hydrogen than
in air, while the saturation current is much greater in air
than in hydrogen. The saturation current depends merely
                               Fig. 4.
on the number of conducting particles produced by the rays,
while the current in the earlier part of the curve depends on
the space described by the conducting particles in the time T
(see equation 6), and we infer that more conducting particles
are produced by the rays in air than in hydrogen, but that
the product of U, the velocity of these particles, and T, a
time which is proportional to the time these particles linger
after the rays are cut ofi', is greater for hydrogen than it is
for air.
   In <U+FB01>g. 5 we give the curves for air, chlorine, sulphuretted
hydrogen, and mercury vapour, the curves being drawn on
such scales that the ordinate representing the saturation
current is the same in all these cases. It will be noticed that
the curves for air, for sulphuretted hydrogen, and for chlorine
coincide, mercury vapour falls below, while the hydrogen
curve would be above. This shows that, using the       notation
of equation (6), UT is the same for air, chlorine,     and sul
phuretted hydrogen, and that its value for these       gases is
smaller than for hydrogen and greater than for         mercury
vapour.
   It is remarkable that the shapes of the curves for air,
sulphuretted hydrogen, and chlorine should agree so closely,

   being in some cases three or four times that of air, while that
   of chlorine is in some cases as much as ten times that of air.
      The value of the saturation current varies greatly in
   different gases ; of the gases we have tried it is least in
   hydrogen, greatest in mercury vapour, the saturation current
   in mercury vapour being about 20 times that for air. It does
   not seem to depend entirely on the density of the gas, as in
   sulphuretted hydrogen it is three or four times what it is in
   air, though the densities are nearly equal, while, though the
   density of the vapour of CHQIQ is greater than that of mercury
   vapour, the saturation current in the former gas is only a
   small fraction of its value for the latter. The gases which
   have large saturation currents are those which contain the
   elements which have an abnormally large speci<U+FB01>c inductive
   capacity in comparison with their valency.

   effect. The absence of polarization implies, however, that the
   ions are able to give up their charges to the metal electrodes.
   Experiments on electri<U+FB01>ed gases show, however, that it is very
   dif<U+FB01>cult to get a charge of electricity from a gas to a metal
   unless the metal is exposed to radiation, either by the metal
   being suf<U+FB01>ciently hot to be luminous, or when it is exposed to
   ultra-violet light.  But in the case of the passage of electricity

conduction takes place even when the system is not exposed
to the direct radiation fron the exhausted tube; we think it
probable therefore that the gas itself radiates after being ex
posed to the Riintgen rays.
   To test this we tried the following experiment. AB, CD

are two concentric cylinders made of thick lead tubing, the
base of the inner one was cardboard, so as to allow Rontgen
rays to pass through the gas in the inner cylinder. A metal
ring was placed between the two cylinders and connected
with one pair of quadrants of an electrometer so as to allow
the leak from it when raised to a high potential to be mea
sured.    A slit was cut in the inner cylinder in such a place
and of such a size that no rays could pass through it directly
from the bulb. The apparatus was <U+FB01>lled with chlorine, as
this gas is one which gives a very rapid rate of leak. When
the slit was left open there was a rapid leak due to the diffu
sion from the inner cylinder of gas which had been exposed
to Rontgen rays. When, however, the slit was covered up
with a strip of paper the leak wholly disappeared, though the
ring connected with the electrometer was placed at the same
level as the slit and therefore exposed to any radiation that
might come from the gas.        This radiation, if it exists, must
 therefore either be of very feeble intensity or else it must
differ from the Rontgen rays in not making a gas through
which it passes a conductor of electricity. We are inclined
to think that when Rontgen rays are incident on a metallic
surface the “diffusely re<U+FB02>ected” rays are not of the same
character as the incident ones, and have not nearly the same
power of renderin a gas through which the pass a conductor
of electricity.     e base this opinion on t e experiments we
have made to detect the existence of electrical effects due to
the “re<U+FB02>ected ” rays ; though we have made many attempts
we have never been able to detect the existence of any electrical

  effects from the re<U+FB02>ected rays. Thus we introduced in 'the
  apparatus in <U+FB01>g. 6 a lead plate inclined at an angle of 45° to
  the axis of the cylinder, and so placed as to re<U+FB02>ect the rays
  through the slit, which was covered with a strip of paper;
  the arrangement was so sensitive that if the plate had re<U+FB02>ected
  anything like one per cent. of the rays incident upon it, the
  leak from the metal ring would have been easily detected ;
  there was, however, no trace of a leak. The results of ex
  periments on the photographic effects produced by rays
  diffusely re<U+FB02>ected from metallic plates seem to show that these
  rays are fairly abundant. Taking this result in connexion
  with the absence of any noticeable electrical effect produced
  by these diffusely re<U+FB02>ected rays, we think that the latter differ
  in character from the incident rays.
     We have not been able to detect any effect produced by a
  magnetic <U+FB01>eld on the rate of' leak ; we tried with the lines of
  magnetic force parallel and also at right angles to the current,
  and with both small and saturated currents.
     The rate of leak through air that had been dried by standinor
  for three days in the presence of phosphorus pentoxide did
‘ not differ appreciably from the damp air of the room.
     In conclusion, we desire to thank Mr. E. Everett for the
  assistance he has given us in these experiments. The period
  during which a bulb gives out Rontgen rays at a uniform
  rate is not a long one, and as most of our experiments re
  quired the rate of emission to be constant, they have entailed
  the use of a very large number of bulbs, all of which have
  been made by Mr. Everett.
  XLI. On the Resistance of the Electric Arc. By JULIUS
     FRITH, 1851 Exhibition Scholar, the Owens College, Man
     chester, and CHARLES RODGERS, B.Sc.', 1851 Exhibition
     Scholar, Firth College, Shg<U+FB01>ield‘.
                           [Plates III. to V.]
      HERE seems to be some uncertainty as to what is meant
         by the resistance of the arc. Any given are is a phe
  nomenon which exists at a de<U+FB01>nite Pl). and current, and
  any attempt to measure its resistance must alter the state of
  the are as little as possible or else we are no longer dealing
  with the same phenomenon.           Hence it seems to us that the
  only way in which the resistance of the arc can be measured
  is by the ratio of a very small increment of P.D. applied, to
      * Communicated by the Physical Society : read May 8, 1896.

 408          Messrs. J. Frith and C. Rodgers on the
 the small increment of current produced. It must also be
 borne in mind that the change in the current must be of so
  short a duration that the form of the carbons is not in any
  way altered.
     Apparently the only method which ful<U+FB01>ls these conditions
  is one in which a small alternating current is used, super
  imposed on the main continuous current. This has the effect
  of rapidly increasing and decreasing by a small amount the
  current passing through the are.     It seems probable that the
  effect on the arc of each small increase of current is annulled
  by the decrease of current immediately following.      In fact a
  comparatively large alternating current may be superimposed
  on the main continuous current without producing any visible
  effect on the are.
     We are thus led to de<U+FB01>ne the resistance of the are as the
  ratio of a small increment of P.D. applied, to the small incre
  ment of current produced.     This may be brie<U+FB02>y written
                                                              _V

  It is most important to distinguish this quantity, which we
  call the “instantaneous ”   in, from the tangent of the incli
  nation of the tangent line of the curve representing the steady
  values of V and A, which we will call, for the sake of clear
                        at
  ness, the “steady ” H
     We have performed some experiments to exemplify the
  difference that exists between these two quantities; and also
  to show that in cases analogous with the arc, where, however,
  the result can be veri<U+FB01>ed, the instantaneous 2%, found by
   superimposing an alternating current, gives correct Values
  for the resistance.
     In one of these experiments a glow-lamp, taking 10 am
   peres at about 8 volts, was placed in series with three I.E.S.
   5O ampere accumulators, and a current sent through against
   the E.M.F. of the cells. This arrangement is just what is
_ wanted to test the method, namely a resistance in series with
   a back E.M.F., both of which are functions of the current ;
   and, further, the resistance can be separated from the back
   E.M.F. and measured, and the result compared with the value
   obtained for the resistance by the instantaneous
     The result of this experiment is represented on Pl. Ill.
   Here are plotted the curves connecting the current and RD.
   between the outside terminals of the arrangement and also

                    Resistance of the Electric Arc;               409
  between the terminals of the lamp and of the battery. This
  last gives the back E.M.F., since the resistance of the
  cells was small enough to be neglected.           The P.D. at the
  lamp divided by the current gives the resistance; this is
  plotted on the same diagram; to make it clearer, however,
  the scale of ohms is multiplied by 10.        We have measured*
  the instantaneous 2% at various current strengths, and the
  values of this are plotted in a dotted line. It is seen that
  there is a very close agreement between these two measure
  ments of resistance.      On the same sheet are plotted values
  for the steady             This differs considerably from both
 the resistance-curves. This leads us to see that the rapid
  excursions caused by the alternating current are not along
 the curve joining the steady values of V and A, but along
  a line which is everywhere more vertical than the tangent
  to the curve. This line is formed by joining the point on
 the curve to the instantaneous origin, which is distant from
 the Origin of the diagram by an amount equal to the back
            at that particular current. Were the electrical
 excursions to travel along any intermediate path, the value
 obtained for the instantaneous (m- would be dependent on
 the frequency. As will be seen later, this is not the case
 between the experimental limits of 250 and 7 complete alter
 nations per second. If, therefore, the arc, as has been a<U+FB02>irmed
 by various authorities, consists of a back E.M.F. and a re
 sistance, we feel justi<U+FB01>ed in applying this method for the
 measurement of its resistance, which has been found correct
 in closely analogous cases.
     Now at very low frequencies indeed the electrical oscilla
 tions would travel along the curve connecting the steady
values ofV and A; and this is clearly the meaning of the
critical frequency which we have observed with cored carbons
 (see p. 421), namely, that under the critical frequency the
superimposed alternations travel on the steady value curve
and become identical with the “ steady”
    Several experimenters have obtained values for the resist
ance of the arc which agree fairly well amongst themselves,
and which seem to show that the arc has a positive resistance 1'.
   * By method I. below.                                 _
   1' An abstract of papers bearing on this subject was given by Mrs
Ayrton in the ‘Electrician,’ Sept. 13, 1895.

410         Messrs. J. Frith and C. Rodgers on the
    It was pointed ' out, however, by Prof. Ayrton at the
Ipswich meeting of the British Association, that although
there was a marked agreement between the values obtained
by these experimenters, they were not at all in accordance
with the conclusions drawn by himself from consideration
of the curves obtained by Mrs. Ayrton. These curves con
nect the RD. between the carbons with the current passing
through the arc, for various <U+FB01>xed lengths of arc, and from
them it is seen that for a given arc-length an increase of P.D.
is always accompanied by a decrease of current. From this
fact Prof. Ayrton concluded that if an attempt were made to
measure the resistance of the are by altering the RD. between
the carbons and <U+FB01>nding the corresponding alteration of cur
 rent produced, the resistance found by taking this ratio must
be negative.
    This conclusion was strengthened by some experiments
made by Mr. Mather at Prof. Ayrton’s suggestion. In one
 of these experiments two points of equal potential were found
 in a circuit consisting of an are, a battery, and a resistance.
Another battery, consisting of a few cells, of known E.M.F.
 and resistance was applied between these two equipotential
 points and the current <U+FB02>owing through the battery was noted.
 The resistances of the two parallel halves of the circuit, exclu
 ding the arc, were known, so that the current which, takin
 the are resistance as zero, should <U+FB02>ow through this battery
 could be calculated. Now the value of this calculated cur
 rent was found to be less than the observed value, no matter
 in which direction the RD. was applied, and this result was
 also obtained when an alternating P.D. was used. Hence
 the resistance of the arc was apparently less than zero.
     The other experiment consisted in running the are at a
 steady P.D. and current, suddenly altering the resistance in
 circuit by a small amount, and notin the changes in the
 ammeter and voltmeter-readings so produced. The new con
  ditions were maintained only long enough to allow of these
  readings being taken. The are was then brought back to its
  former condition before taking another reading.    It was found
  that a change of P.D. in one direction was always accompanied
  by a change of cui'rent in the opposite direction. The results
  of both experiments were, however, only qualitative.
     All these experiments, together with the considerationot'
  the curves found by Mrs. Ayrton, lead to the conclusion that
  the arc has a negative resistance, while former experimenters
  had all obtained a positive resistance.
     It was in order to throw some light on this discrepanc
  that we undertook a series of experiments to determine wit 1

                    Resistance of the Electric Are.        411

conditions.
                               Methods.
   A number of methods were tried using alternating currents,
of which the following were most successful :—
   Jllet/zod [. is represented diagrammatically in <U+FB01>g. 1.  D is
              l'l'llllmmm        Fig.1,

                  K
the .armature of an alternator, the current from which passes
round two circuits in parallel, one of which contains the arc
X, and the other an adjustable resistance R. By adjusting R
the alternating currents in the two halves can be made equal.
When this is the case the impedances of the two halves to
alternating currents must be equal.
   In the diagram the continuous-current circuit is shown to
the left. It consists of a battery of accumulators B, the
hand-adjusted arc-lamp X, the resistance K, the ammeter A,
and (with the commutator C as shown) the resistance S
and the alternator D. It will he noticed that the alternator D
carries the continuous current, but this of course does not
prevent its acting as an alternator.
    In order to measure the small alternating current indepen
dently of the continuous current <U+FB02>owing we used the air
transformer T, the thick wire coil of which was in series with
the alternator D, the thin wire coil being connected with an

412           Messrs. J. Frith and C. Rodgers on the
electrostatic voltmeter .E.     The reading of the electrostatic
voltmeter is thus unaffected by the continuous current, while
it is, at a given frequency, a measure of the alternating current
<U+FB02>owing.
    By means of the commutator C, the air-transformer T can
be thrown into either circuit, the resistance S being by the
same operation thrown into the other circuit. The resistance
S is equal to that of the thick wire coil of T, so that when S
replaces T the continuous current is unali’ected by the change.
                     Method of Experimenting.
    The are was run at the required current and RD. by alter
ing the number of cells in B, K being always kept the same.
The current was kept constant by adjusting the are by hand.
Under normal conditions the current could be kept constant
to within 1 per cent. R was now adjusted till the de<U+FB02>exion
of E was the same when T was in either circuit. When
balanced, a change of 0‘01 ohm in R caused an appreciable
di<U+FB02>'erence in the de<U+FB02>exions of E. It was found to be useless
to adjust more accurately than this, since the small variations
in quality always found in carbons produced differences of
this order in the resistance of the arc.
    Let the value of It when a balance is obtained be R1. This
is equal to the resistance, to alternating currents, of the bat
tery (b1), the resistance (k), the arc lamp and connexions (l),
and the arc
                           R1=k+b1+l+w-         .   l   - '.   n
The carbons are now <U+FB01>rmly screwed together and the number
of cells in B reduced till the continuous current is the same
as before. R is again adjusted till the de<U+FB01>exions of E are
equal ; and if R2 is the new value thus obtained,
                          R2=k+b2+l;       .  .   .   .    . .     (ii.)

                           R3=k+l. . . . . .- , . (iii.)
From (ii.) and (iii.) we obtain the resistance of bg, and by
proportion of any number of cells. Putting these values in
 (i.) we obtain the value of w in ohms.
    The advantages of this method are that no calibration of
the electrometer is required, the speed of the alternator need
not be constant for long periods together, various alternators
giving different frequencies and wave-forms can be used
without materially altering the circuit, and especially that

                                                                     1'1

made large, K being about 11 ohms. The circuit shown on
the left consists of the alternator D, the transformer T, which
together with E is now used simply as a delicate alternate
current ammeter, a condener F, and a commutator C. By
means of C we can put in circuit either the resistance R,
or the arc-lamp X in series with the resistance S. The alter
nating current <U+FB02>owing through K is negligible compared
with that <U+FB02>owing through X on account of the high resist
ance of K. The condenser F prevents any continuous current
due to the RD. at the are from passing through the alter

The alternator was run at a speed corresponding to this fre
quelpcy, at which the arrangement is most sensitive to changes
of .                    .
   An experiment consists in adjusting R till the deflexions
of E are the same whether R or S+a is in circuit.         Then
                           R=S+m
   The experiment was <U+FB01>rst tried without a resistance at S,
but it was found impossible when using solid carbons to
obtain a balance even when R was zero. In order to make
it possible to obtain a balance with R greater than nothing,
a resistance S numerically greater than the negative resistance
of the arc had ,to be put in series with the are. In our expe
riments we kept S constant and adjusted R. The experiment
might have been performed by making R=O, and adjusting
 S till the readings of E were equal. Then S +.r must be
equal to zero, and therefore a: —S, or the resistance qf the
arc is equal to the resistance in the boa: S with its sign changed.
   This method gives results which agree well with those ob
tained by Method I. ; but on account of the necessity of
keeping the speed of the alternator constant the arrangement
is more troublesome to manage, and therefore was used only
as a. check method.
                  Description of the Apparatus.
   The arc-lamp had a hand adjustment for each carbon with
centering arrangements for the positive. The arc-length was
measured by projecting an image of the are on to a screen by
means of a lens in the usual way.
   The resistance K consisted of broad platinoid strips bent
back on themselves so as to avoid self-induction '. It did not
 heat appreciably with the largest currents used.
   The battery consisted of 50 lO-ampere E.P.S. cells arranged
in 4 groups of 10 cells each, 4 of 2, and 2 groups of 1.
 These groups could be connected up by means of mercury
on s.
   The ammeter and voltmeter were Weston instruments of the
 horizontal type.
    The air-transformer T was made in two sections which were
 usually used in series. The constants were as follows :—

The thick wire was double-cotton-covered.         The thin wire
was silk-covered.
   The voltmeter was an Ayrton-Mather reflecting electro
static voltmeter giving a deflexion of 700 scale-divisions at a
distance of 2500 scale-divisions for 100 volts. This instrument
was admirably adapted to our purpose on account of its very
quick swing and excellent damping.
   The resistance R consisted of a box wound with thick
german-silver wire plugging to 0'1 ohm, in series with which
was a german-silver wire (N0. 10 S.W.G.) doubled back on
itself and carrying a slider. Points were marked out at dis
tances corresponding to 0'01 ohm. These spaces were about
107 centims. long.
   The Alternator. Several different alternators were used.
The one used while obtaining the curves given was a Pyke
and Harris machine, which was especially suitable, since it
had no sliding contacts, both armature and <U+FB01>eld being <U+FB01>xed.
The other machines were—for high frequencies a Ferranti,
and for low frequencies a Gramme alternator. The <U+FB01>elds '
in all cases were excited by storage-cells.
   The condenser had usually a capacity of about 60 micro;
farads.
                      Variation of Conditions.
   The conditions of the experiments were varied as much as
possible.   We have studied the effect on the resistance of the
arc of variations in the amount, frequency, and wave-form of
the alternating current ; the effect of different kinds of
carbons and ditferent P.Ds. and currents ; the effect of using
different combinations of cored and solid carbons, of carbons
cored with substances other than carbon; and the effect of
the relative size of the carbons.

  416         Messrs. J. Frith and 0. Rodgers on the
                              Results.
     The amount of alternating current between the limits we
  have used does not appear to have any in<U+FB02>uence on the value
  obtained for the resistance of the arc. The largest alternating
  current used had a R.M.S. (root mean square) value equal
  to about 10 per cent. of the continuous current. The smallest
  had about one-tenth of this value. In obtaining the curves
  shown, the R.M.S. of the alternating current was usually
  about 0'5 ampere.
     The frequency also did not have any effect on the resistance
  of the arc between the limits 250 and 7 complete alterna
  tions per second. Frequencies above 150 were obtained
  from a Ferranti alternator; those between 150 and 45 from
  a Pyke and Harris; and those between 24 and 7 from a
  Gramme machine.                    .
     Besides these three machines a Mordey transformer of
  ratio 1:1 was sometimes used, with its primary in circuit
  with the Pyke and Harris alternator. On account of its
  having a closed iron circuit it was not so suitable, but it
    ave the same results as the alternators.
     \Ve have thus obtained considerable variety in the wave
  form as well as in the frequency. Hence the wave form
  does not affect our measurements of the resistance of the arc.
     The values thus obtained for the resistance of the are
  under various conditions are plotted in Pls. IV. & V. Pl. IV.
  shows the relation between the resistance of the arc and the
  current, the RD. between the carbons being kept constant.
  PLV. <U+FB01>g. 1 shows the relation between the resistance ofthe are
  and the Pl). between the carbons, the current being kept
  constant. PLV. <U+FB01>g. 2 shows the relation between the resistance
  of the arc and the arc length, the current being kept constant.
- In all these cases the resistance is measured from the central
  line marked 0, positive values above the line and negative
  values below the line.
     Certain makes of carbon have been selected for experiment,
  namely, Apostle, Brush, Thomson-Houston, and Carré carbons,
  as representative of the various qualities of carbon now in
  use commercially.
     The diameter of the ositive carbon was in all cases
   11 millim., the diameter 0 the negative was 9 millim. in the
  case of the Apostle and Brush carbons, 8 millim. in the case
  of the Carré carbons, and 11 millim. in the case of the
  Thomson-Houston carbons. These sizes were selected as
  being most suitable for the currents we were able to take

                    Resistance of the Electric Are.             417
  from our cells. The sizes of the Apostle carbons were those
  used by Mrs. Ayrton in her experiments.
     That the diameter of the carbons used does not have any
  great effect on the resistance of the are for the same current
  and voltage is shown by the curves D and E, Pl. IV. and <U+FB01>g. 1,
  PLV. These are the curves for two solid Apostle carbons—one
  set 1) having carbons ll millim. and 9 millim. and the other
  set E having carbons 18 millim. and 5 millim. in diameter re
  spectively, and it will be seen that they lie very close together.
      On the curves each make of carbons is represented by a '
  particular kind of line as explained in the <U+FB01>gure, the Apostle
  carbons, for instance, are represented by a dotted line. Curves
  bearing the same letter refer to the same combination of
   carbons in the different makes. For each make there are four
  combinations :—+ cored, -cored; +cored, —solid ; +solid,
   —cored ; +solid, —-solid; represented respectively by the
   letters A, B, C, and l).
      The general characteristics of these curves are that the
   ordinates of those for +solid —solid are always negative, and
   those for +cored —-cored always positive, while the other
   curves all lie between these two extremes, those which have the
   positive carbon solid always being more negative than those
   which have the positive cored. The greatest uniformity is met
   with in the case of the +solid —solid combination, in which
   all the curves lie close together. For this reason the curves for
   the Thomson-Houston carbons have been omitted, as they lie
   completely on the other curves, and would tend to cause
. confusion.      In the case of cored carbons, however, the uni
   formity is not so marked, as the material of the core varies
   largely with the make. In fact, in a single carbon the core
   may vary considerably, and for this reason the curves for
   cored carbons are more troublesome to take.
       Pl. IV. shows the relation between the resistance of the
   arc and the current that the arc is taking, the voltage at the
   carbons being kept constant. It will be noticed that in the
   case of those combinations which have a solid positive, the
   number expressing the negative resistance of the arc increases
 ' as the current decreases. With the other two combinations—
   those having a. cored positive—the curves for Brush and
   Carré carbons have the same general characteristics, while
   those for the Apostle carbons out these latter. This is pro
   bably due to peculiarities in the coring of the Apostle
   carbons.
       Pl. V. <U+FB01>g. 1 shows the relation between the resistance of the
    arc and the P.D. between the carbons, the current being kept
    constant at 10 amperes in all cases. These curves are more

418          Messrs. J. Frith and C. Rodgers on the
 instructive than those in P]. IV., as the character of the arc
alters more with change of voltage than with change of
 current. As before, the curves for the solid carbons are all
 very close together. In this case they all show a minimum
 (maximum negative) value at about 55 volts.          With com
binations having a cored positive, this minimum becomes
 more strongly marked and occurs at a lower voltage.
    It has been our practice to examine the image of the arc
on the screen and note when any change in the appearance
of the arc takes place. It was <U+FB01>rst noticed by Mrs. Ayrton
that with cored carbons under certain conditions a dark space
 appeared somewhere near the centre of the arc, dividing the
purple glow into two parts.       This was never noticed in the
case of solid carbons. Our observations have fully con<U+FB01>rmed
this, and, moreover, we <U+FB01>nd that the dark space, when only
one carbon is cored, is nearer this carbon. We have noted
the appearance or disappearance of the dark space, and we
<U+FB01>nd a remarkable coincidence between this point and the
minimum of the curves. In the curves for cored carbons in
P1. V., to the right of the minimum point the are always
shows a dark space which becomes less marked on approach
ing the minimum, and at the minimum <U+FB01>nally disappears. To
the left of this point, although the dark space has quite dis
appeared, yet the difference in colour between the two parts
of the glow is still obserVable, that near the negative carbon
being of a redder tint than that near the positive.
   PLV. <U+FB01>g. 2 shows the relation between the length of the arc
and its resistance at constant current. The general charac
teristics of these curves are the same as those of <U+FB01>g. 1, since
the length of the arc is roughly proportional to the voltage.
                        Efect of the Core.
   Since the presence of a core in either carbon has such a
marked in<U+FB02>uence on the resistance of the arc, we tried the
effect of boring out the core ot'a Carré carbon. The result of
using this hollow carbon as the positive is shown by curve F
in P1. V.    It will be seen that this curve follows very closely
that obtained with both carbons solid. The effect was now
tried of <U+FB01>llin this hollow carbon <U+FB01>rst with plaster of Paris,
and then wit kaolin. In both cases the resistance of the
are so produced was positive. Another e<U+FB01>'ect of these cores
was to cause the are to burn at a much lower voltage for
a given current and arc length. The are was, however, too
unsteady to allow of a curve being taken.

                          Inverted Arcs.
   In the experiments hitherto described the positive carbon
has always been uppermost. Experiments were now made to
ascertain if the resistance of the arc is dependent upon
whether the positive carbon is the upper or the lower.
   Using solid carbons, the resistance is not appreciably
altered by inverting the are.      YVith cored carbons, however,
the resistance of the arc is altered, and moreover the physical
character of the are is changed. As we have pointed out
above, the distinguishing feature of the are when using cored
carbons is the appearance of a dark space situated near the
centre of the purple glow, which appears to considerably
increase the resistance of the are.      On inverting such an are,
however, we <U+FB01>nd that this dark space completely disappears,
and, as we should have expected, the resistance is consider
ably diminished. At low currents or P.Ds., the difference
between the resistances of ordinary and inverted arcs dimi
nishes till the two values become nearly equal. These are
the conditions under which the dark space ordinarily dis
appears. Hence when the dark space has disappeared,
inverting the arc makes but little difference in its resistance,
which is also the case with arcs using solid carbons, in which
there is no dark space.
   By placing the carbons horizontal, a value for the resist
 ance of the arc can be obtained which is intermediate between
 the two values obtained by placing the positive carbon
 respectively above and beneath the negative carbon, the
 current and RD. being the same in the three cases.              a
   From consideration of the part played by the dark space, i
would appear that the resistance of the arc is greatly affected
 by the state of the contact between the purple glow and the

420         Messrs. J. Frith and C. Rodgers 0n the
negative carbon. When the inside purple glow is in good
contact with the negative carbon, the resistance of the arc is
most negative.    When, however, there is a dark space (caused
by: the presence of foreign matter or of carbon in a different
p ysical state), and hence a lack of contact between this glow
and the negative carbon, the resistance becomes increased.
                         Hissing Arcs.
  An attempt was made, using Method 1., to <U+FB01>nd the resistance
of a direct-current hissing are produced with accumulators,
but it was found that even with the alternator at rest there
was a large de<U+FB02>exion of the electrometer, showing that the
current through a hissing arc is oscillatory. In order to deter
mine the frequency of the oscillation, a condenser and
telephone were put across the arc.      The sound heard in the
telephone was, however, of no de<U+FB01>nite pitch.
   A method suggested by Mr. Campbell was used to measure
the amount of this oscillatory current. The current taken by
the hissing arc was passed through the primary of a trans
former, the secondary of which was put in series with a
re<U+FB02>ecting twisted-strip ammeter, the deHexion being noted.
The are lamp was then disconnected, and a known alternating
current was sent through the primary, of such magnitude
that the de<U+FB02>exion was the same as before. This known
current has the same B.M.S. as the oscillatory current passing
through the arc, for if the impedance of the secondary is
large compared with its resistance, the de<U+FB02>exion of the am
meter is the same for the same R.M.S. current whatever
the frequency. The are was run at 145 amperes and 35
volts, Apostle carbons +9 mm. —-9 mm. being USt'd. While
the arc was burning the de<U+FB02>exion of the ammeter varied
between 200 and 250 scale-divisions. Primary currents of
0'43 ampere and 0'53 ampere, as measured by another
twisted-strip ammeter, produced these scale readings respec
tively.   Hence in this case the R.M.S. of the oscillatory
current amounted to about 3 per cent. of the continuous
current.

   On comparing our results with the steady 3%; taken from
the slope of the curves published by Mrs. Ayrton, the agree
ment as to sign, which held in the case of solid carbons, was
found to break down in the case of cored carbons ; for while
the general shape of the curves obtained by Mrs. Ayrton was
the same for cored as for solid carbons, that is both curvesl

    In the curves connecting the RD. between the carbons and
the current, each point is obtained by taking the readings of
ammeter and voltmeter after the arc has been made to burn
for a very considerable time at constant current and arc-length,
so that one may say that the “ frequency ” is zero.                In this
case, the resistance, if deduced from the slope of these curves,
would be negative both for cored and for solid carbons. In
Prof. Ayrton’s original method, although the readings are
taken as quickly as possible, still the “frequency ” is small
compared with the lowest frequency we have hitherto used,
and both the carbons and the arc may have time to alter before
the ammeter and voltmeter can be read. This method would
lead to the same conclusion as before, viz. that the resistance
of the arc is always negative. Our measurements, however,
with frequencies as low as 7'5 gave a positive resistance for
arcs using cored carbons. Hence it seems that there must
be a critical frequency, above which the resistance has a
positive value which is independent of the frequency, and
below which it appears to have a negative value, and further,
that this frequency must lie between 7'5 and 0.

the curves 5 ope slightly upwards, thus indicating a positive resistance.

422            On the Resistance of the Electric Arc.
   Our former methods were not suitable for working with
a frequency loWer than 7, for at this frequency the needles of
the voltmeter and ammeter began to vibrate with the alter
nating current. This vibration of the needles was made use
of in the following way, to indicate the sign 'of' the g at
frequencies lower than 7. The Gramme alternator used in
the previous method was run as a rotatory transformer. By
adjusting the continuous current passing through this trans
former, and hence its speed, any desired frequency could be
obtained down to as low as one complete alternation in
 2 seconds. By an arrangement of mirrors the needles and
 scales of both ammeter and voltmeter could be observed
 simultaneously.     In this way it could be seen whether the
two needles were at any instant vibrating in the same or in
 opposite directions. It is evident that if the needles are
 vibrating in phase, that is if an increase of P.D. is accom
 panied by an increase of current, then 5% must be positive;
 while if they are vibrating out of phase, that is if an increase
 of RD. is accompanied by a decrease of current, then it is
 negative. With this arrangement, solid carbons at any fre
 quency gave a negative resistance. With cored carbons, how
 ever, we found as we expected, that above a certain frequency
 the ’resistance was positive, while below this frequency the method
                                  V             . .
 gave a negative value for a.          The critical frequency was
 found by observing the point at which the swing of the needles
 was uncertain, being sometimes in phase and sometimes out
 of phase. At this point the frequency was 1'8, at 1'9 the
 sign was certainly positive, and at 1'7 was negative. This
 result was obtained with all arcs whose resistance as given by
our curves was positive (with one exception mentioned below),
 and was not obtained with any whose resistance was negative.
 In the case of arcs whose curves cross the zero line, the
 transition from positive to negative, as shown by the disap
 pearance of the critical frequency, was well shown and
 corresponded with the crossin of the zero line. As an
 example, we ran an arc wit Brush carbons +11 mm.
 cored -—9 mm. solid at 10 amperes, the curve for which is
 marked B in <U+FB01>g. 1, Pl. V. It will be noticed that this curve
 crosses the zero line twice, at 55 volts and again at 41-3
 volts: at 60 volts we found the sign of the 2%, as shown
by the swing of the needles, to be positive at frequencies

above 1'8 and negative below this frequency, at 45 volts it
was negative at all frequencies ; at 35 volts, however, it was
positive at frequencies above 1'8, and also at frequencies
below 1'8. That the resistance would be positive at all fre
quencies seemed probable, since the curves connecting the
RD. and current at constant arc-length for such carbons
 show that with small arc-lengths an increase of BB. is
accompanied by an increase of current.
    The experiments have been carried out in the Physical
Laboratory of the Central Technical College, and our best
thanks are due to Professor Ayrton and Mr. Mather for
much kind advice during the course of the work.
  NOTE—Fluctuation of the Current given by a Continuous
                           Cu'rre'nt Dynamo.
    An attempt was made to replace the cells in Method I. by
a dynamo, but it was found that even with the alternator at
rest the electrostatic voltmeter showed a large de<U+FB02>exion. This
 was evidently due to the oscillation of the current owing to
the commutator of the dynamo having a <U+FB01>nite number of seg
ments. The oscillation was found to increase as the brushes
 were moved out of the sparkless position. The dynamo was
 a 5 kilowatt 2-p0le machine, and was giving 10 amperes at
 70 volts. By adjusting the brushes to the sparkless position
 this oscillatory current, measured in the same way as in the
 case of the hissing are above, could not be reduced below
 2'5 per cent. of the continuous current, while by rocking the
 brushes out of this position it could be increased to as much as
 9 per cent. without the sparking at the brushes being excessive.
The commutator was in good condition. This oscillation may
introduce errors in the measurement by polarized instruments
of the currents given by dynamos owing to the differences
between the mean and the R.M.S. of such a current.

hemispherical waves; whereas, in consequence of molecular
events, the light really comes off in a broken succession of
such trains, each of moderate duration and, generally, discon
tinuous from one train to the next. Within each train there
must be such continuity as is manifested by the prolonged
interference e<U+FB01>'ects found in the use of such instruments as
Rowland’s largest diffraction gratings, or Michelson’s Refrac
tometer. But, to bring about these effects, the average length
of the trains need not be more than some such length as a
metric foot (30 centimetres) which includes about 500,000
luminous waves from the brightest part of the spectrum.
This would correspond to an average duration of trains of
about the thousand-millionth part of a second. But however
brief the duration of each train, nevertheless for that short
time the aetherial disturbance it occasions can be resolved in
whatever ways it could have been resolved if the train had
gone on for ever. Hence, in order to take into account the
  iscontinuity of the trains of waves as actually emitted by the
point p, it su<U+FB01>ices simply to recognize that the undulations of
uniform plane waves of Proposition 1 are made up of a suc
cession of comparatively short sections of uniform plane waves,
which may each include only some few thousand waves and
which may be discontinuous where one succeeds another.
This, however, does not hinder their continuing to be undula
tions of uniform plane waves : accordingly Proposition 1
extends to the cases where the emission of light from the points
of the object is discontinuous.

    21. The Illuminating Apparatus—The state in which light
 reaches that portion of a microscopic object which is under
 scrutiny is determined by the source-of light, by the con
 denser, by the use that is made of the iris diaphragm and
 stops which are associated with the condenser, and by the
 parts of the microscopic object through which the light has
 to pass to reach the part which is being specially examined.
    The iris diaphragm and stops determine the directions from
 which light is allowed to reach the object.   These should be
 such as will bring into suf<U+FB01>cient prominence in the image

              Dr. G. J. Stoney on Microscopic Vision.                425
those features upon the object which we wish to examine, and
at the same time such as will exclude or minimise the addi
tion to the microscopic image of false or confusing effects.
How this may best be aimed at will have to be considered
in Part III., and will be illustrated there.
    The source of light and the condenser are to be esteemed
as good in the degree in which they enable the whole of the
light of each wave-length which is brought to bear upon a
point of the object to reach that point at each instant in the
same phase and with accordant transversals. For if this con
dition could be fully attained the state in which the light would
then leave the object would be complicated by the previous con
dition of the light only in respects which cancel one another
when averaged over a suf<U+FB01>cient period of time. For this average,
300 metres of cosmic time *—the millionth of a second——
would be abundant. There is, therefore, no “ twinkling of an
eye ” within which the average has not been struck. Hence
light so supplied will furnish a pure image so far as man can
see—one depending solely on the features of the object.
    The efforts to reach this desirable result seem to have been
directed exclusively towards improving the condenser, and
cutting very thin sections; but both theory and experiment
 seem to show that when the condenser is good, a further
advance may be made by attending to the source of light,
which apparently ought to be con<U+FB01>ned to a layer of a thick
ness small compared with a wave-length, and preferably lying
in a plane, or rather on a slightly concave surface, perpen
dicular to the optic axis (see § 27 below, p. 435). Of course
the distance of the source of light is not immaterial, since a
 well-corrected condenser acts at its best only when the source
 of light is at one particular distance.
    However well the light may have been prepared by the
condenser, it is sometimes thrown into confusion before it
 reaches the upper surface of the object, by having to enter
 through its under surface and to traverse its substance.             In
such cases the attempt to ascertain what is on the upper
   * Cosmic time means time the       ortious of which are measured by
lengths—by the distances over which electromagnetic waves in the open
aether, and therefore over which light in vacuo, would travel in those
portions of time. This way of measuring time is convenient in both
optics and molecular physics. The convenience has its foundation in
nature, as it no doubt arises out of the circumstance that this way of
measuring time brings both time and space into the closest possible asso
 ciation in which they can stand to the fundamental units of nature. See
 apaper “On the Physical Units of Nature ” in the Proceedin s of the
R0 a1 Dublin Society of Feb. 16, 1881, or in the Philosophical    agazine
of Klay 1881.

  difficult to determine how many of these rows there are and
  where exactly they are placed.      All will probably be reduced
  to order if the diatom can be mounted between two media, of
  which the under one shall have a refractive index of 1'4, the
  same as silex, and the upper one a refractive index as much
  as ossible exceeding 1'4. To mount objects in this way
  oug t not to be impracticable.
     22. The Six Images.—When a particular mode of illumina
  tion has been adopted, all subsequent events are thereby
  determined if the optical parts of the microscope are fully
  corrected and roperly adjusted. To trace these events from
  the object on t e stage to the image of it delineated upon the
   retina of the observer is now our task ; and it may be prose
   cuted by beginning with an ideally perfect image and applying
   in succession a series of changes which <U+FB01>nally transform it
   into the image which actually presents itself within the eye
   of the observer. Throughout the whole inquiry we may,
   without loss of generality, treat only of the light of one wave
  length out of the light employed.
      The following is a list of the successive stages of the trans
  fqrmation. In reading it the diagram on p. 433 will be found
  0 use :—
           A. Object A is the actual microscopic object, to which
        corresponds Image A, viz. : that ideal image reproducing
        all possible detail, which only light of in<U+FB01>nitesimal wave
        length supplied in a theoretically perfect manner would
        be competent to produce.
           B. Image B, the standard image, means that image
        which the light of wave-len th A as actually emitted by
        the microscopic object won (1 furnish, if reversed (see
        Part 1. section 8, p. 338). This image is of the same
        size as the microscopic object. To it would correspond
        Object B, an object of the same size as Object A, but
        differing from it by containing no detail but that shown
        in Image B.
           O. Image 0, standard image No. 2, is that which
        the light taken in by the objective would, if reversed,
        produce; to which would correspond Object C, an object
        containing the same detail as that shown in Image 0.

               Dr. G. J. Stoney on M'croscopic Vision.           427
         Some of this detail may be in excess of any detail shown
        in Image B, but, unfortunately, an addition of this kind
        does not represent anything on the microscopic object
         (Part 1., Proposition 3, p. 345).
           Image 0 and Object C, like Image B and Object B,
        are of the same size as the microscopic object.
           D. Image D, the focal image formed by the objective,
        which lies near the top of the tube of the microscope, is
        an enlargement with distortion of Image 0. To it
        corresponds Object D, viz. that object which the focal
        image if seen would appear to be.
           E. Image E, the visual image, is that virtual image
        which the eye-piece forms, when it is applied as a mag
        nifying-glass to the focal image. 1t is an enlargement
        and slight distortion of the focal image.  It is, therefore,
        an enlargement with a somewhat different distortion of
        Image 0. To it corresponds Object E, the visual object,
        that object which the observer thinks he sees.
           F. Finally Image F is the image actually produced
        on the retina of the observer.
     The state in which the light has been admitted to the object
  a<U+FB02>'ects images B, C, D, E and the correspondin objects, and
  therefore alfects Image F. We have now to a vance in suc
  cession through these images, be inning with the ideal image
  and ending with the image whic is actually formed within
  the eye of the observer.
     23. Transition from A to B.—Image A, an ideal image of
  the microscopical object, could only be formed by light of
  in<U+FB01>nitesimal wave-length supplied in a theoretically perfect
  manner. This light, and this light alone, could form an
  image reproducing every detail. By such wave-lengths as
  can be used with the microscope—i. e. when we pass from
  Image A formed by imaginary light of in<U+FB01>nitesimal wave
  length to Ima e B formed out of real light—the greater part
  of the events t at happen in the object are shut out from our
  View by being massed together. In fact, when we come to a
  numerical example we shall <U+FB01>nd that a whole squadron of
  them, indeed an entire army, occupies that space upon the
  object which corresponds to the minutest speck which such
  light will show.
     Image B, the standard image, as appears from § 8, p. 338,
  is formed by the <U+FB02>owing in upon it of beams of uniform plane
  waves ; and in consequence it may, under Theorem 2, be re
  garded as formed of luminous rulings interlacing and inter
_ t'ering with one another : each luminous ruling being formed

428            Dr. G. J. Stoney on Microscopic Vision.
 by the convergence of two or more of the above-mentioned
 beams of plane waves, or of components of them.                 The <U+FB01>nest
 of these rulings are those formed by beams that <U+FB02>ow in
 horizontally from opposite longitudes. If each of the beams
  is resolved into light polarized in, and light polarized perpen
  dicularly to the plane of incidence, then the opposed pair of
  each of these components will produce a ruling in which the
  brightness varies by the law represented by the expression
  1 + cos (llama/A). This indicates that it is a ruling of which the
 spacing is M2, each space including the width of a line and
  of the interval between it and the next. Such a ruling will
 be best seen when the intensity of the illumination is such
 that the lines and intervals appear of equal width. Hence the
 lines of the <U+FB01>nest rulings, and consequently any speck in the
 image seen by the interlacing of these rulings, will have an
 apparent diameter of 7t/4, when best seen.
       Now the corresponding portion of the microscopic object,
   viz. a globe with 7t/4 for its diameter, contains within it an
  enormous quantity of detail, all of which is massed together
  in the standard ima e and presented to us as one more speck.
  How great a loss is<U+FB01>iere incurred, and how little any micro
   scope can exhibit to us of nature, may be jud ed from a
   numerical example which will be given in Part I l.*
        24. Transition from B to C.-—'l'he important change from
   B to 0 requires to be carefully studied from many sides.
   Standard image No. 1 contains everything which the whole
   of the light of wave-length k is, in the condition in which it
   leaves the object, (apable of presenting. Standard image
  No. 2 contains the utmost that can be delineated by that por
  tion of this light which the objective is able to take in.
       The change from the <U+FB01>rst of these to the second involves,
  in the <U+FB01>rst place, some obliteration of detail, consequent upon
  the exclusion of the inclined beams Ba, which are spoken of
  on p. 344, in § 15 of Part I. It also involves a rounding off
      i' The outcome of the com utation here referred to is that with bluish
   green light, which has pro ably the shortest wave-length that can be
   used with advantage in eye observations, and when its wave-length is
   shortened by mounting the object in a medium with as high a refractive
   index as immersion oil : under these favourable circumstances, a spherical
   portion of the object of the size of the smallest speck which this light is
   capable of exhibiting, would still be large enough to contain something
   between 300,000 and 300,000,000 of those chemical atoms of which pon
  derable matter is made up. And we should remember that the immer
  sion objective for which the oil is desi ed cannot exhibit quite so small
_ a speck as the smallest which light oft at wave-length could produce. It
   is a limit beyond its   asp.   Biologists would do well to ponder what
 computations of this ind teach us.                                          '

in the image of any sharp edges that may be upon the object,
owing to the exclusion of the beams Bb. The exclusion of
these same beams also often produces a false glare, or adds
features to the image that are foreign to the object (Proposi
tion 3, p. 345).     We shall have to study of what kinds these
illusory effects are, and how they may be in some degree
controlled by adjustments of the illuminating apparatus.
There is another consequence of the exclusion of the beams
Ba and B6. , It is a t to produce a deceptive colouration of
the images seen in the <U+FB01>eld of view. (Proposition 4, p. 345.)
    The most important part of the study of microscopic vision
is the study of these matters. But before endeavouring to
go more fully into them, which can be best done in Part III.,
we must take a glance at the subsequent and less important
steps that intervene between Standard Image No. 2 and the
Visual Image, which last is what is directly presented to the
eye of the observer.
    25. Il'ransition from C to D.—It has been proved in the
 footnote on p. 339 of Part 1., that the illuminating apparatus
 and the microscopic object may be removed, and that Standard
 Image No. 1 can take their place. Now, for our present
 purpose it will be enough to put Standard Image No. 2 in
 their place ; since we are only concerned with the light which
 is to be made use of by the objective, and this light remains
 the same whether it is supplied by standard image No. 1 or
 standard image N0. 2. In order to be available for this use
 of it, standard image No. 2 must be regarded as formed by
 subjecting that portion of the light emitted by the object
 which can be taken in by the objective to two successive
 reversals; and we shall <U+FB01>nd it convenient to conceive the
 medium in front of the objective, whether oil or air, to be
 continued downwards in order that the image may lie within
 this medium, so that the light may be able to go straight
 from the image to the objective. After the second reversal
 the light <U+FB01>rst forms the image and then proceeds on from it
 and enters the objective in precisely the same state as the
 light actually emitted by the microscopic object would have
 done. We may therefore remove the source of light and the
 microscopic object, and substitute for them standard image
 No. 2, transmitting the beams that form it on to the objective.
 Each of these beams is a beam of parallel light, and is there
 fore, by passing through the objective, brought to a focus at
 a, a situation whichjs usually close to the back lens of the
 objective. See the <U+FB01>gure on p. 433. After passing this
  focus the beam diverges in the form of a cone of convex
  spherical waves, and it is in this state that it reaches D, the

    'ect. is what happens to one of the beams.
o JThis                                                  Let us still
farther con<U+FB01>ne our attention to the course pursued by its
awz'al ray, i. e. the ray which coincides with the line drawn from
the middle of the objective <U+FB01>eld perpendicular to those plane
waves which form the beam before entering the objective.
This axial ray starts from the point on the optic axis of the
 microscope where this optic axis pierces image C. When the
 course of the ray is traced through and past the objective it
 is found a second time to intersect the optic axis, at the point
where this axis pierces image D, the focal image. Let a and
B be its inclinations to the optic axis before and after it passes
through the objective.        Then by Lagrange’s Theorem
                     nsina=Msin,B,         .   .  .  .  .   .   .   (l)
where M is the magnifying power of the objective, i. e. the
number of times that the image Dis larger than the image 0 ;
 and where n is the refractive index of the medium between
 C and the objective, the refractive index of the air which
intervenes between the objective and D being taken as unity
  [otherwise n would have to be the ratio of the two refractive
 indices].
     Now if we take two beams, whose axial rays are in the
 same meridian plane *, and which are inclined to the optic
 axis at angles a and a’, then the ruling in image 0, to which
 they will give rise, has a spacing

 A, being the wave-length in the medium which is in front of
 the objective. Similarly the spacing of the ruling which
 these same beams produce when they reach image D is

 where M is the wave-length in air.          Hence we <U+FB01>nd that the
 ratio of 6‘2 to 61 is

 and this, when we replace XII/7&1 by n, and put in the values
 of n sin a and n sin a given by equation (1), becomes

The process that has been here followed might in fact have
been employed to prove Lagrange’s Theorem ; but it is here
used for the purpose of showing that the ratio 62/el is inde
pendent of the values of a and a’ : in other words, that all the
rulings of which image 0 is formed are reproduced on a
larger scale in image D, and that the scale of the enlargement
is the same for them all.
   We thus learn that image D is formed of exactly the same
rulings as image 0, only magni<U+FB01>ed and somewhat distorted—
distorted laterally by the convex form of the beams, and lon
gitudinally owing to the decreased inclination of the beams
to one another. Image D accordingly contains every feature
which is present in image C, only somewhat distorted laterally,
and still more distorted longitudinally.
    Hence the great task we have to set before ourselves is to
<U+FB01>nd out what image 0, standard image No. 2, contains. This
conclusion is not disturbed by pursuing the course of events
farther.
    26. From I) to E, and from E to F.—The subsequent
stages need not detain us long. If, as before, we select two
of the beams of plane waves emitted by standard image No. 2,
and if we follow the course of the axial rays of these two
beams, we <U+FB01>nd that these rays intersect the optic axis where
this axis pierces images 0, D, and F (see the <U+FB01>gure on p. 433),
and that if the portions of them which lie between the eye
piece and the eye were produced backwards they would also
intersect the optic axis where that axis pierces the image E,
which is a virtual image. This last is the Visual Image, 2'. e.
itlhe image which seems to the observer to be presented to
  1m.
    Let aa', ,8/8', 77', and 55’ be the angles at which the axial
 rays of the two beams intersect the axis at C, D, E, and F.
 At each of these images the two beams give rise to a ruling,
 and if the spacings of these rulings in the successive images
 ‘pe designated by 61, 62, 63, 64, we have, by proceeding as in
   25,

where M, M’, and M” are the number of times that images D,
 E, and F respectively are larger than the microscopic object ;
 and where also, by equation (1),

     M' =n sin a/sin f7, and is also =n sin a'/sin y’          - (7)

where n“, 1, and n' are respectively the indices of refraction
of the medium in front of the objective, of air, and of the
vitreous humour in the eye of the observer.
     Hence the ruling to which these two beams give rise in
image U is reproduced in images D, E, and F. The same is
true of all the rulings by the co—existence of which image C
 is formed ; and as within each image the spacings of all the
 rulings are modi<U+FB01>ed in the same way, it follows that every
feature which is present in any one of these images is present
in all the others—of course on the supposition that no defect
is introduced by imperfections in the objective, the eyepiece,
or the eye.
     Image E appears to the observer like an object presented
to his unassisted eye, and in it the conditions must be ful<U+FB01>lled
 for naked-eye vision.         These chie<U+FB02>y concern the angular size
which that image must have in order that the minutest detail
in it may be suf<U+FB01>ciently lar e to be satisfactorily seen (see
Section I. of a paper “On t e Limits of Vision,” Scienti<U+FB01>c

     317 . to what the detail is, and as to the true nature of
p . But)as
that detail, we still have to fall back upon a study of standard
 image No. 2, and of the adjustments of the microscope which
are available for improving that image. And this can be best
done by the study of individual examples, which is to be the
 subject matter of Part III.                       .
     If any dif<U+FB01>culty still hangs over the subject treated of in
 the last few sections it will be cleared up by following out
the whole history of one individual beam.
     27. Course of an individual beam traced, and How to see
 it.——It has already been proved that the microscopic object
and all the illuminating apparatus may be removed, and that
standard image No. 2 may be substituted for them, if this
image be formed after two reversals, and if it therefore emits
its light forwards. Let C in the <U+FB01>gure be the position of this
standard ,image and let Cb be one of the beams of uniform
 plane waves which it sends forward. Let the dark line
 in the <U+FB01>gure represent the axial ray, that is the ray which
 starting from the middle of image 0 continues throughout
perpendicular to the waves of which the beam consists. The
    *t It is the usual practice in England to employ the symbol a for the
 refractive index ; but it cannot conveniently be so used in treating of the
 microscope, since ,4 is wanted as the designation of the micron. On this
 account the continental practice of using 1: for the refractive index has
been adopted in the text.

beam enters the objective at b, and by the objective is brought
to a focus ate, the focus for parallel rays. Here it forms an
Airy’s spurious disk, or rather a somewhat more diffuse
spurious disk, since the objective falls short of being aplanatic
in its treatment of beams of parallel light incident on its
front surface. Past the focus .2: the beam advances, and
diverges as it advances. Let D be where the axial ray, the
dark line of the <U+FB01>gure, intersects the optic axis of the micro
scope. Note that the axial rays of all the other beams emitted
from the image G will, like this one, start from the point
where O is pierced by the optic axis of the microscope, and
 will all intersect that axis again at D. At D an image of
 C is formed on a somewhat curved surface that stands at
 right angles to the optic axis of the microscope. Our
 beam, diverging from at, when it reaches this surface con
 tributes its quota towards the formation of the image upon it.
 After passing image D the divergent beam continues till
 it reaches the front of the eyepiece.      It proceeds through

  where the eyepiece can form an image of .r. If we produce
 the portion qg of the axial ray backwards, it will intersect
 the optic axis at E, where the backward production of the
  convergent beam gg will widen out so as to extend over
  the space occupied by the virtual image E, and contribute
  its-share towards the formation of that image. Accordingly
 the light of our beam, which advances in the direction g ,
  will enter the eye (the pupil of which should be broug t
 close to g) in the same state as if it had come direct from the
 whole extent of an image at E. After passing g-the beam
 again diverges, and by the optical action of the front half of

the eye this divergence is lessened and at the same time the
axial ray is bent in so as a third time to intersect the optic
axis of the microscope, where that axis prolonged pierces the
retina of the observer. Upon the retina, round this point,
the beam of lessened divergence spreads and there assists in
the formation of image F, the image of the microscopic object
which is formed by the microscope upon the retina of the
observer.
    Twice upon its journey the beam we are dealing with has
been brought to a focus—at a: and at y. At both these posi
tions it is concentrated into a point or, to use more accurate
language, into a spurious disk, and can be seen as such. It may
be seen at a: by removing the eyepiece and looking down the
tube of the microscope, taking care to keep the eye central ;
and it may also be seen at y by replacing the eyepiece and
looking with a magni<U+FB01>er at the image y formed in the air
outside the eyepiece *.
    Accordingly every visible point of the image seen at a:
 when we look down the tube of the microscope is the con
 centrated light of one of the beams of uniform plane waves
 which has been emitted from the whole extentof the objective
 <U+FB01>eld. We may therefore, by scrutinizing the position and
 brightness of the points of this image, learn in what directions
 and with what intensity the beams of uniform plane waves are
 being thrown off from the whole front of the objective
<U+FB01>eld.
    We must not, however, suppose that by scrutinizing this
image we can learn everything about those beams, inasmuch
as they differ from one another not only in those respects of
which the eye can take cognizance, but also in the form and
position of the elliptic motion in each wave front, and in its
 phase at a given instant—particulars which, though the eye
cannot detect them, are of primary importance in determining
what image of the microscopic object they will contribute to
form when they reach the position D.
    To complete this survey, we should trace the course of the
light up to the microscopic object, as well as from that
position forward. The light as it reaches the objective <U+FB01>eld
would be ideally perfect if it could be resolved into beams of
plane waves, perfectly uniform, coming with equal intensity
   * The effect is most striking when'the object is such as directs into a
few de<U+FB01>nite beams each beam of the light supplied to it by the condenser.
An excellent objectis the diatom known as Perist-epham'a eutycha, especially
when the iris diaphragm is nearly closed, so that only a smal sheaf
of beams, each extending over the whole objective <U+FB01>eld, is supplied by
the condenser.

               Dr. G. J. Stoney on Microscopic Vision.         435
from all the directions in which the iris diaphragm and stops
allow light to pass, and at the same time in all other respects
—in phase, ellipticity, and so on—such light as would have
been emitted in the reverse direction downwards from a
perfectly featureless self-luminous plane occupying the position
upon the stage of the microscope of the objective <U+FB01>eld.
     This ideal is the more nearly approximated to, the better the
condenser; and it would appear that the best position of the
 source of light is that which would be occupied by the image
which the condenser would form beneath of such a featureless
luminous plane as we have supposed. Hence the suggestion
as to the position of the source of light made in § 21. It
further appears that the ideal position for the iris diaphragm
and stops would be at the position which we may call z
(corresponding to x and y) where beams of uniform plane
 waves emitted downwards from the supposed luminous plane
 would be brought to a focus by the condenser.           This is a
position which is usuallyr very close to the condenser ; and it
 would be a marked improvement in microscopes if the iris
 diaphragm and stops were brought nearer to this ideal position
 than they commonly are. As they are at present placed,
 different parts of the <U+FB01>eld of view are treated di<U+FB02>'erently by
 them in an appreciable degree.
      We have next to examine into some points the consideration
 of which will put us in a better position for interpreting
 aright what we shall see in the microscope.
      28. Of the Composition and Resolution of Undulations.—We
 shall start from the known fact that any luminous undulation
 of uniform plane waves of wave-length 7\. may be resolved
 into two undulations of plane-polarized light polarized in
 planes at right angles. In order to get their equations in
 their simplest form, let the axis of .c be placed perpendicular
 to the wave surfaces, and the axes of y and .2 parallel to the
 transversals of the two plane-polarized components. Then
 the equations of the given undulation, which we may call U,
 will be—
                        q=asin(g7%r(vt—w)+a),- -          -  -  (1)
                         g=bsin(2-;’(vt—w)+<U+FB02>),- - - - (2)
 in which a] and C are the displacements, at the time t, in the
 two plane-polarized components, a and b are the amplitudes
  (i. e. the scalar part of the transversals), v is the velocity of
 light, and a and B are the initial phases on the plane yz,

436          Dr. G. J. Stoney on Microscopic Vision.
which last are constants that are determined by the ellipticity
of the light of the undulation U,by the position of its ellipse,
and by its initial phase.
   Similarly, another undulation V of uniform plane waves
travelling in the same direction will be represented by equa
tions 3 and 4
                   n'=a’sin(2—;r(vt—.v)+a’), . . . . (3)
                    §’=b’sin(2—;T(vt-.z)+<U+FB02>’).. . . . (4)
If the undulations U and V are simultaneously present, the
displacements over the plane .v and at the time t will be
n+1/ and §+§’ ; and these by elementary trigonometry are
found to be
               q+<U+FB02>'=Msin(?{(a-a)+A),. . . . (5)
                §+§'=Nsin(2%(vt—.v)+B),. . . . (6)

Equations (5) and (6) represent an undulation of uniform
plane waves travelling in the same direction as U and V.
 We may call this resultant undulation W. Equations (7),
 (8), (9), (10) enable us to determine the constants of any one
 of these three undulations, if we know those of the other two.
 It appears accordingly that any two of the three undulations
 U, V, W being given, the third can be found.
    It is an easy inference from this that any number of undu
 lations of uniform plane waves of wave-length a, that travel
 in the same direction, may be combined into a single undula
 tion of the same kind travelling in that direction : a proposition
 of which use was made above in the latter part of §6, of
 Part I., p. 337.
    29. Of elementary sheafs of beams, and of the single beams
which may be substituted for than—Beams of uniform plane
 waves may be emitted in any or all directions from the front

             Dr. G. J. Stoney on Morosr'opic Vision.        437
of the objective <U+FB01>eld, or from either of its “standard images.”
Draw what we have called the axial ra s of these. They are
lines radiating from the middle of t e objective <U+FB01>eld, and
each perpendicular to the waves of its own beam. Take a
group of these axial rays which lie within a de<U+FB01>nite cone,
then the corresponding beams may be called a sheaf of beams;
and where the cone within which the axial rays are con<U+FB01>ned
is a very acute one, the corresponding beams may be called
an elementary sheaf of beams. The whole of the beams
emitted by the objective <U+FB01>eld, or from either of its standard
images, may obviously be conceived of as divided up into
elementary sheafs of any required degree of minuteness.
   If we onl have to deal with an image of limited extent
like standar image No. l, or standard image N0. 2 (which
are the same size as the objective <U+FB01>eld), then we are justi<U+FB01>ed
in substituting a single beam travelling along the axis of the
cone for each elementary sheaf of beams. This may be proved
as follows :—
   Let U be one of the beams whose axial ray lies within the
elementary cone, and let 0 be the angle between that axial
ray and the axis of the cone.       The cone, of course, has its
vertex at the centre of the objective <U+FB01>eld. Let now V be an
equivalent beam whose axial ray lies along the axis of the
cone, and let the phase of V be such that U and V are in the
same phase at the centre of the objective <U+FB01>eld. Then, as in
§ 15, let —V mean the same beam as +V, only with wadded
to all its phases. Accordingly, if +V and —-V are simulta
neously present they cancel one another absolutely. Vile may
therefore add both of these to the elementary sheaf of beams
without altering it. Now —V and U would produce a ruling
which will be the coarser, 2'. e. with its luminous bands more
 widely spaced, the smaller the angle 0 is. Moreover, since
 +V and U are in the same phase at the vertex of the cone,
which is also the centre of the objective <U+FB01>eld, it follows that
one of the minima of illumination of the ruling produced by
 —V and U will occupy that position. Now by making 9
 suf<U+FB01>ciently small, the spacing of this ruling may be made so
many times larger than the objective <U+FB01>eld that there is no
appreciable illumination anywhere within the limits of the
 objective <U+FB01>eld. If this be so, we may sup ress the beams
 -—V and U without producing appreciable c ange within the
 limits of the objective <U+FB01>eld. When this is done, the elemen
 tary sheaf of beams differs from What it was at <U+FB01>rst by having
 +V now in the lace of U. By a similar process we may
 substitute V', V”, £0. travelling along the axis of the elemen
 tary cone for the other beams whose axial rays lie within the
    Phil. May. S. 5. Vol. 42. No. 258. Nov. 1896.       2 I

'cone. And, <U+FB01>nally, all these V’s, since they travel in pre
cisely the same direction, will, as is proved in the last section,
coalesce into a single resultant beam W travelling along the
axis of the cone, which single resultant may accordingly be
substituted for the elementary sheaf of beams.
    The general conclusion is :—The whole of the light emitted
from the objective <U+FB01>eld may, by Theorem 1, be resolved into
beams of uniform plane waves; these beams may be divided into
small groups, each an elementary sheaf of beams; and each
elementary sheaf of beams may have a single beam substituted
for it.—ln every subsequent step of our investigation we need
only deal with these resultants—these secondary beams as they
 may be called—which, though many, are limited in number.
    30. Another proof of Theorem 2.—Theorern 2 may be
proved in many ways, and a proof which carries the analysis
of an image down to its simplest elements will be found
instructive. Describe a hemisphere in front of the objective
<U+FB01>eld and round its centre.        tall the point where the optic
                              Fig. 2.
               Q a
axis of the microscope pierces this hemisphere, its pole.
 Planes passing through the optic axis may be called the
meridional planes; and the objective plane,being perpendicular
'to the axis of the microscope, will be its equatorial plane.
 Divide the equator of our hemisphere into seconds of arc,
 z. e., into 1,296,000 parts, which will afford suf<U+FB01>ciently
 minute divisions upon which the bases of elementary cones
 may abut. Draw parallels of latitude also at intervals of a
 second ; and draw meridians as in the <U+FB01>gure, marking out in
conjunction with the'parallels of latitude the bases of the
elementary cones, or rather pyramids.             These become
narrower the higher the latitude, and as soon as they have
.shrunk to half a second horizontally every alternate meridian
 may be omitted, until they have shrunk again till other
meridians may be omitted without any of the little sectors

             Dr. G. J. Stoncy on lVIicroscopio Vision.       439
being more than a' second in width. By this process the
whole hemisphere may be mapped out into these patches
placed in vertical series, each series with a corresponding
series 011 the opposite side of the polar axis, and the whole
ending up in one patch or in one pair of patches at the pole.
From the middle of each patch draw a radius of the sphere,
omitted from the diagram to avoid confusion, but easily con
ceived.    These are the axial rays of the secondary beams \V,
which we are at liberty to substitute for the elementary sheafs
of beams that really exist.
    In this as in all similar problems it is convenient to begin
by resolving each beam of light into two plane-polarized
beams, one polarized in and the other perpendicular to the
meridional plane in which its axial ray lies. We may then
con<U+FB01>ne our attention <U+FB01>rst to the light polarized in one of
these ways. Let us then call the secondary beams Which are
polarized in one'of these ways a, b, &c., and the correspondinv
beams opposite to them and polarized in the same way, a', 11?,
&c., as in the <U+FB01>gure.
    111 general, beam a and beam a' will not be alike. How
ever, beam a’ may by the proposition in 23, p. 435, be sub
divided into a'1 and “'2, of which a’1 shall be exactly similar
to a. Accordingly a and (1', produce a de<U+FB01>nite ruling of
equal and equidistant lines extending over the whole standard
image; and a'2 has still to be disposed of. Resolve 6 into
two beams of which I», is similar to a'2, and b2 is the other
component. Then a’, and b1 produce another ruling, and b,
has next to be disposed of. To do this, resolve 12' into 6’, and
("2, of which F1 is similar to 62.    Then I), and 6/1 produce a
ruling and b'2 is what remains over. By continuing this
process the whole of the vertical columns over a and a.’
may be disposed of: and in a similar way the other columns
can be treated. All the rulings extend over the whole
of the standard image, and between them use up the whole
of the light polarized one way, except that residium which
is left over in the last patch at the pole. This residium can
be made as small as we please by diminishing the size of
our elementary cones; and of whatever amount it is, it
only represents the limiting case of a ruling produced by
two beams advancing at a vanishing angle to one another,
and of which accordingly the spacing is in<U+FB01>nite.
    A similar treatment applies to the light polarized the other
way, which also produces its body of rulings; so that <U+FB01>nally
 the whole of the light emitted by the objective <U+FB01>eld, however
 varied its contents, can be laid down on the standard image in
 the form of a number of luminous rulings of unifbrm parallel
 lines, each of them of that optically most simple character
                                2 l

440          Dr. G. J. Stoney on Microscopic Vision.
which is produced by a single pair of beams that are alike and
polarized, either both in the plane of incidence or both perpendicu
larlg to it.
    A similar treatment applies to standard image N0. 2, the
only di<U+FB02>'erence being that to analyse it we are to employ a
 sector of the hemisphere in the <U+FB01>gure on p. 438 instead of the
whole hemisphere.
    Hence Theorem 2 is fully proved.
    31. The resolution not unique—In order to follow the most
 simple process when combining the secondary beams in pairs,
 we have taken both the members of each pair from the same
 meridian. We might of course have combined them laterally
 or obliquely, and we shall <U+FB01>nd it necessary to bear this in
 mind when dealing with some kinds of illumination that are
 found useful, e. g. annular illumination. It is obvious that
 it is legitimate to combine the secondary beams in any way
 which when completed has used up all the light: and our object
 should be to combine them in each case in whatever order is
 most convenient for the problem in hand. In the practical
 use of the microscope it is usually quite easy to see into
what groups it is most advantageous to throw them. In
 whatever order they are taken the <U+FB01>nal result is the same;
 but one order differs from another in the degree in which it
 gives us information that is of use to us.
    It is sometimes convenient to think of an optical image as
 a kind of picture, and that the rulings are, as it were, suc
 cessively painted in upon the <U+FB01>eld of view to form it. But
 if we conceive matters in this way we must remember that
 this luminous paint behaves after a very peculiar fashion.
 Where one ruling crosses another or overlies it, they may
 obliterate one another in some parts as well as strengthen
 one another in others, effects which will depend on the
 lengths and positions of the transversals in the two rulings and
 upon the relation in which their phases stand to one another.
     In this connexion it is very necessary to bear in mind
 that two rulings may be seemingly identical—-i. e., identical
 in position, spacing, intensity, &c., in such matters as the eye
 can perceive—and yet these rulings may behave quite
 dili'erently towards the other rulings with which they are
 associated, owing to dili'erences affecting the transversals and
 phases which our eyes are not <U+FB01>tted to take note of.          Thus,
 what are apparently identical rulings might result from the
 interference of two beams little inclined to the optic axis,
 and from two others much inclined ; or from two beams in
 the same meridian and two others in other positions: but
 these seemingly identical rulings would all behave differently
 towards the rest of the light with which they have to act.

              Dr. G. J. Stoney 0n Meroscopic Vision.          441
     32. Criticism of the Abbe and the Airy methods.-—The proof
  which we have just gone through is instructive in many
  ways. In the <U+FB01>rst place, it carries the analysis of the image
  down to rulings of the simplest kind that are known. In the
  second lace, it makes the <U+FB02>exibility and Protean character
  of the w ole process conspicuous; for although we followed
  one particular order in combining the secondary beams in
  pairs to form rulings, it is manifest that this order was in no
  degree neCessury, and that the secondary beams might have
 been grouped in an in<U+FB01>nite number of different ways, the
 only condition being that whatever order we adopt we must
 take care to use up all the light. This menus that the set of
 rulings which form an image is not unique: that there are
 an in<U+FB01>nite number of such sets, any one of which will suf<U+FB01>ce
 to lorm the image.
    But, above all, the proof given in the last section brings
 well into view the source of the advantage which is found in
 employing Abbe’s mode of procedure as our instrument for
 searching out the causes of the phenomena presented by
 microscopic vision. By the process we have followed the
 light sent forward from the objective <U+FB01>eld has been analysed
 into beams of plane waves. Now this is only one of number
 less ossible ways of analysing that light. It is an analysis
 whic may be made, not which must be made. But it has
 the advantage over every other analysis, that the resulting
 waves are uniform waves, exactly alike in every respect over
 the whole extent of each wave surface and each wave retaining
its form and intensity unchanged during its advance.
    This sets us free from a sea of dif<U+FB01>culties that embarass
our progress when we attempt to employ any other resolution.
If the analysis be made into curved waves of any kind—into
those of Airy’s method or any others—the resulting waves
are not uniform over each wave-surface; and as the law of
this want of uniformity is not yet known, we can only
legitimately employ Airy’s method in the cases where this
want of uniformity has an inconspicuous effect upon the
result of our inquiry. This is the case, for instance, in the
treatment of telescopic vision to which Airy applied it. Here
the sector of each hemispherical wave that we have to deal
with is su<U+FB02>iciently small for the want of uniformity within
its small extent to be of negligible amount.
   It has sometimes been supposed that we can investigate
microscopic vision by applying Airy’s analysis to the light
sent forward to the eye from the image of t e microscopical
object which is formed by the objective close to the eyepiece.
This light as it comes from each point of that image is con<U+FB01>ned
within a cone which is a continuation upwards of the narrow

442       Messrs. Ayrton and Mather on Galvanometers.
cone from the back lens of the objective to that point of the
image. Accordingly, if that object which is called the visual
substitute in Part 1., § 14, p. 342, could be put in place of this
image, sending forward hemispherical waves from each point
of it which might be treated as uniform within the limits of
the aforesaid cone ; then what the Airy method as hitherto
applied has investigated is what minuteness of detail it would
be possible to see in this object. But such an inquiry does
not even touch the main points towards which an investigation
of microscopic vision needs to be directed. It tells us nothing
as to what this visual substitute is, how far it can represent
something on the microscopic object, and how far it consists of
intercostal markings, diffraction-fringes arising from the
mismanagement of the illuminating apparatus, or any other
misleading effects. And of course it gives us no clue as to
how we are either to interpret or control any of these effects.
   Every legitimate mode of resolution, and there are number
less such, must lead to precisely the same result, if we can
succeed in correctly following out its consequences. Where
they differ is in our power of handling them. Abbe’s
resolution into beams of plane waves recommends itself above
all others in regard to this; since it substitutes uniformity
for that want of uniformity which exists in all other methods
of resolution in just those places where in the present state
of our knowledge we are unable to assign the law of this
want of uniformity. And even if we ever come to know
this law, the resolution into uniform plane waves will still
recommend itself in consequence of the law of uniformity
being simpler and therefore more easily handled than any law
of non-uniformity.

 XLIII. Galvanometers.        By Prof. \V. E. AYRTON, F.R.S.,
                        and T. MATHER *.
   N an article on “The Electric Discharge in a Magnetic
      Field ” contributed by Sir David Salomons to the Phil.
Mag. for September, it is stated on p. 255 :—
   “ I made a large number of experiments with galvanometers
built on the D’Arsonval-Deprez type, and obtained very
varying results by modifying the magnetic <U+FB01>eld. By in
creasing the <U+FB01>eld a maximum sensibility was reached, which
decreased on further increasing the <U+FB01>eld.
   “The various experiments described no doubt indicate the
cause of this, viz. that the <U+FB01>eld being made too powerful, less
current passes through the coil, and the sensibility begins to
                  " Communicated by'the Authors.

         Messrs. Ayrton and Mather on Galvanbmeters.           443
  fall. I had a special galvanometer-apparatus made to <U+FB01>t my‘
 large magnet, converting it probably into the largest galva-.
 nometer of the type extant ; but the sensibility is exceedingly.
 small when the magnet is fully excited, and increases rapidly
 when the excitation is somewhat diminished.”
     The preceding is gravely given by Sir David Salomons as -
 an illustration of the displacement of the current in a con-.
 ductor by a magnetic <U+FB01>eld “ generally known under the name.
  of the Hall effect,” in apparaut ignorance of the fact that the
  “ Hall effect ” is extremely minute. Indeed, had Sir David
  Salomons tried to compare the current sent by a given P. D..
  through a coil of insulated tine copper wire when placed in
 and out of any magnetic <U+FB01>eld he would have found it practi-.
  cally impossible to detect any difference, and he would have
  convinced himself that the great falling off in sensibility of a
  d’Arsonval galvanometer as the strength of the stationary
  magnetic <U+FB01>eld was increased beyond a certain limit could
  have nothing to do with the “Hall effect.”
      Further, this phenomenon, which is described in the Phil.
  Mag. for September as new, has for some time past been
  known to electrical-instrument-makers, for it was one of the.
  causes which prevented the sensibility of the suspended-coil.
  ty e of galvanometer being increased beyond a certain limit.
     In the discussion which took place after the reading of
  a paper on a “Workshop Ballistic Galvanometer” before
   the Physical Society in June 1892, reference was made—.
   perhaps for the <U+FB01>rst time publicly—to the ' dif<U+FB01>culty ex
  perienced in increasing the sensibility of a d’Arsonval
   galvanometer by increasing the strength of the <U+FB01>eld beyond
   a certain point. And it was the investigation of the cause
   of this phenomenon, and the discovering of a means to over
   come it, that caused the publication of the description
   of this instrument to be delayed until the meeting of the
   British Association in 1895, as was explained in the account
   of this latter instrument given in all the electrical journals
   about September 1895.
      In the ‘ Electrical Engineer ’ for October 5th, 1894, it was
   mentioned that “great dif<U+FB01>culties were, however, found to'
‘ arise when the extreme sensitiveness sometimes required
   in the laboratory was attempted . . . chie<U+FB02>y due to the
   traces of magnetism found to exist in the silk and other
   parts of the coil usually considered non-magnetic . . . .
   A great number of trials was made at the Central Technical
   College which showed that . . . . the purest wire of electrolytic
   copper or of <U+FB01>ne silver, specially drawn and covered, still
    showed traces, and a method . . . was at length devised “hich
   has practically solved the dif<U+FB01>culty. The non-magnetic pro

444       Messrs. Ayrton and Mather on Galeanometers.
perty of the new coils allows a magnet to be used whose <U+FB01>eld
is four times as strong as those ordinarily employed in this
type of instrument.”
    Rather more than a year later, in the ‘ Electrical Engineer ’
for December 13th, 1895, further information on this subject
is iven :—“ This phenomenon was <U+FB01>rst noticed by Mr. Mather
in ecember 1891 . . . The coil to be tested was suspended
in the earth’s <U+FB01>eld and the period of a complete oscillation
was found to be 252 seconds. It was then placed in a <U+FB01>eld
 of 1500 C.G.S. lines and the period was only 3'5 seconds,”
 corresponding with a controlling force due to the magnetic
 action of the coil <U+FB01>fty times as great as that due to the
 suspension itself. . . “parts of the coil became magnetic and
 it can easily be seen that this secondary effect is magni<U+FB01>ed in
 the d’Arsonval type of galvanometer, when, with the object
 of gaining sensibility, the ma netic <U+FB01>eld is strengthened . . .
 in fact the magnetic action of t e coil will defeat this attempt.”
    References are also given in the ‘ Electrician ’ and ‘ Elec
 trical Review’ of the same date to the limitation in sensi
 bility produced by the magnetism of the coil ; and lastly, in
 the ‘Electrician’ for January 31st, 1896, Mr. Fisher, in a
 series of articles on the “ Crompton Potentiometer,” writes :—
 " whilst up to a certain point the deflexions became greater
 with increased strength of <U+FB01>eld, beyond that point the de
 <U+FB02>exion gradually fell off as the <U+FB01>eld was strengthened, this
 being due, as Messrs. Ayrton and Mather have pointed out,
 to the presence of iron in the materials used in the construc
 tion of the coils. A remedy for the same was found by
 Messrs. Ayrton and Mather, and it is due to Prof. Ayrton’s
 kindness in disclosing the process adopted that the sensi
 bility of the instrument is to a great extent due.”
     We may take this opportunity of replying to an article on
 “ Galvanometer Design.         Waste Space near the Needle,”
   ublished in the Phil. Mag. for December 1895, by Prof. S. W.
  Dolmen, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as a
  criticism of one of the facts brought out in the 1890 paper on
 “Galvanometers” by Dr. Sumpner and ourselves. In that
 paper it was pointed out that to obtain maximum sensibility
 with an ordinary re<U+FB02>ecting-galvanometer no wire should be
 wound in a certain space close to the needle, or, if wound, it
  should be connected up the reverse way to the rest of the coil;
 and it was shown that the approximate shape of the space in
  question was “ an oblate spheroid with a polar axis about 0'72
  of its equatorial diameter, the latter being, of course, slightly
  larger than the length of the needle.”

         Messrs. Ayrton and Mather on Gall'anometei's.       445
   Prof. Holman admits the accuracy of' our reasoning that
there is a certain space in which the wire should either be
left out, or be oppositely connected, but he considers that we
overestimated the volume of this space because we neglected
“the fact that the <U+FB01>eld over the remainder of the needle is
not the same as at the poles, either in direction or strength.”
   And to support his argument he proceeds to consider what
ought to be the boundary of the space in the case of “ a very
thin uniformly magnetized prismatic needle” (the italics are
ours) without observing that this is exactly the case we dealt
with, and, therefore, must lead to exactly the conclusion we
arrived at. For no part of such a longitudinall magnetized
needle, other than its ends, contributes to t e de<U+FB02>ecting
moment when placed in any weak magnetic <U+FB01>eld, since no
free magnetism exists except at its ends. Hence his objection
that the <U+FB01>eld is not uniform throughout the length of the
needle has no weight whatever in the very example he has
 himself selected.
   We may also call attention to another error into which
Prof. Holman has fallen.        He gives as the value of the
de<U+FB02>ecting moment, produced by a current in a coil on a very
thin uniformly magnetized prismatic needle, the expression
                             z
                        2] m.fcos€.ds,
                           o
“m being the strength of pole of any thin transverse section
 or shell of the needle, ds the thickness of that section, f the
 <U+FB01>eld-intensity at that point, and t9 the <U+FB01>eld-direction angle
 with the axis of the coil.” But this expression could only be
 correct if every part of the needle were equidistant from the
 axis of rotation. And even if allowance were to be made for
 this not being the case by introducing s, the distance of a
 section from the axis, the expression
                            1
                        2f m.fcosl9.sds
                           0
 would still only give the correct value for the de<U+FB02>ecting
 moments in the case of “ a very thin uniformly magnetized
 prismatic needle ” by making m equal to nought for all points,
 except at the ends. And when that is done, the conclusions
 arrived at by Prof. Holman are profoundly modi<U+FB01>ed.
    As to the con<U+FB01>rmation by experiment of his conclusion that
 the de<U+FB02>ecting moment of a coil of diameter about half the
 length of the needle is nil when the coil is placed close to the
 needle, that merely proves, we think, that the needle he used
 In his experiments was not uniformly magnetized. It is, of
 course, well known that it is almost impossible to obtain

446         Messrs. Ayrton and Mather on Gal't-anometers.
magnets uniformly magnetized, and if free. magnetism exists
along the length of the magnet as well as at its ends, our
conclusion must, of course, be modi<U+FB01>ed. Indeed, we convinced
ourselves by experiments made at the Finsbury Technical:
 (Jollege as long back as 1884 that with ordinary magnetic
needles it was necessary to place a coil of given diameter
somewhat nearer to the needle than was indicated by the
formula in our 1890 paper before the de<U+FB02>ecting moment
changed sign. But since by far the greatest amount of free.
magnetism on very thin magnets exists near their ends, we
do not consider that the theoretical deductions contained in
that paper concerning the waste space can have been far
wrong.
   \Ve agree with Prof. Holman that uniformity should be
observed in describing the sensibility of galvanometers, and
we were glad to see that the system for denoting sensibility
which was proposed and used by us in our 1890 paper was
adopted in the programme of the Naturforscher und Aerzte
which met this September in Frankfurt. The t, however, used
by Prof. Holman in his proposed list of observed quantities
should be the periodic time, and not, as he states, “ the time
 of a single swing.”                                 I
   Further, in addition to the data respecting resistance,
periodic time, and current per millimetre de<U+FB02>exion at given
scale distance, mentioned by Prof. Holman as essential in
descriptions of sensitive galvanometers, we would point out'
that it is also important to give the moment of inertia of the
suspended system, for unless this be done it is impossible to
make the comparisons of various instruments complete. As -
is well known, the smaller the dimensions and mass of the
moving parts, the more excellent will such an instrument
appear, when excellence is judged entirely by the de<U+FB01>exion
per micro-ampere at constant scale distance and constant
period. But for certain purposes it is necessary to compare
instruments under conditions ofv constant controlling moment
per unit angle de<U+FB02>exion, because the stability of the zero and
trustworthiness of the readings depend on this quantity, as
was pointed out on pages 85 and 89 of our 1890 paper; so
that to make this comparison, a knowledge of the moment of
inertia of the suspended system is required.                  1
    Other useful particulars of galvanometers are the total
volume of the coils, and the decrement, or logarithmic decre
ment, of the oscillations. And since this latter depends on
the periodic time and on the condition of the galvanometer
circuit, whether closed or open, the damping should be
 observed with the instrument under the same conditions as
 when the periodic time was taken.

Anleitlmg zur mikroohemischen Analyse der wirhtigsten organisohe‘n
    Verbindungen. Vol. 111. By Prof. H. BEHRENS. Hamburg:
    Voss, 1896.
THE rapid development of organic chemistry, and more especially
      the discovery of substances chemically almost identical but phy
sically different, has caused the chemist to turn his attention to
physical instruments, with the result that the polarimeter, polari
scope, and refractometer are to be found in every well-equipped
laboratory for chemical research. Prof. Behrens now seeks to
introduce the microscope to the organic chemist, and in the three
parts of his work which have already appeared he describes the
 behaviour of the more important organic compounds when crystal
lized, or treated with reagents, on the stage of the microscope.
 The reactions described result in the formation of crystals, the
 size, shape, and optical characters of which are speci<U+FB01>ed. The
 present volume deals with the aromatic amines, and is enriched by
 77 illustrations of microscopic crystals obtained by precipitation.
It should prove a useful handbook in the organic laboratory.

THE following communications were read :—
       1. ‘ On Foliated Granitcs and their Relations to the Crystal
line Schists in Eastern Sutherland.’ By J. Horne, Esq., F.l{.S.E.,
F.G.S., and E. Greenly, Esq., F.G.S.
    The crystalline schists of Eastern Sutherland are traversed by
great numbers of granitic intrusions, chie<U+FB02>y in the form of lenticular
sills. These generally lie parallel to the foliation-planes of the
schists, but transgressive junctions are also frequent. Thin seams
of granite also occur in such abundance as to constitute with the
schists a banded gneissic series; but these seams can often be seen
to trunsgress the schistose folia, and even often to proceed from
large masses of granite. The granites contain numerous inclusions
of the schists which they traverse, such inclusions retaining, usually,
the dip and strike of the surrounding rocks.
    There are no chilled edges; and, moreover, the component crystals
of schist and granite mutually interlock along the lines of junction.
    The authors give an account of the foliation of the granite. In
some rare cases a folialion parallel to that of the schists traverses
granite-veins.    It is generally, however, parallel at once to the
sides of the sill and to the foliation of the schists ; and many of the
structures are the remains of biotite-folia. belonging to schists
whose quartzo-fclspathic elements have been incorporated with

  448                      Geological Society :—
  those of the granite. But many sills or veins, traversing the schists
  at various angles, are foliated parallel to the line of junction, and so
  discordantly to the structures in the schists; and foliated granites may
  even be observed to cut each other’s foliation. These can hardly be
  anything but original igneous structures; but, if coexistent with
  the last-named, would be indistinguishable from it.
     The country-rocks are various types of biotite-schist or gneiss,
  with quartz-schists at Kildonan, and a scapolite-limestone at Arma
  dale. They are almost all holocrystalline, but it is certain that
  sedimentary rocks enter into the complex. The whole series is
  powerfully folded.
     The granites increase in size and numbers north-westward from
  Kildonan : the intimate intrusive relations above described becoming
  more highly developed in the same direction.        The schists, at the
  same time, become more and more highly crystalline, sillimanite
  also appearing in them. About Kinbrnce they are coarse silliman
  ite—biotite—gneisses, with large striated felspars.
     Igneous contact is not held to be the sole origin of metamorphism,
 though the cause which brought about the introduction of the gra
 nites has evidently also produced these high types of crystallization.
 The evidence of powerful movement which the schists everywhere
 present suggests that such movement was the initial cause of the
 whole series of phenomena. Movement recurred throughout, though
 all cataclastic structures (if such existed) have been wholly e<U+FB01>'aced
 by crystallization; introduction of granite being the <U+FB01>nal stage in
 the production of the complex, and a high temperature (as shown
 by the absence of chilled edges) being maintained to the very end.
    With regard to the granites, the authors <U+FB01>nd it dif<U+FB01>cult to believe
 that they are wholly foreign matter, but remark that it is here
 necessary to observe the utmost caution.
    2. ‘The Geology of the Eastern Corner of Anglesey.’ By E.
 Greenly, Esq., F.G.S.
    The notes contained in this paper embody the principal results
 obtained during a survey of Anglesey 0n the six-inch scale.
    The schists of the South-east of the island are succeeded uncon
formably by the slates of Careg Onnan, which appear to be
separated by a strong unconformity from the Ordovician shales.
The Careg Onnan slates appear (pending con<U+FB01>rmation from other
sections or direct fossil. evidence) to be of pre-Cambrian age, and
the author records the existence of sponge-spicules therein.
    The ashy grits and bedded tu<U+FB02>’s of Baron Hill near Beaumaris
appear to have been moved somewhat from the E.N.E. along a
thrust-plane. They are traversed by planes of mylonization, and
are much broken and folded.
    The Ordovician rocks consist chie<U+FB02>y of sparingly fossiliferous dark
shales and mudstones, but contain a group of volcanic tu<U+FB01>'s on the
horizon of the pisolitic ironstone.
    The Carboniferous rocks appear to be about 700 feet thick, and
contain conglomerates, sandstones, and shales, with plant-remains
about the middle of the series.

            Seismic Phenomena in the British Empire.              449
   The Glacial striae sweep round from S.S.W. at the north, to S.W.
and W.b‘.W. at the south end of the district. In the Penmon area
there is cross-hatching with a series running S.S.E., and it is
suggested that this is due to <U+FB02>uctuations in the power of the Car
narvonshire glaciers to de<U+FB02>ect the ice coming from the north,
combined with the local in<U+FB02>uence of certain high ground.
   3. ‘ Seismic Phenomena in the British Empire.’ By M. F.
de Montcssus do Ballore, Captain of Fortress Artillery at Belle-Ile
en-Mer.
   The author gives a brief outline of a plan that he has elaborated
for studying Seismology. He has separated his work into four
parts :—1. The formation of an Earthquake Catalogue. 2. Refuta
tion of the empirical laWs previously enunciated. 3. Description of
the globe from a. seismological point of view. 4. Investigation of
the characters which differentiate stable from unstable regions.
   He gives a. method by which the relative seismicity (or instability
as regards earthquakes) of regions may be obtained and registered,
and indicates some of the results which he has derived from his study,
including the intimate relationship between instability and surface
relief, and the independence of seismic and volcanic phenomena.
   The main part of the paper is a section of the third division of
the author’s work, and deals in detail with the earthquakes of the
British Empire. In this part of the paper, the recorded earth
quakes of the British Isles, India, Australia and New Zealand,
British Africa, Canada, and various scattered possessions are de
 scribed.

    1. ‘Notes on the Glacial Geology of Arctic Europe and its
 Islands—Part II. Arctic Norway, Russian Lapland, Novaya
 Zemlya, and Spitsbergen.’ By Col. H. W. Feilden, F.G.S. With
 an Appendix by Prof. T. G. Bouncy, D.Sc., LL.D., F.R.S., V.P.G.S.
    The author gives an account of observations made in Arctic
 Norway which tend to prove that the shell-bearing terraces are
 true marine deposits indicating uplift since their formation, and
 that they were not formed by ice-dams. He then describes terraces
 recently formed in Kolguev Island, which illustrate the combined
 in<U+FB02>uence of pack-ice, sea-waves, and snow on the formation of
 terraces in a. rising area. The glacial geology of the Kola Peninsula
 is next considered, and the distiibution of tho boulders noticed.
 There is no doubt that these boulders have been derived from local
 rocks, and that no ice-sheet from the North ever passed through
 Barents Sea or impinged on the northern coast of Europe.
    The author saw no evidence of the former extension of an ice
 sheet over the now frost-riven rocks of N ovaya Zenilya. He found
 wide-spread deposits of boulder-clay with marine shells in this
 region, which he attributes to the action of <U+FB02>oating ice.      In the
 Kostin Schar many of the islands are connected by ridges covered

450           Intelligence and .Miscellaneous Articles.
with rounded stones pushed up by <U+FB02>ee-ice, with solid rock beneath
glaciated by the <U+FB02>oc-ice. Several minor phenomena connected with
the glacial geology of Novaya Zemlya are also described. The
raised beaches of Franz Josef Land are noticed, and immense
deposits occurring in Spitsbergen, which were originally formed
under water in front of glaciers, alluded to.   These, as well as other
submarine deposits of glacio-m'irine origin seen elsewhere by the
author, show no signs of strati<U+FB01>cation.
    Prot'. Bouncy describes specimens brought by Col. Feilden from
Norway, the Kola Peninsula, and Novaya Zcmlya. From an
examination of the rocks obtained in situ in the latter region,
Prof. Bonney confirms Col. Feilden’s suggestion that the Kolguev
erratics may have come from Novaya Zemlya.
    2. ‘Extrusive and Intrusive Igneous Rocks as Products of
Magmatic Differentiation.’ By Prof. J. P. Iddings, For.Corr.G.S.
    The author, after pointing out the propositions concerning
differentiation of magmas upon which he is in agreement with
Prof. Brb'gger, discusses the points of difference, and describes the
relation of the igneous rocks at Electric Peak to all of those which
took part in the great series of eruptions which occupied almost the
whole Teitiary period, and spread themselves over a vast territory
 in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho. In Tertiary times the eruptions
were at <U+FB01>rst largely explosive, and the accumulation of tuff-brcccia
formed a chain of lofty volcanoes, comparable with the Andes in
size as well as in the nature of their material (andesite and andesitic
basalt). After considerable erosion of these volcanoes, gigantic
<U+FB01>ssure-eruptions <U+FB02>ooded the region west of the denuded volcanoes.
The maSsire lava-streams which welled from these <U+FB01>ssures consisted
at <U+FB01>rst of rhyolite with an average silica-percentage of about 7 4,
 alternating occasionally with basalt; but the great bulk of the
basalt was poured out immediately after the rhyolite from <U+FB01>ssures
 still farther to the west and south-west. In the case of these
extrusive rocks, whose volumes are of such magnitude, the evidence
 drawn from the succession of their eruptions and from their com
 position is of a higher order than that derived from the smaller and
 more localized erupt-ions, and it is upon evidence of this order that
the author ventured to enunciate the principle that in a region of
 eruptive activity the succession of eruptions in general commences
 with magmas representing a mean composition and ends with those
of extreme composition.

  CARBON MEGOHMS FOR HlGH VOLTAGES. BY W. M. MORDEY*.
 THE insulation of apparatus and cables used with high voltages
        should be tested with high voltages. For this and many other
 purposes some inexpensive and trustworthy form of high resistance
    * Paper read before Section A, British Association, Liverpool, Sep
tember 23rd, 1896.    Communicated by the Author.

               Intelligence and .lflscellaneous Articles.         45 L
is required. The ordinary carbon megohm is very untrustworthy,
being subject to considerable variation and unsuited for use with
pressures of more than a few volts. The Author having overcome
these defects thinks the simplicity of the plan followed no reason
for withholding a description of it.
    A study of some of these carbon megohms, supplied by
instrument-makers, showed that, although the loss is very small,
being only one-millionth of a watt per volt impressed, the delicate
conducting <U+FB01>lm or line of plumbago is too much disturbed by the
heat generated. Experiment showed that on increasing the cross
section of the conducting <U+FB01>lm, and correspondingly increasing its
length, it became easy to construct a carbon resistance practically
uninfected by any ordinary variation of temperature, and capable
of being _used with pressures of 100 volts per megohm, or as much
higher as'may be desired.
    Various ways of carrying this out have been tried. Excellent
results were obtained by the use of long strips of shellaced
cartridge—paper coated on one side to a width of one to two
inches With plumbago, well burnished, the edges of the paper
strip being folded down over the <U+FB01>lm to protect it. The strip
is then rolled into a loose spiral, secured to a support, and mounted
in a suitable box with terminals.
    Examples of these resistances were shown and particulars given
 of tests to which they had been subjected. The resistance in one
 case was 1315 megohm at 746’ F. It was tested at various
 temperatures up to 150° F., and was practically constant throughout
 this range, the resistance at the higher temperature being 1'31
 megohms.
    Another resistance shown, which measured 0'975 megohm, had
 been subjected to a pressure of 100 volts for 12 hours continuously
 without showing any change. It was stated that these resistances
 were being supplied by Mr. Paul, of 14 Hatton Garden, London.
            SEARCH FOR SOLAR (U-RAYS ON PlKE’S PEAK.
                           BY FLURIAN CAJORI.
    Experiments carried on by M. C. Lea * and others have failed
 to show the presence of Rontgen rays in solar radiation. If
 these rays reach us from the sun, their intensity must be ex—
 ceedingly feeble.     The suggestion has been made that Ro'ntgen
 rays may exist in sunlight, but are absorbed by the earth's atmo
 sphere. The fact that Lenard rays are stopped by only a thin
  layer of air made it not improbable that Rontgen rays might
  be stopped by a thick layer of it. On this hypothesis a mountain
  t0p is the best locality to examine sunlight for the new rays. The
  writer determined, moreover, to expose the photographic plate to
  solar rays, not several hours, but several weeks.

   During preliminary experiments made in Colorado Springs, it
was found that a sheet of aluminium would allow certain solar
rays to pass through. These were not Rontgen rays, for the
reason that black paper placed between the aluminium and the
photographic plate seemed to cast as deep a shadow as did a. strip
of iron. A different mode of exposing the plate was necessary
and a plan similar to Lea’s was <U+FB01>nally adopted.
   The <U+FB01>rst 100 leaves of an unbound book were turned over, and a
rectangular trough of the dimensions of the photographic plate
(7'5 by 13 em.) out into the next 55 pages. Seven pages above
this trough, thin metallic plates, from 5 to 20 mm. wide, were
placed between two leaves, and held in position by gumming the
two leaves together. Care was taken to let the mucilage dry before
shutting the book. After the photographic plate (Seed, 23) was
placed in the trough, the book was closed, wrapped in black
tissue-paper, then in para<U+FB02>ine paper, and <U+FB01>nally put into a tin
box.
   The box was prepared as follows :—Its lid was placed externally
over its bottom and a rectangular window, 7'5 by 13-5 cm., cut
through them both.         Thereupon a sheet of aluminium, 13 by
23 cm., and '29 mm. thick, was placed between the lid and the
 bottom, so as to screen the window. The wide margin of the
aluminium, lying between the sheets of tin, was united to them
 above and below by thin layers of bees’—wax. Externally the
edges of the rectangular window were covered with sealing-wax,
 to which a thick layer of paint was <U+FB01>nally applied. A new lid
 was provided for the open side of the box and both lids were
 soldered on. Prepared in this manner, the box could be left
 exposed to all kinds of weather without danger that moisture
 would reach the photographic plate. To touch the plate, rays had
 to penetrate the sheet of aluminium, a few layers of paratline and
 black paper, and 100 pages of the book. Ro'ntgen rays of intensity
 ordinarily met with in the laboratory penetrate at once very much
 greater thicknesses of these materials.
    Through the kindness of Mr. F. Blackmer and Mr. D. Rupp, of
 Colorado Springs, the box was taken to the summit of Pike’s Peak
 (elevation 14,147 ft.) and fastened by wires upon a roof sloping
 southward. The box was left in that position from June 27 to
 August 10. When subjected to the usual process of development,
 the plate failed to show any action of rays and presented a uniform
 surface, without traces of shadows from the metallic strips.
 Another plate, similarly exposed from July 7th to Augustp28th in
 Rosamont Park, near Pike’s Peak, at an altitude of 9200 ft., gave
 the same result.
    Thus even in high altitudes no evidence of the presence of
 Rb'ntgen rays in solar radiation was obtained—Am. Jam-n. Sci.

XLVII. On some Experiments with Rontgen’s Radiation.
    By RICHARD THRELFALL, 111.11., Professor of Physics, and
     JAMES ARTHUR POLLOOK, Demonstrator of Physics in the
     University of Sydney, N.S. W.*
THE experiments to be described were performed during
         April and May of this year, and were made with the
object of elucidating the nature of the radiation. It was
thought that the following possible explanations should be
tested :—
     1. The radiation consists of a swarm of material particles
           projected through the glass of the generating tube.
           Electrical changes taking place at the glass surface are
           invoked to explain the differences between B'ontgen’s
          [and Lenard’s rays.
     2. The radiation consists of an “ aether wind.”' Ether is
           sucked through the glass towards the source of radia
           tion and then blown outwards. The question as to
           whether the radiation observed by Rontgen is the
           expression of the motion of aether to or from the source
       a   remaining open.
1 ‘ 3. The radiation consists of tether vortices moving to or
           from the source.
     4. The radiation consists of aether waves: that is waves of
       ‘ regular or irregular aether motions.

        ponents. This is probably a special case of (4)—-at
        least if we are to look to the aether to explain electricity
        and magnetism dynamically.
   6. The radiation is a phenomenon of a new order entirely
        unconnected in any way with anything in our past
        experience.
                       Source of Radiation.
   Being thrown entirely on our own resources for means of
production of the radiation—all the Crookes’s tubes in our
possession being almost useless—we arrived at the form of tube
shown in <U+FB01>g. 1. These tubes are easily made; the surface
                               Fig. 1.
opposite to the kathode being spherical, can be made very
thin, and the electrodes are kept well apart. The kathode
is best made very nearly plane—if concave it will easily fuse
the thin glass against which its rays are projected ; we have
lost many tubes from this cause. We have found that the
bulb may be conveniently about three or four centimetres in
diameter and the main tube as little as 1'5 to 2 cm. in diameter.
The expansions round the electrodes are intended to obviate
local heating, for it is not always easy to prevent oscillatory
 discharges and consequent “ kathoding ” from the “anode.”
 The chief merits from our point of view, however, were that
 the tubes were very easy to make out of comparatively small
glass tubing. Their volume is small, so that they can be
 exhausted quickly, and they give very intense action. In
 fact one tube—the bulb of which ultimately fused under the

               Eaperiments with Ro'ntgen’s Rays.              455
influence of the kathode-discharge—gave quite as intense if
not more intense radiation than a “ focus ”-tube made in our
laboratory, which appeared to act perfectly, so far as we
could judge.
                Ewperz'ment to test Hypothesis 1.
   When a vacuum-tube is prepared with electrodes of alu
minium-wire whose ends are about 1 centimetre apart, and
exhausted until the discharge will rather jump across three or
four centimetres of air between balls of 1'5 cm. diameter
than pass in the tube, it is generally noticed that the dis
charge, when forced to pass by the tube, goes rather more easily
in one direction than the other. By placing a spark-gap
with spherical electrodes in parallel with the exhausted tube
and properly adjusting the distance of the balls from one
another, it is easy to so arrange matters that the sparks pass
mostly by the spark-gap when the current is in one direction
and by the tube when it is reversed. An arrangement of
this kind is exceedingly sensitive to small changes of pressure
in the exhausted tube. In the experiment to be described, the
 spark-gap was generally so adjusted that when the coil-com
mutator was in one position the whole of the discharge
passed over the gap—only the faintest glow being discernible
 in the tube in a dark room. When the current was reversed,
 however, the discharge was about equally divided between
 the gap and the tube. No very delicate adjustment of the gap
 seems to be necessary, at all events when the discharges follow
each other rapidly.
   Having thus obtained a means of testing the vacuum in a
discharge-tube more rapidly and probably much more deli
cately than by any kind of gauge, we thought it worth
while to try whether Bontgen’s rays would project particles
into the. exhausted tube. 1f hypothesis (1) be correct,
then particles must be carried into the exhausted tube if
it is thin enough to be transparent; and if in addition it
contains a piece of platinum-foil which stops the radiation,
the particles would also be stopped; also if the particles are
not wholly entangled in the platinum, some change in the
vacuous state of the tube is to be expected.
   A tube about 12 cm. long and 1'5 cm. in diameter, and
having a bulb about 4 cm. in diameter in the middle of its
length, was prepared of German glass. It was provided with
electrodes fused in from either end, and extending to within
1 cm. of each other in the centre of the bulb. A bit of platinum
foil lay in the bulb, and the tube was fused on to a Sprengel
pump through about a met2reKot:2 tubing some millimetres in

pentoxide tube, “as repeatedly heated by a Bunsen burner
'mid exhausted until the discharge preferred to pass through
 3 cm. of air-gap rather than through the tube. So sensitive,
 however, was this means of testing the vacuum that for the
[<U+FB01>rst few days, despite frequent heatings and pumpings, the
 vacuum would not remain constant for more than some
 minutes. After about a fortnight of heating and pumping,
 however, the vacuum became so steady that the change in
 twelve hours, which was suf<U+FB01>cient to entirely stop the discharge
 in the spark-gap, could be recti<U+FB01>ed by the fall of at most
 50 drops of mercury in the fall-tube—i.' e. by about 30 seconds’
 pumping.      The change of vacuum occuring during an hour
 could still be easily detected by testing with a current in
 alternate directions.                                               .
   , Under these circumstances, experiments were made by
 urging Bontgen tubes to their utmost, almost in contact with
 the bulb of the exhausted tube, and directing their radiation
 on to theplatinum-foil. Though many very active tubes were
 fused or otherwise destroyed, yet during an hour’s action on
 seve"al occasions no change of vacuum in theexhausted tube
 could be detected when due allowance for the slight progressive
 deterioration wasmade.                '                 '         .
     This experiment was repeated several times, and a tube
 which'had successfully exhibited the <U+FB02>uorescence of a screen
 of tungstate of calcium through an aluminium plate '7 mm.
 thick to an entire audience, was melted down in the operation ;
 but no effect whatever was observed.
 _‘ Professor Wright, of Yale, has given some reasons for
 thinking that Rontgen rays when passing through gold-leaf
 carry articles (of gold?) off with them ; so that if a positive
 e<U+FB01>'ect ad been obtained in the experiment described it'wovld
 not have been quite conclusive ; neither is the negative effect
 observed conclusive against any particles being carried for.
 ward ; it only shows that the particles so carried (if any)
 either re fuse to behave as gaseous particles, or are exceedingly
 few in number.                                                        1'
     The experiments of Professor Minchin which are now
 available have, however, rendered the solid particle theoryrso
 unlikely that it is hardly worth while pushing the investiga-j
 tion further—at all events until much more powerful appli
 ances are to hand. In case the experiment appears worthy
 of repetition, we would eall attention to the fact that it appears
 desirable to use specially puri<U+FB01>ed phosphorus pentoxide in
 the drying-tube ; for the presence ofthe vapour of phosphorus

associated with aether movements.                t
     In this arrangement the light from L is' divided into two
 beams at A which travel round from mirror to mirror in
opposite directions, eventually reaching the telescope T.
When the adjustment is correct, interference-bands are seen
on looking into the telescope.
 _ In this experiment it was estimated that a shift of the
bands‘equalto one tenth of the width of a single band, or a
widening of the hands by one'<U+FB01>fth of the same amount,

458          Messrs. Threlt'all and Pollock on some
could not have escaped our notice. In some experiments the
Rontgen tube was placed so that the line of kathode discharge
made an angle of about 30° with the path BC, and in others
made an angle of 90° with the same line. No disturbance of
the bands could be detected when the coil was started or.
while it was working, which shows at once that within the
limits of accuracy imposed by the experimental conditions,
the R<U+FB01>ntgen radiation is unaccompanied by aether streams.
This conclusion refers, of course, only to air, and it therefore
appeared desirable to make an additional experiment, replacing
the air by a substance of greater density. Pure benzene
was selected as a suitable liquid, and a glass tank 164 cm.
 long, and several centimetres wide and deep, was placed in
 the path BC. The radiating tube, which was placed above
the free surface of the benzene, was arranged to radiate on to
the path in all directions, and in some cases was actually
immersed in the benzene so that its active surface was in the
 <U+FB01>eld of view of the telescope.
    No disturbance of the bands commencing when the coil
started, and stopping when it stopped, was ever detected,
though a great many excellent observations were made. Of
 course, effects due to the heating and electri<U+FB01>cation of the
 glass can be easily distinguished from those we are in search
of in view of their persistence after the coil is put out of
action. The tube employed gave quite visible <U+FB02>uorescence by
barium platinocyanide at a metre’s distance and through
aluminium '7 mm. thick.        We can get an idea of the order
of the minimum aether velocity which could be detected
 by this means. The path BC being some 25 cm. long,
 we will suppose that only 10 cm. of it are in<U+FB02>uenced by
 the tube and that the radiation is along the path. The sen
 sitiveness of the method was the same whether we employed
 air or benzene.
    A shift of the bands amounting to a fifth of the distance
 from band to band would be produced by an zether velocity
 suf<U+FB01>cient to change the time of passage of light over the path
 by one tenth of a period. As sodium light was employed,
 we may call this
                     5'9/3 X 10‘m seconds.
 But the time required for light to travel over ten centimetres
in air is about                                '
                       1/3 x 10_9 seconds ;

with aether velocities greater than, say, one <U+FB01>fth of a kilo

of kathode rays as measured in a vacuous tube by Prof. J. J.

               In this case the sodium light from L is divided
 at the partially silvered mirror A, one beam travelling to C
 and thence to T, the other travelling to B and thence back to
T. The path AC is operated upon by the tube, and the path
AB is screened by a heavy cast-iron 'screen.            The active

JGQ I          Messrs: Threlfall und' Pollock'on some
surface of the tube is brought up to the path CA, and the
Bentgen radiation allowed to traverse it in a variety of direc
tions fro .n parallelism to normality, and is even thrown on to
the mirror at C. For experiments on benzene, troughs of
that liquid as similar as possible are inserted in both paths,
the one in the path AB acting merely as a compensator.
This experiment is much more dif<U+FB01>cult than the one previously
described, and the benzene requires to be well stirred if good
de<U+FB01>nition is required. In the experiments in air a shift of
the hands by 516 of the width of a band could be observed,
while in benzene a change of about half the distance from
band to band only could be seen.         A widening of the bands
to about half the above amounts could have been detected in
each case. When the benzene was used the fringes were
unsteady, and opportunities for observation had to be waited
for.     Of course, when the active surface of the Rontgen tube
dipped into the benzene so as to appear in‘ the <U+FB01>eld of view
of the telescope great disturbances due to thermal and electric
changes became visible. These, however, did not appear
instantaneously on starting the coil, nor did they disappear on
stopping it. In no case was any real e<U+FB02>'ect observed.
     The chief interest of this experiment lies in the fact that if
the Rontgen radiation consisted of longitudinal aether waves,
2'. e., waves of longitudinal aether displace'nert, some effect was
to be expected. If the waves are long corroared with the path
AC (the path AB being screened) a widening of the fringes,
or in the extreme case a total disappearance of the fringes, is
to be anticipated. This can easily be realized by blowing an
organ-pipe in the neighbourhood. If the waves are short
compared with the dimensions AG then all will depend on
the azimuth of the tube, or rather on the inclination of the
Rtintgen-ray path to the path of the light rays. This appears
from the fact that whole waves would produce no effect in
the case contemplated—everything would depend on the
fractional parts of the waves included in orv projected on AC.
    The conclusion to be drawn from the experiment is that
neither in air nor benzene are the light-transmitting properties
of the act-her interfered with. The limits of observational
accuracy are of the same order as in the case of Experiment II.

aluminium. The cells were made according to the directions
given by Mr. Shelford Bidwell" in his paper read before the
Society last year—the only difference being that puri<U+FB01>ed
selenium was employed.           ,                        Y
   The result of a good many observations was to show that
a certain selenium cell with platinum electrodes was acted on.
to about the same extent and in the same direction whether it
was exposed to the radiation of a “ standar ” candle at a
distance of three metres, or to the Rontgen radiation at
a distance of ten centimetres and passing through '7 mm. of
aluminium and about 3 mm. of wood. The tube was
working so as to cause visible fluorescence in a barium platino
 cyanide screen—not of quite the best quality—at a distance
 of rather over a metre in a room nearly but not absolutely
 dark.   This is of course a very rough way of stating the
 degree of activity of the tube, but when the experiments were
 made Professor Minchin’s work had not reached us, and
 consequently the simple scale of tube intensities which it
 implies was not available.
    In order to test whether the action of the light differed in
 kind from that of the Riintgen radiation two experiments
were made—in one the rate of. resistance-recovery of the
 selenium cell was carefully studied and compared with the
 rate of recovery of the cell after exposure to candle-light;
in the other tests were made in the hope of discovering that a
permanent electromotive force was established by the radia
tion, and that it persisted after the radiation was cut off.
 Neither of these experiments led to positive results. ' The rate
 of change of resistance during the twenty seconds of exposure
 to Rontgen’s radiation was,so far as could be seen, exactly the
 same as when the candle-flame was substituted at the proper
 distance. The recovery curves, extending over about half an'
 hour, were also very similar on the whole (several tests were
 made), though both curves themselves exhibited great
 irregularities.                           ’
    In order to obtain effects as little complicated as possible
 by previous history the sensitive cell was kept in circuit on
 the bridge, and was traversed by the testing current for two
 or three days before the observations.
    It was for the same reason that exposures were limited to/v
 20 seconds, for the rate of recovery of resistance with the
 cell employed was very slow. On one occasion when an
accidental exposure for several minutes to Rontgen’s radiation
                     * Phil Mag. vol.

 462        On some EzPerime'nts vwith Riintiyen’s Rays.
 was made the cell had by no means recovered four hours
 afterwards.
     The resistance of the sensitive cell employed was reduced
 from 1209 ohms to 1185 ohms in 20 seconds by the radiation
 under the conditions mentioned. The testing battery consisted
  of two “Obach” cells, and the bridge was made up of two equal
 arms of 1000 ohms each—the selenium and the variable arm.
 We mention this in case it may ever turn out that the effect
 depends on the testing current.
    With regard to the electromotive force which it was supposed
 might be set up. The cell was kept at rest and undisturbed
 for three days before the <U+FB01>nal trial; it was placed three
 centimetres from the active tube, which was, as before, in a
 metallic box, together with the coil. The tube was shut off
 from the cell by an aluminium plate '7 mm. thick.
    A very sensitive high resistance galvanometer in our
 possession, which has been described in a paper read before
 the Royal Society but as yet unpublished, was employed to
 test for any electromotive force which might be set up. An
 exposure to the radiation was made while the cell was in
 series with the galvanometer, and it was found that the cell
 always exhibited a small electromotive force whether it was
 exposed to the rays or not. This prevented the test from
 being very sensitive, but in no case was any electromotive
 force attributable to the radiation discovered, though it' a
 avoltage of 10’7 volts had come into operation its effect could
 probably not have escaped observation.
 ». At the time these experiments were made we were unin
formed as to the discharging action of the rays, which has
since been so copiously studied. As soon as we saw an
account of some of this work we felt that the change of
resistance of the selenium cell was no longer an isolated
phenomenon to be worked out by itself, but must be .studied
in conjunction with the similar phenomena observable in other
 substances, and it is for this reason that the experimental
work was not extended so as to include other cells.
    These notes may, perhaps, be summed up as follows :—
    (1) it is easy to make a Bontgen tube of great activity by
the most elementary glass-blowing.
    (2) The Rontgen radiation does not consist in the pro
jection of gaseous matter, or if it does the amount of such
matter involved is extraordinarily small.
    (3) The Rontgen radiation does not consist in the projec
tion of aether streams having a velocity above a couple of
hundred metres per second: this is true whether the radiation
takes place in air or-in benzene.

     CHARLES DAVISON, 801)., F.G.S., .Mathematical Master at
     Ifing Edward's High School, Birmingham*.
 1.         [THIN the last seven years, two important memoirs
               have appeared dealing in part with the diurnal
 periodicity of earthquakes. In a paper published in 1889,
 M. de Montessus de Ballore 1‘ considers the question from a
 negative point of view, his object being to show that the
 diurnal period is apparent rather than real. More recently,
 in 1894, Prof. F. Omori i, in a valuable investigation on the
 after-shocks of earthquakes, points out that there are various
 periodic <U+FB02>uctuations in their decline of frequency, three of the
 periods being a day or less in length. I will <U+FB01>rst give a brief
 summary of the methods and conclusions of these two writers
 before proceeding with the immediate object of this paper,
 which is to subject the records used by them, or similar
 records, to the more rigid process of harmonic analysis.
      2. M. de Montessus’s statistical inquiries are based on a
 great catalogue of more than 45,000 earthquakes. The
 separate entries being of unequal value, he divides them into
 seven classes, according to the nature of the district and the
 mode of record. The <U+FB01>rst six classes include all registers
 obtained without instrumental aid, the seventh those of the
 Italian geodynamic observatories. For every region of each
 class he gives the total number of shocks during each hour of
 the day. Representing by d the number of shocks occurring
 in the twelve day-hours (6 A.M. to 6 P.M.), and by n the
 number in the twelve night—hours (6 PM. to 6 A.M.), he then
  evaluates the ratio d/n for each region. For the <U+FB01>rst group,
  excluding the <U+FB01>fth or volcanic series, the mean value of d/n

varies from 0'75 to 0'82, and increases Hwith the scientific:
character of the record. Also, the value of d/n being small*_
for moderate shocks and approaching unity for severe ones;
M. de Montessus infers that earthquakes in reality occur just.
as frequently by day as by night.
 ' . The seventh class comprises the records from thirteen geo
dynami'c observatories in Italy, all obtained by means of con
tinuously reCording instruments. The value of d/n varies
from 0'50 for- Corleone t0 2'06 for Bologna and S. Luca,
being on an average 1'49. If all shocks are exeluded but'
those of intensity I. of the Rossi-Forel scale, the mean value
rises to 1'80.        This seems to imply the existence of a true
diurnal period, but M. de Montessus interprets the inequality
otherwise, referring the more numerous slight shocks of they
day-time to “ mouvements dus a l’homme, roulements dé
v'oitures et de trains de chemins de fer, explosions de mines,
&c.”       The suggestion is a useful one and deserves careful
consideration. At the same time, it should be remarked that
the phenomena admit of another explanation, for we might
eXpect that slight earthquakes would be subject to periods of
greater amplitude than violent shocks *.            With regard to the
non-instrumental records, however, M. de Montessus’s analysis
leaves little doubt that the more frequent observation of earth
quakes at night is due to the conditions being then more
favourable for the detection of weak tremors.
  f 3. Prof. Omori’s investigation is based for the most part on .
seismometric records.          He makes use of the valuable Tokio
register from 1876 to 1893, that for all Japan from 1885 to
1890 (which is only in Part a seismometric record), and,
especially the lists of after-shocks at Kumamoto, .Git'u and
Nagoya, and Chiran, during the thirteen or fourteen days
following the Kumamoto earthquake of 1889, the Mino-Owari
earthquake of 1891, and the Kagoshima earthquake of 1893.
The shocks are grouped in hourly, two-hourly, and six-hourly
intervals, and curves are drawn, not through the points
cerresponding to the numbers so obtained, but, by some
process of smoothing which is not explained. The Periods
which are brought into prominence by this method are 24
heurs, about 8 0r 9 hours, and about 4 hours, in length. In
the case of the Mino-Ov'vari earthquakes, while both the eight:
Nagbyaand

different districts is extremely variable, the average number
of'shocks per hour in each case is represented by unity, so
that the results may'be directlycomparable. The epochs are
given in the mean local time of the place ofobservation, with
two exceptions, namely, Japan and Italy, in which the standard
times are those of 135° E. and 15° E. respectively. In the
Table, however, the <U+FB01>gures for Japan refer to mean Tokio
time, for Japanese after-shocks to mean time of 135‘,3 E,” and
for the Italian stations to mean Rome time.                                .

    Prof. Milne’s great catalogue includes all the earthquake

Tokio. A large number of these were obtained by means of
seismographs, but unfortunately the particular shocks so
 recorded are not indicated.           For my present purpose, I have
 made use only of those in which the time of occurrence is
 given in hours, minutes, and seconds: for these, Prof. Milne
informs me, were certainly registered by seismographs. As
many others may, however, be omitted by this mode of
 selection, it is obvious that the results will not compare in
value with those obtained from the Tokio record. I have
excluded the shocks occurring during the last two years em
braced by the catalogue on account of the great number that
followed the Mino-Owari earthquake of 1891 (see                      7, 8) :—

           The numerous slight shocks which follow a severe earth
       quake are subject at <U+FB01>rst to a rapid decline in frequelicy*.
       Now, if a simple harmonic series he superposed on a declining
       linear series, the harmonic analysis of the compound series
        shows that not only are the amplitude and epoch of the
       function of the same period changed, but minor harmonic
       components are also introduced. It is clear therefore that the
        epochs given above cannot be supposed to agree exactly with
        those of their physical equivalents. At the same time, the
        omission of the <U+FB01>rst one, two, three, and four days in succes—
        sion from the Git'u and Nagoya records produces no important
        change in most of the components. Moreover, as will be seen
        in the next section, the different conditions introduced by the
        occurrence of a great earthquake endure even when the decline
        in average frequency of the after- shocks ceases to be sensible.
           The results for Gifu and Nagoya con<U+FB01>rm those obtained
       by Prof. Omori by a different method of analysis, the 8-hour
       component being more marked at Gifu, and the 4-hour com
       ponent at Nagoya. Prof. Omori gives the time of each shock
        recorded at both places until the end of Nov. 10, those at
        Nagoya to the nearest second, and those at Gifu generally to
       the nearest minute. Out of 1257 shocks recorded at Gifu

       that even all- these are identical, for, during the <U+FB01>rst day or
       two, shocks were frequently felt at Gifu for several minutes
       in succession.          Though the two stations are less than 14
        miles apart, and both are close to the great fault-scarp, it
        would seem, from the above analysis, that their after-shocks

    The nine Italian records thus agree in exhibiting a marked
 diurnal period, the epoch in seven cases being about noon,
 and in the other two cases not far from midnight. Reference
 has already been made to M. de Montessus’s explanation of
 the preponderance of slight tremors during the day.                            There
 is much to be said in favour of this explanation. The obser
 vatory on Vesuvius is only a few yards from the main road,
 along which there is a great deal of heavy traf<U+FB01>c about mid
 day. During the interval embraced by M. de Montessus’s
     Phil. May. S. 5. Vol. 42. No. 259. Dec. 1896.                           2 L

470              Dr. G. Davison on the Diurnal
catalogue the observatory at Rome was situated close to a
much-frequented street. At the various observatories of the
second order the arrangement of the recording instrument,
I am informed, was not then irreproachable. ()n the other
hand, at Rocca di Papa, Dr. Cancani tells me that the appa
ratus could not be in any way in<U+FB02>uenced by accidental or
arti<U+FB01>cial movements on the ground outside. He does not,
however, attribute the movements of the tromometers to
seismic causes so much as to the action of the wind either
near to, or at a distance from, the observatory.
   This one case, therefore, being free from doubt so far
as arti<U+FB01>cial disturbances are concerned, it becomes un
necessary to reject entirely the results obtained from the
other records, especially when the epochs of the principal
harmonic components agree so closely, as some of them do,
with those derived from the Rocca di Papa register. More
over, while some variability might be expected in the epoch
of the diurnal period if it were due to natural causes, it is
dif<U+FB01>cult to understand how, according to M. de Montessus’s
explanation, the epoch could ever occur near midnight.
                       Summary of Results.
    11. The following conclusions may, I think, be drawn
from the results of the above analysis :—
    (l) The reality of the diurnal variation of earthquake
frequency seems to be proved by the approximate agreement
in epoch (mean local time) of the <U+FB01>rst four components for
the whole year at Tokio and Manila, and for the winter and
summer halves of the year at Tokio.
    (2) In ordinary earthquakes there is in nearly every case
a marked diurnal period, the maximum generally occurring
between 10 11.151. and noon. The semi-diurnal period, though
less prominent, is also clearly marked, the maximum
occurring, as a rule, between 9A.M. and noon and between
9P.M. and midnight.         Other minor harmonic components
are also occasionally important—the <U+FB01>rst maximum of the
eight-hour component probably occurring about 6.30 A.M.
and that of the six-hour component about 3 or 4 A.M.; but in
these two epochs the results are not always concordant.
    (3) Though the materials are insuii-icient for any general
conclusion, a comparison of the results for Tokio and Rocca
di Papa seems to show that the slighter disturbances at the
latter place are subject to a more marked diurnal periodicity.
    (4) In the after-shocks of great earthquakes the diurnal
periodicity, as a rule, is strongly pronounced. The maximum
 of the diurnal period occurs within a few hours after mid
night, but the epochs of the other components are subject to

                     Periodicity of Earthquakes.                    471
wide variation. A special feature of after-shocks is the
prominence of the eight-hour and four-hour components.
After a year or two there is some return to ordinary con
ditions; but even when the average hourly number of
shocks is reduced to one-hundredth of that during the <U+FB01>rst
few days, the characteristics of after-shocks are still per
ceptible.
         Origin of the Diurnal Periodicity of Earthquakes.
    12. The pressure of the atmosphere, either at rest or in
motion, has for some time been regarded by seismologists as
a cause of earth-tremors. Prof. Milne, who has made a
detailed analysis of tremors recorded at Tokio, concludes that
they are more frequent with a low than with a high baro
meter, and with a high than with a low barometric gradient;
also, that a majority of the tremors Were produced by the
action of either local or distant winds upon the surface of the
earth, and possibly by their pressure against a neighbouring
mountain-range *.                                   _
    My object is now to inquire how far the larger disturbances
considered in this paper are subject to similar laws. If there
is any intimate relation between the diurnal Variation of
earthquake-frequency on the one hand and that of barometric
pressure or wind-velocity on the other, it is evident that the
epochs of their respective harmonic components should not
differ widely; since any distortion of the earth’s surface
 by changes in the distribution of atmospheric pressure must
 be propagated, both along the surface and downwards, with
great velocity.
     The records of most value for the purposes of this com-'
parison are: (1) those of ordinary earthquakes at Tokio,
Manila, and Rocca di Papa; and (2) those of after-shocks at
Kumamoto, Gifu, Nagoya, Chiran, and Nemuro.
     13. Taking, <U+FB01>rst, the diurnal variation of barometric
 pressure and seismic frequency, it will be seen that the only
 approximate agreement in epoch is in the second and fourth
 components at Tokio and the second at Rocca di Papa. The
 epochs of the <U+FB01>rst component differ by as much as eight or
 nine hours at both places.

          In the case of wind-velocity the agreement in epoch is
     much closer, especially for the third and fourth components
     at Tokio. The epochs of the <U+FB01>rst and second seismic com
      onents at the same 1place, however, precede those of wind
    velocit by as muc as two or three hours. At Manila
    the epoch of the <U+FB01>rst component of seismic frequency precedes
    that of wind-velocity by about two hours, and the epoch of the
    second component of the former follows that of the latter by
      alf-an-hour.
         The diurnal variation of barometric radient between Tokio
    and Nagano (112 miles W. 30° N. of okio) seems too slight
    to produce such important effects, though the epochs of its
    harmonic components do not differ widely from those of wind
    velocity *.

     With regard to the after-shocks of Japanese earthquakes,
  the records are of such short duration that satisfactory results
  can only be obtained by a detailed comparison during the
  intervals over which they extend.              It is worthy of notice,
  however, that the epoch of the <U+FB01>rst seismic component occurs
  with some persistence early in the day, and does not differ very
  greatly from that of the <U+FB01>rst component for barometric pressure.
     It seems evident, therefore, that we cannot attribute the
  diurnal variation of seismic frequency exclusively to that of
  barometric pressure or of wind-velocity. But it is not im
  probable that it may result from a combination of both
  phenomena; that the diurnal periodicity of ordinary earth
' quakes may be due chie<U+FB02>y to that of wind-velocity, and the
  diurnal periodicity of after-shocks chie<U+FB02>y to that of baro
  metric pressure. In support of this suggestion, it may be
  mentioned that the amplitudes of the <U+FB01>rst component of wind
  velocity and earthquake-frequency at Tokio are both greater
  in summer than in winter, and that the same amplitudes for
  the whole year are both greater at Manila than at 'l‘okio.
      In the case of after-shocks, a reason may be given for the
  ef<U+FB01>cacy of barometric pressure if, as seems not improbable,
  the principal earthquakes were due to the sudden elevation of
   one rock-mass adjoining a fault. In a movement so abrupt
   as this must be, the disturbed mass would almost certainly
   overshoot its position of equilibrium, and immediately after
   wards would begin to settle back to it by a succession of
   minor slips, at <U+FB01>rst numerous but gradually becoming less
   frequent along the whole line of displacement. In such a
   condition the elevated rock-mass would, in some part or other,
   he constantly on the point of giving way, and a slight increase
   of barometric pressure would probably be suf<U+FB01>cient to pre
   cipitate a slip resulting in an after-shock.

v I EYNOLDS, in treating of radiometer motion in con
            nexion with his discovery of thermal transpiration,
‘    showed that fundamentally both phenomenakare' traceable to
i    the same general cause: the object of the rest of this paper is
1    to bring out this fact mm c clearly, and to establish theoretically
  ‘  the general laws of radiometer motion for comparison with
     the experimental results of Urookes‘and Pringsheim.
        In the theory of thermal transpiration, we have seen that
     under suitable conditions the variation of temperature along
     a passage through a porous plate (an produce a certain
     di<U+FB01>erence between the pressures at its hot and cold ends,yand
     therefore the solid wall of the passage must be exerting a
     tangential force. F from cold to hot, such that, B being the
     mean radius of the passage,                  > r       -          =
                                  F="R’(Pz 1m),
     and, accordingly, the gas in the passage exerts a tangential

             Transpiratz'on and Radiometer Motion.            477
force F on the solid from hot to cold.      If then a porous plate
had one face heated and was hung on to a string with this
face and the opposite cool one vertical, the tangential force
F acting along all the passages would de<U+FB02>ect the string from
the vertical, a “case of radiometer motion ; if two such plates
were mounted in a vertical plane and free to revolve round a.
vertical axis lying between them, and one face of one was
warmed by irradiation, it would move away from the source,
and thus a continuous rotation could he kept up as in an
ordinary radiometer.
   In discussing thermal transpiration we con<U+FB01>ned our atten
tion to <U+FB01>ne tubes, such as mi ht represent the passages in
porous plates; but as we saw t at the phenomena depended
for the most part on the ratio of the radius of a passage to the
mean free path of the gas, it follows that our deductions for
<U+FB01>ne tubes will hold for tubes of any size with rare enough
gas to give a free path as large as may be necessary; thus
with the means of getting high enough vacua and with
delicate manometers it should be possible to demonstrate
thermal transpiration along an ordinary gas-pipe or the
largest gas main ; in the radiometer we have generally to-do
with thermal transpiration going on in spaces of ordinary
size.
   We have already obtained in (5) an expression for the
traction exercised on the gas in the tube by the whole surface
of a- tube along which the temperature varies ; thus
                          F. -= nmuz'n'R2 ;
a curious result that the traction on the surface should be
proportional to the square of the radius, but it is to be
remembered that the tube is supposed to be long enough in
comparison with its diameter, and of suf<U+FB01>cient thermal
capacity, to dominate the temperature of the gas so thoroughly
that the temperature throughout any section of the tube is the
same as that of the wall. This traction has been found for
the case when the motion due to thermal transpiration along
the tube has become steady ; but in connexion with radiometer
motion it is necessary to consider the traction before the
steady state is established.      Imagine a solid surface over
which the temperature varies to he suddenly introduced into
a mass of gas at rest and uniform in temperature, and let us
determine the traction which the solid immediately exerts on
the gas. The <U+FB01>rst effect is to make the layer of gas in contact
with the solid take the temperature of the solid at every point
of the surface, and therefore each molecule that encounters
the surface acquires on the average the velocity u given by

478              Mr. W. Sutherland on Thermal
(4), and the number that encounter unit surface in unit time
being nv/4, the total momentum imparted to the gas in unit
time by a surface S is given by
                         F=Snmvu/4. . . . . . . (20a)
This is the initial value of the traction ; but as the velocity u
is carried out to the remoter          arts of the gas, a molecule
which encounters the surface iiaving come from a region
where it had already acquired a fraction of u does not receive
the whole of u from the solid, and therefore the traction
diminishes with time. To determine the <U+FB01>nal value when the
motion of the whole gas is steady we may consider the simple
case of two parallel planes the variations of temperature over
which are such as to produce velocities ul and u, in a <U+FB01>xed
direction in the gas in contact with the two surfaces; then
in the steady state we may suppose the transition from ul to
u, to occur linearly, so that the velocity u at distance .1: from
one of the planes is ul—(ul—uz)x/D, where D is the distance
between the planes ; then the mass of gas that <U+FB02>ows in unit
time along any layer of width b and thickness da: is mnbu dw,
and the momentum imparted in unit time to the layer is
nmbu’dm, and therefore the total momentum acquired by the
gas between the planes is
               D
            I nmbua dz = nmbD(u1’ + M1112 + “26/3
             0
Obviously the planes impart the respective fractions
u12/(u19+1122) and uf/(ulgi-uf) of this, so that the traction
per unit area of the <U+FB01>rst plane, if its length in the direction
of motion is l, is
                     nmDul’Qll" +111u2 + 1122) _
                            31(u12 + 11,2)           ’
but it is really a useless arti<U+FB01>ciality to consider the traction
per unit surface, as most of the traction is really exerted on
the gas near its entrance to the space between the lanes, and
we will therefore con<U+FB01>ne our attention to the tota tractions.
As before in the case of the tube, the result that the traction
should be proportional to the sectional area between the plane
is peculiar, but it is true only when the planes dominate the
temperature of the gas in such a manner that u is a linear
function of the distance from either. Thus the initial total
traction on the <U+FB01>rst plane is Smnvu/4, which is roportional
to the surface S, that is to both width and lengt , but inde
pendent of distance from neighbouring surfaces ; and the
<U+FB01>nal traction in the steady state is
      '        mnbD (1112 + ul'u2 + 1122) u12/3 (1112 + 1122) ,

               Tran-spiration and Radiometer Molion.            479
which is independent of the length but proportional to width
and distance from neighbouring surface. To bring out the
full signification of these we had better introduce the value
 of u, and let us suppose it.) to be 0 ; then the initial and <U+FB01>nal
 total tractions exerted by a plane of varying temperature at
 distance D from a plane of constant temperature are
                —Snmvgh(n’/n+v’/v)/24,                          (21)
                   bnmDvghg(n’/n+o’/v)2/108. “ l i            .
When the conditions are such that the pressure can remain
 constant between the surfaces, n’/n+ 2v’/v=0, and then these
become Snmv)w’/24 and bnmDX'lv’Q/108, both acting from cold
to hot, and therefore the equal and opposite reaction of gas
 on the surface is from hot to cold.
    But when the conditions are not such that the pressure is
kept constant, but that a difference of pressure is established
by thermal transpiration which goes on till a steady state is
 established, the effect of the difference of pressure may be
much greater than that of the traction, as the following
 example will show :-—A piston is inserted into a cylinder which
it does not quite <U+FB01>t, and is <U+FB01>xed immovable so as to leave a
clear space of sectional area a between itself and the cylinder,
and the cylinder is closed ; when one end is heated a fall of
temperature gets established along the cylinder, and the gas
at the cold end begins to transpire through the narrow space
into the hot end until the difference of pressure 122—101
sufficient to stop the <U+FB02>ow is established; then the total traction
of gas on the side of the piston is a(p2—p,), while on the area
A of the hot end of the piston there is a total pressure
A(p,—p1) in excess of that acting on the cold end, so that the
total force urging the piston from hot to cold is (A + a) (102—101) ,
which may be made as much more important than the total
traction as we please by diminishing a. If the piston is freed
it will begin to move under the force (A+a)(p,—p1), and
become an exaggerated instance of radiometer motion.
   This example makes clear the lines on which to formulate
a general theory of radiometer motion ; we have only to
adapt our transpiration formulae established for circular tubes
to the case of any space bounded by solid walls over which the
temperature varies. In the general problem of radiometer
motion we have to do with a solid surface over which the
temperature varies and which therefore is subject to a traction
from hot to cold, and also establishes a higher pressure in the
gas towards its hot end than at the cool end; the relative
importance of traction and difference of pressure in producing
motion of the body to which the surface belongs depends

480              Mr. W. Sutherland on Thermal
entirely on the relative position of the movable surface and
the <U+FB01>xed surfaces surrounding it. We have seen that for a
tube the total traction is nmue'n'RQ, and for a passage bounded
by two parallel planes of width b and distance D apart with
the same variation of temperature along both, it is mnu’bD/2
along each plane, and as qrR corresponds to b and R to D/2
we see that the traction exerted between the walls of a cylinder
of any sectionand the contained gas may be written in the
form nmuesD/‘Z, where s is the perimeter of a right section of
the cylinder, and D is a mean value of the distance between
opposite parts of the perimeter. For the difference of pressure
established by thermal transpiration along a tube of any
section we may use the equations (14) and (17) if in them we
interpret 2R as a mean value of the distance between opposite
parts of the perimeter ; and in the case where there is a
variation of pressure across only a fraction of the perimeter,
 as for instance in the case where one plane wall has a varying
 temperature and the opposite one a uniform temperature, we
 must multiply by a fraction not greatly different from that
 fraction (1/3 instead of 1/2 in our example). We can there
 fore state the fundamental equations of radiometer motion as
 follows :—If across a length b of the perimeter s of any
 cylinder a variation of temperature is suddenly established
 whose average rate is 12’ over a length I, then the initial total
 traction between solid and gas is approximately
                           bln1n7tvv'/24. . . . . . . (22)
 When the steady state is reached the total traction is
 approximately
 bDn1nVv9(n’/n+v//v)2/108, or bDmnkevQQ/l/p—1//v)‘Z/108,(23)
 and the difference of pressure between the two ends of l is

 where the values of A’ and B' are those given in (19), with
 R2=R1=R. No proof has been furnished here that the
 introduction of the fraction b/s rigorously adapts our expres
 sion (19) to the case where only a fraction b/s of the boundary
 is operative in producing thermal transpiration, but it is a
 reasonable enough approximation for experimental results at
 present available, closer approximation could easily be calcu
 lated it required. If in (23) we write (pg—ply! and (vs—v<U+FB02>/l
 for p’ and v' we can express the total traction in the steady
 state entirely in terms of v, and v1, which completes the
 solution.

' ’With these results we can now state what ought to be the
behaviour of a radiometer, and as Crookes and Pringsheim
found the best form of instrument for investigating the laws
of the radiometer experimentally to be one in which a single
vane of mica blackened on one side was attached with its
planes vertical to a horizontal arm attached to a vertical
torsion <U+FB01>bre, the whole being suspended in a glass bulb
capable Of being <U+FB01>lled with any gas at any pressure, we will
discuss the theoretical laws of such a form. Let D be the
mean distance of the edge of the vane from the glass wall
immediately opposite it, b the perimeter of the vane, s—b the
perimeter of the glass wall opposite, E the area of each face
of the vane, E +S the sectional area of the bulb (S being small
compared to E) in the plane of the vane, and ,8 the thickness
of the vane; when the black face is irradiated let its tempera
ture become 02, that of the clear face being 0,, then there is a
fall of temperature 09-01 through the thickness of the Vane,
and thus the thickness of the vane becomes a surface capable,
along with the surface of the bulb opposite it, of starting
thermal transpiration from the cold edge to the hot, with
elevation of the pressure in front of the hot face to 102, and
depression of that behind the cold face to p, ; when a steady
state is established the total traction on the surface of varying
temperature must be approximately equal to Sub—10,) b/s, and
the excess of total pressure on the black face over that on the
clear face is E(]0,—p1)b/s, so that the total force de<U+FB02>ecting
the vane whose moment is to be balanced by the torsion
couple of the <U+FB01>bre is (E + S)(p2—p1)b/s.          Thus the total
 de<U+FB02>ecting force is

This equation contains all the theoretical laws of radiometer
motion when S is very small compared with E. If everything
is kept constant except the mean pressure (p, +p1)/2 there is
a value of the mean pressure of the gas in a radiometer for
which the de<U+FB02>ecting force is a maximum, a very important
point in radiometer construction. When the pressure is high
enough the last two terms in the denominator may be neglected
and the de<U+FB02>ecting force is inversely proportional to the
pressure, and when the maximum is passed and the pressure
 becomes small enough the <U+FB01>rst two terms may be neglected
 and the de<U+FB02>ecting force becomes proportional to the density

482               Mr. W. Sutherland on Thermal
and dies away inde<U+FB01>nitely with increasing exhaustion of the
bulb.
    It will be seen that the de<U+FB02>ecting force depends on the
dimensions of the apparatus in a somewhat complicated
manner, but that the most important principle is that (as
regards the denominator) it increases with diminishing dis
tance D between vane and glass Wall, except at pressures so
low that the <U+FB01>rst two terms are negligible ; and as diminish
ing D means in general an increasing value of b/a, we see
that in general at all pressures the ef<U+FB01>ciency of the radiometer
is increased by bringing the edge of the vane nearer to the
glass wall. Other things being equal the de<U+FB02>ecting force is
proportional to the total sectional area E + S of the bulb.
    As regards the effect of the nature of the gas on radiometer
motion the equation shows that at pressures low enough for
neglecting the <U+FB01>rst two terms of the denominator all gases
 give the same de<U+FB02>ecting force, a theoretically interesting
 result, but not of much practical importance: the practically
 important matter is to determine how the different gases com
 pare, each at its maximum effectiveness :, now when the
 de<U+FB02>ecting force is a maximum p, + p1: 4110(1); +v')9/3Dro, or
 D=27\. where 7L is the mean path at (p,+p1)/2, and the
 de<U+FB02>ecting force becomes proportional to 4770(U2+v|)2/3DU0, so
that the most effective gas is that for which q0(v,+vl)Q/vo is
 largest, that is to say, for which i70/mi is largest ; compare for
 instance hydrogen and oxygen, 1; for H, is '44 of that for 02,
 while m3 is 1/4, and thus at the pressure of maximum ef<U+FB01>ciency
 H, is 1'76 times as e<U+FB02>icient as 0,, and at higher pressures the
 advantage of H2 increases till its efficiency is 1'76’I that of ()9.
 From Rayleigh’s measurement of the viscosity of helium as
 '96 of that of air (Proc. Roy. Soc. Jan. 1896) while hydrogen’s
 is about '5, and with 4 as the molecular mass of helium as
 against 2 for hydrogen, it would appear that helium ought to
 be nearly 2* or 1'4 times as ef<U+FB01>cient in a radiometer as
 hydrogen.
     The equation (25) contains the laws of the dependence of
  radiometer motion on the temperatures of the faces of the
 vanes, although as these temperatures have never been
 measured experimentally, We cannot verify them as they stand ;
 but to a certain extent we can bring them within the range
 of experimental veri<U+FB01>cation in the following manner.        When
 the black face of a vane is suddenly irradiated the tempera
 ture of the black face suddenly rises, while that of the clear
 face is unaltered, and the fall of temperature is con<U+FB01>ned
 for the <U+FB01>rst moment or two to the thickness of the layer of
 lampblack; the <U+FB01>rst de<U+FB02>exion of the vane takes place in

              T'ranspiration and Radiometer illotion. ‘          483
accordance with these conditions, but if the vane is steadily
irradiated, conductivity soon establishes a steady distribution
of temperature through the vane from front to back with
permanent temperatures 0, and 6‘, so that the <U+FB01>rst de<U+FB02>exion
alters until it attains the <U+FB01>xed value due to these steady con
ditions. Suppose the black face to be irradiated by a candle,
and let Q be the amount of heat it absorbs per unit area per
unit time, and E the corresponding amount emitted by the
clear face ; then if we ignore loss of heat by the edge, and
denote the conductivity of the substance of the vane by k,
                          Q=k(0,—01)//8=E.          . .  .   .  (26)
     Now in (25), (v,—v,)/(v2+v1) may be written

 in which the denominator is nearly 4(02+ 61), since the di<U+FB01>'e
 rence of 02 and (91 is small ; and as in the experiments (02 + 91)/2
 was always an ordinary temperature it may be taken as con
 stant, so that (1),. —o,)/(v,+vl) was always closely proportional
 to 02—91 and therefore to Q<U+FB01>/lc; but Q is inversely as the
 square of the distance of the candle from the vane and directly
 as the number of candles at that distance (the candles being as
 nearly as possible in the normal to the centre of the vane),
 thus the de<U+FB02>ecting force varies as the number of candles and
 inversely as the square of their distance from the vane, which
  is the experimental result (Crookes, ‘ Nature,’ xiii.) ; the
  de<U+FB02>ecting force is proportional to the thickness of the vane
  and inversel proportional to the conductivity of its material,
  hence the a vantage of using a substance such as mica for the
  vane, and the disadvantage of using metal.
     To show that this theory of the radiometer is in harmony
  with the experimental facts, we will brie<U+FB02>y describe the
    eneral results of Crookes’s numerous experiments, and it
  will be seen that they accord with the deductions from our
  formulae.
      Crookes obtained his most valuable quantitative results
  with an apparatus such as the one of which we have just
  considered the theory. The bulb was continued into a
  vertical tube for containing a torsion <U+FB01>bre nearly a metre
  long, and the rectangular plate of roasted mica was attached
  directly to the <U+FB01>bre so that its plane was vertical and its
  centre at the centre of the bulb ; a continuation of the line of
  the <U+FB01>bre divided one face of the plate into two equal halves,

484         ‘     Mr.W. Sutherland on Thermal
one of which was lampblacked.           For all the experimental
niceties reference must be made to the original paper (Phil.
Trans. clxxii.)
    It is obvious from the description of this apparatus that it
does not comply with the conditions under which (25) was
established, as the mica plate is probably only a fraction of a
millimetre in thickness and between 5 and 10 millim. from
the glass bulb where it is nearest, so that the length of the
region in which thermal transpiration occurs is much less
than its width, whereas in           the contrary is supposed to
be the case. The chief effect of the difference in these con
ditions will be that thermal transpiration, instead of going on
over the whole distance between edge of plate and bulb, will
extend to a distance from the edge of the plate which will
depend on the conductivity of the gas; in fact, if we move
along the shortest distance between plate and bulb we shall
<U+FB01>nd the fall of temperature across that line grow less as we
leave the plate and become negligible before we reach the bulb ;_
but the better the conductivity of the gas the farther will the
dominating in<U+FB02>uence of the edge of the plate extend; there
fore in our formulas, when applied to Crookes’s experiments
with the torsion radiometer, D must be interpreted as a
function of conductivity lc’. Then b being the length of the
edge of the black half of the plate, the area S over which
thermal transpiration is effective may be taken to be bD, over
which at the front and the back of the plate there is an
average difference of pressure Pg—Pv which, however, will
not be maintained over the whole front and back of the plate,
because there is so much facility of escape for the gas, but
only near the edge, so that probably E varies as bl); thus
 (E +S)b/s will be replaced by bK, where K is a function of
k’. Another effect of the fact that thermal transpiration
occurs only to a certain distance from the ed e of the plate
 will be to reduce the effect of slipping, seeing t at the velocity
of transpiration dies away to zero in the gas. To indicate
that slipping has not its full theoretical effect we had better
Change B’ to B”, and to remind ourselves that in A' and B'
the symbol l) or 2B now means a function of k’, we will
change A’ to A” and B” to B’” and put
                     bK(’Ug_ (In/(v; + '01) = C],
then (25) becomes
              de<U+FB02>ecting force: c’/(A”p + B’”+ l/p). . . (27)
   There is no need to take account of molecular force in
altering density at edge of plate because so small a fraction
of the free path lies in the condensed gas.

               Transpiration and Radiometer lllotion.           485
     The last point to be attended to in applying our equations
  to the experimental results is that when one side of the mica
  vane is irradiated the glass bulb is also warmed in such a
  manner that it is hottest where nearest the candle, and there
  fore there is thermal transpiration along the inner surface
  of the bulb tending to raise the pressure near the hottest
 'point with diminution towards the coldest point; now we
  can afford to neglect the effect of this near the vane until
  the pressure gets so small that the mean free path of a
  molecule “becomes, say, nearly equal to the radius of the
  bulb, for then the walls of the bulb, on account of their
  much greater area than that of the effective edge of the
 vane, must dominate the distribution of temperature and
  pressure in the gas even quite close to the vane, and there
  fore at the highest exhaustions the relation between pressure
  and de<U+FB02>ecting force must tend to a limit determined rather
  by the bulb than by the vane. \Vith these explanations,(27)
  is now applicable to the experiments of Crookes.
     With his apparatus Crookes was able to study concurrently
  the viscosity of a gas and the forces at play in the radiometer
  at pressures from one atmo down to the lowest measurable
  by the M‘Leod gauge. The form of his vibrating system
  renders the mathematical problem of obtaining an expression
   for the viscosity of the gas from the constants of the apparatus
  and the observed decrement per vibration of the logarithm
  of the amplitude of the vibrations of the mica plate intract
' able ; but it is obvious, from the theory of the vibrating disk
  method of measuring viscosity, that the motion of the mica
  plate when oscillating must be retarded by the viscosity of
  the gas in such a way that the difference of the logarithms of
   successive amplitudes is proportional to the viscosity of the
  gas, so that although absolute values of viscosity are un
  obtainable with the apparatus, approximate relative ones can
   be got with it. At a number of different densities of the gas
  Crookes measured the logarithmic decrement and also the re
  pulsive effect of a candle-<U+FB02>ame radiating towards the blackened
  half of the mica plate from a horizontal distance of half a metre,
  the latter being measured by a reading of the permanent
  de<U+FB02>exion of the plate from its position of rest in darkness.
      Now from Maxwell’s well known discovery that the
   viscosity of a gas is independent of its pressure it follows that
  the logarithmic decrement is independent of the pressure so
   long as slipping of the gas on the solid surfaces is negligible;
  but, as already indicated, Kundt and VVarburg showed
  experimentally, with some support from theoretical reasoning,
  that slipping ceases to be negligible when the mean free path

  of the gas becomes comparable with the linear dimensions of
  the containing vessels; they did this by pushing the rare
  faction of the gas so high in a vibrating-disk apparatus for
  measuring viscosity that the logarithmic decrement diminished
  measurably—for example, with air and a distance of '11 cm.
  between the <U+FB01>xed and moving plates the log. dec. at 1 atmo
  was '132, at '01 atmo it was '129, and at '0008 atmo it was
  '111 ; now at 20° (1. and at these pressures the mean free
 path in air is about '00001 cm., '001 cm., and “012 cm.
 respectively, this last value is nearly 1/10 of the distance
 between the plates, so that when the distance between the
 plates is only 10 free paths the log. dec. diminishes by 16
 per cent. of its limiting value when the distance is a large
 number of free paths.               Thus we see how the measurements
 made by Crookes of the log. dec. in his apparatus give
 valuable information as to the relation between the free
 path of the gas and the distance from the edge of his mica
 plate to the glass bulb.                In the following table the <U+FB01>rst
 row contains the pressures of dry air at 15° C. in terms
 of the atmo as unit, the second gives 104 times the log. dec.,
 the limiting value of which at higher pressures is 1000, and
 the third contains the de<U+FB02>ecting force of the candle in an
arbitrary unit :—

    Thus at a pressure between 36 and 29 millionths of an
atmo the repulsion rises to a maximum, say at 30 millionths,
at which the mean free path is '00001 X 106/30, that is one
third of a centimetre. The actual distance between the edge
of the mica plate and the bulb is not given by Crookes, but
from the <U+FB01>gure he gives one would imagine that the distance
might be between ‘5 cm. and 1 cm., and thus the cXperi
mental result corresponds to our theoretical one that the
maximum effect is to be expected when D=2>t; before the
maximum is reached the repulsive e<U+FB01>'ect ought, according to
(27), to vary inversely as the pressure, so that the products
of the numbers in the <U+FB01>rst and third rows above ought to be
approximately constant, and the <U+FB01>rst four products are 2600,

             Transpiration and Radiometer Motion.             487
2700, 3000, and 2700, which verify the equation. Beyond
the maximum, according to (27), the repulsion is ultimately
to vary directly as the pressure, so that the numbers in the
third row divided by those in the <U+FB01>rst are to tend towards
constancy : the last three values are 2'0, 2'4, and 2'5, while at
lower pressures the value 3 is reached; but the results at
these lower pressures have not been reproduced in the last
table, because the M‘Leod gauge with air becomes less re
liable towards l/lO6 atmo, and therefore Crookes’s results at
the lowest pressures will be discussed in a separate paper on
the measurement of pressures in the highest attainable vacua.
   From Crookes’s experiments we can calculate c’, A”, B’”
in (27), for with 1/106 atmo as unit of pressure and Crookes’s
arbitrary unit as the unit of repulsion, we have just seen that
c’/A” is about 3000 and 0' about 3'0, so that A”='001 ; now
the de<U+FB02>ecting force is a maximum when p9=l/A”, so that
the maximum value of the de<U+FB02>ecting force, namely,
                        ave + B”// VF),
gives a convenient method of <U+FB01>nding B’” when/A” and c’ are
known ; thus for air, B"'='01 and we have all the data for
calculating the de<U+FB02>ecting force at any pressure by (27) for
 comparison with experiment : the calculated values are given
in the fourth row of the last table, and show that we have
the correct form of equation to represent the experimental
 facts. But according to the meanings of A” and B’, B’2/16
 should be nearly equal to A”, whereas B’W/lti is only the
 1/160 part of it.
    Now the term in B’” expresses the eli'ect of slipping, and
 our results for air show that in Crookes’s apparatus the effect
 of slipping is only 1/160t or 1/13 of what it would be under
 the ideal conditions for (25), indeed (25) with the given
 values of A' and B' stands for one limiting case, and with
 B' =0 it stands for the other where slipping is of no account,
 and the conditions of Crookes’s experiments are nearer to
 those of the latter limit than of the former; indeed, with
 slightly different values of c’ and A” we could put 8’” =0
 and get nearly as good a representation of the experimental
 results for air as that just obtained. For nitrogen the values
 of the repulsive force are about two-thirds of those for air at
 the same pressures, except in the case of the small values,
 which are somewhat unreliable, thus for nitrogen A” and B’”
 have about the same values as for air, while 0’ is about 2'0 ;
 now according to equation           c’,.as it depends only on the
 dimensions of the apparatus and the temperatures of the two

  488                  Mr. W. Sutherland on Thermal
  faces of the mica vane and conductivity, ought to have nearly
  the same value for two gases so closely alike as air and
  nitrogen; that is of course on the assumption that the value
  of c’ for oxygen is not much different from that for nitrogen,
  but we had better delay the discussion of this curious point
  until we have considered the data for oxygen.
     For 002 and CO the parameters are :—
                                     c'.         A".       B”'.

     In the case of CO these values give values of the repulsion
  or de<U+FB02>ecting force agreeing closely with the experimental
  over the whole range of pressure, but for C102 the calculated
  values are larger than the experimental at the higher pres
  sures; but the matter is hardly worth going into more closely,
  especially as oxygen and hydrogen show exceptional behaviour
  of the highest interest to which we will proceed.
     For oxygen Crookes obtained the following, the pressure
  unit being l/lO6 atmo, and the unit of repulsion the same
  arbitrary one as before :—

  where the de<U+FB02>ecting force remains almost constant from a
  pressure of 1000 down to 297, after which it rises, and at lower
_ pressures than those given attains a maximum and then dimi
  nishes. Now Bohr (Wied. Ann. xxvii.) discovered a remark
  able discontinuity in the compressibility of oxygen at about
   921/106 atmo, which has been corroborated by Baly and
  Ramsay (Phil. Mag. [5] xxxviii.), and obviously the above
  anomaly must be traced to the same cause as the discontinuity.
  These phenomena are so important for the chemistry of oxygen
  that I will discuss them in a separate paper on “ Spontaneous
  Chan e of Oxygen into Ozone, and a remarkable type of Dis
  sociation.” Meanwhile we will go on to the region of pressure
  in which the repulsion in oxygen is not exceptional ; here we
  have c’=3‘0, A”='0007, and B’”='0132, which give the

ness of the exceptional behaviour at the higher pressures.

The products do not show the same approach to a limit as was
the case with air, and there is a jerkiness in their variation
which points probably to experimental uncertainty. At the
lower pressures the quotients of repulsion by pressure, which
ought to be tending to a limit, are given in t e third row of
the following :—

In view of the experimental uncertainty already pointed out
at the high pressures and that which is to be proved at the
lowest pressures, this comparison shows that the modi<U+FB01>ed
formula represents the facts for hydrogen about as 'well as
possible.
     We will now compare the theoretical values of the para—
meters 0’ and A” with the numerical ones just obtained; 0'
stands for bK(vg—cl)/(v2+v]), in which K is proportional to D
 and is a function of k’; also (ea—v1)/(cg+vl) is the same
 for all the gases, so that c’ is proportional to D. But
 A”=9D9v02/161F(v2+v1)4, and v varies as m'%, and therefore
 (A”1)9/m)3 is proportional to D, which now means distance
 from edge of vane to which transpiration extends. The
 following table contains 107k’, 0’, and (A”1f’/m)ii for com

 It can be seen that on the whole these numbers con<U+FB01>rm the
 theoretical conclusion that thermal transpiration near the
 edge of the plate is effective to a distance which increases
 with the conductivity. The smallness of c’ for N, as com
 pared to its value for air and the smallness of c’ for C0 are
 points that require con<U+FB01>rmation by experiments with an
  apparatus lending itself better to quantitative calculations than
 the torsion radiometer of Crookes.
      The values of 13‘”, as they represent only a small amount of
  slipping, and are not given very de<U+FB01>nitely by the experiments,
  are not worth further consideration.
      So much for what may be called the static form of the
  radiometer; of the results obtained from a great variety of
  moving radiometers constructed by Crookes the following are
  the most important. In a radiometer containing two <U+FB02>ies,
  one pivoted above the other, and having their blackened

             Transpiratz'on and Radiometer Ztlotion.         491
sides facing in opposite directions, the radiation from a candle
causes the <U+FB02>ies to revolve in opposite directions, which proves
that the driving action is chie<U+FB02>y localised close to the <U+FB02>ies ;
this result is of course involved in our theory according to
which the action of the fall of temperature through each vane
is to raise the pressure near its hot face and lower it near the
cool face, but the region of lower pressure of the upper <U+FB02>y
being just above the region of higher pressure of the lower
<U+FB02>y, and, with no obstruction between, ought to produce dissi~
pation of the driving power of both <U+FB02>ies, so that although
they move in opposite directions they hinder one another in
this direct manner as well as through the viscosity of the gas.
Another radiometer contained only one pair of vanes at the
ends of a single arm, and each vane carried opposite to its
black face, at a distance of a millimetre, a large disk of thin
clear mica ; the action of a candle on this was to cause
rotation in a direction opposite to the usual, that is, the black
face moved towards the light. When another disk of thin
clear mica was attached opposite the other side of each vane
a candle ceased to have any effect. The theoretical reason for
these facts is clear; in the <U+FB01>rst case the region of high
pressure set up near the edge of the black face of the vane has
more effect on the clear plate than on the vane and in the
Opposite direction, so that there is a resultant differential
pressure driving the vane and its attachments in the opposite
direction to the usual ; when the other clear plate is attached
there is an equal opposite resultant differential pressure due
to it and so there is equilibrium ; in short, when the two clear
plates are attached the whole action is con<U+FB01>ned to the space
between them, so that there can be no motion of the whole
system.
   In another radiometer the four vanes were left clear, but at
the side of the bulb a plate of mica blackened on one side was
fastened in a vertical plane passing through the centre of the
bulb, so that a vane in passing it would leave a clear space of
a millimetre: when light is thrown only on the clear vanes
there is no motion, but as soon as it is allowed to fall on the
<U+FB01>xed plate the <U+FB02>y revolves as though a wind were blowing
from the black surface. This follows from theory at once, as
the edge of the black face becomes a region of higher pressure
and therefore a source of wind.
   On replacing the pith or mica vanes by metallic ones
Crookes encountered some new phenomena ; perfectly <U+FB02>at
aluminium vanes were found to be much less sensitive to the
light of a candle than mica or pith ; they move in the same
direction, that is with the black surface away from the light,
but when the candle is replaced by a source of dark heat their

 492      Thermal Tranapiration and Radiometer Motion.
 motion is reversed, which is not the case with mica and pith
  (of course we are speaking of forms in which two or more
  vanes are arranged symmetrically with regard to the pivot) ;
  this reversal simply shows that the metal is a better absorber
  of dark heat than the lampblack.
     But in working with vanes made of gold-leaf Crookes
  noticed that while the blackened side of one vane appeared to
  be repelled by a candle, that of another appeared to be
  attracted, and on examination it turned out that while the
  former vane was <U+FB02>at the latter was crumpled and bent in
  such a manner as to present a concave surface to the light.
  Following up this clue by constructing radiometers with bent
  and curved vanes Crookes was able to prove that in radiometer
  motion shape of the vane exercises even more in<U+FB02>uence than
  the absorbing power of the surface, so that a convex bright
  surface appears to be strongly repelled by a source of light,
  while a black surface if made concave to the light is actually
  attracted by it.
     The theory of curved vanes is simple: consider a convex
  vane irradiated by a source on the normal through its middle
  point; then, as the amount of heat that a surface absorbs
  depends on its obliquity to the incident radiation, the farther
  a part of the convex surface is from the middle the less is it
  directly heated, and thus there is a continuous fall of tempera
  ture from the centre of the surface to the edge ; conduction,
  if allowed time, tends to reduce the amount of the fall but
  does not obliterate it, and conduction also establishes a fall of
  temperature along the back from centre to edge; now the
  traction of the gas on the solid is from hot to cold, so that
  both on the front and the back of the vane there is a traction
  from centre to ed e whose resultant effect is to drag the vane
  away from the lig t when the vane is convex to it, so that the
  light appears to repel a convex surface ; when the surface is
  concave the same reasoning applies, the gas exerts a traction
  from centre to edge, and therefore the light appears to
  attract it.
      There is hardly any need to reproduce any more of Crookes’s
   facts or Pringsheim’s skilful experimental analysis of the
  parts played in radiometer motion by bulb, vane, and gas;
  enough has been given to show that the kinetic theory can
  account qualitatively and quantitatively for all the essential
, facts of radiometer motion and furnishes general principles
   for the design of apparatus of the radiometer type.          An
  illustration of the application of these principles will be given
   in a separate paper on “Two New Pressure-Gauges for the
  Highest Vacua.’

L. Theoretical Considerations respecting the Separation of
   Gases by Difusion and similar Processes. By LORD
   RAYLEIGH, Sec. R.S.*
THE larger part of the calculations which follow were
        made in connexion with experiments upon the concen
tration of argon from the atmosphere by the method of
atmolysis 1'. When the supply of gas is limited, or when it
is desired to concentrate the lighter ingredient, the conditions
of the question are materially altered; but it will be con
venient to take <U+FB01>rst the problem which then presented itself
of the simple diffusion of a gaseous mixture into a vacuum,
with special regard to the composition of the residue.             The
diffusion tends to alter this composition in the <U+FB01>rst instance
only in the neighbourhood of the porous walls ; but it will be
assumed that the forces promoting mixture are powerful
enough to allow of our considering the composition to be
uniform throughout the whole volume of the residue, and
variable only with time, on account of the unequal escape of
the constituent gases.      ‘
   Let a, y denote the quantities of the two constituents of the
residue at any time, so that -d.z', —dy are the quantities
di<U+FB01>used out in time dt. The values of dx/dt, dy/dt will
depend upon the character of the porous partition and upon
the actual pressure; but for our present purpose it will
suf<U+FB01>ce to express dy/da', and this clearly involves only the
ratios of the constituents and of their diffusion rates. Calling
the diffusion rates a, v, we have
                               dz/_V_y_
                               (H_M........(1)
   In this equation x, y may be measured on any consistent
s 'stem that may be convenient. The simplest case would be
that in which the residue is maintained at a constant volume,
when x, y might be taken to represent the partial pressures
of the two gases. But the equation applies equally well
when the volume changes, for example in such a way as to
maintain the total pressure constant.

  an equation which exhibits the relation between the enrich
  ment and the ratio of the initial and <U+FB01>nal total quantities of
  the mixture.
      From (8), or more simply from (4), we see that as .2:
  diminishes with time the enrichment tends to zero or in<U+FB01>nity,
  indicating that the residue becomes purer without limit, and
  this whatever may be the original proportions. Thus if the
  <U+FB01>rst gas       be the more di<U+FB01>usive (p.> v), the exponent on the
  right of (4) is negative ; and this indicates that 1' becomes
  in<U+FB01>nite, or that the <U+FB01>rst gas is ultimately eliminated from the
  residue. When the degree of enrichment required is speci<U+FB01>ed,
  an easy calculation from (8) gives the degree to which the
  diffusion must be carried.
      In Graham’s atmolyser the gaseous mixture is caused to
  travel along a tobacco-pipe on the outside of which a vacuum
  is maintained. If the passage be suf<U+FB01>ciently rapid to
   preclude sensible di<U+FB02>’usion along the length of the pipe, the
  circumstances correspond to the above calculation ; but the
   agreement with Graham’s numbers is not good. Thus in one
   case given by him "‘ of the atmolysis of a mixture containing
   equal volumes of oxygen and hydrogen, we have
                     Y/X=1, y/w=92'78/7'22,
   so that r= l3 nearly.       Thus, if in accordance with the view

so that a reduction of the residue to “229 of the initial quantity
should have effected the observed enrichment. The initial
and <U+FB01>nal volumes given by Graham are, however, 7'5 litres
and '45 litre, whose ratio is '06.        The inferior ef<U+FB01>ciency of
the apparatus may have been due to imperfections in the walls
or joints of the pipes. Such an explanation appears to be
more probable than a failure of the law of independent
diffusion of the component gases upon which the theoretical
investigation is founded.
    In the concentration of argon from a. mixture of argon and
nitrogen we have conditions much less favourable.              In this
 case

     When the object is the most effective separation of the
 components of a mixture, it is best, as supposed in the above
 theory, to maintain a vacuum on the further side of the porous
 wall. But we have sometimes to consider cases where the
  vacuum is replaced by an atmosphere of <U+FB01>xed composition, as
 in the well-known experiment of the diffusion of hydrogen
  into air through a porous plug. We will suppose that there
  are only two gases concerned and that the volume inside is
  given.    The symbols .r, y will then denote the partial
  pressures within the given volume, the constant partial
  pressures outside being a, ,8. Our equations may be written
                            dz = ,u. (a— a!) (it

    Image a: is that image which is seen on removing the
eyepiece and looking down the body of the microscope. It
is seen without distortion if the iris diaphragm below the
condenser occupies its proper position. (See p. 435.)
    The X scale is one of the radii of image a: divided into
a scale of equal parts, with zero at the centre, and on which
the number G (the NA of the objective) is at its outer end.
 (See p. 506.)                                                                                      ~
    A punctum means a luminous point in image .70. It is what
a beam of parallel light becomes after passing through the
objective. (See p. 503.)
    A macula is a spot of light of any size and shape in image
.70, and corresponds to a sheaf of beams emitted from the
object. (See footnote on p. 510.)
    If kg, in the <U+FB01>gure on next page, be the front of the
objective, and o the middle of image 0, then the radiating
lines represent the axial rays of a fan of beams as they emanate
from image (3; and the feet of the perpendiculars are in the
relative ositions in which the puncta of those beams will
present themselves in image x. (See p. 504.)

 (See p. 504.)
     33. Numerical Aperture, or Grasp—The microscopic
 object, the illumination supplied to it, the cover-glass placed
 over it, and the media on both sides of this cover-glass—viz.:
 the medium between the cover-glass and the object on the
 one side, and the medium betWeen the cover-glass and the
 objective on the other (which latter is usually air or oil)—are
 what between them determine the condition in which light
 enters the objective.
     It will be convenient to call the three media between the
 object and the objective a, b, c; a being the medium in which
 the object is mounted, b the glass of which the cover-glass is
 made, and 0 being the oil or air which intervenes between the
  cover-glass and the objective.          The surfaces of demarcation
  between these media are always planes perpendicular to the
  axis of the microscope, so that we need only consider this
  simple case.
      It has already been proved that the light immediately in
  front of the object, i. e., as it exists while in medium a, may be
  resolved into beams of uniform plane waves. These beams con
  tinue to be beams of uniform plane waves in travelling across
  media 12 and 0, since the surfaces separating the three media
  are planes. Hence the light immediately before entering the
  objective, i. e., as it exists in medium a, may be resolved into
   beams of uniform plane waves. We may regard this light as
   suffering reversal, as in § 8, and at the same time conceive
   medium 0, the oil or air in front of the objective, to be
   extended downwards, all other apparatus beneath * being
   removed.
      * For convenience of descri tion we suppose the microsco        to be
   pointed downwards, as it usua ly is more or less.     It should  e noted
   that what is commonly called the front of the object is what is then its
   upper side, the side turned towards the observer, while what is called
   the front of the objective is its under end, that end which receives the
   light.                                                  '

              Dr. G. J. Stoney 0n Moroscopic Vision.                  501
    Under these circumstances the light after reversal will
 form image C, i. e. standard image No. 2, in the extension
 downwards of medium a. If the light be allowed to advance
 farther down, and then to suffer another reversal, it will in its
 subsequent upward journey re-form standard image No. 2,
 and then continuing past it, will fall upon the front of the
 objective in exactly the same state as the light that came
 from the microscopic object would have done. We shall
 <U+FB01>nd the state of things which is here sketched to be much
 the most convenient for our purpose.
    We may accordingly remove everything that lies below the
 objective except medium 0, which is to be extended down
 wards, and we may substitute image 0 (i. e. standard image
 No. 2, formed as above described in medium a after two
 reversals) for everything so removed. We have thus only to
 picture to ourselves image C as present in its proper position
 in medium a and as emitting its light upwards. This light
 is resolvable into beams of uniform plane waves, each of
 which has its own axial ray, viz.: that ray of the beam which
starts from o, the point where image C is pierced by the axis of
 the microscope. Accordingly all axial rays diverge from o,
 and after passing through the objective they all converge to, or
rather nearly to, another point a on the optic axis, at D. If
a and B are the angles which one of these rays (or one of
these beains*) makes with the optic axis at 0 and s, then
Lagrange’s theorem states that
                            nsina=Msin,B,           .   .   .  .   .  (l)
where M is the number of times that the linear dimensions of
image D are larger than those of image 0, and where n sin a
is that which Abbe calls (when applied to the most inclined
ray from 0 which the objective can admit) the “Numerical
Aperture ” of the objective, symbolizing it by the letters NA.
These—the name and the symbol—are a too limited name,
and an inconvenient symbol. I therefore propose instead to
   * We may speak of a and B as the inclinations either of the axial ray,
or of the beam to which it belongs. With some objectives image 1 lies
inside the objective, with snme eye ieces D lies inside the eyepiece; and
the diagram &c. will need to be me i<U+FB01>ed accordingly.

speak of the grasp of a beam, and of the grasp of the objective.
This designation is justified, since, as we shall presently see,
the quantity designated by it, when it is applied to an ob
jective, is the proper measure of its resolving power, 2'. e. of
the minuteness of detail which that objective can reach ; and
when applied to an individual beam or to its axial ray, it
indicates the farthest that two rays of that obliquity can go
in the representation of detail, in other words their utmost
grasp. When applied to the most inclined beam in any
meridian plane whose axial ray can be caught by the ob
jective, it measures the grasp of the objective, and may
conveniently be represented by G, and it may be symbolized
by y when applied to any less inclined beam.

the objective, 0 the middle of image C, and ob and 011' the
 axial rays of two beams lying in the same meridian plane.
 These beams, if reversed, will under ordinary circumstances
 (1'. e. if the transversals are not in alto ether discordant
 positions) produce a ruling* in image 0. T e spacing of this
 ruling is given by the formula                        ‘
                          7U=a (sin a+sin a'),
 where a- is the spacing of the ruling, 7U the wave-length in
 medium 0, and where a and a' are counted as positive when
 on opposite sides of the vertical. Multiply both sides by n,
 the index of refraction of medium 0. Then
                        nN=a-(n sin “+1: sin a'),
     it To prevent misapprehension it may be well to call attention to the
 circumstance that this ruling may have a very brief existence—lasting for
 something like one foot of time in cosmic measure, see footnote, p. 425—
 and may he succeeded on the image-plane by other rulings parallel to and
 equally spaced with the <U+FB01>rst, but perhaps shlfted in the irection perpen
 dicular to the ruling.   Such rulings would be unseen by us.    They only
 become visible when the two beams have some common origin so that
their bases maintain the same relation to one another in successive
small intervals of time.   This prevents the shifting spoken of above.

where 7t (=n7\’) is the wave-length in air, and g and g’ the
“grasps” of the two beams. Hence 0' and g+g’ are in
versely as one another : in other words, the minuteness of a'
is proportional to 91+ 9'. Of course at least two beams have
to be associated with one another to produce a ruling. If,
however, the two beams are equally inclined and on Opposite

   The case of two beams which are not in the same meridian
plane is dealt with in the next section.
   34. Of the Information supplied by Image or. In any of the
cases we have to deal with, the angle ,8 of the <U+FB01>gure on
page 501 is so small that its tangent may be written for its
sine. In fact the two do not di<U+FB02>'er, in the cases we need
consider, by one part in a thousand, a difference which may
legitimately be disregarded. Now look down the tube of the
microscope. The beams of parallel light emitted from the
objective <U+FB01>eld are concentrated into the points of the luminous
image a; which is then seen. Let us direct our attention to
that one of these beams which is represented in the diagram
on p. 501. Its light is concentrated in the 'point p of image m.
It is convenient to have a name for this concentration of a
beam in image .z, and we shall call it the punctum of the
beam. Let 'r be the radius from the axis of the microscope
out to this punctum, and let f be the distance from image a:

B being the radius to the border of the disk of light seen on
looking down the tube. It appears from these formulae that
the grasp of any particular beam is simply proportional to the
radius in image at out to the punctum into which that beam
is concentrated ; so that we may put the above formulae into
the simple form of words—g is proportional to r, on the same
 scale on which Gr (the numerical aperture of the objective)
is represented by R (the radius of the disk of light seen on
looking down the tube of the microscope). This excessively
simple rule will be found of great use in carrying on practical

therefore lies in a plane parallel to and close to the objective
plane, but not necessarily coincident with it. Let us call
this plane the image plane, in order to give it a name. We
have spoken of the image as lying in this plane, but the phrase
 must here be understood in a generalized sense. “That is
 meant is, not that the image is <U+FB02>at, but that the image plane
 is related to image 0 in the same way that the objective
 plane is related to the microscopic object.
     Consider now one of the beams that form image C. The
 positions in that beam that are in the phase 6 at the time t,
 are a system of parallel planes transverse to the beam and
 Separated by intervals of 7V from one another. These planes
 intersect the image plane in a system of parallel lines, which
 are separated from one another by intervals 5=7t'/sin a, a being
    it In dealing with such matters as are discussed in this section, the
 reader should note that g, g', &c., the grasps of individual beams, though
 of cypher dimensions are not mere numbers. They are directed quantities,
 each standing out in some de<U+FB01>nite longitude, per endicularly to the optic
 axis. Each accordingly consists of a vector com ined with a scalar. It
 is thus that they can be fully represented both in direction and magnitude
 by the radii r, r', &c. in image 1', the radii from the optic axis out to
 the puncta of their res ective beams. It is otherwise with G, the grasp
 or numerical aperture 0 an objective, the direction of which is immaterial,
 and of which, therefore, the scalar part is the only one to which we need
 pay attention. G is adequately represented by R, where R is the length
 of a radius of image a: irrespective of its direction.

the inclination of the beam to the optic axis. All points of
these lines are in the phase 6 at the time t.
   Proceed in the same way with another beam whose inclina
tion to the epic axis is ad, and which lies in a plane of incidence
inclined at an angle <75 to the plane of incidence of the <U+FB01>rst
beam. It produces on the image plane a system of parallel
lines in the phase 9 at the time t; which lines stand at
intervals 8’=7\'/sin a’, and are inclined at the angle ¢ to the
<U+FB01>rst set.
   Let <U+FB01>g. 1 represent the image plane with the two systems
of lines drawn upon it. They form parallelograms; and if
we draw the dotted lines of the <U+FB01>gure, which are diagonals

 in the same phase as the other at every point of these dotted
lines—in other words, these dotted lines are the middle lines of
 the equidistant luminous bands which constitute the ruling
produced by the two beams on the image plane.

perpendiculars of one of the triangles of <U+FB01>g. 1, both in actual
magnitude and in position. Now the lengths of the perpen
diculars of a triangle are inversely as its sides. Take then
the reciprocals of a, 8, and 8' without changing their positions

their scalar parts are of cypher dimensions. Now if p and p'
of <U+FB01>g. 3 are the puncta in image .e of the two beams, their
radii represent 9 and 9’ both in position and in magnitude
 estimated on the X scale, which means that scale which
 prevails throughout image x, and on which the length of the
 radius of image .z' represents G, the grasp 0r numerical
aperture of the objective. The X scale is one in which
lengths mean numbers. We thus learn that the triangle in
<U+FB01>g. 3 is in the same position as the triangle in <U+FB01>g. 2, and is
 similar to it. Therefore d, the line joining the puncta p and
11', represents X/a in magnitude on the X scale, and represents
it also in position. In other words,             ’

perpendicular to the line 11.
    This is a very important proposition, far reaching in the use
 that can be made of it in the interpretation of microscopical
 phenomena.       We should, however, when employing it,
 bear this caution in mind—In every attempt to draw an
 inference from image .21, we must recollect that the inform
 ation it gives, though great, is limited. It tells us the
 intensities and the ositions of the beams of uniform plane
 waves into which t e light is resolved—beams which are
 thrown off from the whole extent of the objective <U+FB01>eld; it
 also tells us the directions and the spacings of the rulings
 produced by these beams ; but it is silent in regard to every

             Dr. G. J. Stoney on M'croscopic Vision.         507
thing that is determined by the positions of the transversals
of these beams, or the phases of the luminous waves.
   35. Resolution—Our <U+FB01>rst illustration of the great assistance
which is rendered to the practical microscopist by Abbe’s
theory will be taken from the guidance it gives him when he
wants to set up his apparatus so as to resolve an unusually
dif<U+FB01>cult “ test-object.” That which we shall take is Amphi
pleura pellucida. This cigar-shaped diatom is less than the
tenth of a millimetre in length, and about a tenth of that
again in width. With ordinary objectives the only detail
seen on it is the ridge surrounding it and a longitudinal
midrib which dilates into loops at the two ends. Between
the midrib and the sides of the diatom are what seem to be
two mere uniform plains ; but when adequate arrangements
are made each of these plains proves to be covered by trans
verse rows of specks so close that Mr. Nelson in one specimen
counted 96 of these rows in the thousandth of an English
inch; and the specks of which the rows consist are somewhat
closer still. Hence a', the spacing of the rows, is the 96,000th
part of an English inch, which is the same as a-=0'265 a,
where ,4. stands for the micron, the thousandth part of a
millimetre. This is a good deal shorter than the shortest
wave-length of the most extreme ultra-violet light which can
reach us from the sun. The wave-lengths of the visible part
of light are much larger, ranging from 0‘38 ,1:- to 0'76 a.
   The diatom was one mounted by Professor Van Heurck
in a medium containing arsenic disulphide (As2S2), the
refractive index of which is said to be 2'4; so that the
relative refractive index between it and silex is about 1'7,
thus affording both the advantage described in Theorem 6,
p. 348, and what is in the present case the still greater
advantage described on the same page, in the paragraph
which follows the enunciation of that theorem. Moreover,
the result seems to show that this medium has also a relatively
low dispersive power, which adds to its value. It is unfor
tunate that a material possessed of these important properties
is so dif<U+FB01>cult to manipulate, or so risky, that no one seems
to have succeeded in mounting objects in it except Dr. Van
Heurck himself.
   The apparatus employed were an - immersion objective
of which the nominal G (numerical aperture or grasp) was
1'35, and a dry condenser of which G’=0'9. To be on the
safe side it was thought well to reckon only on being able
to make 1'25 of the grasp of the objective available, and 0'85
of the grasp of the condenser. Putting these values for
g and 9’ into equation (2), viz. :—
                          X=a(g+g’), . . . . . . (2)

                   A: (0'265) x (1'25+ 0'85)
                       =O'56 /.a,
which is the wave-length of a ray between the lemon-coloured
part of the spectrum and the green. We thus learn that
light of the above wave-length is the least refrangible which
can help us to see the detail we are looking for. We ought
accordingly to exclude all red, orange, and yellow rays since,
if present, light of these colours would throw a uniform glare
over the plains upon which the detail lies. This condition is
best complied with by setting up prisms to limit the range of
wave-lengths that we employ. , Two two-inch equilateral
prisms of dense glass brought into their position of minimum
deviation were found to answer well. The light to be chosen
 should be of a colour for which the objective is specially well
 corrected, more particularly as regards aplanatism; and for eye
 observations it must be in a su<U+FB02>iciently luminous part of the
 spectrum to supply brightness enough. It should obviously
 consist of the rays of shortest wave-length that ful<U+FB01>l these
 conditions ; and on trial the best light was found to be
bluish green of about 7t=0'52 p. This wave-length is
nearly that of the great magnesium triplet in the spectrum.
    No collimating-lens was employed to prepare the light for
the prisms, but the slit (a coarse one) was adjusted to
 such a distance from the prisms as enabled the condenser to
produce a disk of light in image .z' of the full size corre
sponding to its grasp, when the condenser was itself adjusted
 at such a distance from the microscopic object as to produce
 one uniform colour throughout that disk of light. Upon the
 slit the ima e of an incandescent gas-burner had been
thrown, whic was thus the source of light. The mirror of
 the microscope was then turned until the colour seen in
image a: was bluish green. With these arrangements we
know that the wave-lengths we are using are in the neigh
bourhood of 7t=0'52 a.
    We are now in a position to determine what size of stop
it will be advisable to introduce under the condenser, so as to
 block out most of those direct beams whose diffracted light
does not come within the grasp of the objective, and which
accordingly would be not only useless but prejudicial. Since
7t=0'52 p. and 0:0'265 p. we <U+FB01>nd by equation (2) that
9+ 9’ = 1'96. Hence when 9 has its largest value, which is
1'25, 9’ will have its smallest, which accordingly is
                            g’=0'7l.

             Dr. G. J. Stoney on Zllicroscopic Vision.                 509
We should therefore put in a stop
which will block out all beams that
have a grasp less than this *. The
image at .2: will then have the ap
pearance represented on a large scale
in the annexed diagram. An annulus
of bright light will be seen in it

lies at g’=0'7l, and the limit Of                Image.r,withXscale.

and faint light will be seen farther out to the limit of the
grasp of the objective at G: 1'25.
    We may, however, with advantage block out still more of
the light. For the specks upon the diatom are numerous,
and although not quite regularly disposed, they are approxi
mately in straight vertical rows, and less regularly in some
what wavy horizontal rows.            In this description we suppose

so that it can be centred relatively to the condenser. Provision for
this adjustment is always useful and sometimes essential for accurate
work ; and Messrs. Watson and Sons, at the request of the writer, made
an adjustable cell for holding the stops which is entirely satisfactory.

  the length of the diatom to be placed horizontally. Now the
  nearest of the diffraction-spectra which such sources of light
 would produce are disposed round a direct ray 2, as in the
  <U+FB01>rst of the diagrams on           . 509. Accordingly, when 2 is
 in the neighbourhood of _a of the second <U+FB01>gure, it produces
 one, and only one, diffraction-spectrum, that at a, which comes
 within the grasp of the objective. Similarly the direct beams
 which have their puncta near I" produce diffracted beams
 with their puncta near b. And in the same way the beams
 which are concentrated into those puncta of image at which lie
 near 0’ and (1’ will produce diffracted light which reaches 0
 and d. But the direct beams that reach the intermediate
 positions at e’, f’, g’, and h’ throw all their spectra too far
 out—vertically sideways or diagonally—to be caught by the
 objective. Hence this intermediate light cannot help to show
 the specks, and only produces di<U+FB02>'used light tending to veil
 them from view. The image will therefore be cleared by
 blocking this light out. This is easily done by cutting a
 cross out of card, and placing it
 over the central stop. What is then
 seen at w is depicted in the annexed
 <U+FB01>gure, for in fact the diffracted
 light is so faint, and the direct light
 so strong, that to see each macula *
 of diffracted light it is best to shut
 out all but one of the maculae of
 direct light ; and even then the
 diffracted light at o and d is faint and
 diffuse enough to be dif<U+FB01>cult to see.
     It now only remains to adjust the draw-tube with extreme
care (since the objective is fully corrected only for one
length of draw-tube) and to apply a compensating eyepiece
of suf<U+FB01>cient power. A suitable ma i<U+FB01>cation is 2000, for
eyes that see very minute objects wit ease ; and if there be
in the observer a slight defect in this respect, the power
3000-]- will be found better. The power 2000 causes the
vertical rows—those which stand at right angles to the mid
rib of the diatom—to appear with the closeness of lines ruled
at intervals. of halfa millimetre from one another when viewed
   * A macula or spot in image a: is the representative in that image of a
sheaf of beams emitted from the microscopic object. It may be of any
size, and the sheaf of beams it re resents are those beams of which the

and which he has found to be of great service.

by the unassisted eye from a distance of ten inches._ When
all the foregoing precautions are taken the observer is
rewarded by seeing something like 17 or 18 specks in each row
where the rows are longest, and fewer in other places. The
specks are fainter than the rows, because from their being some
what closer, the diffracted light at c and d lies farther out than
that at a and b, and less of it is grasped by the objective. It
is alsojmore diffuse, and therefore less easily seen in image .70,
partly because the specks are disposed in wavy lines longitu
dinally while they are arranged in nearly straight lines across
the diatom. Another reason why it is fainter is that the longi
tudinal rows are much less numerous than the transverse.
On all these accounts it is very di<U+FB02>icult to see the maculaa
at c and d in image .r.
    Another point is well illustrated by this experiment. The
larger features on the diatom require a certain moderate
 aperture to show them well. Now beams so divergent
 as those that have their puncta in maculae so separated as
 a’, b’, c’, and (1’   cannot   concur   to show     these larger
 features unless in co-operation with intermediate beams that
 have been blocked out. The larger features are accordingly
 only seen by the light of these maculie, each acting separately;
 and the sheaf of beams that reaches one of them has too small
 an aperture to show those features well. They present
 accordingly that clumsy blurred-out look familiar to all
 microscopists who have worked with annular or oblique
 illumination.
    Again, the specks themselves look very much like little
 molehills viewed from above. This is because they are due
 to the intersection of rulings which are of the <U+FB01>rst order,
 and which do not differ much from one another in their
 spacing. Rulings of the <U+FB01>rst order mean such as are pro
 duced by interference between only one pair of beams. The
 law of intensity in rulings of this simplest kind is that repre
  sented in the accompanying <U+FB01>gure, and therefore the specks
 which are produced by the intersection of rulings of the <U+FB01>rst
  order must have the same kind of rounded appearance.
    Two other appearances are likely to be seen in making
 this experiment. One is that the bright specks will become
 dark specks on a slight change of focus; the other is that they
 may perhaps seem to shift their positions relatively to the
 larger features of the object when the focal adjustment is dis

turbed. These are both of them phenomena more conspicuous
in others of the experiments which we propose to make, and
will more appropriately he explained in connexion with them.
(See § 37.)
   It has appeared desirable to go very minutely through the
successive steps of this example in order to show clearly that
Abbe’s mode of dealing with microscopic vision does success
fully and in the most instructive manner guide every step
of our preparations, and that it renders a full explanation of
every phenomenon we encounter whether in the course of
the preparations or in the <U+FB01>nal result.
   36. On the Signi<U+FB01>cance of what we see in the Meroscope.-—
As to the signi<U+FB01>cance of these specks. Their spacing along
each row is somewhat less than the spacing of the rows, and
may be taken to be about 0'24 a. From the way in which
their image is formed by the intersection of rulings of the
<U+FB01>rst order, it appears that they, like rulings of this kind, will
appear larger or smaller according to the amount of the
illumination ; and that they will be best seen when the
illumination is such that the apparent diameter of a speck,
and the apparent interval between it and the next, are about
equal. Accordingly the portion of the object which corre
sponds to it when best seen is that which is contained within
a sphere whose diameter is 0'12,a, and whose radius is there
fore 0'06 u. Now if we make the probable hypothesis (see
“ On the Internal Motions of Gases,” § 9, in the Phil. Mag.
for August 1868, p. 140) that the average spacing in solids
and liquids of the chemical atoms of which matter is made up
is somewhere about a tenthet-metre*, which is the same as
0'0001u, then there has needed about 900,000,000 of these
chemical atoms to build up a portion of the object of the
volume of our little globe. If, on the other hand, we suppose
 that the spacing of the atoms is about a ninthet-metre, i. e.
 0001 u—and it can hardly be more than this—the number of
 atoms in our little sphere becomes 900,000. The actual
 number probably lies somewhere between 900 thousands and
 900 millions. There is therefore this vast number of chemical
 atoms in the tiniest part of an object which can be dis
 tinguished from another part by so good a microscope, when
 handled with extreme care. We ought further to re<U+FB02>ect that
 each of these chemical atoms is itself highly complex, and
 that within every one of them all those events are in progress
   * A tenthet means a unit in the tenth place of decimals. And as a
 quarter pound means the quarter of a pound, so a tenthet-metre means
the tenthet of a metre.

             Dr. G. J. Stoney on illicroscopic Vision.               513
that are betrayed to us through the spectroscope. In the
face of such facts as these it is in vain for biologists to talk
as if anyone had at any time seen such a thing in nature
as “ undifferentiated protoplasm,” or asigany speck of matter
that can be seen by the best microscdpe s other than a body
of large size from the molecular standpoint, within which
there may be a vast amount of structure and an inconceivable
<U+FB02>ow and variety of events continually in progress. The
<U+FB01>nest <U+FB02>agellum of a saprophyte, the tiniest rod in karyokinesis,
may, consistently with every lesson taught us through the
microscope and by molecular physics, have quite as elaborate
a structure as that part of the structure of the limb of a
quadruped which can be seen by the human eye.
    Coarse rulings are usually produced by a fan of numerous
beams. It is thus that the shape of the bars of which they
consist is brought out. But the <U+FB01>nest rulings are of the
<U+FB01>rst order, i. e. in their case the fan has been reduced down
to two beams. Now the intensity of the light in rulings of
this kind follows the law [l—cos (21m(g+g')/>t)] ‘, which is
represented by the diagram on p. 511; and the microscopist
should constantly bear in mind that every speck or band upon
the object which is suf<U+FB01>ciently minute to have its image
formed exclusively out of rulings of the <U+FB01>rst order must
accordingly have the appearance of a little hillock or little
ridge wholly devoid of detail and with blurred outline: and
that notwithstanding this there may be any amount of detail,
variety of outline, and intricacy of motions present upon the
actual object within the limits of the part represented by that
speck or band.
   37. Propositions 8 and 9. Cause of bright specks becoming
dark; and Cause why <U+FB01>ne detail often seems to shift upon an
object—The <U+FB01>ner detail in image 0 is formed by the inter
lacing of beams that are inclined at a large angle to one
another. Let u and u' be two such beams in one meridian
plane, and let the unbroken lines of <U+FB01>g. 1 represent those
wave-surfaces in them which at the instant t are in phase 0.
Then it is easy to see that the two undulations reach every
point of the planes represented by the dotted lines in the same
phase. Hence if minute markings are seen by the ruling
produced by these beams cooperating with rulings produced
by other pairs of beams which are but little sloped to u and
  it If the two beams are not in-the same meridian plane, g+g’ should be
replaced by d, i. e. by the number on scale X which is represented by the
length of d, which is the distance asunder in image x of the free ends of
g and g'. (See §34, p. 506.)

u'—a case which occasionally happens—then if we put the
object a little out of focus these markings will appear to travel

along the inclined dotted lines and will appear to shift side
ways if the dotted lines are inclined, which they will be if,
as usually happens, the angles of incidence of u and u’ are
unequal. This shiftin need not extend to the larger features
of the object, since t ey are seen by light that is quite
differently circumstanced. In the case represented by the
<U+FB01>gure the markings that are seen do not pass from bright to
dark. Their de<U+FB01>nition merely fades continuously into a
haze while they are being put out of focus inwards or out
wards.
    But a case which is much more frequently met with is
represented by <U+FB01>g. 2. Here two pairs of undulations u, u’
and v, 2/, both in the same meridian plane, cooperate to pro
duce one of the rulings by which the markings are seen *. To
avoid complication the wave-surfaces are not represented in
this <U+FB01>gure, but the dotted lines sloping up to the left repre
sent, as in <U+FB01>g. 1, the planes over which u and u' are in the
same phase. The lines sloping up to the right represent the
same for v and v'. Hence if the objective be focussed upon
the horizontal plane through 8 everything is in confusion
and the image disappears, whereas on removing the focus a
little farther out to p the ruling reappears, but now dark

by the reappearance of the ruling at 'r, with its bright and
dark lines in the same positious as on the image plane.
   This is what happens to beams u, u', v, 1", all of which
lie in one meridian plane. If, as usually happens, the corre
sponding undulations in all the other meridian planes that
contribute to form the minute marking have their dotted
lines (the lines shown in <U+FB01>g. 2) about as much sloped, then at
about the height 10 they too will produce rulings in all of
which dark lines will now occur where bright ones did on the
image plane. Hence at the height p dark specks will be
produced, by the cooperation of all the beams, where bright
ones were produced on the image plane; and light will be
distributed over the intervening spaces where on the image
plane the darker shades prevailed. The effect depends on the
inclinations of the dotted lines being suf<U+FB01>ciently nearly the
same in different longitudes. Usually they approximate
 suf<U+FB01>ciently for at least one of the alternations from bright to
 dark spots to be well seen, and not unfrequently a second or
 third may be imperfectly traced.
    If, as in <U+FB01>g. 2, v' and v are at the same inclinations as u
 and u', then the dotted lines are equally sloped to the right
 and left, and the dark specks at level 10 are directly over the
 bright ones on the image plane. But this adjustment seldom
 happens to be accurately secured, and the dotted lines in

consequence slope more one way than the other. The dark
specks will then not be vertically over the bright ones, but
will have shifted a little in the direction of the more inclined
dotted lines of the <U+FB01>gure. From all which we may enunciate
the two following propositions:—
                          Pnorosrrron 8.
    When the image of minute detail is produced by a triplet of
 beams, or by two pairs of beams, in each meridian, then the
conditions are usually such, especially when the detail presents
the appearance of round spec/cs, that it will suddenly change
from bright to dark, or vice versa, upon a slight change of
focus; and under special circumstances which are occasionally
met with more than one of these alternations may occur.
                         PROPOSITION 9.
    The conditions are likely to be such, unless special precautions
have been taken, that on a slight change of focus the minute
detail upon the object will appear to shift its position relativel
to the general position and broader features of the object.
   38. Experiments illustrating the last section.——-All the con
ditions spoken of in the <U+FB01>rst paragraph of the last section
can be reproduced if the objective be a good half-inch
apochromatic with G=O'65, and if the object be the large
variety of Navicula lyra which is frequently met with in slides
of diatoms from St. Peter, Hungary. We shall suppose the
diatom to lie horizontally in the <U+FB01>eld of view, i. e. with its
length in the direction sometimes called East and West.
Now insert a stop under the con
denser, which will allow the sheaf of
beams u to pass. The <U+FB01>gure re
presents image .r, which is seen by
taking out the eyepiece and looking
down the tube of the microscope.
It is well to use a blank eyepiece to
keep the eye central—that is, the
mounting of an eyepiece without the
lenses, and with a small eyehole.                  Image a'.
The transverse rows of specks upon
the diatom, which lie vertically in the <U+FB01>eld of view, produce
the vivid spectrum 1; ; the longitudinal rows, which are fewer,
closer, and more wavy, produce on these accounts the fainter,
more distant, and more diffuse spectrum w. On replacing
the eyepiece the specks are seen on the diatom with great
distinctness. If the stop is in the position represented in the

              Dr. G. J. Stoney on Meroscopic Vision.         517
<U+FB01>gure, so that u and v are at equal distances on either side of
the vertical diameter, then on slightly changing the focus the
specks will not shift sideways. But on account of the
diffuseness and the one-sided lateral extent of w, the adjust
ment of u and 10 cannot be the same for different parts of w,
nor can it be the same for different colours, and it may be
found impossible to <U+FB01>nd any position of u in which there will
not be some shifting of the specks vertically.
   In this experiment only two of the maculae in image .z
(corresponding to two sheafs of beams) lie in the horizontal
direction, and two vertically. Accordingly in each direction
there is (as in <U+FB01>g. 1 on p. 514) only one of the two sets of the
dotted lines in <U+FB01>g. 2 upon page 515. In this case there
fore the conditions for the passing of bright specks into
dark do not exist, and accordingly on putting the microscope
slowly out of focus the image grows indistinct but no black
specks appear.
   The case is otherwise if we use a stop
 with a hole in it as at u in the
 accompanying <U+FB01>gure of image            Here
 there are three maculae, corresponding
 to three sheafs of beams in the horizontal
  osition and only two vertically. Ac
 cordingly on putting the microscope
 out of focus the vertical rulings (which
are caused by three sheafs of beams) will
change from bright to dark while the
horizontal ones (caused by only two) will not, and the resulting
specks in the microscopic image will become imperfectly
dark.
   Diatoms which show the transition from bright specks to
dark in perfection are those known as Actinoptyc/zus, of which
a good example is almost sure to be found on a St. Peter slide.
With the half-inch apochromatic and with the iris diaphragm
below the condenser nearly closed it gives in image .z a
ring of strong diffracted light. Two opposite puncta in this
ring and a punctum in the central macula belong to three
 beams which produce one of the very numerous rulings which
 conspire to form the specks in the microscopic image. Each
 such trio of beams furnishes both sets of the dotted lines in
 <U+FB01>g. 2 on p. 515. And as the ring is a tolerably circular one
 the other similar trios, whether in the same or in other
 longitudes, furnish dotted lines in <U+FB01>g. 2 that are not very
 far from being equally inclined. These are conditions that
 will produce black specks at the height represented by p in
    l’ln'l. <U+FB01>lag. S. 5. Vol. 42'. No. 259. Dec. 1896.   2 O

<U+FB01>g. 2 on p. 515. Now open the iris diaphragm, insert the
eyepiece, and look at this diatom : it will be found to exhlblt
the phenomenon with great distinctness.
    A modi<U+FB01>cation of this experiment is to cut a piece of card
of the annexed form and to place it over
the back of the objective. It allows only
two of each trio of beams to pass. These
proceed to form the rulings which are
competent to form specks in the micro
 scopic image ; and accordingly that image
will still exhibit the bright specks, which, however, will now
 go out of focus without any dark specks appearing.
    Notice that the specks now appear to traverse in a direction
 perpendicular to the diameter of the semicircular stop, while
 the microscope is being put out of focus. This is because the
 dotted lines of <U+FB01>g. 1, p. 514, are here necessarily oblique.
    39. Experiments exhibiting Illusory Colouration. See Pr0-'
position 4, p. 345).—The half-inch apochromatic, of which
 the grasp is 0'65, answers admirably for these experiments.
 It should be furnished with a Davis’s shutter, i. e. a small iris
 diaphragm interposed between the objective and the micro"
 scope tube, by which the aperture may be reduced when
 desired.   We shall also want a small central stop about 8 mm.
 in diameter, which can be put over the back of the ob
jective, and which may be cut out of card. This will
 enable us, at one stage of our experiment, to exclude the sheaf
 of dioptric      e. unditfracted) beams, while leaving a free
 passage to others.
     The object which perhaps most strikingly exhibits the
  phenomenon we are now occupied with is the diatom known
  as Actinocyclus Ralfsii. 1°. Select a valve of this diatom
  which looks blue when the Davis’s shutter is partly closed.
  2°. On then opening the Davis’s shutter the colour is for the
  most part but not altogether discharged, and at the same time
  a quantity of detail comes into view which was not visible or
  was seen imperfectly when the colour was present. It consists
  of specks variously distributed over the valve. 3°. Now
  introduce the central stop over the back lens of the objective,
  and open the Davis’s shutter.      The image is thereby con
  verted from blue to red, and there are added to the image
  dark grooves and bright lunes distributed over the intervals
  between the legitimate specks. 4°. Finally examine tl.e
   diatom with the immersion objective, which has a much
   greater grasp than the half-inch. It has now become
   absolutely colourless, and new detail has come into view

                Dr. G. J. Stoney on Microscopic Vision.          519
    consisting of from two to <U+FB01>ve little oints within each of the
   specks which are visible with the ha f-inch.              ‘
       Now a study of image .2: enables us to trace the cause of
   every one of these effects. Focus the diatom with the half
   inch. Take out the eyepiece and look at image w. Nearly
   close the iris diaphragm under the condenser, so as to reduce
   the incident light to a narrow central sheaf of beams. Then
   the macula of this sheaf of beams will be seen in image .1;
  as a central spot of bright light. Faint light
   is visible about it, which is scattered pretty
   generally over image .2: [this is light which
   helps us to see the larger features of the
   object], and at about the distance from the
   centre where g=0'5 there is a ring of much
  more intense light which has been di<U+FB01>'racted          I      _
   in all directions to that distance. This ring      wig heszale
   0f ditl'racted light is mainly red, owing to the               '
   unequal distribution of colour spoken of in § 16, p. 345.
, As so much red has been thrown into this spectrum, there
   is an equal de<U+FB01>ciency of red in the light which forms the
   central macula and the faint diffracted beams by which
  the larger features on the object are seen.           Hence it is
   that when the marginal ring is shut out by partially closing
   the Davis’s shutter, the diatom will appear blue : blue
  being the colour which lamplight becomes when much of
  its red is withdrawn from it. The exclusion of the di<U+FB02>'racted
  red light has another effect—it prevents the formation of
  a number of the rulings which are necessary for the
  formation of a good image; and accordingly much of the
  detail on the diatom which is visible when the Davis’s shutter
  is open, is lost to sight when it is suf<U+FB01>ciently closed to render
  the image blue.                  _
      That the image is not quite colourless with the full aperture
  of the half-inch is because there also exist other diffracted
  beams which lie beyond the reach of that objective. We
  know that they exist and that they are coloured, because the
  image seen with the immersion objective is colourless, and
  because more detail is seen in it. It has rendered the image
  colourless by adding some coloured beams to the slightly
  tinted image which the half-inch, fully open, presented, and it
  has brought out further detail by transmitting these additional
  beams in directions which furnish new rulings.
      Return now to the half-inch objective. When the central
  stop is put over its back lens, the central macula of image a:
  is covered up. This shuts out the dioptric beams. The image
                                 2 O2                               ,

 is then formed by the ring of red di<U+FB02>'racted light along with
 the fainter and apparently white di<U+FB02>'used diffracted light.
 Accordingly the image in this case is preponderatingly red.
    At the same time the red diffracted light is now obliged to
 act without the cooperation of the part of the light of the
 dioptric beams with which it before produced rulings. What
 was before a triplet of beams producing a ruling has now
 become the two extreme beams left to operate without the
 middle one, and they produce a ruling that is twice as <U+FB01>ne
 It is thus that black bands and bright patches are produced
 between the legitimate specks. These are very conspicuous
 in the image, notwithstanding which they are quite foreign
 to the object. They are produced very much in the same
 way as intercostal markings, to the illustration of which the
 next section will be devoted.
    Similar experiments may be made with innumerable other
 objects. Thus the familiar diatom, Pleurosig-ma angulatum,
 becomes buff-coloured when viewed with the Davis’s shutter
 su<U+FB01>iciently closed to exclude all but dioptric beams and that
 inner portion of diffracted light which has its origin exolu
 sively in the larger features of the object; whereas it becomes
 of a delicate blue when seen with the dark-<U+FB01>eld illumination
 obtained by putting a stop of the proper size under the con
 denser. ]n this case the object is seen by its diffracted light
 only, much of which is coloured. Similarly the tubercle
 bacillus when stained with fuchsin is intense red when examined
 through the half-inch in the ordinary way, but becomes a bluish
 white when seen with black-ground illumination. The study
 of a variety of cases like the above will be found instructive.
    40. Intercostal Markings and allied phenomena. See § 15,
p. 345.—Light which does not contribute to delineate any
 thing upon the object is apt to intrude in three forms—
 either (a) concentrated into patterns which are superposed
 upon the microscopic image, or (b) scattered in patches over
parts of it, or      spread in the form of a luminous haze
over everything. We shall endeavour to exemplify each of
these.
    (a) The <U+FB01>rst is well shown in the image of Pea-isteplzam'a
'e1/tyclza when examined through the half-inch apochromatic
 objective. '.Ihe real detail upon this diatom seems to consist
 of divisions into hexa onal cells which make it look like a
 honeycomb. Adjust the draw-tube accurately. Now nearly
 close the lower iris diaphragm, and look at image .1'. The
 dioptric light makes a central white macula, and round it are
 displayed, as in the <U+FB01>gure, a beautiful army of coloured
maculaP, each of which is a s] ectrum, blue inwards and red

              Dr. G. J. Stoney 0n Microscopic Vision.               521
  outwards. To make the following experiment, the lower
  iris diaphragm should be opened to so moderate an extent
  as will cause these maculae just to
  come short of touching one another.
     When now the Davis’s shutter is
» gradually opened, which increases the
  aperture of the objective, a succession
  of images present themselves. If it
covers up all the maeulae except the
  central one, the diatom is indeed seen,
  but with no detail upon it. In all
  subsequent enlargements of the aper
  ture, the honeycomb structure of the                 Image 11'.
  diatom is visible; but with the ad
  dition of spurious effects which vary* while the grasp of the
  objective is being enlarged. In fact, they depend on what
  spectra are permitted to pass and what spectra are excluded.
      Let us consider three of these images, 1, 2, and 3, of
   which 2 is formed with a larger aperture than 1, and 3 with
   a larger aperture than 2. If we start with image l and open
   the Davis’s shutter so as to pass to image 2, we may regard
   2 as being image 1 modi<U+FB01>ed by adding to it the new rulings
   which are formed by the newly admitted. light cooperating
   with a part of the dioptric sheaf.     And on the other hand, if
   we start with image 3 and close the Davis’s shutter, we may
   regard image 2 as being image 3 with the rulings added to it
   which would result if light equal in intensity but opposite in
   phase to the excluded light were allowed to cooperate with
   part of the dioptric light. In fact, these rulings <U+FB01>ll the gaps
   between whatever rulings 3 has and which 2 has not.
      Sometimes the one of these processes and sometimes the
   other helps us to a better conception of what is going on.
   The <U+FB01>rst process needs no elucidation, and of the second the
   following is a very neat illustration.
       Keep the same diatom on the stage; then look at image .2,
   and open the Davis’s shutter till the inner
   hexagon of six spectra is seen. On re
   placing the eyepiece a few intrusive mark
   ings will be perceived, including a bright
   patch of light occupying the middle of each
     oneycomb cell. This is image 1. Next
   look again at image w, and open the Davis’s
   shutter farther until the succeeding hexagon of twelve
   spectra is also allowed to ' pass. The image which is then
      ' With the half-inch apochromatic, two, three, and four intercostal
   markings can be produced along each side of each hexagon, the last
   number when we employ black-<U+FB01>eld illumination.

seen on replacing the eyepiece is image 3. One of its
  honeycomb cells is represented in the diagram, from which
   it will be seen that there are 19 deceptive markings upon
   it. The central one is_bright, but by a slight change of
   focus becomes dark.
       Adjust the focus so as to make it dark, and then close the
    Davis’s shutter into an intermediate position, which shuts out
    the. whole of the red of the outer twelve spectra, while it
    allows their blue halves to pass. This produces a new image—
    image 2—which will be seen on replacing the eyepiece. It
    will be found to be nearly like image 3, but with a red central
    spec/c instead of a dark our.
        The reason of this is that the hexagon of twelve spectra
    produces, along with some of the dioptric light, rulings which
    formed the dark central speck, as is proved by its being
    present in image 3 and not in image 1.       Now when we shut
    out the red of those spectra, we produce the same effect as if
- we added red light in the opposite phases, and half of this with
    half the same dioptric light (which has not been excluded)
    produces rulings the same as before, except that the bright
    and dark bands are interchanged. These accordingly change
    the dark into a bright speck at c. The effect is somewhat
 startling, since we change the specks from dark to red by
 shutting out red light! This gives one a lively picture of
 .how it comes to pass that the exclusion of light from image 0
    can lead to the intrusion of unauthorised markings.
        Another matter may here be adverted to. As explained
    in § 39, these spectra need not be equally intense for every
    wave-length: sometimes the less refrangible light pre
    ponderates in them and sometimes the more ret'rangible.
 ,Accordingly some of the intercostal markings to which they
    give rise will have a preponderance of red, others a prepon
 . derance of blue.      The <U+FB01>rst will seem buff-coloured, the others
    whiter than the lamplight we use as our illuminant; and
 pupon scrutinizing the <U+FB01>ctitious markings this difference in
     tint between them is plainly visible.        .    '
        When the dioptric macula is placed excentrically the
     resulting intrusive markings become in some degree both
     different and differently situated. Hence when we give a
     large aperture to the dioptric sheaf of beams by opening the
     iris diaphragm below the' condenser, its .macula becomes
     large; one part of it is central, others are excentric in
  . different degrees and different directions. Each part gives rise
     to its own set of false markings, and these where they overlap
     interfere and may occasion a general illumination at the place
      where they are situated instead of distinct markings.      This

             Dr. G. J. Stoney 0n Mcroscopic Vision.           523
is illustrated on our diatom by the whole inside of each cell
becoming full of a nearly uniform sheet of light instead of a
group of de<U+FB01>nite markings, when the' iris diaphragm is
suitably opened.     It is easy to see from this that there is no
one opening of the iris diaphragm which will, in all cases,
 give the best effect—the effect most free from intercostal
markings. In each case it depends on the way the spectra
are disposed, and will therefore differ from one object to
another. ' Its success, so far as intercoslal markings are
concerned, depends on the circumstance that when a small
dioptric macula is shifted about in image .r, the illusory effects
 undergo rapid change, while the image of true detail is but
little affected. Hence the real features of an object are well
 seen with a considerable illuminating cone ; and they may
 even be better seen on account of the admission of oblique
 rays, as these will both add to the visible detail and will
diminish that defect in images which consists in the rounding
 off of sharp edges. On the contrary, the false effects produced
 by the several small sheafs of beams in the cone are so diverse
 that when jumbled together they become undistinguishable.
 This is the next best thing to their being got rid of.
    It is evident that anything which intensities the strength
Of the more inclined beams will give rise to brighter inter
costal markings. They are, therefore, of exaggerated strength
when the object has been mounted in a medium of extra high
refractive index, owing to the effect which is described inv
§ 18, p. 346.
    (b) The diatom employed in the foregoing experiments
has the detail upon it disposed with the regularity of a honey
comb. It therefore concentrates most of the light diffracted
by it into de<U+FB01>nite spectra, and this has led to the formation
 of intercostal markings of equal de<U+FB01>niteness and regularity.
 Where, however, less symmetry prevails in the disposition of
the detail upon an object, the light it diffracts is not distri
 buted according to any simple law, and a corresponding want
of regularity ensues among the spurious markings, which
may become shreds, lunes, and patches, black, white, or
tinted, usually twisted, about, and sometimes <U+FB02>ickering (from
slight movements of the observer’s eye), and which are
chie<U+FB02>y conspicuous where there is some <U+FB02>at space in the
 microscopic image unoccupied by real detail. Numbers of
diatoms exhibit these phenomena.
    (0) Another frequent event is the presence of a haze of
light over everything. It will occur when, from want of a
central stop, there is dioptric light whose corresponding
diffracted light is abundant and lies beyond the grasp of the

remedy is to insert a stop of the proper size. A similar fog

it will then produce its own body of intercostal markings ;
these get massed together and produce a haze. The remedy
is of course to lessen the opening of the iris diaphragm“.
   A case which' should be specially noted is that of a bar on
the object with sharp edges. These produce highly inclined
diffracted beams; and if the objective cannot take these in,
the beams —Bb of p. 344 which must then be added to
standard image No. 1, round olf the edges and add thin
appendage-lines which are often mistaken for diffraction
fringes though they have a different appearance and a quite
different origin.

illustration of the effect produced by Stokes’s layer—the
effect which microscopists call optical contact—may be
obtained as follows :—
   Focus a valve of Pleurosz'gma angulatum, mounted dry,
under an immersion-lens of, say, G (or NA)=1'3. Adjust
the draw-tube. Then set up the apparatus described in § 35,
p. 12, for furnishing monochromatic light, and select green
light of about wave-length A=O'55 it.             Now 0'55]; is also

of its rows of markings.               Hence from the formula

thick.  In this case the parts that are out of focus produce it, and it
may often be cleared up without detriment to the observation we want
to make by partially closing the Davis’s shutter.

beam, and g is the grasp of the associated diffracted beam.
[The regularity of the detail on this diatom throws nearly
all the diffracted light into de<U+FB01>nite spectra] We have made
the convention that g and 9’ shall be positive when on oppo
site sides of the centre. Accordingly, when on the same side
we must regard g’ as negative. Now open the iris diaphragm
until the macula of tho dioptric sheaf of beams has expanded
so as just to touch those of the diffracted sheafs of beams.
Then what is seen on looking at image w is either what lies
within the greater or what lies within the less of the two
large circles of the <U+FB01>gure, of which the outer one corresponds
to 1'3, the rasp of the objective, and the inner one to a.
grasp=1.       t' the diatom is “ in optical contact,” that is if the
layer of air between it and the cover-glass is less than the
thickness of Stokes’s layer, then what is seen extends to the
outer circle. Whereas if the chink between the diatom and
the cover-glass is more than the thickness of the Stokes’s
layer, no light can get into the cover-glass except such as
passes up through it and the oil at less than the “critical
angle,” and this supplies light in image .r, only within the
smaller circle which corresponds to G (or NA)=1. The
reason of all this is obvious from what is stated in § 19 ; and
very interesting appearances may be obtained by traversing
the slide sideways and thus brin ing diatom after diatom
under the objective. With some t e light will extend in its
full intensity to the outer circle.     These are they that are in
good optical contact. With others nothing is seen beyond
the smaller circle. These are they that lie beyond the thin
 Stokes’s layer which lies like a varnish on the under side of
the cover-glass. And now and then one may be found in
which the outer ring of light is present but dim. This is
 one the interval between which and the glass is nearly the
full thickness of the Stokes’s layer. The whole experiment,
 if made with green monochromatic light, is one of exceeding
 beaut  .
    42.y110w  to See the Rulings.—-1t has been explained that the
 microscopic image is produced by the interlacing and mutual
interference of luminous rulings, each of which extends over
 the whole image <U+FB01>eld; and that each ruling is due to the
 concurrence of two or more beams the puncta of which are
 situated at equal intervals along some straight line upon
 image x. In order, however, to get light enough to see a
 ruling, we must be content to use small sheafs of beams
 instead of individual beams, and these in image .2: become
 small maculaa instead of points. This in practice may be
accomplished by putting a disk of card over the back of the

mounting of the objective and making a pinhole in it where
we wish a sheaf of beams to pass.
    Make one such hole in the centre and examine a slide
containing a variety of diatoms, as for example one of the
sh0w slides made with diatoms from St. Peter, Hungary. In
order to be able to predict the result, we must deal with a
speci<U+FB01>c case. Let, then, our objective be the half-inch
apochromatic with which R, the radius of image .11, is about
8 millimetres. Let us further suppose that the hole in the
card is l nnn. across. Hence the sheaf of beams the puncta
of which lie within this hole, contains beams of which d, the
distance between their puncta (see § 34, p. 506) may on scale
X be as much as one-eighth of0'65 (the grasp of the objective),
i. e. d is nearly 0'08 on scale X. Put this into the equation
                              G=7t,/(l,
and put 7t=0'6,u, which is close to the wave-length of the
brightest rays in lamplight. We <U+FB01>nd then

fer the spacing of the <U+FB01>nest ruling which can be produced by
the light passin through the small hole. __ “This would admit
of detail upon t e object being seen down to about the size of
a speck half the diameter of a disk of human blood.
    Accordingly all the large features upon most diatoms can
be seen through this small hole, as may be veri<U+FB01>ed by passing
a slide containing a variety of diatoms under the objective.
 ' Now make another similar hole at some distance from the
centre, suppose in a position corresponding to g=0'6 ; or,
still better, make two holes at that distance on opposite sides
of the centre. This gives us three holes in a straight line at
equal intervals. Then close the iris diaphragm under the
Condenser until the sheaf of dioptric beams just <U+FB01>lls the
middle hole. Only diffracted light will then appear in the
other two. New pass the diatoms again under the objective,
and on many of them a ruling will be seen, viz. : on all those
which furnish diffracted light of suf<U+FB01>cient strength in the
positions of the two lateral holes.     This ruling will have a
spacing calculated by
Here then we have actually in riew one of those rulings which
go to build up the ordinary microscopic image—that image

of the object which is furnished by the microscope when the
 card is removed.
. Note that the ruling as seen does not extend across the
 whole <U+FB01>eld of view, but only a little beyond the boundary of
 the diatoms. This is because the ruling we see is made by
sheafs of beams instead of by individual beams. The more
 we can reduce the size of the holes without making the ruling
 too faint, the more diffuse will the image of the diatom
 become, and the farther out will the ruling extend ; until at
 the limit it would extend over the whole <U+FB01>eld of view and be
peafectlz/ uniform everywhere *.
      It is instructive to make this experiment with a specimen of
 Actinocyclus Ralflrii, selecting one which is blue when seen
through a small aperture. Here we found the diffracted
 light to be red, see § 39. This red light cooperating with
 some red out of the dioptric light produces a ruling which if
  seen alone would consist of alternate red and dark bands.
 .But there is an excess of dioptric light beyond what is
 employed in contributing to form this ruling, and this excess
 throws a wash of blue light over everything. Where it falls
 on the red it turns it white, where it falls on the dark parts
it turns them blue. Accordingly what is seen is a ruling
 of bands which are alternately white and blue. Similarly
 on other diatoms the ruling is found to consist of white and
coloured bands instead of merely light and dark. The colour
 which takes the place of the dark bands is in each case what
ever colour the diatom, or the part of the diatom, presents
 when seen through a very small aperture.
     * What has happened may be clearly apprehended from the following
 considerations:—If instead of three individual beams with puncta at a, b, c
to produce a ruling, we suppose two such sets as in the <U+FB01>gure, and all under
such circumstances that they can interfere, then a and a’ produce a. coarse
ruling with its luminous bands and dark
intervals lying vertically. Rulings in exactly
the same position are produced by b and 6’,               “@a’

     43. In our study of microscopic vision no consideration
 has been given to the consequences of imperfections in the
 mounting of the instrument, or in the objectives and eye
 pieces. To have entered on these branches of the subject
 would have been to open new ground, and ground which has
 been rendered of less importance by the extraordinary per
 fection both in the stand and in the objectives which may be
 secured by a careful selection from among the best that are
 available. It is truly astonishing with what accuracy the
 chromatic, and especially the even more important spherical
 aberrations have been successfully corrected in some speci
 mens from among the best objectives on sale. Objectives
 are not unfrcquently to be had which, when the draw-tube
 is adjusted with suf<U+FB01>cient care, will bear an eyepiece mag
 nifying 40 times without observable defect.
     However great their degree of perfection, it may be
 carried one step further by a skilful use of monochromatic
 light; whereby adjustments can be made by the observer
 with a completeness which with light of mixed wave-lengths
 is unattainable. This is indicated by theory, and abundantly
 con<U+FB01>rmed in practice.
     In whatever branch of microscopic work the observer may
be occupied he will <U+FB01>nd it of advantage to train himself both
in the intelligent manipulation of his instrument and in the
interpretation of results, by making a large body of experi
ments such as those of which a few selected examples have
been described in the foregoing pages; being careful at every
step to understand the reason for everything he does, and to
<U+FB01>nd out the cause of every efect he perceives. To enable him
to do this has been the object of the present memoir.

Studies in Chemical Dynamics. By J. H. VAN ’1‘ HOFF. Revised
   and enlarged by DR. ERNST COHEN, translated by THOMAS
   EWAN, M.Sc., Ph.D. Amsterdam: Frederick Muller and 00.;

THE present translation of Professor van ’t Hoff’s work Will
    ' come as a surprise to many English chemists, who are not
aware of the magnitude and importance of his researches on some
fundamental problems of chemical dynamics. In Britain there are
but few workers in the same <U+FB01>eld, and, as the translator tells us,
scarcely any text-book in our language deals with the subject. The
reason is, we believe, not far to seek; it is, however, a most
lamentable one.

   In this count1y it is at present one of the disadvantages of any
science which has important industrial applications, that the treat
ment of it in the universities proceeds upon lines which are more
appropriate to the technical schools. In the course of a few years
the technical schools may a<U+FB01>ord a partial relief to the universities ;
but we cannot help thinking that the necessity of adapting their
lectures to the student of technology will always tend in some
measure to draw the attention of the university teachers away
from the development of the theory of their subject. Professor
FitzGerald has, on more than one occasion, claimed for the
university teacher increased opportunity for “ useless ” research,
that is, for investigations of a theoretical character without any
visible practical applications. This claim is worthy of most serious
consideration at the present time. While the future of our higher
technical schools is trembling in the balance, could not a division
of labour be e<U+FB01>ected which would relieve the university of some of
the teaching at present assigned to it ‘?
   In the work at present before us Professor van ’t Hoff does not
tell us anything new concerning the nature of molecules ; he pos
tulates the existence of reacting molecules just as in ordinary
dynamics force and matter are accepted as facts. But, by assuming
that the rate of decomposition of the substances involved in any
reaction is proportional to the concentrations of these substances,
he shows how a knowledge of the degree of complexity of the
reaction (as measured by the number of different kinds of molecules
taking part in it) can be obtained. The assumption is justi<U+FB01>ed by
experiment in a few cases ; in many reactions, however, disturbing
in<U+FB02>uences cause a departure from this simple law. The author
was therefore led to investigate the nature and magnitude of the
more obvious forms of disturbance, such as the action of the
medium in the case of liquids and 0f the walls of the containing
vessel in gaseous reactions. The in<U+FB02>uence of temperature on
chemical change is next discussed, and is naturally followed by an
inquiry into the conditions of chemical equilibrium, with special
reference to the relations between temperature and equilibrium.
The volume concludes with a chapter on af<U+FB01>nity.
   The subject is one Which a<U+FB01>ords much scope for research, and
we hope that the appearance of this translation will serve to direct
attention to it. Both the reviser and the translator have per
formed their duties with care, while the printing of the volume is
a good example of what Holland can produce—very different from
some of the specimens of English and typography which occasionally
reach us from that country. J. L. H.

  GENTLEMEN,
      LLOW me to avail myself of your Magazine to make some re
         marks about the Memoirs of Messrs. Oumo<U+FB01> and Samoilo<U+FB01>
  (Phil. Mag. October), and of Messrs. J. J. Thomson and Ruther
  ford (Pl.il. Mag. November).
     The experiments of Messrs. Oumoff and Samoi'loi’f do not, in
  my opinion, resemble very closely those of my own experiments on
  electrical shadows to which they refer, but they have rather much
  likeness with those, concerning the production of Rontgen’s shadows
  with the electrical method, which I published in two Notes on the
  1st of March (Rend'iconti della R. Accad. dei Lincei). They have
  therefore the same analogy with those afterwards published by
  Prof. Silvanus P. Thompson (Phil. Mag. August). No doubt that
  Messrs. Oumo<U+FB01> and Samoi'loff had no knowledge of the previous
  publications above mentioned.                       .
     As to the Memoir of Messrs. Thomson and Rutherford, I beg
  to observe that the fact proved at pages 395 and 396 (viz. that
  a thinner layer of air may o<U+FB01>er a greater resistance than a
  thicker one) has already been described by myself in a Note on
  the 3rd of May (Rand. della R. Accud. dei Lincei).                  In that
  Note I recalled also some experiments I had formerly made, which
  proved that an analogous phenomenon may be produced by ultra
  violet rays, and also without the action of any radiation at all.
     In the complete Memoir read before the R. Academy of Bologna
  on the 3lst May (“On the Propagation of Electricity through
  Gases traversed by Rontgen’s rays ”), I have described with more
  particulars all these phenomena, and also others that I obtained
  with Rontgen’s rays.

      VOLUME MEASUREMENT OF AN AIR THERMOMETER BULB.
                           BY WALTER G. CADY.
    In all constant volume air thermometry Where high tempera
  tures are involved, it is frequently necessary to determine the
  volume of the glass bulb used ; such a bulb softens at a low red

                Intelligence and .Mv'scellaneous Articles.        531
heat suf<U+FB01>ciently to have its volume considerably altered by any
difference between the atmospheric pressure and that within the
 bulb. Thus it is important to know at the end of an experi
ment to what extent, if any, the volume of the bulb may have
changed, as any such change must be taken into account in
calculating the temperature.                                 ,
    The usual method of volumetry by weighing with water is long
and arduous, involving as it does the taking apart of the apparatus.
Below is given a simple and suf<U+FB01>ciently accurate method of
calculating the volume at any time without disconnecting the bulb.
In addition to the usual apparatus it is only necessary that the
 manometer tube in which the air is con<U+FB01>ned be graduated for 9 or
 10 centim. from the top, so that the volume of air in the tube
may be computed.
    In the <U+FB01>gure, B is the bulb, PP
a. capillary connecting tube, T the
graduated manometer tube, the gra
duated portion of which is about
1 centim. in diameter, connected in
the customary manner by <U+FB02>exible
rubber tubing with a reservoir.
The scale in question is shown at
T and is graduated in 0'1 centim.
beginning with the <U+FB01>ducial mark.
    Assuming the whole apparatus to
be at constant temperature during
the operation, the required volume
V is easily found as
                     v —P,v,
             V: P,Pz—P
                      l    2
 when 1'2 and v, are volume excesses measured by means of the
 scale on '1‘, corresponding to pressures P2 and P1 respectively.
    It will be observed that V is not the volume of the bulb alone.
 Still, since the bulb is the only variable factor, the above formula
 indicates what change it may undergo.
    The following is an example of a number of observations
 leading to the volume of a glass bulb used; in each case the
<U+FB01>rst reading is combined wilh the third, the second with the
fourth, in <U+FB01>nding the values of P2v2—P1vl and Pl—Pz.                 '

    The method is equally serviceable when a long capillary of
irregular and appreciable volume joins the bulb with the mano
meter, a condition sometimes unavoidable in practice; the volume
 of the capillary may then be separately found by temporarily
 plugging up its detached end—American Journal of Science, (4)

   ON THE INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE ON THE REFRACTION OF
                   LIGHT BY METALS.     BY C. PULFRICH.
    About <U+FB01>ve years ago I published a research in the Annalen ’3, in
 which the in<U+FB02>uence of temperature on the refraction and dispersion
 of several transparent solids (glasses &c.) was the subject of an
 extended experimental investigation. In this research, I was
 able to sh0w by a series of arguments, that the (positive and
 negative) variations of the refractive indices observed in those
 bodies could       be regarded as the result of     the combined (or
 opposed) action of two causes, change of density and change of
 absorption.
     This explanation would not at that time apply to the metals
 For the enormous increase in the refractive indices with tem—
 perature (about 00037 for 1° C.) found by Kundt T, could only be
  ascribed to a great change in the absorptive power of the metals.
  Observations have, however, so far revealed nothing of such a.
 change in the absorption of metals. They show rather that the
  metals have only a small variation of absorption. It is in agree—
 ment with this that the dispersion of metals experiences almost no
  alteration with the temperature.
     The contradiction arising out of this is solved since P<U+FB02>iiger i, in
  a research which has lately appeared, has proved that the value
  given above for the variation in the refractive indices of the
  metals must be ascribed to a source of error neglected in the
  apparatus used by Kundt, and that, as shown by his own measure
  ments made with Kundt’s apparatus and the same form of
  experiment, both the refractive index and also the dispersion of the
  metals undergo n0 demonstrable changes with temperature.
     The behaviour of the metals can therefore no longer be looked
 upon as in disaccord with the explanation I have given—Wiede

 THE JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY.
      The publication, in the English language, of aJournal of
 Physical Chemistry will begin in October of this year.          This
 journal is to be issued upon the first of every month—except
 in July, August and September when no numbers will appear.
 It will contain articles embodying original research in all
 branches of Experimental and Theoretical Physical Chemistry ;
 and this matter will be supplemented by thorough and prompt
 reviews of the current literature of the subject, i. e., of all jour—
 nal articles and books which bear upon any phase of it.         The
 new publication will accordingly present a continuous and
complete account of all work done in the field in question
after June, 1896.
      The subscription price will be the nominal sum of two
dollars and one-half (in England ten shillings, in Germany
ten marks) per volume, i. e. per year, the first volume running
to the close of 1897 and comprising twelve numbers. All com
munications concerning either articles or subscriptions should
be addressed to
      The Journal of Physical Chemistry, Ithaca, N. Y., U. S. A.
