 I.   Observations   on  Animal Eleclricity, and particularly that
            called Spontaneous.         By J. J. Hemmer. *.
¦Uni    NDER     Animal Electricity         I   understand   that kind ob
 served in animals, from whatever cause              it may arise. When
 this electricity is excited in animals, neither by the peculiar
 movement of their own bodies, nor by friction, or the appli
 cation of any other body, it is called Spontaneous Animal
 Electricity.    We are taught by many instances, both an
 cient and modern, that men, as well as other animals, have
 exhibited evident signs of electricity ; although the ancients,
 who mention        these instances,       did not know to what the
 phenomenon was to be ascribed.                It  may not be improper,
 therefore, to quote here some        of  the most remarkable        of them.
     I. We   are told by   Virgil, that     the hair   of Ascanius emitted
•a harmless    kind of flame     t-

      II. We         are insormed      by Dionyfius and other writers, that
fire     streamed            forth from the hair of Servius Tullius, the
Roman king, during sleep, when he was about seven years
of age *.
      III.       Piiny alfo speaks of light often shining around the
heads           of men : — Hominum quoque capita vejpertinis horis
flelles magno prœsagio cirtumful gent .                       \
     IV. We are told of a Carmelite monk, who was always
 attended with this phenomenon, that, as oft as he stroked
his hair backwards, it emitted sparks J.
   V. A woman at Caumont exhibited a phenomenon of the
like kind, as her hair, when combed in the dark, always
emitted fire§.
      VI.       Father       J. Faber speaks of a young woman from whose
head sparks             of   fire always sell when she combed her hair                             ||.
      VII.       Franciscus Guidus
                         produced bright flames from his
body when he rubbed his arm with his hand as he lay in
beds.
    VIII.          Ezekiel de Castro**,
                                  phyfician of Verona, relates
                                                      a
the following circumstance respecting Casfandra Buri,     lady                                 a
of the fame place  — As often as she touched her body, even
                                  :
in ssight manner, with
    a                        linen cloth,    emitted sparks in
                                                a                    it
great abundance, which could be perceived                                     by   every perfon
standing near her, and which were attended                                  with       a   confider
able noise.             Her maids
                        were often deceived    this pheno                         by
menon,            and that they had, through carelessness,
                           believed
dropped fome coals between the meets, as she always caused
her bed to be warmed in winter, at which time the sparks
were most abundant and strongest.
      IX. Anthony Cianfi,                      a  bookseller at Pifa, when he pulled
oss    a   narrow shirt, and              a    piece of cloth which he wore on his
breast, emitted              sparks from his back and arms, with                           a   crack

have warmed themselves                            at a stove,   and then pull off their
shirt in a cold bed-chamber,                              or move or shake it after it is

  XI. Bartholinus fays, that a rope-dancer at Turin,                                                      ac
cording             to the          testimony of a respectable man, Cassiano a
Puteo, emitted                  a    like phenomenon of light from his body J.
      XII.         The      fame author fays,                 that sparks proceed from the
skins of cats, and particularly from the back ; which can be
clearly perceived by stroking the hair backwards even with
the least pressure, and especially after they have been warmed
at the fire           §.
      XIII.
        Scaliger speaks of a white Calabrian horse,                                                 which,
when combed in the dark, emitted sparks of sire                                             ||.
      XIV.          Ezekiel          de Castro fays            %    of another          horse          of the
same kind, that real sparks were observed when his neck was
stroked upwards                     with     the hand or        a    currycomb.
  XV. Simpson treats of the light emitted                                          by   the bodies         of
animals when rubbed   and quotes instances ;                                       of   such pheno
mena on combing                        the     hair of      a   woman,         currying            a   horse,
and stroking               a   cat     with    the hand        **.
      XVI. The       following circumstance respecting himself was
told       by   Vaudania to the celebrated Beccaria: — " For ten or
twelve days past, since the cold set in,                                I   wear, between two
shirts,         a   piece      of    beaver's skin.            Always when          I        pull off my
upper shirt at night,                   I      observe      that   it   adheres,        in        some de
gree,       to the piece               of skin;          and when      I   draw my shirt from
it,
  I        see sparks          which have           a     striking resemblance                  to those of
electricity.               Scarcely do         I    begin to pull oft' the piece                    of skin

the under- fliirt.   On talcing it out I observe, when I hold it-
in the right hand, that the frill of my fliirt moves up from
my body towards it.       If I remove the piece of skin to a;
greater distance,          and draw        it from   the    frill,, the latter       moves
again towards my body.    If I bring the piece of skin nearer,
the fliirt moves again towards it. This oscillation of my
fliirt between my body and the piece of skin continues al
ternately, till it is gradually lessened, and at length ceases."
   XVII. About twelve years ago the following circumstance'
was communicated             to our Academy,                in writing, from Ber-
digheim — On  :         the 12th     of February          a young woman having
put on an aired shift, which was exceedingly narrow and fat
very close to her body, heard, on laying hold of     crack                 it,   a
ling    noise      like what oftimes proceeds                from the flame           of   a
candle,       and    observed      sparks      to issue    from all those places
which flie touched with her hands.                        Being astonished at this
phenomenon, she called to another girl, who slept in the
next apartment, to come to her assistance, as her shift, which
she     inmean time pulled off, was on sire. They both
             the
now shook the shift in order to extinguish the sparks; but
the more they moved                  it,
                         the effects were stronger  on ex                        :
amining the shift, however, no                     traces   of   sire   could be disco
vered.  The first maid then put                    on another shift,         which      she
took from her box; but as soon                     as (he   touched        it,   the fame
crackling noise and appearance of sparks took place.    She
then put on her dirtv smock, which she had before pulled off,
and returned to bed, on which the phenomenon disappeared.
Some persons to whom the circumstance was afterwards re
lated, were desirous to know whether the fame phenomena
would again appear       the maid put on another clean fliift.
                                if
She did       so   the following night  and as often as the smock
                                               ;
was touched           by her or any other person,   crackling noisea
was heard, and sparks were emitted every time the finger
was brought near it. The spectators now desired her to put
on another clean smock, which belonged to another maid                                     :
on approaching the hand      like noise was heard, and the
                                           a
appearance of fire was, observed; but no sparks issued from
her body, even though touched, when she had the shift on.
                                                                                        An

                 Observations   on Animal Electricity.                5'
An experiment was then made to try whether the fame phe
nomena would occur if another woman put on the girl's
shift ; but nothing of the kind was observed either by the
person     who  had"  put it on, or by those who touched it ; but
the phenomena were repeated when it touched the maid
on whom they had been first observed.           Every time after this.
period that the fame person put on a clean smock, the same
effects were produced ; but they disappeared           after   the shift
had     been   worn   some    days.   On the ist of February the
whole phenomenon          ceased,   and  after  that time never re
turned.
    XVIII. M.      Flad junior, member of our Society, having
 been in a consumptive state about eight years ago,            observed,
 for  a  long time, as often as he pulled off or drew on his
 stockings, that sparks proceeded from his feet in abundance.
 Having afterwards      recovered   his strength   in  some measure,
 the sparks disappeared;      but they returned when his strength
 again began to decrease, and continued* till his disorder put
 an end to his existence.
     XIX. As      often  as  M. Hertel, chaplain to the Elector,
 draws his hand over his breast,        which is   covered    with hair,
 abundance of sparks are seen in the dark.
     XX. I was told by Count von Kagenek, that it often
  happened to him, that when he drew a silk handkerchief
  between his fingers, while standing near a stove,          long lumi
  nous stripes were here and there observed.
     XXI. I was told also by a lady named Von Fraise, that very
  often, when stie rubbed her hands or arms even weakly with
  a linen cloth,   lying in bed, abundance of       sparks issued from
  them.
     XXII. M.      Von Schlemmer, of Deux-Ponts, relates of a
  lady named     Von Koch, that stie often observes, when she
  gets  up early, that a ribbon, with which she binds up her
  hair during the night, adheres to her fingers when she pulls
  it off, and moves with velocity towards other neighbouring
  bodies.     Having, by my desire, applied to the ribbon a piece
  of sealing wax, which had been rubbed, it was always re
   pelled by it.
      XXIII; lam       acquainted-   with another lady,      whose hair,
                                                                    when

when combed in the dark, always has a luminous appear
ance, as I have sometimes observed myself.
  XXIV. I have a white horse, from the body of which,
particularly in the winter-time, the comb brings forth abun
dance     of   sparks.     I   have likewise a white dog, from the back
of which, when I draw my hand over           in    warm room, it,        a
from the tail to the head, sparks issue with    snapping noise,     a
and which seem      troublesome to the animal, that he en
                          so
deavours       to run away.         I      have sometimes           charged        ajar with
them.
     XXV.   I    have     often produced             the    fame     phenomenon on
an afli-grey,       strong,    lively cat.
     XXVI. We            are acquainted with three kinds                  offish which,
when touched, give             a    shock almost          like that occasioned              by   a
charged jar, viz. the cramp-ray, Raia torpedo I,.; the elec
trical eel, Gymnotus electricus L. and the Silurus eleSlricus L.
                                                 ;
The more modern philosophers                         have convinced themselves,
 byrepeated experiments, that the effects of the shock                                    given
by these animals are of an electric nature, though to                                 me      it
appears probable that they depend, in part, on another                                cause.
  The animal electricity which      have announced inI                                    these
numerous instances             is   of    the coarser kind, and may be easily
observed       by   every one      ;     but there    another kind, of more

    but very little fuel. This they made      digging    round   by                a
    hole in the ground, about twenty inches wide, and full three
    feet deep   cutting an opening in the front, sloping down to

    small opening of about four inches                      by

    up like   cup.

of the body of the still, or jar, exposed to the flame, when
the fire came to be lighted ; and its bottom, not reaching to
within two feet of where the fuel was, left a capacious hollow
between them, whence the wood, that was short and dry,
when lighted, being mostly converted into flame, and cir
culating on so great a surface of the still, gave a much
stronger    heat than        could   else    have   produced from so
                                                     been
very little fuel : a       consideration well worth the attention of a
manufacturer, in our country more especially, where siring
is so dear.   There indeed, and particularly as coal is used, it
would be better, no doubt, to have a grate ; and that the air
should enter from below.      As to the benefit resulting from
the body of the still being of earthen-ware, I am not quite
so clear in it. Yet, as lighter substances are well known to
"transmit heat more gradually and slowly than the more solid,
 such as metals, may not earthen vessels, on this account, be
less apt to burn their contents,             so as to communicate an       em-'
pyreumatic taste and smell to the liquor that is distilled, so
often, and so justly complained of with us? At any rate,
in this country, where pots are made so cheap, I should
think them greatly preferable, as at least much less expensive
than those which      the gentlemen engaged in this manufac
ture most      commonly employ : though of this they are best
able to judge.
  Having thus made their furnace,                    and placed the body of
the still in   it,   as above described,           they then luted on, with
moistened    clay, to its neck, at the opening, what they here
call an adkur forming with

rise through, and the under-part                 of the alembick.     The adkur
was made    with two earthen pans, having round holes in
their middles of about four inches diameter and, their bot   j
toms being turned opposite the one to the other, they were
cemented together with clay; forming       neck of junction
                                                         a
thus of about three inches, with the small rising on the
upper pan. The lowermost of these was more sliallow, an -
about eleven inches wide,            so
                             as to cover exactly the opening
at the neck of the jar, to which  they luted    on with clay.    it
The upper and opposite of these was about four inches deep,

in              rising, as is already said, from the inner fide

of the neck, of about half an inch high, by which a gutter
was formed to collect, the condensed spirit as it fell down;
and                         hole in the pan to let it run off
          from this there was            a
by ; to which hole they occasionally luted on a small hollow
bamboo, of about two feet and a half in length, to convey it
to the receiver below.               The     upper pan had also another hole
in-   it,   of about                      quarter of its cir
                             an inch square,        at near     a
cumference from the one below just spoken of, that served to
let off the water employed in cooling; as shall be mentioned
presently.

arm that is fixed to the pump                              ;   while this, being somewhat
heavier,     immediately sinks again, which carries                            up the pis
ton, while the cylinder is again filled ; and thus, by alter
nately cooling and filling                    it,
                                the machine kept in motion
                                                      is                                                  ;
the power exerted in raising the pump-arm being always in
proportion to the diameter of the cylinder, or to the surface
of the    piston,       which      is    exactly fitted to                  it,   and on which the
pressure acts.
   The contrivance, too, of having the under part of the
alembic, where the condensed vapour         collected, or upper            is
part of what they call the adkur, of earthen-ware, of      great                                    so
a thickness, and of course at   great   distance  from the
                                                      so    heat     a
in the body of the still,   well imagined to keep the spirits
                                         is
the coolest possible, when collected, and running off.
  By thus cooling and condensing the vapour, likewise,                                                    so
suddenly as    rises, there
                   it          in             is,
                                    great measure,     constanta                              a
vacuum made, or               as   much          as possible can be               ;    but, that both
steam rises        faster,      and that water boils with much less heat
when the pressure             is   taken away from its surface,                          is   an axiom
in chemistry            too   well known                       to need          any illustration;        it
boiling     in vacuum when the heat                                 isonly ninety or ninety-
five   by   Farenheit's thermometer                            ;   whereas in the open air,
under the pressure of the atmosphere,                                 it    requires no less than
that of two hundred and twelve, ere                                  it    can be brought to the
boiling point.
 I   must further observe, that the superior excellence of con
densing the vapour      effectually and speedily in the alembic
                                   so
to our method            of doing        it      in   a    worm and cooler,                   is    greatly
on the fide of the former;                       both from the reasons                     I      have   al
ready adduced,            and      because            of the          small       stream      of vapour
that can be only forced into the worm, where                                        it   is   condensed
gradually     as   it   descends        ;   but, above all, from the nature                              of
vapour itself, with respect to the heat contained in   which                                  it,
oflate has been proved,                     by
                             the very ingenious Doctor Black,
to be greater           by
                     far than, before his discoveries, was ima

it contains ; and all fluids, as he has clearly demonstrated,
on their becoming such, absorb a certain quantity of heat,
•which    becomes      what he very properlv calls latent heat         ;   it
being heat not appearing either to the senses or to (he ther
mometer while they remain in that liquid state, but showing
itself immediately by its effects on whatever is near it; upon
their changing their form from fluid to solid, as on water
becoming ice, or metals fixing, and the like.                In   the solu
tion of                                   of heat, as we daily
          salts, also, there is an absorption
experience   in the cooling of  our liquors by dissolving salt
petre in water; and this he has found to be the cafe with
water itself, and other fluids, when pasting into a slate of
vapour by boiling.    From the most accurate and judicious
experiments,  indeed, he infers, and with the greatest appear
ance of truth, that ihe heat thus concealed in vapour raised
by boiling, from any given bulk of water, would be fully
          if collected in a piece of iron of the like size, to
sufficient,
make it perfectly red hot. What then must be the effect of
so much heat communicated in our way of distilling to the
worm, and to the water in the tub, v.              ill

                                a
than we might have done with respect to cooling at least,
both in the making of spirits, and in other distillations of the
like kind, where similar mode

                                  adopted.
    The poor ignorant Indian, indeed, while he with wonder
surveys the vast apparatus of European distillers, in their
 immense large stills, worms, tubs, and expensive furnaces,
 and finds that spirits thus made             by
                                     them are more valued,
 and fell much-dearer than his own, may very naturally con
 clude, and will have his competitors join with him in opi

 and                  manner of distilling with all those inge
         more judicious

 emulate: but    this,

that we have been in use to               employ, for the raising of spirits,

perience will      so

seems founded, indeed,               with regard to their way
                                      especially
of cooling, are      striking and just, that in many other di

 my own particular opinion of the flavour and quality of the

 this country, I may be entirely silent ; the rules and reason

prove our understanding, being what              of themselves can  never
 be depended       upon till confirmed by facts and experiments;
where many things often turn out very different from what,
from our best and most plausible arguments, we had the
greatest reason to expect.            Or, if it mould be found to be
really true, what I have often heard asserted, by those how
ever who had it only from others, but not of their own par
ticular knowledge, that, in distilling their oil of roses at the
places     where they make it the best, they use also with their
roses, sandal wood, and some other aromatics, no roses what
soever, it is plain, could ever of themselves be made to afford
a like    oil, nor without     such an addition as they employ.        A
circumstance, by the bye, that might possibly easily be cer
tified by some one of the many ingenious correspondents of
the Society who may happen to reside where it is made; and
a knowledge      of the    real truth  of it would certainly  be of use.

(mailer hairs     ; after  which they are washed in running water,
and rinsed with care.          After remaining a night in the water,
they are dried in the open air. Thirty parts of these (kins
are then placed in two quintals of bran, (each part consists
of six skins, and the quintal is 150 pounds.) They are suf
fered to continue in this sta'.e,      turning them every day, till,
they have acquired a great degree of pliability. They are af
terwards washed again in running water, and trod upon with
the feet ; then thrown into a second bath made with white
figs, about a quintal and a quarter of which are employed
for thirty parts of skins.         The figs render the water sapona
 ceous.     They    are left in this bath four or five days,    during
 which they are often turned ; and, while immersed in the
 water, they are for three days besprinkled with finely pounded
 rock-salt.      The water is then drained off, and, being again
 besprinkled with salt, they are placed in a heap in a flat ves
 sel, where they imbibe the salt completely.           The water they
 contain is wrung out by twisting them ; and they then be
 come exceedingly pliable, and fit for receiving the colour.
      If destined to be red, half a pound of cochineal and three
  ounces of alum are employed for ten parts of skins. They
  are then put into pits, where tan-beds are formed of about
  fifty pounds for each skin; which is turned in such a man
  ner that the grain is inside, and that the skin may be filled
  with the tanning water. At the end of eight days they are
  turned inside out, and are still filled with the tanning water,
  in which they are left for six days ; care being taken to stir
  them.      They    are then rinsed in running water; scraped     with
  an iron      instrument    ; cut up along the belly    ; and softened
  with a little oil. They are dried in the sun, and then cooled
  in the shade : after which they are gently besprinkled with
  water, and the edges are paired off with three different in
   struments of iron. When the red is too dark, a decoction of
   a plant called raszoul al acbb'i, a kind of annual mesembrian-
   tbemunt, is employed to weaken it.             This liquid is applied
   warm, by pouring a spoonful over each skin.

   pared as for the red, but not salted till they are put into the
   fig-bath   j  and for five dozen    of skins, twenty-five pounds of

   Dr. Monro'a report was iti the following words — ob                         :   I
served, along with Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Gordon, (two
other gentlemen of the committee,) and two gardeners who
were present,      that such caterpillars as were wetted      the                    by
liquor Mr. Henderson employs,          were killed in   very few         a
minutes, and the experiment has been repeated      my own                  by
gardener with the fame effect.   have likewise found, that

it kills  kind of green fly, which
          a                            very hurtful to the

leaves    of plum-trees          and         other fruit-trees.      It        has       been
very generally known, that the smoke and the juice of to
bacco were pernicious to different kinds of insects and
worms   but
         ;      has not,
                  it      far as  know, been employed in

Mr. Henderson's manner; and as this has the advantage of
not hurting the leaves, nor the fruit, consider      I              it   as an useful
and  material improvement, well entitled to                           a        moderate

I     HAVE        no doubt that          a great    number of different causes
may have contributed, each its part, more or less, to pro
duce those effects which are the object of the present re
search.  Some of them are only accidental, and have taken
place in different countries at very different periods, while
in others       of them have not taken place at all. Among
              some
these are the draining of lakes and morasses, the extirpating
of forests, and the cultivation of land. All these circum
stances, no doubt, render the temperature of climate milder.
I found, however, one cause, of a kind altogether different,
which appears to me general and uniform in producing the
above changes.    After what I have before said, and in an
other place*, it may be readily conjectured that I here speak
of    an   union     of    the    two distinct principles,                 moisture        thd
heat.      Their mutual          disengagement,         and the increase              of   the
one above the other, afford,                 if I   am not mistaken,               a key to-
a true theory       of    the earth.
     All   the ancient writers who              speak   of    the countries           of Eu
rope   beyond the latitude of 500 north, represent them as
filled with lakes and morasses, and covered with immense
forests, almost as America                is at present.           It is   a   certain fact,
that the climate of North America                       is different from that of
Europe by about ten degrees of longitude ; that  the dis                        is,
tricts of North America lying under 400 of north latitude
are as cold and moist as the countries                        of Europe which lie
in the latitude of 500.  New England lies between the 41st
and 46th degrees of latitude; yet      observed that the cli
                                                    it
                                                    is

  the    districts of England between the latitude of 50 and 56.
   It  is well known that the people of America are more and
   more extirpating the forests, draining the marshes, and cul
   tivating the land ; and that the climate there is found to be
   come perceptibly milder.          For a thousand or two thousand
  years past the people in all the northern parts of Europe
  have    been    in the fame manner employed in the improve
  ment of the foil.        These causes, however accidental thev
  may be, and however much dependant on human industry,
  must certainly have contributed their part to render the cli
  mate milder, not only in the countries where they took place,
  but even in the neighbouring           countries, exposed to the ef
  fects of their atmosphere.
      It is almost needless to observe,       that the great number of
  lakes and morasses,      which, according        to the accounts of an
  cient authors, existed in their time in the southern parts of
  Europe, must have rendered the air of these countries ex
 ceedingly cold and moist as well as unhealthful, since it les
 sened its elasticity, and rilled       it with thick vapours; which
 corresponds       with the description they have given us of them.
 The countries of Europe         have not for a long time been seen
 covered in that manner with lakes and                morasses,  if  we ex
 cept Sweden and Norway; though the places where such
 marshes formerly existed, both in England and on the Con
 tinent,     in Gaul,    Germany,       and    the   European    Sarmatia,
 may be still clearly observed.            It is certain that Jiuniau in
dustry, in the course of ages, has in part contributed to pro
 duce this change, as a great many epochs are known when
the draining of lakes and morasses was undertaken ; but I
 have no doubt that gradual sinking             of  the surface of  the sea,
which occasions        a natural and gradual efflux, that could be
 produced only by these means, may have contributed its
 part also.      But, from whatever cause these changes may have
 proceeded, it is certain that they have contributed to lessen
 the moisture      and cold   of all the countries of Europe.
      We know that in          the time of Julius Cæsar, and           even
 long after, almost all Germany and Sarmatia were covered
with     immense forests.       The Hercynean forest was sixty days
journey in length.         It  began    in Belgic Gaul near         the sea,
                                      D  2                              and

ao             On tie Changes of Temperature and Soil
and extended         through Germany and Poland.               England was
proportionally        less  abundant in forests.           Now it     may     be
readily comprehended what extraordinary cold, what moist
and unheallhful air must have prevailed in the climate of
these extensive        countries,    as all   the mountains        and   plains
were covered with such            immense      woods, and     as each     valley
almost, contained a lake or a marsh                ;   and  what wonderful
changes      in   the temperature       of these lands must have been
effected     by the     extirpation of these extensive forests, and by
draining off the stagnant waters. Large woods prevent the
beams of the fun from penetrating to, and warming the foil j
they impede also the free diffusion of the internal heat, as
the fallen leaves and branches which rot on the ground form
a moist crust through which the internal and external heat
can with        difficulty force a passage. In the last place, they
 concentrate the cold and moist vapours, render them putrid,
 and corrupt the whole atmosphere.                     This has been always
observed     in North America,          as   we are assured      by  Dr.   Wil
liamson    ;   and the consequences          are bilious and intermittent
 fevers  in summer and autumn, and inflammatory fevers in
 winter.      He asserts, that the opener and drier the land be
 comes,   the more it is remarked            that    these fatal  diseases    de
 crease.     This    must    have   been    the cafe formerly in Europe
 under the like       circumstances,     and    the like causes must have
 contributed to render its climate milder and more salubrious.
     The Celts and Sarniatians, who were the first inhabitants
 of all the European countries lying to the north                 of Italy and
 Greece, like all the        barbarous    nations      under different names
 which descended from them, and which over-ran the Roman
 empire in the fifth and sixth centuries, despised agriculture,
 and cultivated no more land than was sufficient to supply the
 wants of the current year. They lived 'chiefly cither on what
 they caught in hunting, or the flesh of their domestic ani
 mals, of which they reared a great many; as they considered,
  though very unjustly, these employments as much nobler
  than the cultivation of land.           Now it is certain that the cul
  ture of the earth, which breaks its surface, puts it in move
 ment, keeps it in a state of continual tenderness, and makes
  it capable    of imbibing     thq rays    of  the fun in summer, and          of
                                                                       affording

                which take place in different   Climates.              21
affording     a passage  to the internal heat in winter ; and by
these means        contributes to preserve a continual equilibrium
of the principle of heat in the earth and the atmosphere.
The contrary takes place in all uncultivated countries, espe
cially when they are moist, and covered with wood.
      It can no longer be doubted that the gradual draining of
the stagnant water in all Celto-Scythia and European Sar-
matia, with the extirpation of their large forests, and the ge
 neral cultivation of the fields of these countries, must have
 had an influence also on the atmosphere         of Greece    and   Italy.
 Those cutting north-winds which converted every thing into
 ice, and of which the Greeks and the Romans complain so
 much,       have,  in  a great measure,  ceased since the principal
 causes which        produced    them  no  longer exist.     As long as
  Germany,       Pannonia, Dacia, Mœfia and Thrace remained
  uncultivated and covered with immense           forests,  their atmo
  sphere     was exceedingly cold, thick and heavy, and had a
  continual influence on that of Italy and Greece, in which,
  because they were open and warm countries, the atmosphere
  was consequently       far lighter.  The   exertions    of this fluid  to
  recover its equilibrium       were  the cause of the cutting north
  winds, of which        the Greeks and the Romans complained so
  much.        But after  those centuries, when the whole       of Celto-
  Scythia      and  Sarmatia became opener and belter cultivated,
   their atmospheres must have come nearer to an equilibrium
   with that of Greece and Italy, and consequently these streams
   of air from the north must have decreased in the same pro
   portion.      This must have contributed to moderate the cli
   mate of Greece and of Italy, and to render it much milder
   than it was about 1800 or 2000 years ago; and to such a
   degree,     that, had there been no other cause, we could no
    longer wonder at, or entertain any doubt of, the effects of the
    cold which the ancients remarked in their time, and which
    are not observed at present.
        It is well known     that the winds which       traverse  the im
     mense cold regions     of the Continent are always colder and
     more penetrating than those which blow from the sea.
     America extends a great way towards the north ; and its
     remote districts, on account of the ice, snow, and continual
                                                                        fogs

 2*               On the Changes          of Temperature and Soil
 fogs which        prevail there, have never been explored, and
 therefore       remain unknown.     This immense country cer
 tainly extends nearer the north pole thatv the Continent of
 Europe and Asia, the boundaries of which are pretty well
 known.       This, without doubt, may be reckoned among the
 oaufes    which render North America much colder than Eu
 rope     under the Tame degrees of latitude, as I have already
 remarked.   Hence it happens that the immense Continent
 of America, the farther it extends towards the north, is more
 filled with lakes and marshes,                  which     must consequently add
 to the severity      of the winds that           sweep their surface.
       It will   perhaps   be said, that it appears to follow,
                                                   from my
positions, that the more the cold of winter decreases, from
the above causes, the heat of summer ought to increase in
the same proportion.    In my opinion it can be proved by
many  monuments,     historical as well as physical, that the
sum-total of the mean summer heat is greater than it was
formerly, and that it continually increases;                         though this takes
place imperceptibly,          and        can be observed             only    after periods
of   considerable      length, and by comparing the respective de
grees     of   distant epochs. On the other hand, in regard to
the degree of the intensity of that penetrating, concentrated,
and stifling heat which is experienced even in Lapland, I
must fay, that this kind of heat is lessened by all those causes
before enumerated          which        lessen   the cold      of winter.          I   by no
means ascribe contrary effects                   to the fame             cause.    We    are
taught by general experience, that the thinner, purer, and
more elastic the air            is,
                         the less, in the fame proportion,                                 is
the intensity of the summer heat   and, on the contrary, the
                                                 ;
thicker the atmosphere            is,
                           and the more      silled with stag  it   is
nant and concentrated vapours, the heat    more intense and    is
the more stifling.  For this reason     always cooler on the
                                                     it   is
summits of high mountains, while        stifling and insupport
                                                       a
able heat prevails in the neighbouring plains, especially when
they are surrounded        wood.by This      always observed
                                                           is                             in
the savannahs of America.   Dr. Williamson was convinced,
by experiments and observation, of the truth of my assertions
in regard to North America; and he remarks, that when
this     extensive    country         becomes        entirely        open,        when    its

tity of the snow, ice, and                  moisture     is  already evidently les
sened ; and many plants, which could not be cultivated there
formerly, now thrive and succeed.
    I now come to the last and principal cause of these changes,
which acts in a general and uniform manner in producing
these effects,       as  all the others are merely accidental, and de
pend      on human industry.                   I here mean to fay, that the
principle of heat, increased continually in the course of time,
so as to overcome the opposite principles of moisture and cold,
renders, by these means, the earth drier and fuller of stones,
and consequently increases                   the sum of the degree of heat.
Without this principle,                  in my opinion, we can never find
sufficient grounds for the wonderful changes which have
taken place in the nature of the foil of all those lands which
 border on the Mediterranean sea, which formed the ancient
empire of Rome from Syria to India, and which at present
 have all become uncommonly fruitful, dry and stony, as                                  I
have already remarked.                     The mere neglect of agriculture
 could never have produced these effects, and must have been
 attended rather with effects of a contrary nature *.

 I. X HE          theory of the loadstone ought to form a part of
 the theory of the earth, hecaufe the phenomena which de
pend on it belong to the whole globe ; and because Halley,
and after him other philosophers, have endeavoured to ex
plain the different phenomena of the magnet by supposing
the earth to be hollow, and that it contains in its cavity one
or more magnetic globes.
    2.   In considering         the loadstone        it ought first to be exa
mined whether, in order to explain its phenomena, we
ought, like Descartes, to suppose a dense fluid moving in a
vortex around the magnet, and entering at one of its poles
and issuing at the other; or, as M. Æpinus, a discrete fluid,
susceptible of rarefaction and condensation, which is rarefied
in    one    of  the   poles and         condensed      in the other   ; or, lastly,

  as   M.     Prevost*,        two fluids, susceptible of being combined
  with each other in such a manner that one of them alone is
  accumulated around the north pole of a magnet, while the
  other is accumulated around the south pole ; and that all the
  magnetic phenomena may be explained by the elective at
  tractions which these fluids exercise either upon each other
  or on iron      f.
      3. It must then be examined, whether the direction of the
 magnetic needle, and its inclination, depend on the situation
 of a large magnet enclosed in the bowels of the earth, as
 Halley      supposes ; or on the action             of    one  of  these two mag
 netic fluids towards one of the poles, and, perhaps, of the
 other fluid towards the opposite pole, as M. Prevost supposes.
     4.   If we     admit the hypothesis of a large magnet suspended
 within       the cavity        of the earth, stiall we suppose, as the in
 ventor of this hypothesis,                 that this magnet has four poles            ?
 Or,     shall we endeavour              to explain the whole,          as thaf great
 geometer         Euler      has    done,     by a magnet having only two
 poles    ?    Or,    lastly, shall we suppose,          as  Mr. Churchman, an
 American philosopher, has lately done, that the earth con
 tains two magnetic poles, one at the north and the other at
     * De
            I'origine des forces mngneticiues, 8. Geneve 17RS.
     f  The celebrated Coulomb admits also two fluids, which compose the
 magnetic fluid, and which exercise their action in the inverse ratio of the
 square of the distance: but, in the theory of phenomena connected with
 the action    of the globe, this philosopher sets out from certain facts imme
diately given by -observation ; one of which it would be of importance to
verify in different points of the globe.           This fact is, that the forces which
attract one of the poles of a magnetic needle freely suspended towards the
north, are equal to those which attract the opposite pole towards the south.
Coulomb concludes that this equality exists, because a needle, weighed two
different times, before and after it was magnetised, was found exactly of
the fame     weight.
    C. Borda     has found,      by observations made first at Iirest,   Cadiz, Tene-
rifte, Gorec      on   the   coast of Africa,   and  afterwards   at Brest and Guada-
loupe,    that the intensity of the force exercised by the globe on the mag
netic needle, estimated according to the number of okillaiions made by
the needle in a given time, was sensibly the same in these different places.
This     observation     in other    latitudes,  especially on approaching    the poles,
might     throw     some    light  on  the theory of natural magnetilm.      — Note of

the south,        at different distances from the poles of the earth,
which perform their revolutions in different times ; and that,
from the combined influence of these two poles, we may
conclude the annual changes of the declination with so much
precision, that we can deduce the longitude of any place from
its latitude, and from the degree of declination which the
 needle experiences          *.
      5. Thus, by supposing one or more magnets in the inte
 rior part of the earth, the annual changes of the declination
 and     inclination      may be explained by the rotary movements
 of these magnets.             But in the system, which does not admit
 these internal magnets, it is asked,                 Whether the       changes    of
 declination might not depend on movements which produce
 the change of obliquity, precession, nutation, and perhaps
 other phenomena or inequalities of that kind t.
      6. With regard to diurnal variations, an Englifli philo
 sopher, Mr. Canton, considering that it is proved by expe
 rience that heat diminishes the force of the magnet, thought
  that the solar rays, by heating the earth, must lessen the at-'
  tractive force of the grand magnet contained in it ; and he
  thence deduced,          as   will  be seen hereafter,       an explanation of
  these variations.          But   Mr. Canton         did not reflect on what
      * Heads of Lectures
                              by S. Priestley, London 17^4.
      \ Æpinus gives another explanation independent of            these movements.
  It  may be possible, according to this philosopher, that the declination of
  the magnetic needle arises, in general, from the irregular figure of the
  nucleus of the magnetic globe, or from an unequal distribution of the
  fluid in its interior part   : and to account for the variation    of this declina
  tion in one place, in the course of time we might suppose that the figure
  of the nucleus, or the distribution of the fluid it contains, is itself vari
  able.    Æpinus presumes also, that the action of the iron-mines dispersed
  throughout     the bosom of the globe, may have an influence on the varia
  tion in question ; and     my,     perhaps,   be the  sole cause  of it.  Tenlamen

      This philosopher wishes that men of science, who have an opportunity
  of being near a mine of loadstone, would determine, by observation, whe
   ther the masses of this mineral,       before they are taken f.om the bowels of
   the earth, have their poles disposed, in regard to the poles of the world,
   like th'ise r.f needles freely suspended : and whether, in certain masses, the
   poles are not in an inverse direction, of which he shews the possibility by
   means of consequent points.         Ibid. p. 333. — Note of the fame.
                                                                                 was

                                        a Theory        of the Earth.                                      27
     was clearly seen by M. Æpinus, that this magnet, if it ex
     ists, is funk to too great a depth in the earth for the action
     of            or at least the variations of that action, in
          the solar rays,
 the morning and evening, to be able to penetrate to it. We
 may, however, apply to the ferruginous minerals, dispersed
 in abundance over the surface of the earth, what Mr. Canton
 supposed,         in       regard       to the         grand magnet contained in its
 bosom; and then,                       if we admit that       these minerals exercise
 any action on the magnetic needle, we cannot deny that the
 he?t, excited by the rays of the fun, may diminish that ac
 tion.        From
               these principles it would follow, that in the
 morning,   when  the fun warms the surface of the ground situ
 ated to the east of the needle, the latter, being less strongly
 attracted towards that part, ought to decline towards the
 west ; and, for a contrary reason, it must in the evening de
 cline towards the east.   But Mr. Canton proved, by a long
 series     of   observations,               that at London, at least, this is the
 ordinary course                of   the diurnal variations.
    7. But it will be proper to examine whether this explana
 tion, even thus corrected, does not contain a paralogism ;
 and when the attractive force of all the ferruginous particles,
 dispersed over the surface                      of the earth,        to the east          of the    needle,
 is diminifliedequally and simultaneously, the needle ought
 not to remain motionless; since the diminution of the attrac
tion exercised upon the south-pole of the needle, compensates
for the diminution of that exercised upon the north-pole*.

remains at rest,            there    is an equilibrium, and the
forces a + c = b + J.     But in this supposition,                            if
the forces of the fame fide, b and c for example,                             gradually     d;minifli, the

I say  the same thing    of those situated to the west.  If this rea
soning be just, the needle ought not to vary by the action of
the solar heat, but when this heat diminishes the magnetic
force of the ferruginous parts situated to the north of the
needle, more than that of the parts situated to the south, or
reciprocally.
    To  determine    this curious question, it would be necessary
to make choice of two opposite coasts, and directed almost
east and west   from the magnetic meridian ; such as the coast
of  Provence to the south, and that of Normandy to the north ;
to establish   two compasses well suspended, such as those of
M. Coulomb, one to the south, at Antibes for example,
and the other to the north, near Cape de La Hogue; and to
fee   whether their diurnal variations did nol proceed in a con
trary direction : that is to fay, whether that at Antibes,
having the continent to the north, and only sea to the south,
would not decline, in the morning, towards the west, as that
of Mr. Canton did ; and whether that of La Hogue, having
 the continent to the south and sea to the north, would not,
 at the fame time, decline to the east.        Mr. Canton, indeed,
 who made these observations        at London, had, to the north
 of his magnetic horizon,       the greater part of England and all
 Ireland ; and thus he must have had the variation west in
 the morning and east in the evening, as he observed it ; for
 it is certain that the sea preserves the land, which it covers,
 from the action of the fun; and that thus the attraction of
 that land ought not to vary by the heat which emanates
 from that luminary.
     By carefully repeating    and   varying these observations,     in
 places chosen with discernment, we shall         be able to decide
 whether the regular diurnal variation depends upon a general
  cause, the action of which, however, is susceptible of being
  suspended or disturbed by local causes ; or whether we are to
  believe, on the contrary, as M. Van Swinden does, that the
  diurnal variation is net a cosmic phenomenon, or that it does
  not depend on a general cause inherent in the globe, and
  which every where acts according to the fame law.
     9. Is there properly any action of the magnetic fluid on
  the electric fluid ? or is there, between these two fluids, only
  a resemblance of properties, or in their manner of action ?
                          7                                      10.  Is

perfection, even in that part which depends merely on ob
servation, that it is much to be wished that observers and
observations          were    multiplied,    especially    in what concerns
 the inclination         of  the needle.      In   regard   to the declination
 and its variations,          M. Van     Swinden       has given a noble ex
 ample of correctness, and of constancy in observations, and
 in the art of classing and comparing the results.                      It would
 be of great benefit if this example were followed in different
 situations and climates.              It would     be highly interesting, for
 instance, to determine, with precision, the zones of the earth
  where the declination is nothing, and where changes take
  place, and the fame for the inclination.

  VII.     On the Effefls produced on different Kinds of Stones by the
      Vapour of the Fluor Acid. By M. Kortum of Warsaw* .
  n      .AVING          employed
  means of the fluor acid,
                                       myself in engraving on glass by
                                          and having observed that some
  pieces     of  the glafe    I used   were more susceptible of being at
  tacked by it than others,            I  resolved    to try the effects   of this
   acid on different kinds of vitreous stones.                 Conceiving that
  the figures would be corroded with more neatness, the less the
   siliceous earth contained in the stones was mixed with fo
   reign matter, I exposed a very bright piece of rock-crystal,
   from Swisserland, at a temperature of 180 Reaum. for twenty-
   four hours, to the vapour of the fluor acid ; and found, con
   trary to my expectation, that no impression was made upon
   it.     I repeated the experiment, doubling the temperature

                On the Ejseils produce      J  on different Stones
   differs  from the coloured kinds by this circumstance — that
   by exposure to heat, the former undergoes no change, while
   the greater part of the latter do. It is equally well known
  that the action of the fluor acid on glass is increased by heat.
      In order that I might begin          a series  of comparative expe
  riments in this respect,        I  exposed,    for thirty-fix hours, at a
  temperature of 40", a ruby, sapphire, leuco-sapphire, eme
  rald, Oriental garnet, amethyst, chrysolite, avanturine, gi-
  rasol, a Brasilian topaz burnt, a Saxon topaz raw, and an
  opal ; but after being taken from the apparatus, they seemed
  as little injured as the pure transparent              rock-crystal of the
  first experiment.
      The diamond, which by its combustibility shews itself to
  be a peculiar genus, did not suffer the least change after four
  days exposure to the vapour of the fluor acid j the apparatus
  being placed on a common German stove.
      Polished granite, being exposed to the vapour for three
  days on a stove as before, neither the quartz nor the mica
 seemed to have been attacked.              The feld-spar, however, at
 tracted    my attention; being opaque and muddy, and co
 vered with a white powder.               I  therefore repeated the expe
 riment     on   a   thin  fragment     of  feld-spar of a reddish colour,
 noting its weight, which           was 38 grains; and found it to be
 2\- grains lighter.       The    stone had      also become whitish and
 friable at the surface,       exactly as when in a natural          state of
 efflorescence.
     The   different   species  of flints, mixed with foreign earths,
 are more or      less fusible.     But as this difference is not exactly
in proportion to the quantity of the earths mixed with them,
the proper explanation of the phenomenon must be sought
 for in the different degrees of affinity which these kinds of
earth have for caloric.
     Figures traced out on the following stones through a co
vering of wax, after being exposed for twenty-four hours to
the vapour of the fluor acid, the apparatus being placed on
the stove, were all found to be etched : Chrysopras, Hunga
rian opal, onyx, Persian cornelian, agate, chalcedony, green
Siberian jasper, common flint.              On the chrysopras the cor
rosion was above          half  a line in depth.       In  those places the
                                                                      green

green colour of the stone had disappeared, and the cavities
were filled with a white powder.                 The strokes of the figures
were     expressed with        the greatest fineness and regularity on
the opal     ; and    the   lines, in the like manner, were filled
with     a  white powder.          The onyx exhibited               the   contours
very clearly,      and    the etching was          pretty deep      :  the powder
with which         they were       silled   was     likewise white.        On the
cornelian the figure was in part etched, and silled with white
powder ; in part there was only a white efflorescence, though
still compact and entire.            The agate and chalcedony were,
on the other hand, corroded white, but very unequally : here
and there cavities were formed, each of which was lined
with     a  white compact substance.             The green jasper was cor
roded very unequally, but almost to as great depth as the
 chrysopras. Some parts which remained compact, and which
 were only as it were effloresced,             had lost their green          colour
 and become white.
     Flint.     The    uncovered     part, of a bright brown and some
 what transparent specimen, had become totally white, but
 was nevertheless compact.               As I had covered the stone with
 wax, leaving a small spot bare, without delineating any re
 gular figure, I observed that the efflorescence had begun at
 the edge of the wax, and proceeded thence to the centre in
 such a manner that the white contour thereby produced re
 sembled       an   imperfect     figure of       a    fortification,    while   the
 inner space was only partially effloresced, and still grey, but
  interspersed here and there with white points.                        To free the
  stone from the wax,          I washed    it in spirit of wine. The white
  figure then gradually disappeared : in half a minute nothing
  of it was to be seen ; and the thin fragment seemed trans
   parent as in its native state.             When it became dry, how
   ever,   the  opaque      white figure      again made          its appearance.
   After moistening and drying it                several times        in succession
   the revival of the natural colour             and opacity became always
   more     perfect,   and    the white      efflorescence       remained visible
   when wet.         As all   these effects were         produced     by water and
   other liquids as well as by spirit of wine, as I afterwards re
   marked on other specimens, these phenomena of the flint had
   a great similarity to the change produced in the colour of the
                                                                                opal,

opal, and its becoming transparent in water.    I found means
to stop the action of the fluor acid on a cornelian and a dark
brown jasper, at that stage of the process when the stone was
still compact, and the colours only whitened. In water both
these stones recovered                      their natural colour,            and   when dry
became        again white.
     I    exposed another opaque and almost                      black piece of flint,
with            white points,
           effloresced                                    and the usual white crust,
without any covering of wax, at the usual stove-heat of about
16°, to the vapour of the fluor acid for five days in my ap
paratus.             At   the end      of that       period it had lost almost          i-8th
of its weight; for it
                    was reduced from 103 to 91 grains, and
was thoroughly white, so that the sound parts of the nucleus
had entirely the appearance of the effloresced crust.  Some
parts were friable ; and I at the fame time remarked that the
parts     of the nucleus,            already naturally effloresced, as well as the
crust, were much less acted upon than the found black parts.
     It   is found also, that               in   regard to the natural efflorescence
of flints,       the      effloresced        crust       serves   the sound nucleus as a
cover to defend             it,      and,    by   these means, retards the total de
composition of the stone.                        Some, from this crust being formed
of   seemingly            foreign materials, which                    is   sometimes   consi
dered as lime and sometimes                         as   clay, and which in common
resembles            both, have deduced                  too much, in regard to the
formation   of flints, when they explain the phenomenon
by separation and successive hardening from one of these
kinds of earth. To judge from the above experiments, this
crust      is   not properly the matrix, but                       a   result   from the de
composition of the stone itself.

was dissolved in the fame time.      Black marble suffered

of the fluor acid did not destroy the combination of the cal
careous earth and the sulphureous acid, but only abstradted
the gypsum from its water of crystallisation.
   As the zeolite, among the siliceous stones,                            contains the
greatest quantity of the water of crystallisation,                      as the      gypsum
does among the              calcareous,       I     exposed 102 grains         of   striated
zeolite at the    stove temperature.    In forty-eight hours                                I
found its surface friable, and its weight only 85^ grains con                       ;

it had increased 2'.       now weighed 88 grains, but did not
                                It
recover its splendour.    On the tin plate, to which the stone
had been fastened           with wax,       I   observed near the latter            a   white
powder, which had the appearance of something volatilised
from the stone.  poured over the frothy cake of sparry fluor
                         I
powder and sulphurous acid    little water, and, after some
                                               a
hours, found the inner fides of the apparatus of tin plate
covered with     beautiful silky substance, of the brightness of
                    a
mother-of-pearl, which was perfectly like that of the zeolite
in its natural state. But as afterwards remarked the fame

      That  I might not leave magnesian stone unexamined,            I
 txposed, for forty-eight hours, at the stove-heat, a thin plate
 of Venetian talc weighing 124 grains. After the experiment
 it weighed only    81 grains, and had therefore        decreased in
 weight    more  than  j : it had  also  fallen into a soft tender
 powder, which floated on water, and had the appearance of
 magnesia.     I  poured   water on the residuum       in the appa
 ratus, and found next day the sides incrusted with small
 crystalline glittering flakes, adhering in detached masses,
which could not be washed off with diluted nitrous acid.
Though these may have been real magnesian salt, they seem,
 however, to throw some light on the crystallisation of stones.
Bergman had before observed the siliceous crystallisation
 formed in diluted fluor acid, which had stood a long time
at rest over powder of silex.
     Among the various hypotheses respecting the formation of
granite, and stones in general, that which supposes the an
cient ocean, so much spoken of by modern geologues, to
have consisted of a fluid totally different from that of our
sea-water, and of which the latter may be only the residuum,
is not the most improbable.         In my experiments, about 50
grains of the powder of sparry fluor, mixed with as much
concentrated sulphurous acid as was equal to the space ocr
cupied by the powder, was put into a tin-plate box, and the
Utter into another of the conten of about 20 square inches ;
to the lid of which, of strong tin plate, I fastened, with wax,
the specimens to be tried, and shut the whole so as to be
air-tight.    After exposing various kinds    of stones for fourteen
days I found die inner small veslel in part corroded, and on
the exterior fides a moist, weakly-adhering salt, crystallised
in a considerable quantity, which at first I considered as a
mixture of iron and fluo-sulphat of lead, tin being seldom
worked pure, and the folder having begun to give way.               It
is, however, poflible that some tin may have been dissolved
by the two acids combined.        I dissolved some of this vitriol
in distilled water, and dropped into it some spiritous tincture
of galls. The liquor became of a beautiful indigo-blue co
lour, instead of black or purple as I expected j and a very
                                                                light;

light precipitate, of the same colour, was                                       deposited at the
bottom.   A solution of muriate of barytes        being dropped
into the blue liquor, gave a white precipitate, like regenerated
barytic spar, without changing the blue colour of the first
fight precipitate, which remained like                            a   slimy substance float
ing on the other, nor the clear liquor                        :       and  the latter, after
having stood several years, appears as deep a blue as can be pro
duced by ammonia from a solution of copper. The blue slime
was found sit for a pigment, but far inferior to Pruflian blue.
  On thi3 occasion I recollected the blue colour of lapis la
zuli, which Marggraf ascribes to iron, and in which Rin-
mann found fluor acid. This stone, after two days exposure,
femained unattacked, and its colour unchanged.              how                              If,

  According to Bergmann, siliceous earth    not soluble in                  is
pure carbonic acid gas but     observed
                                   ;    in common

cence   of    the glass       in    the above-mentioned                          places,     we may
assume this effect,           under certain modifications,                           in    regard to
the natural efflorescence                    of   stones  ;   as      it    is    not   so   much a
solution     of   the earthy bases, as              a    separation         of     the crystalline
connection.
   Though analogical conclusions from chemical results are
of little value, they have led me to the following conjecture:
As the fluor acid hitherto, at least as far as know, has never         I
yet been analysed, and as its radical     unknown,    am of       is                       I
opinion that, till something positive learned, we may admitis
that fluor acid        not essentially different from carbonic acid
                        is

                       Method of preparing Sal A'eratus.                                                 tf

equal to that prepared                    by   crystallisation.
     Note.      The     pearl-ashes            had butter be put into the                        box in
moderate-sized lumps than in powder, that the air may have
free access to it.
   But    any choose to have this salt in its most perfect form^
           if
let him proceed in this manner                            :
   Diflblve as much of the clean vegetable alkali in boiling
rain or other pure water as possible      filter the solution           ;
through paper,               pour     into
                                       it   jar of stone or earthen-ware,

cover      the vessel         in such    manner as that the air may have
                                               a
access to        it,   but    so   as to   exclude all dust or foreign matter.
Let     be hung by
       it                          a   cord      fermenting vat, or cistern, for
                                                in   a
u month or two, in which time great many crystals will be  a
formed from which the superfluous liquor may be poured
            ;
off, and the salt dried in Hippocrates' sleeve. The super
fluous liquor may be again saturated with more alkali, and
again exposed to the air in the cistern, without any loss. This
last   is,
       without doubt, the most perfect mode of preparation,
aud   Ihave sometimes     made use of        but, as      much        it;                   it   is
more troublesome                  to make than the other, and as the other,
for all medicinal purposes,                          is    perhaps equal to this,                I     have
for the most part employed it.
     This     much more tolerable to the palate, and may
               salt   is
be taken in larger doses than the naked alkali  and as                                 ;                   it
decompounded                 by    vegetable acids as well as the mineral,                              it is
may be exhibited                  instead of the alkali in perhaps every cafe
where the latter             is    proper, unless the fixed air                        is   judged im
proper.
     Itmuch superior to common alkali in forming Riverius's
          is
anti-emetic effervescing draught, as contains much larger        it                   a
proportion            of fixed air (in which                    the principal virtue              of that
medicine         issupposed to reside) than the mildest fixed                                         alkali,
and    is    at the fame time much more palatable.

the prescriber chooses, a spoonful of it may be swallowed
alone first, and as much vegetable acid immediately upon ??j
in which cafe none of the gas will be lost.
   When acidity abounds in the first passages, a little of thi»
fait added to any bitter infusion, or the dry salt added to
powder of columbo, or any peptic powder, is an effectual
antacid.
    In calculous cafes this salt is recommended by writers,
particularly by the celebrated Dr. Cullen in his Materia
Medica, Vol. II. ch. 13. as being an happy expedient for
conveying larger quantities of alkali into the stomach, than
it can bear in its natural state.
   Hitherto the common        mode   of preparing the      salt for this
purpose,     I believe, has been by impregnating a solution ot
fixed   alkali with fixed air, by means of Dr. Nooth's ma-«
Chine ; but any one who has prepared the medicine in both
ways, will readily give the most decided preference to that
above described, on account both of ease and cheapness.
    It is scarcely worth mentioning,      that, for ceconomical pur
poses,    such  as promoting     fermentation in dough for bread
or   cakes,   where pearl- ashes is commonly employed, the sal
 ae'ratus is much to be preferred, on account of the much
larger quantity of fixed air eliminated in the process.

 an account of it as observed here.
     I was looking on that evening for the Comet, which iex->
 pected to have seen between        the   Northern Crown and the
 constellation of Hercules.       This being about half past eight,
 my eye consequently was then directed westward. The Iky wa»

tension was called off from its immediate object by a most
vivid reflection of light from ihe clouds of that part of the sky;
as   if full
          day had sprung on me inliantaneously.    I immedi
ately turped  round to discover whence it proceeded, and saw
a most luminous body, apparently equal (or larger) to the full
moon when she appears greatest, but certainly very much
brighter.         Jt     was      of    an   exceedingly splendid                    gold colour,
and round, except to the west, where                                it    was   of   a strong red,
drawing off            (to   purple, and its edge                   ill   defined,        and   rather
unequal. It             was about 13 or        I5°))igh,      almost exactly
                                                                          and
jn the meridian.                   It    seemed nearly stationary; but what
little motion it had, tending to the horizon nearly at a right
angles   In about three or four seconds it disappeared, as if
finking behind               the clouds          :   I                         nor any

seen     by    many at Bury,             and was also seen atNorwich, and at
Cxoruer on the coast                     north-east of Norwich.   Thirty-five
minutes past eight was                   the time minuted of its appearance

but  Ihad not then corrected my watch      an observation of              by
she sun on the meridian, for many days preceding.      might                                It

 I   do not at present learn                     it   has been seen any where much
 westward of the line which                           these several observations                  indi
 cated.        It   seems to have been   very low  and  more ob            ;          if
 servations         could be collected and compared,   would pro                 it
 bably be found to have    very considerable parallax, and its
                                             a
 altitude and magnitude might be determined, especially                                                 if
 observations could be had east and west of this line.  But                                             it

 possible to have been not seen by any person who was out,
 if within   the limits of the sensible horizon which circum
 scribed it.    This   seems a strong       presumption that it must
 have   been   uncommonly       low   indeed.       Very few stars being
then visible, it was not easy to come to much accuracy as
 to its apparent path.
    Meteors have abounded          lately.     I saw two very brilliant,'
but small ones, in one night, and within three minutes of
time of each other ; one between the Northern Crown and
Bootes, and the other between the Crown and Hercules.
The former appeared about the size and brightness of Venus.
And on the ad, at about twenty minutes past ten, another,
which was in the field of my night-telescope with the comet:
 beside many smaller, usually ca\\ed shooting Jlars.
    The last time the weather has permitted me to fee the
comet, was October 4, at twenty-five minutes past ten, to a
very few minutes of its setting.            I thought its nucleus very
disoernible,    and   the  extent    of its coma rather        increased.
From     its then appearance      I  mould hope,       if the weather fa
vours, it will be traced down to its node ; which seems likely
to be in 17 or 18 of Sagittarius ; and that it may still be
visible for a fortnight from this time.

    P. S.   It is worthy     of inquiry    and     observation, whether
nearly all the very large meteors have not been seen in or
near the magnetic meridian, as an acute and attentive phi
losophical observer thinks to be the fact.

   1 HERE        is no animal matter which has been subjected
io   more   examination than urine, and there is none which
has furnished more discoveries to chemists.                    They have,
however, confined themselves chiefly to an examination of
phosphats, which were for a long time called Fusible Salts.
Margraff, Pott, Schlosser, Haupt, and Rouelle the younger,
were almost exclusively occupied with them from the time of
Boerhaave to Scheele.              This great attention bestowed on
phosphats     arose from the interest           inspired by the discovery
of   the phosphorus      of urine,     and the ideas which      the alche
mists    had  propagated       respecting     the singular properties of
these salts.    What physicians          have done in regard to human
urine has scarcely had any relation to its nature, and has
supplied too much to the ridiculous pretensions of empiri
cism.     The   discoveries    of Scheele put       an end to the inco
herence between medical observations               and    the chemical la
bours on urine.          When     the    acid, which     forms the greater
part of   the urinary calculi,        or the uric acid, was discovered,
as well as the acid phosphat of lime, the formation of these
calculi, like those of the depots of the precipitates of urine,
 became much easier to be comprehended than before ; and
it  then became possible to establish between              the medical ob
 servations   on urine and its nature, better ascertained,             that
relation which ought constantly to have been the physician's
 guide, since by it alone he could be furnished with any exact
 light.    The useful inferences which our colleague Berthollet
 has drawn from the examination              of urine, and from     its na
 ture, more or      less   acid,   in  gouty affections, are at     present!
 well known.

44               ExtraS of Fourcroy and Vauquelirit
long ago a number of new facts in regard to the urine of
men and animals.    Our new analysis of urinary calculi in
duced us to resume, in greater detail, an examination of hu
man urine, the natural source of these concretions.      The re
sult of our labour on this liquor we communicated to the
Institute in the fitting of the nth of Frimaire this year; and
I shall here give a short account of       sufficient to make
                                                           it,                              it
known,                   how moch light may be thrown, by
              and to prove
an analysis of this kind, on the physical nature of animals.
    I.In this memoir the smell of human urine          first con                 is
sidered as    very distinct and characteristic property of this
               a
liquid.   In urine well constituted, and when      issues from              it
the bladder,       neither the odour of ammonia, nor of an
                   it   is
acid, nor of the violet           evidently aromatic, and de
                                      :    it   is
pends entirely oh    matter peculiar to urine, which makes
                             a
it  to be what               is,
                        and without which
                        it                      would not be           it
urine.
     II.    The orange colour of urine                 is,   no    less     than its odour,
a property which exclusively belongs to     and which               k,                      is
found in no other animal liquid. Being susceptible of many
shades, and exceedingly varied degrees in its intensity, as'
was long ago observed                 by   Bellinr,   it   is    indebted for this va
riation to the very variable proportion in the effect of the
water and the colouring matter, and the latter      the fame                  is
that gives to this liquid its aromatic odour. The darkest
coloured urine,    cither naturally or                     by
                                          artificial evaporation,
assumes all possible shades, like those remarked under diffe
rent circumstances,       the addition of water only in various
                                 by
quantities.   Thus the smelling and colouring matter of urine
h very  soluble in water.
     III.
       The authors of the memoir, in treating of the acrid
and strong taste of human urine, remark that this acridity
isnot merely that of the saline substances held in solution'
in this liquor, which only modify           giving         it,
                                                         saline   by              it   a
taste.  The durable acridity of urine depends also on the
matter which produces its smell' and Colour.            varies,                    It
therefore, like these two properties, which    follows in their     it
intensity or diminution.    When physiologists ascribed the
savour of urine to these salts, they did not know, or did not
                                                                                           pay

                             Memoir on Human Urine.                               45
pay attention to the small quantity of them in proportion to
the mass of water in which they are dissolved.
  IV. The     component materials of urine, the number of
which is considerable, re-act on each other during the pro
cess of analysing them.  The salts contained in it are mo
dified, and change their nature : but the property, above all,'
of becoming alcalised, or of forming, by its spontaneous al
teration, ammonia and carbonic acid, (a property which is
developed in a few moments in an elevated temperature, and
which   has made it be considered as the most alcalescent of
all the animal humours,) is the source of the most singular
changes in its nature.  Instead of remaining acid, it then
tums vegetable colours green j it produces an effervescence
with    acids      when poured over it; it changes its colour; it
assumes a fetid        ammoniacal smell ; it deposits precipitates
and crystallised salts which it did not contain.  This altera
tion begins sometimes even in the reins, and carries with it
a disposition to form calculi, which it would not have formed
without      it        It   depends entirety on the urinary matter, the
cause   of its odour,          its colour,    and its savour.
  V. It follows, from the preceding consideration, that the
       of urine, by the means at present employed, must
analysis
have given many uncertain results ; and that many errors, in
this respect, must have been committed.    The action of fiTe,
which so speedily and fo easily alters the nature of bodies,
changes   both the proportions and the properties of its pro
ductions.   Urine, therefore, must be examined at the mo
ment when it innes from the body ; the component parts
of it must, as much as poffible, be sought for without em
ploying fire       ;   in examining          it,
                                       re-agents ought to be used,
which,      as     in the analysis of mineral waters, may serve to
ascertain,        at the moment of their mixture, the matters con
tained in that liquid.    The phosphoric, the uric, and the
muriatic acids, with Kme and ammonia, have already been
shewn in      but science
             it   ;         as yet far from being in that ad
                                      is
vanced     state as to possess        the     number of        re -agents necessary
for this kind of analysis,            which        still requires many new re
searches.
   VI.     Our     researches on the means             of   analysis, carried   mudr
                                                                            farther

 46            ExtraS os Four croy and Vauquelin's
 farther than any before undertaken, have been attended with
 no other success than to enable us to compare the pheno
mena they exhibited with those of evaporation.          Thus the
 transparency   of turbid urine,  and  the concrete flakes preci
pitated during the evaporation     of urine, have (hewn us that
the caustic alkalies, and the precipitate formed by the tanning
principle in the liquid, belonged to the phosphat of lime and
 a gelatinous animal matter.      We have learned, by the fame
 comparative process, that even a very gentle heat formed in
urine ammonia, which speedily neutralised its acidity : that
its colour embrowned by evaporation, and its abundant crys
tallisation, on cooling, after it had been brought to the con
sistence  of syrup, depended on the concentration of the par
ticular matter, the common source of its colour, odour, sa
vour, and its other characteristic properties : that the fetid
garlic smell,   and the crystalline form, were two of its most
prominent characters: and, in the last place, that as all
urine evaporated in this manner forms itself into a mass,
there ought to be found in this mass the constituent matters
of urine, except the portion of ammonia formed and vola
tilised  by the evaporating heat.     This lamellated crystalline
mass, treated with alcohol, was almost entirely dissolved, and
hothing remained but a little of the grey saline substance
which the water separated from the phosphat of soda and
ammonia, and a little phosphat of lime and uric acid, inso
luble in the liquid, but which was insulated from the calca
reous phosphat    by the ley of caustic alkali.  These salts, and
this acid, made some milliemes only of the weight of the
urine; while the matter dissolved by the alcohol formed
some centiemes.       The latter was composed of a little muriat
of ammonia, benzoic acid, and urinary matter more abun
dant than all the rest.     Such is the series of our analytical
processes, analogous     to  those employed on the residues of
mineral waters, and by the help of which we have been
able to separate the constituent matters   of human urine more
exactly than had been done before.
    VII. The distillation of urine, though considered as well-
known, presented to us several remarkable facts.        In a very
gentle sand-bath, fresh urine gives water very ammoniacal
                                                              and

and crystallisedcarbonat of ammonia long before it is dry t
the last portions of water obtained effervesce strongly with
acids, and become of a rose-colour, not much susceptible of
changing in the open air.      It arises from the carbonat of
ammonia which the liquid product contains ; and urine has
a singular disposition to form this salt in great abundance
and. with great ease,   is ptoved by all the means of analysis
                               as
applied to it.        The       of the urine is then saturated j
                              native acid
flakes of animal matter are deposited, as well as earthy phos-
phats and the uric acid. All these phenomena continue until
the predominance of the carbonat of ammonia, which is
formed, becomes very manifest.       They take place at a con
tinued temperature            of    60   .
   VIII. We                with any exactness, but three facts
                      never saw,
 in regard to the putrefaction, or spontaneous and septic de
 composition of urine, viz. the horrible fetor by which it is
  accompanied ; the formation of a great quantity of ammo
  nia which characterises it ; and the abundance as well as
 easy extraction of the fusible salts or alkaline phosphat which
 follows.   C. Halle has given an exceeding good description
 of the successive alterations which urine, left to itself, expe
 riences, but he has not followed them in regard to the natnre
 of their materials      ; the object of his research was only to de
 scribe the effects      in their appearances.     Urine contained in
 a close    vessel   becomes of a darker colour ; turns brown, and
 even   black; emits    fetid, ammoniacal odour; deposits first
                               a
  a light cloud, which is gradually changed into mucous
  flakes more or less coloured.  There are formed at its sur

    IX. An attentive and       careful examination of the first
 phenomena    of the  putrid decomposition of human urine, pre
 sented to us results as interesting at least as that of urine en
 tirely decomposed.  These results are connected, above all,
 with the formation of urinary calculi, which were one of
 the most important objects of our labour. We were desirous
 of adding to the well-known fact of the existence of calcu-
 lous matter in every kind of urine, answers to the following
 questions of     much importance —Why are these matters
                    so                                :
more abundant        ?     Why         does   a   disposition        to calculus exist in
some subjects and not             in all, though           the urine       of all contains
what may form them               ?      Why         are they formed sometimes
speedily,    and sometimes          What
                                       slowly the cause of the
                                                ?                   is
fix-fold variety  of the calculous matters, their mixture, and
interruption   ? Though we were far from having found                                      a
solution to all these questions,                we have at any rate been able
to resolve some.
   The white prismatic crystals, which are deposited on the.
pellicles or the fides of vessels containing urine, do not sliew
themselves till the liquid becomes ammoniacal. They increase
in quantity and bulk for six or eight days they are prisms           :
of six planes, with pyramids having fix faces, which arc rea
dily   discovered                            phosphat, like
                     to be ammoniaco-magnesian
that often found, under the sparry form, at the surface of
white calculi. This salt does not exist, or not formed, but          is
when there      is   an excess          of ammonia in
                                            the urinary liquor.
This ammonia,            by
                    saturating the free phosphoric acid, sepa
rates the gelatinous matter which gives birth to       mucous                   a
precipitate, and constitutes              with that acid,                 and   by   uniting
itself to the phosphat of magnesia,                 the ammoniaco-magnesian

                         Memoir  on Human Urine.                      49
   phosphat, Which deposits itself in crystals.        The uric acid is
  equally saturated,      and  presents  urate  of ammonia; which
  sometimes     deposits itself  in the calculous     matter  with the
  triple phosphat just mentioned. This triple phosphat sepa
  rates itself in crystals of the liquor only because it is less so
  luble than the two insulated phosphats.         This salt, therefore,
  which does not exist quite formed in the urine, is the pro
  duce  of  its ammoniacal alteration.
     As ammonia        and the carbonic acid go on always in
  creasing   when   the   uric and phosphoric acids and the phos
  phat of magnesia are saturated, there remains in the liquor
  carbonate of ammonia, which then renders syrup of violets
  green, and effervesces with acids. The acetous acid, which
  is formed at the fame time, becomes saturated also with am
  monia   ; so  that the urine contains, at the fame time, acetite
  and carbonate    of ammonia. These three substances, formed
  almost at the fame time by the decomposition of the urine,
  ammonia, the phosphoric and the acetous acids, are the
  produce of the urinary matter, which ceases          to be found    in
 that liquid when altered by putrefaction.
     X. This alteration of urine       does not always take place     in
 the fame manner,         and its decomposition varies according to
 the diversified nature of that liquor.        Sometimes, in one in
 dividual,    when the urine commonly presents the before-
 mentioned phenomena, the liquid, instead of emitting an
 ammoniacal odour, becomes covered with a green and white
 mouldiness, which increases frr fifteen or twenty days.            In
 stead  of containing ammonia 1 ak id, it contains the acid, and
 emits   a smell  of it.   This kind of urine    is less subject to al
 teration than the preceding. It appears to be at least as
 common as that which alcalises.            Their difference depends
evidently on the variation of their principles, and not on their
nature ; for they are almost always the fame, except in their
proportion.       Thus the urinary matter, the source of the
formation of ammonia, of the carbonic and acetous acids,
and the cause of the alterability of urine, does not produce
or experience that alteration, or that decomposition, but so
far as it is mixed with a certain quantity of gelatinous mat
ter, which serves it as a ferment. If it does not contain
    Vol. V.                         H                         enough,

50             Extras? of Fourcroy and Vauquctins
enough, and if the urine, less gelatinous, is by these means
more coloured, has a stronger smell, and is more charged
with urinary matter, it i3 less susceptible os fermentation or
putridity ; it preserves itself much longer and with its pri
mitive characters, and        is more   permanent : that, on the
other hand, which is        less coloured, more changeable, and
more disposed to the formation of ammonia, deposits speedily
mucous flakes, and gives sooner a cloud and precipitate. It
appeared to us, that urine less corruptible and less gelatinous,
and in some measure more urinous,          if I may be allowed the
expression,    was the sign   of good health,   and the produce   of
complete digestion ; while pale urine, more gelatinous and
more decomposable, existed more particularly in weak sub
jects, and in cafes where the digestive faculties were lessened.
There is reason to believe that these two different states of
 urine, which exhibit it as two distinct or different liquids,
 will one day furnish facts of great utility to the healing art ;
 and that a solution   of tan will    supplv the means    of distin
 guishing them, and of determining their relation in regard
 to the nature and quantity of the precipitate which it will
 form in these liquids, compared in different subjects, or in
 the fame at different periods.
     XI. Scheele first announced the presence of the benzoic
 acid in the urine of man, and particularly in that of children.
 Rouelle the younger had before suspected it in that of the
  mammeferæ, though he durst not give any opinion as to
 its nature. This acid is obtained by sublimation, on heating
  the extract of urine in close vessels.    It may be separated still
  better by evaporating urine to the consistence of clear syrup,
  and    pouring on it the muriatic acid, by which it is precipi
  tated ; because that acid decomposes        the benzoat of ammo
  nia that has been formed. It is by the latter process that we
  have taught the method of extracting it from the urine of
   horses and cows, and, above all, from the water of dung
   hills, in sufficient abundance to substitute it in pharmacy
   for that of benzoin.     In a word, this acid is the least abun
   dant, and perhaps the most variable of the matters in urine.
   It  appeared  to us to be between       ^Vis and -rdsv      There
   are some morbific     circumstances under which its quantity
                                                            increases

                         Memoir on Human Urine.                                      $1
increases yery sensibly, and often very foeedily.   We had no
opportunity  of determining   the difference of the  proportion
in   the urine  of adults, or that of children, in which Scheele
fays that it is  much more abundant.
   XII. The analysis of urinary calculi, which first directed
our attention to urine as the source of its concretions, in
duced us to examine whether the oxalic acid existed        in this
liquid.  The  oxalat of  lime          is,
                                 indeed,  one   of  the most  fre
quent matters of calculi    and we have found
                                ;                     in the pro  it
portion of    sixth
                a   in  the  number  of  urinary  stones we exa
mined.   None of the means which can be employed to dis
cover the presence of that acid, exhibited       to us in urine
                                                             it                      ;
while, on the other hand, the smallest quantity of the oxalic
acid, which we poured into the liquid, gave us an abundant
and very heavy oxalat of lime; which proved to us, that such
an acid could not remain dissolved in the urme. Thus, when
a    mural      or mulberry-formed calculous, composed                           of the
oxalat    of lime   and an animal matter,     which     by             it   is   agglu
tinated, arises in the urinary duct, its production takes place
even at the moment of the formation of the oxalic acid.
This acid must arise in the urine; and in that case there
must be in       it   an unnatural and morbific
                                              foreign production.
There     is   reason to believe that some kinds of urine, which
come from the body white and turbid, are charged                            with this
salt; and that the oxalat of lime, formed    cause still un  by
                                                              a
known, issues in this manner without producing calculi.                              It
may be thence seen of how much importance         to make         it   is            a
chemical examination of the urine of diseased persons, and
to establish continued series of experiments on this subject
                 a
in   some hospital       set apart   for these useful researches.
   The cafe the fame with siliceous
                 is                                  earth as     with the oxalat
of lime. We have never yet found                  it   in urine.      And its ex
istence in that liquid appears to be             a   rare cafe in pathology          :
of   three      hundred calculi,       indeed,    analysed        with      care,   two

morbific circumstances.   5. Siliceous earth, which is found
in it only very rarely. The four first substances are constant
in it    ; the other two are only accidental, and therefore we
pass     them over till after the examination of calculi arising
necessarily          from urine, and of which the constituent matters
have       been       dissolved in that liquid. Another new fact ob
tained by our labour        that the particular matter which
                                    is,
gives to urine its distinguishing characters,   converted, by           is

latinous body, into ammonia, carbonic acid, and acetous acid,
and from these new products there arise in urine very re
markable changes. The analysis of putrid urine differs, there
fore, very much from that of fresh urine.
      results from these researches,
      It                                which                by              human urine
has become             much better known than                    it   was before,   that   it
contains ten principal or constant substances, characterised                               in
the following manner            :
       A. Muriat of        soda, which crystallises                   in octaedra in   eva

   C. The acid phosphat of lime, forming about the 700th
part of urine, considered formerly as an earth, precipitating
itself     by
         the addition of alkalies, which take from   its excess               it
of acid carrying always with
           ;                          gelatinous matter which

Itthic acid. It crystallises by the cooling of urine, and forms
the red sand which that liquid deposits at the bottom of pots.
It is more abundant in the urine of diseased persons. It may
be dissolved exceedingly well by the caustic alkali.
    H. The benzoic acid, more abundant in the                      urine of

syrup,    mixed to a tenth with concentrated                sulphuric acid,
and distilled.

its proportion in the different kinds of urine ; shewing itself

in that    over which     alkali is poured, in flakes by the evapo
ration of urine; precipitating itself by the tanning principle,
 which serves to determine the proportion ; occasioning a
speedy putrefaction of urine, which contains it in abun
dance ; appearing by their augmentation to be the first cause
of the jformation of calculi, and furnishing them with the
gluten which       unites their moleculæ, and following, in their
proportion, the energy or weakness of the digestive forces of

    K. The     special urinary matter, giving to urine its charac
 teristic  properties   really constituting it ; giving it its odour,
 colour, and     savour — its alterability into ammonia, the car
bonic and acetous acids, &c.            It is the most abundant       of the
matters     contained in urine      ;   it forms      alone  the   i|  of its
matters.      It  has been     mproperly considered by Rouelle the
younger as a saponaceous extract.             To it is owing the almost
 total crystallisation of urine evaporated to the consistence of
 syrup ; the solid and crystalline form          it   assumes   in that  state
 by the addition of concentrated nitric acid ; the crystallisation
 of the muriates of soda and ammonia modified, and in some
 measure reversed — the former from the cube to the octaedron,
 and the second from the octaedron            to the cube.       This parti
 cular animal matter, which we call            ur'ee,   will form the ob
ject of another Memoir,         destined to serve as a supplement            to

 constant materials of human urine, it contains sometimes,
 but rarely and accidentally, sulphat of soda, muriat of pot
 ash, sulphat of lime, oxalat of lime and of (ilex : that some
 of these substances, and particularly the two latter, are only
the rare productions of some particular and perhaps mor
bific dispositions of urine. It will be of great utility to in
quire into the circumstances which have an influence on the
existence        of   these matters,   which      are foreign to the natural
 state.
        XIV. Incharacterising urine as a liquid very distinct from
 all others, the matter which I have called uree gives       above          it,
 all, the property of becoming,                  by
                                        the decomposition which
    occasions,   liquor very different from what       was when        it
it it
                      a
    issued from the  bladder, and   substance
                                            a totally new.  Fer
mented urine     changed in almost all its matters. The view
                       is
of these changes, which terminates this Memoir, exhibits, as
the most striking result, the production and existence in pu
 trid urine of nine new matters, which do not exist in fresh or
natural urine.
   I.      Ammonia in excess.
        a. The phosphoric acid saturated               by
                                             this alkali.
        3. The phosphat of magnesia  converted   into ammoniaco-
                magnesian    phosphat.
        4.   The    urat of ammonia.
        5.   The    acetous acid united to ammonia.
        6.   The    benzoic acid saturated with the same ammonia.
        7.   The    muriat of soda become octaedral.
        8.   The    muriat of ammonia become cubic.
        9.   The    carbonat of ammonia.
        We may still        add the precipitation           of   the   albumen and
gelatinous matter effected             by
                                 the ammonia, and which ac
companies  that of the phosphats        that these salts, like the
                                             ;    so
matter of bone, are susceptible of giving carbon when heated.
        Such   is   the general view   of             in this first
                                            the facts contained

stow on   it that continued attention which it requires, and
what influence such phenomena may have on the progress of
animal physiology.              The authors       promise to make known,                          in
a second       Memoir, all
                       the properties which distinguish the
particular matter that  characterises this liquid, which is the
most abundant in     and which they call urie, as has been
                              it,
already said.

    A   HAT         the diamond          is   combustible,        is   a     truth which
    Newton, in          some measure,      conjectured which
                                                           ;                       experience
    has fully confirmed             and respecting which                             no longer
                                                                             \s is
                                ;                                      it
    possible to entertain the least doubt.                But what                   the nature
    of this combustibility? My first experiments, published in
    1785, on the entire combustion in nitre in fusion    seemed                      t,
    to announce that the diamond burnt in      after the manner
                                                              it
    of coal,   since    it   left an effervescent alkali      ;    and this suspicion
                                                                                                  La

    acquired more reality, after the examination made
    voisier of the gas remaining in the vessels in which                                          had
    burnt,     and which            he found     charged      with carbonic acid.
    Mr. Tennant           has   since furnished us         with     new proof of
                                                                       a
    this important fact,            by
                             repeating the combustion of the dia
    mond       by
              nitre in   gold crucible, as had proposed, in order
                                a                     I

       There were, however, still sufficient reasons to induce us
     to disbelieve that the diamond and carbon, or that the dia
     mond and the carbon extracted from the carbonic acid by the
     noble experiment of Mr. Tennant, were the same substance.
     Independently os their external characters,     completely               so
     different, several observations,which    have already commu

     that the aggregation conceals sometimes the affinities                                              by
     counterbalancing their power, but not in operations where
     the bodies are sufficiently fixed, and the temperature suffi
     cientlyhigh, to render effectual the weakest attractions.
     Something remained, then, to be discovered to harmonise
     and make us comprehend facts in appearance   contrary *.                       so
I      imagined that          it    was        by   attentive     observation       of what took
     place during the act of the combustion of the diamond,                                        that
     we should attempt to penetrate this secret of nature.                                         The
     experiments    am about to describe will,

    nomena, which have appeared to us the most incoherent,
    may hereafter be deduced from some circumstances which
    were not observed nor even suspected, and which have en
    abled us to make an important step     the knowledge of the   in
    nature of the diamond, since we can indicate substances
    which approach much nearer to      than carbon.          it

    clouds or weakened                by

    this delay.  ffiall suppress the details of those essays which
                     I
    did not lead to conclusive results; but      shall not neglect     I
    those which        furnished us with                     an opportunity          of observing
    several times the fame facts, and sometimes                            in   a   more distinct

    tors in these experiments,             C. Clouet and Hachette. The
   journal of them was          correctly kept by C. Desormes, formerly
    a pupil of the Polytechnic School, and at present                      assistant-
    preparer for one of the courses of chemistry.                    The   most im
    portant phenomena were seen, at different fittings, by several
   men of letters.
       The Council of          the   Administration        of    the    Polytechnic
   School, approving the object             of  the experiments, authorised
   me to dispose      of  some   of   the diamonds in its         cabinet*.
      The   first experiment was           made    on the 9th of Fructidor
   in the year 5. We placed upon the table of the mercurial
   pneumatic tub, a bell of flint glass 18-3 centimetres in di
   ameter, aiid of the content of 5580 cubic centimetres. Near
   the tub was placed,          on one side, a pneumatic machine, to
   exhaust    the common air from the bell by means of a bent
   tube, which      rose as far as the      knob.     On     the other side        was
   a water pneumatic tub, bearing a large receiver,                       having at
  its tubulure a cock which communicated with the inside
  of the bell by a tube of bent glass, and rising, in the like
  manner, to the hollow             knob of the bell.             On    one   of the
  edges of the mercurial tub was fixed a Aide, bearing a kind
  of mandril, destined to receive a cylinder of hard wood move-
  able in every direction, terminated by a handle of iron, and
  serving to support a cup made of the crucible earth of Va-
  logne; so that this cup could be conveyed to even' point of the
  interior part of the bell to present the diamond to the focus.
  This apparatus is represented by fig. 1. (Plate II.) Every
  thing being disposed in this manner, we put into the cup
     * The diamonds,      which   form   part of its collection of minerals,      were
 fbund   in nn English     (hip from    Senegal, captured     in t'le year 2.   They
 were deposited     at  the Hotel des monneies,    where    tiny rerrYiincd till the
 year 5, when, on the suggestion of our colleague Mongez, one of the ad
 ministrators, the minister of the finances, after causing it to be ascertained:
 that the greater part of them were unfit for being cut, and for that reason
 more valuable for instruction,      ordered one third of them to be given to
the Museum       of Natural History, another to the Cabinet of the School ot
Mine?, and another to that of the Polytechnic School.                The lot a/iigneii
to the last consisted   of 26, weighing    altogether 3-662 grammes.
      Vol. V.                               I                                      an

58           Experiments made at         the  Polytechnic School
an incomplete octaedral         diamond,        having the edges      a little'
rounded, of        a  dirty water inclining to yellowish-grey, and
weighing exactly 14a milligrammes.                   On the cup, the edge
of which was ground flat, a cover was applied, attached to 3
thread tied round the lower part of the support.
     The pump was made to act till the mercury in the bell
rose    within   less  than  a millimetre of the orifice of the tubesr
of communication.            The cock of        the receiver of  the hydro-
pneumatic tub, which had been previously filled v#th oxygen
gas obtained from the oxygenated muriat of pot-ash, was
then opened ; and the first portion of this gas which had
passed     into the bell was extracted by the pump, in order to
 exhaust as much as possible the remainder of common air.
After this it was silled with         the fame gas to      within   69  milli
metres of its internal edge,            and 51    of the external. It may
readily be conceived         that still  a little air remained in the cup-
 in which      the diamond was placed, and which, during these
 experiments, had been shut by its cover; .but its content
 not being altogether three cubic centimetres, this inconve
 nience was thought the smallest of those which were to be
 apprehended.
     The diamond having           been    uncovered, we began, at ten*
 minutes after one, to throw upon it the focus of the large
 lens belonging to the cabinet of the Polytechnic School, the
  diameter of which is 40-59 centimetres, and the focus 135*3.
 We     were well      aware   of  the    necessity   of heating  the bell by
  degrees, to prevent its cracking.             For this  purpose we inter
  posed,    at first, green    and   blue coloured glass ; but whether*
  they acquired more heat, or resisted dilatation more, these
  glasses all speedily broke ; and we were not able to accom
  plish our object but by covering with paper, for some mo
  ments, the part of the bell which received the luminous-
  disk.     When      the paper was withdrawn, the mercury fell
  rapidly, 19     millimetres    in tlic inside.     The diamond, exposed
   to the focus for twenty minutes, did not inflame. It appeared
   at first mealy, but sensibly blackened at the surface w hen ob
   served through the coloured glass while exposed to the              focus*.

                           ;

to 44 degrees.
   The focus was thrown                  upon the diamond at 28 minutes
after 11.          At 42 minutes         after 11 the cone               of light   was    in
tercepted,     and we saw the diamond red, transparent, and sur
rounded with         a    faint radiation.          When          cooled,    its edtjes ap

mercury, to calculate, according to the temperature and pres
sure, the volume of the aeriform fluid remaining under the
bell; and we judged that       had decreased about 173 cubic

  The rays of the fun were bright and strong; but the air                                       so
much agitated, that while the thermometer under the bell
was at 44"5, that exposed to the sun in the open air did not
rise higher than 32,'.  There was    moment, however, when
                                                     a

its being too much in a mass, or perhaps also too much in
sulated from every other combustible \vhich might contribute
to this temperature : and that we might make an attempt to
remove this obstacle, we introduced into the same porcelain
cup, and without deranging the apparatus, a small cut dia
mond of the weight of eight milligrammes; but there was
no appearance that the combustion was in the least aug
mented; and this small brilliant, instead of being more ra
pidly attacked by the heat, after having been two days ex
posed to the action of the solar fire, capable of igniting ob
scurely the large diamond placed close to      gave no signs of   it,
inflammation,             and   was    takenfrom the apparatus without
having           experienced     the slightest alteration, either in the
polisli of its surface, or the vivacity of its edges.
  Op the 23d of the fame month we took the diamonds
from the saucer, to examine, with care, that which had given
manifest signs of commencement of combustion.

a fort of specks inclining to grey    but what appeared worthy

to indicate the place where the                    solar       focus had exercised,         at
the end of the operation, its greatest intensity; and where

    I thought      it might be of some importance to preserve the
 subject of    these    observations,     and that it would not disgrace
 the collection of the cabinet of the School, with an inscrip
 tion allusive to the experiment to which it had been sub
jected.     Another diamond was therefore destined to be put
 into the apparatus, in order that it might be there subjected
 to entire combustion. This diamond was also a pretty regular
 octaedron, of a much more beautiful water                   than the pre
 ceding, and weighing aoevi milligrammes, 377 grains.
     As the season was already so far advanced that it left us
 no hope of a solar focus as strong as that from which we had
 obtained    so  little effect with the lenses we had employed,            I
 was desirous      of terminating       the   experiment with the great
 lens of Tschirhaufeii       ;   and the class granted       me permission
  to take it from their cabinet.
     This lens, as is well known,               is  86-6 centimetres (33
 inches) in diameter, and 2ii'Oj6                 (73 inches) focus.     We
 augmented        its power still      more    by catching the luminous
  cone with the small lens          of  the cabinet   of  the Institute, the
 disk   of which is 37-89 centimetres, and the focus 56'83,
 which in this position was shortened to 5-41 centimetres.
     A first sitting gave scarcely any signs of a commencement
  of combustion. Next morning, the luminous disk having
 fallen on one of the parts of the bell which was thickest, it
 occasioned     it to crack.      It   was therefore     no longer possible
 to compare the volume            of   the gas before and after the ope
  ration, nor to distinguish and ascertain the quantities of the
 products.       We confined ourselves to making lime-water pass
 through the interior of the bell before the fissure had suffered
 a sensible quantity of common air to enter, and we observed
  that it was much troubled.
     The diamond which             had heen last exposed was noways
  changed    at its surface    :  it had, however, lost two decimilli-
 grammes of its weight ; which was verified by the lame
  balance with which it had been weighed, and which is ca
  pable of marking, in a very sensible manner, these fractions
  of the milligramme.            Thus we were obliged to adjourn the
  experiment till the next summer, in order to find a more
  favourable sun, and to have time to provide a new apparatus.

     Copal in Spirit of Turpentine, and in Alcohol*.
              To separate      the   Mucilage from Linseed Oil.
  X HAD           read  in   some     book, the title of which         I  do not
 recollect, that linseed           oil might be purified by shaking it
 with water, which would imbibe the impurities,                      and leave
 the oil more limpid.               I tried this experiment by shaking
 linseed     oil with warm water; and was surprised to find they
 did not separate, but remained united in the form of emul
 sion. I then boiled them together, and found their tendency
 to separate diminish. As it is the known property of gums
 or mucilage to keep oil and water united in this state, I was
 induced to suspect the presence of mucilage in linseed oil.
     I had read in Dosiie a method of preparing what he calls
fat   oil.   It  is effected by placing linseed oil in a shallow vessel
 exposed to the heat         of   the sun,     and stirring it frequently: in
 a certain time it loses its property of drying, thickens, and
 acquires     a degree     of tenacity that makes it proper for a size
 or cement for gilders, &c. A similar substance is alluded to
 by Leonardo da Vinci.
     Taking the existence of mucilage in this oil for granted,
 I  conjectured that the alteration, produced in its texture by
 Doflie's process, arose from the evaporation of some of its
 principles,       and the more intimate          union of the rest in con
 sequence      of that evaporation.            To verify this conjecture, I
 tried the following experiment :
     I filled a half-pint phial full of linseed oil, corked and tied
 it securely over with a bladder. This I exposed                  to the     heat
 of the sun in summer, during the whole day :                      after it had
 remained a few days in this situation, the upper part of the

 Sheldrake's    paper on Painting in Oil, in a manner similar to that practised
 in the ancient Venetian School, published in Vol. XVI, •• for a copy of
 which see Phil. Mag. Vol. I.
                                                                           phial

phial was covered with drops similar to those produced by
holding a wet bottle to dry before the sire. I then shook it
well, which made the contents look muddy, and set it to rest
again. After a time it became clear, and a portion of trans
parent liquor, like water, lay at the bottom. I then repeated
the making and setting it to rest, till no additional quantity
of this fluid was separated.
    By trying this experiment repeatedly upon oils procured
from different places, I found that some oils afforded much
more mucilage than others. From some I separated a third
part of mucilage ; from others, a pint would not afford more
than a table-spoonful,          and  sometimes   less.  Whether this
difference    in   the  result   was radically in the oils, or from a
difference in the processes conducted by means so variable as
 the heat of the fun,      I  am not able to ascertain.
     Upon trying the      same experiment with nut and poppy        oil,
 I   found the same result,        but in a different degree.      The
 average quantity afforded by nut oil was, I believe, not more
 than a third part of the average of linseed oil ; and the ave
 rage   of the poppy oil was not so much as a sixth.          In  some
 cafes, particularly of the poppy oil, I did not obtain any.
     The colour of the oil always diminished as the mucilage
 was abstracted     ;  but the mucilage was always as colourless
 as water.      It is a question I will not pretend to decide, whe
 ther the colour of these oils depends upon the presence of the
  mucilage, or upon any other principle which is destroyed by
  the action of light.       I have in some instances had the oil as
  colourless as water.
      This decomposition of the oils, if it may be so called, is
  curious, _as proving the mucilage in them ; but, as it is very
  troublesome, may it not be advisable to prefer those which
  have naturally the least mucilage in their composition ?
      After pouring the oils from        the  mucilage,   I put several
   quantities of the latter together,      and found them mix    with
   out any difficulty.      I mixed this mucilage with water, and
   found it unite with it in any proportion without becoming
   turbid.    I laid it upon plates of metal, exposing them to dry
   in the fun and before the fire, and, when dry, washed them
   with a spunge and water : but it fliewed no tendency to dis-

  solve   ;   though, while in      a  liquid state, it seemed to    possess all
   the properties of      a gum.
       As   the processes by which         I dissolved the amber and copal
  to make the          oil varnishes,     are to be found in many books,
  and    as  it will be better    for artists to purchase       than attempt
  to make those varnishes, it can scarcely be thought necessary
 to detail those processes here : but, as I believe the methods
  by which I dissolved the copal in spirit of turpentine and
  spirit of wine are not known, I shall now subjoin them.
                  To dissolve Copal in Spirit       of Turpentine.
      N. B. Whatever quantity is to be dissolved, should be put
 into a glass vessel capable of containing at least four times as
 much, and it should be high in proportion to its breadth.
      Reduce two ounces of copal to small pieces, and put them
 into    a proper vessel.       Mix a pint of spirit of turpentine with
 i-8th of spirit of sal-ammoniac ; shake them well together ;
 put them to the copal ; cork the glass, and tie it over with a
 string or wire, making a small hole through the cork.                      Set
 the glass in a sand-heat so regulated as to make the contents
 boil as quickly as possible, but so gently that the bubbles
 may be counted as they rife from the bottom.                       The fame
heat must be kept up exactly till the solution is complete.
      It requires the most accurate attention to succeed in this
operation.          After the spirits are mixed, they should be put to
the copal, and the necessary degree of heat be given as soon
as possible.         It should likewise be kept up with the utmost
regularity.         If the heat abates, or if the spirits boil quicker
than is directed, the solution will immediately stop, and it
will afterwards be in vain to proceed with the fame mate
rials; but if properly managed, the spirit of sal-ammoniac
will be seen gradually to descend from the mixture and attack
the copal, which           swells  and dissolves,      except   a very   small
quantity which remains undissolved.
     It is of much consequence that the                 vessel should not be
opened       till fume time after     it  has been perfectly cold.      It has
twice happened to me, on uncorking the vessel when it was
not warm enough to affect the hand, that the whole of the
contents were blowa with violence against the deling. It is
                                                                     likewise

  likewise important that the spirit of turpentine should be of
  the best quality.        I have never succeeded with that which is
  sold at the colour-shops ; but whenever I procured my spirits
  at Apothecaries'        Hall,  I  have dissolved the copal, by the pro
  cess  I  have described,      without difficulty.
      This varnish is of a rich deep colour when viewed in the
  bottle, but seems to give no colour to the pictures it is laid
  on: if left in the damp, it remains sacky, as it is called, a
  long time ; but if kept in a warm room, or placed in the
  fun, it dries as well as any other turpentine varnish ; and
 when dry, it appears to be as durable as any other solution
 of copal.
                        To dissolve Copal in Alcohol.
     Dissolve     half  an ounce      of camphire in     a pint  of alcohol j
 put it in    a  circulating glass,     and add four ounces      of copal iii
 small pieces}       set it in a sand-heat,     so regulated that the bub
 bles may be counted           as they rife  from the bottom ; and con
 tinue the fame heat till the solution is completed.
     Camphire acts more powerfully upon copal than any sub
 stance that I have tried.           If copal is finely powdered, and a
 small quantity of dry camphire rubbed with it in the mortar,
 the whole becomes in           a few   minutes a tough coherent mass.
 The    process above described        will  dissolve more copal than the
 menstruum will retain             when    cold;    The most economical
 method will therefore be to           set the vessel  which contains     the
 solution by for a few days ; and when it is perfectly settled
pour off the clear varnish, and leave the residuum for a fu
 ture operation.
     This   is the brightest solution       of copal  that  I have seen  :  it
is an excellent varnisti for pictures, and may perhaps be found
to be an improvement in fine Japan works; as the stoves
iised in drying those articles may drive off the camphire en
tirely, and leave the copal pure and colourless on the work.
     N. B. Copal will dissolve in spirit of turpentine, by the
addition of camphire, with the same facility, but not in the
same quantity, as in alcohol.
    At    the   time    I  determined      to lay the    preceding papers
before the Society,          I  conceived    that the quick and certain

manner in which             the vehicle dried, was one      of its advan*
tages.        Bat  as that circumstance has been       objected   to, and
in    some cafes really is a disadvantage,         I have   since  endea
voured to remove that objection by the following process :
     Put a pint of nut or poppv oil into a large earthen vessel ;
niake it boil gently upon a flow fire ; put in by degrees two
ounces of ceruse, and stir it continually till the whole is dii-
solved.
     Have ready       a pint of the copal oil varnish heated in a se
 parate vessel ; pour this by degrees into the hot oil, and stir
 them together till all the spirit of turpentine is dissipated ; let
it then be set by till cold, when it will be sit for use.
     It  is obvious, that, as this is a compound        of the copal var
 nish with the least exceptionable of the drying oils, it will
 partake of the properties         of each of its component parts. It
 gives less brightness and        durability to colours than the varnish
 will, but more than oil : but as it certainly may be used in
 painting in the fame manner as anv other drying oil, and
 gives more brightness and durability to colours than they
 can derive from any other oil, it is not unreasonable to sup
 pose that      it will  prove an advantageous    vehicle.
      I have      mentioned specific quantities of the ingredients j          -
 but it is easy to see that the relative proportions may be va
  ried according as it is required to dr)- faster or slower.             It
 must be remarked too, that whenever the mixture is to be
  made, both the ingredients should be hot; because, if either
  of   them      is cold,   the mixture becomes      turbid, and a part,
  often the whole of the copal, is precipitated : but this incon
  venience is avoided by mixing and boiling them together, as
  I   have directed.        It must likewise be observed, that after
  some      time a spontaneous alteration takes place, which di
  minishes, and at last destroys the drying quality of this mix
  ture   :   it will therefore be advisable to use it fresh, or at least
  not    to  use it after it bas been made more than a month or
  ik    weeks.

 XIV.     "Process  for producing       the  Lights   in Stained   Drawings,
    By  Mr. Francis Nicholson, of Rijpony                        York/hire*.
   JL HE difficulty of         preserving the lights in stained draw
 ings, with freedom and precision, is so universally felt by those
 who cultivate that branch of the arts, the practice^ of which
 is every day growing more extensive, that the statement                        of
 this circumstance alone is sufficient for the introduction                     of
 the following process, by which that difficulty is removed,
 and by which all the effect of body-colour may be obtained
 without any of its inconveniences or defects.                      It is appli
 cable to every subject, to the richness of foliage, of rocks, or
 of foreground ; and in ruins, their most picturesque appen
 dages of hanging flirubs, weeds, &c. may be expressed by it
 with the utmost sharpness, and with all the lightness and
 freedom of which body-colour or oil-painting are capable.
     The principle of this process consists in covering the places
 where the touches        of light     are intended      to be, with a com
position     not liable to be displaced          by washing over it with
 the colour, and such as may be afterwards                removed     by  a fluid
in which the colours         used   in water are not soluble.
    This composition, or stopping mixture, is made by dissolv
ing bees-wax in oil of turpentine, in the proportion of one
ounce of wax to five ounces of the oil ; and, as near the time
ot using it as may be convenient, grind with the pallet-knife
a* much flake white, or white lead,                in oil of turpentine, as
may be wanted at one time ;               dilute it with the above folu-
    •                                           of Arts, &c. having last session
      The   Society for the Encouragement
received   from   Mr. Nicholson, of Rippon in Yorkshire, a Drawing in
tended as a specimen of the      process   for producing   the lights  in stained
drawings,    by removing,  after the shadows    are washed in, the colour where
the lights    arc required, giving by this means the effect of body-colour
with greater clearness, and without any of its disadvantages; and it ap
pearing that Mr. Nicholson's method of tinting drawings promises to be
of use in the practice of drawing in water-colours, and produces a more
spirited effect, the Soc'ety agreed to Mr. Nicholson's proposal, and pur
chased from him, at the price of twenty guineas, the complete process for
 performing the work, at communicated in the abeve paper.

tion until      it will work freely with the pencil, and appear on
the paper, when held between the eye and the light, to be
opaque. It is necessary to observe this, or the first touches
will not    be sufficiently visible,    after being washed      over with
the colours, to ascertain         the places  of the second.     It is also
necessary to use a frame instead         of the drawing-board, or to
paste the paper on the frame           of the drawing-board so as to
remove      the    pannel   ;  because  the first   and   second  touches
must be put on with            the drawing    placed    between   the eye
and the light,       as they   will be most   visible  in that situation.
On this frame        paste the paper wet, so as to dr)' firm : when
quite  dry,    draw    the outline, and proceed as follows : —
   ist, With a sine small hair pencil, and the stopping mix
ture, cover those places where the clear whiteness of the
caper may be wanted, except in the sky : let it dry a few-
minutes ; then wet the paper on both sides, and while it is
wet wash the sky.            The shadows of the clouds, distances,
and   general      breadths    of shadow,    must   be put   in with the
grey tint ; and over the places of the          light, wash the tints of
the brightest light ; those will be generally yellow ochre or
light red.
   The light of       the clouds may be preserved sharp by pressing
on that part       a piece of tissue-paper     previous to the washing
of the sky    ;   this, by absorbing the superfluous moisture, will
prevent     the colour from spreading farther than is desired.
Suffer the whole to be very dry ; and,
   2dly, Touch in with the stopping mixture, the sharp and
prominent parts of the brightest lights; let them dry a few
minutes, then wash over them with the tints of the next
degree   of light.
   3dly, Stop with the mixture the second order of touches,
and wasti over them with the middle tints j strengthen also
at the fame time the breadths of shadow.
   4thly, Stop, with broad touches of the mixture, the places
of the middle tint ; uniting them to the former touches, and
extending them so as to graduate the middle colours into the
shadow    :   strengthen      the shadows,    making     them nearly     as
dark   as   they are intended to be, and let the whole be per
fectly dry.
                                                                     Then

    Then take oil of turpentine, and with a sponge, or hog's-
hair pencil, wash over the places where the mixture has been
used, rubbing it with the brush until it be dissolved : clear it
away with      a  linen rag, and wash it with more oil of turpentine
so   long as any white lead appears ; then let it dry.
    Warm the drawing ; then with a soft brush and highly*
rectified    spirit of wine wash the places where the oil of tur
pentine has been used, to clear away the remainder of it :
rub the drawing lightly on the face, but sponge it well on
the back.
     When dry, tint down the lights where it may be wanted ;
harmonise the colouring, and cut the shadows to effect, with
full darker tints as may be necessary.
     If  other touches      of light   should    afterwards    be wanted    in
the shadowed parts,         the colour may be easily removed by a
 pencil formed of sponge, with water sufficient to produce
 them with as much strength as can be desired ; then stop
 them with the mixture ; wash the sliadow over the touches,
 bringing it to the colour taken off; and, when dry, remove
 she mixture with the oil of turpentine and spirit of wine.
      XV. An        Account   of Mr. Brown's Travels              through
                          Egypt and Syria,         &cc.
                [Continued from   page 414  of the  last Volume.]
  D,"URING           three or four days ensuing,         Mr. Brown    suffered
  so  violent a relapse as to be unable to perform the common
  offices   of life, and even to suppose that it was nearly at an
  end. The moment any symptoms of amendment appeared,
  he sent word        to the   Melek that    he wished to be introduced
  to the Sultan,       and then, as soon as possible,        to be dismissed.
  No reply was        made    to this message ; but the following day
  he came to the tent, with some           of his attendants, and desired
  to   fee  the merchandise he had          brought with him. As to
  part   of the articles,   consisting  of wearing apparel, &c. suited
  to the great, our traveller readily consented : but this was not
  sufficient ; the Melek insisted on seeing the contents of a small
   chest,   which chiefly contained articles          useful to himself,    but
                                                                            not

   not designed for sale. There were also in it some English
   pistols, which he intended to avail himself of as presents ac
   Sennaar, or wherever        else   he might     be able    to penetrate.
  Mr. Brown, therefore, positively         refused    to open    the chest   :
   the Melek threatened      to have it broke open       ;  and, as his at
  tendants were proceeding to do so,          Ali  Hamad, the man who
  attended   Mr. Brown, took         the key from its concealment and
  opened the box.       Every thing was pulled out and examined,
  and   many small articles appeared no more            : the pistols were
  reserved to be taken by the Sultan,           after a violent but fruit
  less altercation at the valuation made by his own servants ;
 and Mr. Brown's telescopes, books of which they knew not
 the use, with his wearing apparel, &c. were graciously less
 him. The valuation was made the following day : the whole
 was estimated at thirty-eight head of slaves, being at the
 market price worth eighty, exclusively of a present of value
 for the Sultan.        A  pair of double-barrelled pistols, silver
 mounted, which cost in London twenty guineas, were valued
 at one slave; which can in general be purchased,                  by those
 who are experienced in that traffic, for the value of fifteen
 piastres in Egyptian commodities.              On this Mr. Brown ex
 claimed, that     if they meant to plunder, and            if bargain  and
 sale were not conducted        in  the country by the consent of rhe
 parties, but by force, it would be better to take the whole
gratis. No answer was made; but the day following two
 camels were brought him as a present.
     The violent manner in which our traveller's property had
been seized, and the general- ill-treatment lit received, had
much augmented his disorder. He had been fifteen days in the
tent exposed to great variations of temperature; and it being
at the close  of the rainy season, he could rarely obtain water lo
drink, though tormented with thirst.               He judged, therefore,
that the only means       of  restoration   were,    to return to Cobbe,
and avail himself os the shelter          of  a clay house and     privacy,
the want of which he had          so sensibly   felt. The Melek, being
in possession of the greater part of his property, having left
him only as much as would supply the wants of a few
months, did not seem very anxious about his stay.                      Mr.
Brown hired      therefore  two Arabs,       and with the camels given
                                                                         to.

                               through        j
                                          Jig pi    and Syria                         fl
to him, and the property that remained, arrived on the third
day at the place from which he had come.     In the intervals
of his illness he visited the chief persons of the place; and as
the eyes of the people became habituated to him, he found
his situation growing somewhat more tolerable.           Though
idle during the course of the winter respecting the immediate
objects of his voyage, he grew, of course, more familiar with
the manners and particular dialect of the country ; for the
Arabic spoken in it differs materially from the vernacular
idiom of Egypt.
   The following summer (1794) Mr. Brown, having in
some degree               recovered      his strength,      determined to go and
reside .for       a    time near the Sultan,             both to supplicate for re
dress    of what           he had already suffered,      any     and to embrace
opportunity that might offer of prefling his request for per
mission to advance.  On his arrival at El Fastier, his good
friend Melek Misellim                    being employed          by his master in the
south,       he went under the protection                   of   the Melek Ibrahim,
one of the oldest persons in authority there, and took up his
lodging in the house of a man named Musa.        During Mr.
Brown's          stay     at   El   Fasher,   of   three    entire months,         he was
solicitous to attend regularly the levees of the Sultan, which
were from fix in the morning till ten ; but could very rarely
obtain admittance, and when he did he had no opportunity
of speaking.   After waiting in fruitless expectation at El
Fastier, when the time of his departure was drawing near, an
accident happened, which, though not of the most pleasing
kind,     contributed to make                  him noticed, and obtained for
him      at length an interview with the Sultan.                        One day, as
he was reading in his hut,                    a female       slave belonging to the
house,   girl about fifteen, came to the door of
             a                                       when,                   it,
from   whim of the moment, he seized the cloth that was
         a
round her waist, which dropped, and left her naked. Chance
so determined that the owner of the slave pasted at that
time, and saw her.  The man immediately threw his turban
on the earth,              and exclaimed — Ye believers             in the Prophet
hear me      !        Ye faithful        avenge    me   !   (with other similar ex-
prefllons        :)   a   Caffrc has violated the property of           a   descendant

 $i               An Account of Mr. Brown* s Travels
 of Mohammed          !   When a number of people was collected
 around    him,   he related the supposed injury he had received in
 the strongest terms, and exhorted them to lake their arms
 and    sacrifice   the Caffre.     He had    charged    a  carbine, and
 affected to come forwards to execute his threats, when some
 one of the company, who had advanced farthest and saw
 Mr. Brown,        called out to the rest that he was armed, and
 prepared to resist.      It was then agreed among the assembly
 that some method of punistiment might be found which pro
 mised more security and profit to the complainant, and would
 be more formidable to the guilty.           The man who         acted as
 his broker was to take the slave as if slie had really been vio
lated, and agreed to pay whatever her master should charge
as the price.        The latter had the modesty to ask ten head
of slaves ; and if Mr. Brown carried the matter before the
Cadi, -which he supposed he would hardly venture to do, he
had suborned witnesses to prove that he had received of him
property to that amount.
    On Mr. Brown's removal from Cobbe to El Fasher, he
had caused his small remaining property, among which were
a few articles     of value, but many of much use to him, to be
lodged in the house of Hossein, the owner of the slave, and
his companion.          On his return thither, which happened a
few days after the accident, he claimed it; but they resisted,
as they alleged, at the suit of his broker, and would not de
liver it till the value of ten slaves sliould be paid to him. Mr.
Brown from the first considered their conduct as so violent
that   if it reached    the ears    of government the claim would
unquestionably be abandoned           ;  and, indeed,    his adversaries
had    rested their     expectations    only on the timidity which
they had been accustomed            to observe   in Christians of the
country, whose accusation and condemnation are in facl the
same.      He had not neglected to give the transaction all the
notoriety he could without having recourse to public autho
rity, and those to whom he had applied were decidedly in his
favour.      He   therefore  now went to his adversaries, Hossein
and    his companion,        and   in their  presence    offered   to Ali
Hamad a promissory          note for the value    of ten   slaves- at the
                                                                 market-

                           through Egypt and Syria.                                           73
market-price on his arrival at Kahira. It was however re
fused ; and his chest, containing some German dollars and
other articles, wa3 still detained. The rest was given up.
   Mr. Brown had been told that the Sultan was apprised of
the transaction previously to his departure from El Fastier,
and that he intended to grant him redress ; but after waiting
about fifteen days without hearing any thing farther of his
intentions, being weary of suffering, he determined to return.
He had been arrived but a sliort time when a fulganaway,
or messenger, came express from Court, with orders for him
to repair to      El    Fastier immediately.                  The object of          the mes
sage was kept a profound secret, nor could he discover whe
ther it portended good or evil. He left Cobbe the same even
ing, and arrived at the end of his journey the day following
about noon.     He repaired as before to the Melek Ibrahim,
who on the             following        day    introduced him              at the      public
audience.         The Sultan,           as    he retired        to the     palace     after it
was over, ordered            all the parties                 to appear.      Being come
within the inner court,                he stopped the white mule on                    which
he was mounted,              and       began      a sliort harangue,             addressing
himself to         Hossein     and       Ali Hamad Mr. Brown's                       servant,
in which he censured,                  in a rapid and energetic style, their
conduct towards him                :   — " One,"   said he, turning to Ali,
"calls himself Wakil of                  the Frank ;           if he   were a  Sherif and
a   Muslim,       as he pretends,             he would know               that the law of
the Prophet permits not a   Muslim to be Wakil to a Caffre :
another casls himself his friend : both are agreed in robbing
him of his property, and usurping the authority of the laws.
Henceforth I am his Wakil, and will protect him."          He
 then ordered the parties to repair to the house of Musa Wul-
lad  Jelsun, Melek of the Jebbs, under whose appropriate
jurisdiction are all foreign merchants.       Mr. Brown here
gives the following account of the                           manner    in which       he had
been before received by the Sultan                       :
      "   On my        first audience,"           fays   Mr. Brown,          "I      was too
ill   to make much observation.                     He       was seated     at   a   distance
from me      ;    the visit was sliort        ;    and   Ihad no opportunity of.
opening    conversation. He
             a                                    was placed on his feat {curji)

my watch and a copy of Erpenius's grammar I had with me.
He asked to fee both ; but after casting his eyes on each, be
returned them. The present I had brought was slievvn him ;
for which he thanked me, and rose to retire.
    "  During the following summer         the first time   I  got ad
mission to him he was holding a divan in the outer court.
He was then mounted on a white mule with a scarlet benijh,
and had on his head a white turban         ;  which however, toge
ther with part of his face, was covered with a thick muslin.
On his feet were yellow boots ; and the saddle on which he
was   seated  was  of crimson velvet, without any ornament of
gold or silver.    His sword, which was broad and straight,
and adorned with a hilt of massy gold, was held horizontally
in his right hand. A small canopy of muslin was supported
over his head.      Amid the noise and hurry of above a thou
sand persons,     who were     there   assembled,    I was   unable to
make myself heard, which the nature of my situation enabled
me to attempt, though not exactly conformable to the eti
quette   of the court, that, almost to the exclusion of strangers,
had appropriated the divan to the troops, the Arabs, and
others connected with the government.
    "  On another    occasion   I contrived to gain admittance to
the interior court by a bribe.          The Sultan was hearing a
cause of a private nature, the proceedings on which were
only in the Furian language. He was seated on a kind of
chair, which was covered with a Turkey carpet, and wore a
red silk turban ; his face was then uncovered ; the imperial
 fvvord was    placed across his knees ;     and his hands were en
gaged with a chaplet      of  red coral.     Being near him, I fixed
 my eyes on him in order to have         a perfect  idea of his coun
 tenance^ which, being sliort-sighted, I had hitherto scarcely
 found an opportunity of acquiring. He seemed evidently dis
 composed    at my having observed him thus, and the moment
 the .cause was at an end he retired very abruptly.              Some
 persons to whom I afterwards remarked the circumstance,
 seemed to    think that his    attendants    had  taught him to fear
 the 'magic of the Franks,     to the operation of which the habit
 of taking likenesses is imagined by some of the Orientals to
 conduce.      He is a man rather under the middle size, of a
                                                           complexion

                          through      Egypt and Syria.                                   75
complexion adust or dry, with eyes                      full of fire,      and features
abounding in expression : his beard is short, but full; and                               hi
countenance,, though perfectly black, materially differing
from the negro : though fifty-five years of age, he possesses
much alertness and activity.
  " At another of my visits                     I   found him in the interior
court, standing with a long staff tipped with silver in his
right hand, on which he leaned, and the sword in his left.
He then        <had    chosen        to adorn his head           with   the folds        of   a
red (ilk turban, composedof the same material as the western
Arabs     use           The Melek Ibrahim presented him,
                 for cincture.

nufacture of Damascus. He returned in answer, Barak ullajil
May the blessing of God be on him ! a phrase in general use
on receiving any favour ; and instantly retired, without giv
ing me time to urge the request, of which I intended the
offering mould be the precursor. It is expected of all persons,
that, on coming to El Fasher, they should bring with them a
present of greater or less value according to the nature of the
business in hand. It is no less usual, before leaving the royal
residence,       to ask   permission        of      the Sultan for that purpose.
With this        latter form, which was to me unpleasant,                        I   some
times complied, but more frequently omitted it.                             But on this
occasion,       having been           long resident there,
                                                       sit to       I   thought
make a last effort to promote my design.  The day preceding
that which I had fixed for my return, happened to be a great
public audience. I found the monarch seated on his throne
{curfi) under a lofty canopy, composed not of one material,
but of various stuffs of Syrian and even Indian fabric, hung
loosely on a light frame              of wood, no two             pieces    of   the fame
pattern.         The    place    he fat in was spread with small                  Turkey
carpets    ;    the Meleks were seated at some distance on the right
and left ; and behind them a line                   of guards, with caps orna
mented         in front with a small            piece   of copper and a black
ostrich feather.          Each bore         a   spear in his hand, and a target
of   the hide      of   the hippopotamus on the opposite arm                         :   their
dress consisted only            of   a cotton shirt  of the manufacture of
the country.            Behind        the   throne were fourteen or fifteen
eunuchs, clothed indeed                 splendidly        in;   habiliments      of cloth
                                            La                                         or

of hired encomiast stood on the monarch's left hand, crying
out    plein gorge during the whole ceremony :— " See the

phant of superior strength ; the powerful Sultan Abd-el-

this audience, and those which preceded      was obliged to     it,

   Mr. Brown's reception with Musa Wullad Jelfun was
very different from that which he had experienced in the
house of Misellim or Ibrahim. His behaviour towards him
was complacent, and he affected to seek opportunities of
hearing his sentiments on such subjects as occurred.  In
obedience to the Sultan's command, Mr. Brown now gave
in   an exact statement           of the property         he had lost,   and sub
stantiated    the proof         by
                            strongest circumstantial evidence.

&c. which had been violently with-held.      The plunder
which had fallen into the hands of his servant, and his ac
complice, was not            so
                     easily restored. The Melek, tired of                          a
gratuitous justice, began to think that   lucrative composi a
tion was more eligible.   The offenders, who had been obsti
nate in the first instance, seeing how the cause relative to
the jarea (female slave) had been decided, thought proper to
offer to the Melek marks of their gratitude for the lenity they
expected     from him      ;    and the Sultan was unwilling to ima
gine that the sufferings of    Caffre could fall heavy on him
                                           a
self at the day of final retribution.   At length the Melek,
¦who in reality was supreme arbiter of the contest,   contented
himself with giving Mr. Brown the intrinsic value, about four
head   of   slaves, instead          of twenty-four or twenty-five,            which
at first he had unequivocally declared due to him, and pro
mised he should receive. Thus the matter was terminated.

XVI.        Description    of      the Paliorum Lacus, or Lake Palius, in
        the Valley      of Noto in Sicily.         By M. Dolomieu *.
 T HIS
  -•¦           small but very remarkable lake, situated                             at the
distance  of two miles west from the town of Palagonia, or of
a mile from Mineo, is surrounded      by volcanic mountains,
aud lies in a small plain somewhat hollow towards the mid
dle. This plain is half surrounded by steep rocks, which
give it the appearance of a monstrous crater, that has funk
down by some convulsion.      The lake is placed in its centre,
and, as it were, in the middle of a funnel.     Its depth often
varies, and consequently its circumference.  In the winter
time it may be about sixty or seventy fathoms in diameter,
and about ten in depth ; but in summer, when great drought
prevails, it is often entirely dry. At the period when I saw
it,which was in the month of May,        formed an oval about
                                                        it
thirty fathoms   in  length  and  twenty in breadth  its depth           :
was about five or six.       had    strong smell of Jew's pitch,

                                   a                The water in
its colour inclined   little to green, and had an exceedingly
                               a
nauseous and disagreeable taste.      was told that the water was
                                               I
often tepid    ;   but    it   had, at the time when         I   examined            it,   the
temperature        of   the atmosphere.            In   several parts      of   it
                                                                                 I         ob
served  violent bubbling, and particularly in four places near
         a
the middle.   This bubbling was stronger at certain intervals,
and the water was thrown                     up sometimes        to the height              of
two or three feet,      rising in this manner every                        five or six
minutes.        There are periods when this boiling                        is   stronger
or weaker;         but on these occasions              no other noise           is   heard
than that produced             by   the motion    of the water.
  When the lake           dry, one may without danger examine
                           is
its centre,     where there are several deep holes. From these
holes currents       of air, somewhat warm, continually
                                               arise, and
throw back sand and other bodies   put into them.   if                                It    is

with foam.           It would, no doubt,
                                   be important to examine
accurately the natureof this vapour ; but though I was pro
vided with the proper apparatus, I could not obtain my ob
ject,   because       I                   into the water in
                          durst not venture to wade
order to reach the places where the bubbling appeared, and
which were at a considerable distance from the bank.
   The mud           at the bottom and on the bank,            which   has a
black colour, is tenacious, and smells like pitch. A little
petroleum has also been sometimes found at the surface of
the water. The whole soil of the small plain consists of
black, tough, resinous, inflammable earth. A few years ago
some straw huts in this neighbourhood having been set on
fire, the fire was communicated to the ground, which burnt
with a whitish dull flame, like that of the inflammable springs
in Dauphiny, during several months, and was extinguished
with the greatest difficulty, as the fire, when destroyed in
one place, broke out in another.         Since that period great
care is taken not   to kindle fire in the neighbourhood.     From
this phenomenon I am induced to think, that the air which
rises through the water of the lake, and which probably finds
i. passage through the ground, may be of an inflammable
nature also ; as the air of marshes, which burns without any
 noise. The fertility of this small plain is so great, that it pro
duces     a most          abundant crop every year, without
                                                      requiring
much agricultural care. In walking over the ground a hollow
noise is heard ; which seems a proof of there being beneath
the surface subterranean cavities, like those of Solfatara near
Puzzuolo.            From these circumstances there is reason to think
 that this place has been formed from the remains of a fallen
 crater, a part of which is still seen in the surrounding moun
 tains ; and between this lake and that of Agnano near Na
 ples, there is no other difference than the greater quantity of
 water in the one, and the more violent efflux of vapour in
 the other.    Some assert that the vapour of this lake is mor
 tal      that no bird, or other animal, can be exposed to it
       ; and
 without being killed.   The vapour also which arises from
 the ground is considered as of a suffocating nature, so that
 people who lie down on the earth, or only bend their bodies
 towards       it,   are exposed    to the   greatest danger   3   though one

may walk over it without the least fear of any pernicious con
sequences.         All these phenomena have a great similarity to
those    of  the Grotto del Cane, near the lake Agnano.
     On   the banks     of  the lake Palius     there   are found   a great
many small clusters of          asties and slag,    exactly like those ad
hering to the sides        of the  craters  of Ætna    and Vesuvius. The
mountains and lava around this lake exhibit the most evident
marks of their great antiquity, as in many places they are
covered with calcareous stones, from which it may with cer
 tainty be inferred that they must have originated at a time
 when the present continent was not inhabited.                  In the time
 of Diodorus Siculus, however, the crater, which forms the
 present bason      of  the lake, shewed       traces   of its internal   in
 flammation       :  as we are       informed by this historian, that
 flames     burst   forth from this spot ; that the water possesled a
 considerable degree of warmth ; and that a horrid thundering
 noise was heard.          Being extremely desirous to know whether
 a connection actually existed between               this volcano and that
  of Ætna,      as they are at no great       distance   from each other,
  I  enquired whether any affinity had ever been observed be
  tween     the eruptions of Ætna and she before-described phe
  nomena of the lake ; and whether, during these eruptions, a
  stronger ebullition had taken place: but I was assured that
  no person had ever observed any thing of the kind.
      The phenomena of this lake have at all times been at
  tended     with    so  many singularities as to give rife to fables
  without number         :  at present it is said to be inhabited by a
  fairy.     In  ancient times these phenomena were ascribed to
  the supernatural       power and influence of some deity. On this
   account a very celebrated temple, the remains of which                    I
   could not find, notwithstanding all the trouble I took to dis
   cover   them, was erected           here  to   Jupiter  and   the nymph
   Thalia. People       swore also by this lake, with the fame respect
   and solemnity as by the river Styx.                 What astonished the
   ancients, and what even at present excites the wonder of ali
   those who visit this lake, is the incessant ebullition of the
   water, though the least increase is not observed in it on the
   bank.
      In  the neighbouring         mountains     I found under the lava a
                                                                     resinous

could be easily divided into laminae of from one to two inches

exhibits nothing but what has been seen in the other extin
guished volcanoes in the neighbourhood.                The Val di Noto
is the only part of Sicily where traces of ancient volcanoes
are found.      Travellers,   who imagined that they found some
of the like kind in other provinces, were either mistaken, or
suffered themselves     to be deceived by false marks.
XVII.     Observations    on the Nature      of the Fog of 1783. By
   M. De Lam anon, Correspondent of the Academy of Set"
   ences  at Paris  *.
w.       HEN      this fog, which may be called an electric fog,
began to appear, I was at Sallon de Crau, in Provence.                In
order   to  free  my neighbours      and    countrymen    from   uneasi
ness as much       as possible,   I  wrote a letter to      M. Artaud,
editor of the Courier d' Avignon, in which, after speaking of
the nature of the fog, I said it would be destroyed by the
storms that would not fail to ensue. The event fully justified
this kind of prediction.         Having learned from the public
papers that this phenomenon was not local, but almost ge
neral throughout Europe,        I made new observations,       and tra
versed the     highest Alps of Provence, Dauphiny, and Pied
mont j and, during the course of my travels, collected inform
ation respecting the fog, and the effects of the thunder. But
before I offer that explanation of the phenomenon, which
appears to me most probable,         let me endeavour to give         an,
accurate description     of it.
          I.  Nature and Effells      of the Eleclric Fog.
   1.  In almost all   countries the fog was preceded by       a  storm.
   2.  It began the    fame day at places very remote from each
other;    as  Paris, Sallon,    Turin, Padua, &c. where it ap
peared, for the first time, on the 18th        of June. M. Senebier
                    t  From the Journal   de Physique.
                                                                   wrote

                                    on the  Fog of 1783.                81
                     Observations
 fyrote to the       Count dc Saluces, perpetual president of the
 Academy of Turin, that the fog was observed at Geneva on
  the 17th.      I read in the Ajfiches of Dauphiny, that it be
 gan at Grenoble on the 21st.
     3. A north wind prevailed in several places when the fog
 began ; and in other places, where it began the fume day, a
 south wind prevailed.          The fog, after having ceased, re-ap
 peared     in  some places by the north wind ; in others, by an
 east, west, or south     wind.
     4. The    atmosphere was not every where equally dry.             At
 Sallon   I  observed that it did not make salts enter into deliques
 cence; did not raise the hygrometer; did not prevent eva
 poration from being abundant ; and did not even tarnisti
 glass,  which      I exposed to it.     The salt-pits    at Hyercs,    in
 Provence, crystallised       a fortnight sooner than usual by the
effect of the fog.       Messrs. Toaldo and Senebier observed, the
one at Padua and the other at Geneva, that the hygrometer
did not reach         the point which      denotes   humidity.     In the
Champsaur os Dauphiny, and at Turin, the fog was some
times humid.
    5. The fun, which was never seen but through the fog,
appeared very pale in the day-time; of a blood-red colour at
 rising, and still more so at setting.
    6. At Sallon the fog sometimes diffused a very disagreeable
smell, difficult to be determined, and which some believed
to be sulphureous.         This   bad smell was perceived       in other
places.
    7.  It  was hurtful    to the eyes.     At Sallon,   persons   whose
lunsrs   were    weak, found disagreeable effects from it. The
inhabitant.-? of the Champsaur informed me thai several peo
ple in that neighbourhood            had  violent pains in the head ;
and that, in general,       they partly lost their appetite.     The in
habitants of this valley arc the greatest eaters in France:

eat almost as much as they, and are not so nice as usual in

fog ripened     the corn, and was favourable       to the harvest.   The

peasants    beheld, with the greatest satisfaction, the effect of
the fog on their crops     ; and yet were afraid of it.         In Upper
Dauphiny,      and at Turin, it blighted several fields of wheat,
and rendered copper buttons green. In other places it dried
the plants.
     9. At Padua, Turin, Paris, Sallon, Grenoble, the baro
meter remained almost always stationary at the point which
denotes its mean state.
     10. There were some days remarkably warm ; but, in ge
neral, the months of June and July were almost every where
less warm than usual.        That year there was no summer on
the high mountains of Provence and Dauphiny, where the
sliepherds of the plains of Crau and Camargue tend annually
numerous flocks.
     11.  There were     every   where storms of rain         ;  and    after
these storms the fog sometimes         increased,  but most frequently
was diminished.
     12.  During   the whole time     of the fog, an electric machine
 1 had at Sallon emitted       few or no sparks.            A philosophic-
friend at Sorgues, near Avignon, wrote to me, that his elec
 trometer always indicated a great deal of electricity in the
 atmosphere.
     13.  On  the 4th of July, at five in the morning, M. Nico
 las, physician at Grenoble, and M. Plana, apothecary, took
 four measures of fog and mixed them with two measures of
 nitrous air : the absorption was i-4th, and nothing remained
 but a gas, in which a candle became extinguished several
 times.     Atmospheric air generally contains nearly r-3d of
 pure    air (oxygen gas), and 2~3ds of mephitic air (azotic
 gas). Fontana's eudiometer gave the fame result on the 7th
 of July : of three hundred parts of atmospheric air, thirty-two'
 were absorbed.     '
                      The air of   the fog, mixed with inflammable
  (hydrogen) gas,     did  not   prevent it from exploding when a
 lighted taper was presented to the neck of the bottle in which
                                                        •

      14. Almost all those who have spoken os this fog, fay that
  it was low.     When I was on the top of Mount VentouX,
  however, nearly 1040 toises above the level of the             sea,   I saw
  it far above me,      M. Senebicr savs, in his letter           to  Count
                                            8                              de

de Saluces, that         it was seen in the Alps at an elevation
greater    than that of Mount Saleve, which rises 601 toise*
above the sea.         On the 22d of September (1783) I ascended
the highest      Alps of Dauphiny, to the height of 1660 toises
above the     sea. (No one has yet been higher in Europe.) The
shepherds,       who served me       as guides,   all assured   me that this
fog had however         passed  over these mountains.
    15. The lowest part of the fog was the thickest and driest.
I  assured myself of this by proceeding from the borders of
the sea to the summits         of the   highest mountains.
    16.  It  is probable,     according to every account, that this
fog overspread almost all Europe, the islands of the Mediter
ranean, and a part of Africa.             It covered the whole Adriatic
Sea,    but extended only to the distance of 1 00 leagues on the
ocean.      It was properly a continental fog.
   17. The thunder this year (1783) occasioned great devas
tation.     In Provence       and    Dauphiny alone it killed nearly
sixty persons, and a great number of animals.                  I have found
no instance of its falling and doing mischief in places higher
than 450 toises above the level of the sea.                It would be too
tedious to insert here the name of every place, which I noted
down in my journal, where I learned that the thunder fell.
It will be sufficient to relate the most singular effects it pro
duced, and such         as may add to our knowledge respecting the
nature    of  these terrible meteors.
   According        to Pliny, Plutarch,      Seneca,  &c.    the olive, sig-
tree, and laurel, are never struck by lightning.              Porta adopted
this opinion,       which    was that of all the ancients.            Toaldo
fays also,    it  is only those trees which contain resin           that can
perhaps    escape the danger of thunder; such as the olive-tree,
laurel,   fir,   and some others of the like kind.               This, in all
probability, is the foundation of the practice, common among
the populace,        of keeping in their      houses, and placing on the
summits of steeples and at the corners of fields, branches ot
olive that have been blessed, and of burning them in their
houses during storms.           It  is possible, and even probable, that
trees   of this kind may        be less frequently struck by lightning
than those which contain           a great deal   of aqueous juices ; but
I  can assert, that these preservatives           of the ancients are not

equal to our conductors.          On the 21st of June the lightning
burnt the leaves of a fig-tree, and all the bark of an olive-
tree, in the territory of Sallon; and I learned that the fame
thing    had happened      formerly,     and that    there even had been
fig-trees and olive-trees split and tore to pieces by thunder.
     There is some kind of thunder, fays Seneca, accompanied
with    a loud report, by which         men fall dead, and some be
come stunned       and    lose their senses.        In   1783  I saw several
instances    which confirm the truth of this observation. At
Pellisanne in particular, which is scarcely a league from Sal
lon, the thunder,      attracted    by an iron cross, killed two per
sons, and deprived several others, as it were, of their fenses.
The fame thing happened at Freiffinouse, in Dauphiny.
     Thunder sometimes, savs Seneca, renders wine frozen and
congealed.      Of   the two persons killed by the thunder at Pel
lisanne, one lost immediately -all his natural heat, and the body
 was found extremely cold.              Thunder      must sometimes       pro
duce these effects by occasioning            a strong    and speedy evapo-t
ration.
     Bodies struck by thunder, fays Plutarch, do not corrupt :
dogs and birds do not eat them.                  This may sometimes be
the cafe, but    I know      several examples      of  the contrary*.      On
 the day of the fair of Villefranche (Julv 22d) the thunder
 killed a mule, which corrupted so soon that it was found
 necessary to remove it.        About eight or nine years ago, se
 veral sheep were killed by lightning on the mountain of Se-
 dcron in Provence       ;  and the shepherds abstained, for a long
 time, from approaching the phice, on account of the bad
 smell which they emitted.             On the i ft of July, about four
 in   the  afternoon, the lightning fell at Camentras on the
 Lazaret, (a place where those who died of the plague were
 formerly buried,) and set sire to the wood-work.                   '{Tic fire
 being communicated to several quintals of gunpowder, an
 explosion took plate, by which five persons were killed and
 fifteen wounded.       The fame flash of lightning traversed the
 convent of the Carmelites,           and melted part       of the seissars  of
 the   prior: it killed  also a cow, which was eaten without any
 bad consequence.

  Towards the end of the month of June, the cure of EsoU
nouse, in Provence, standing at the door of the church in
order to exorcise the thunder, was killed, as well as his maid
servant and his clerk.  At Mane, in Provence, the bell-ringer
was killed by it.  On the 26th of August the lightning was
attradted by the iron cross on the church of Sigoger du Hai,
in Dauphiny ; and, going round it both on the inside and
outside,frightened the ringer so much that he swore                                             he
would never return thither again in the time of a storm.                                        At
Pernes, in the Comtat, it overturned a cross. This cross, the
remains of which I saw, was of white calcareous stone, and
fastened by a bar            of iron t0 a column of coquilliere stone* of
a yellowish colour.              The iron had disappeared ; a part of the
column was            sliivered, and blocks of it carried to the distance
of more than twenty-five paces.
  At Aix the thunder dried up a beam, and left in one place
only the fibrous part. At Freslinousc, in Dauphiny, it killed
two oxen         ; deprived       a   labourer of his fenses, and carried away
one    of his toe-nails.               I must here remark, that his shoes
were      shod with          iron.       -A-t   La Motte du Caise, in Provence,
it   entered       at a window,            where there was no iron, and went
out at the chimney.   At                   Claret it unsaddled an ass without
doing  him  any hurt, and carried the packsaddle to a consi
derable distance. In several places, and particularly at Ba-
non in Provence, the lightning tore off the hair from the
heads of several women.    At Saint Cristol, in Provence, it
carried away the half of a girl's body. At Avignon it carried
away the half of a cat.   I had this fact from M. Sauvan,
who on that day (June 21       observed the ball on the steeple
                                               st)
of the Grands Augustins of Avignon covered with                                       a   crown
of light, which continued three quarters of an hour,                                   and dis
appeared at eleven at night.
     On the                 of July                                                   of hail

 86               Observations        on the  Fog of 1783.
Jjke phenomena were observed the same day in several othef
places. In several villages through which I passed, I was
shewn    a great      number of trees stripped of their bark by
die thunder ; and I remarked that the part of the bark, or
wood, carried away, was almost always broad at the bottom
of the  tree, and narrow at the summit.                It would   seem as   if
the lightning had met with obstacles, and that it had not
the fame foree when it attacked the higher parts of the tree.
In my opinion       the thunder which produced these effects was
all ascending ; and I often observed holes at the roots of the
tTees which had been deprived of their bark.                I observed also
that dr)- land had been less struck with the lightning than
moist land, which induces me to believe that the greater part
ot the thunder that year was ascending.
        II.  Thoughts on the Origin           of the EleSfric Fog.
   Several philosophers adopted the opinion of the populace,
and considered this fog as a natural effect of the earthquake
which laid waste Sicily and a part of Calabria.                       Toaldo
thought that all these exhalations were brought from Cala
bria and Sicily bv the winds which blew from the south
ward : but this respectable philosopher, at the time when
be wrote, did not know that the fog was almost                       general
throughout Europe.            Besides, the earthquakes in Calabria
and Sicily took place chiefly in February, and the fog did not
appear till the middle of June; that is to fay, till more than
four months after. In my opinion, then, this fog was not
occasioned    by   the earthquakes         of Calabria     and Sicily ; but
the fog and these earthquakes, as well as thole which we are
assured took place      in Iceland,       had a common cause,          which
produced different effects according as they were modisied
by circumstances and the nature of the places.                 Let us now
search  for this  cause   ;   we  shall  find  it in the  annals  of mete-,
oroloey,   and nothing is necessary but to distinguish             it.
   I have said, in another place *, that the constitution of the
atmosphere depends chiefly on the nature and form of the
ground, and that the revolutions             cf the air  are subject to the

Involutions of the earth, over which they have an influence
in their turn.           If  we consider the different bodies or sub
stances of which that part of the earth known to us is conu
posed, We shall fee that, notwithstanding                   their apparent rest*
 they all obey, as we may fay, an intestinal motion ; and
that this motiorl gives continual rife to new composition*
and combinations, the connection of which escapes us, but
 which nevertheless exist.             The remains of animals            and ve-    .
getabics        still  distinguishable,     and     which     occupy so much
 room in our globe ;           the acids which attack them ; the aeri->
 form fluids disengaged             from them       ;  the metals and pyrite9
 brought to perfection, or decomposed ; the sires separated, of
 collected ; the fermentations and effervescences ; in a word,
 the innumerable             decompositions and          recompositions of all
 the parts        of the earth, furnish abundance of              subtle matter,
 which, by its levity, disengages itself at the surface of the
 globe, cannot, in certain circumstances, resist the gravity of
 the air, and rises sometimes to the summit of the atmosphere.
 On     the other hand, the rains which fall, moist fogs,                 and   se
 veral     other causes, make           a  part    of the water, which          de
 taches itself from the air, to penetrate              the earth, and to com
 bine with the substance               of  these exhalations.         It is  after
  wards, in part, attracted by the external heat, or repelled by
  the heat of the earth itself; but it never returns to the atmo
  sphere      as   pure as it was when        it  issued    from it.    It carries
  with     it   a great     part  of that    subtle    matter of which      I have
  spoken ; and         it is this afterwards       which      produces thunder,
  and     almost      all fiery  meteors.        There     is then a continual
  communication from the earth to the atmosphere, and from
  the atmosphere to the earth. The greater part of these ex
  halations,        in general, is specifically heavier than the atmo
   spheric air; and, if they are not impregnated with a certain
  quantity of water, they cannot quit the earth. They must
   necessarily      be there collected, and accumulate to a greater or
  Jess depth in the time          of  great droughts.
      Let     us now consult our registers, and those of different ob
   servers, and we shall see that there had prevailed, at least for
   nine vears,        an   extreme    drought, not only in Europe, but
   also  in Africa       and America.       This was announced year after
                                                                               year

     88                Observations     on the Fog    of iffy,
    year by our domestic as well as foreign gazettes ; and we
    may conclude so from the minute observations of the cele
   brated Van Swinden, and the tables published by Toaldo^
    Cotte, Beraud, Beguelin de Romily, &c. Sometimes, in
    deed,   rain took place in one country or other; but in gene
    ral, till the preceding winter, an extraordinary drought pre
    vailed. It began about 1774, and in the month of June 178*
    was extremely great in Italy and in our southern provinces.
    We experienced at that period a suffocating heat ; the earth,
   as we may fay, seemed to be on fire, and, in the Plain of
   Camargue, scorched the feet of the reapers to such a degree ,
   that they were obliged at length to walk upon straw : several
   died of heat with the sickles in their hands, and there were
.  a great many sick.         In a word, the drought and heat were so
   excessive,   that,  at  two  leagues from Sallon, the spiders, which
   in general are not venomous, occasioned by their bite violent
   diseases, which had a great affinity to those occasioned by the
   bite of the tarantula.
      In  consequence       of this   great   drought, the exhalations of
  the earth, specifically heavier           than the air, and deprived of
  that humidity which serves them                as a  vehicle, remained in
  the bosom       of   the earth, where they must have formed im
  mense accumulations.            The wintcrof       1782
                                                          — 1783  was rainy,
  particularly      in Calabria       and    Sicily ; and   the  Alps   were
  covered      with   a great    deal  of  snow.     The spring  also was in
   general    rainy.    The water      then being filtered into the bowels
  of   the earth, was at first absorbed by the very dry exhalations
  there confined.         This humidity,       added to the warmth    of the
  spring, no doubt occasioned           effervescences and fermentations;
  so that the    exhalations, disengaging themselves with violence,
  in certain places convulsed the earth, as was the cafe in Ca
  labria and Sicily. In proportion as the water filtered into the
  earth by its own weight, it found new exhalations, which,
  by disengaging themselves, occasioned new convulsions, but
  less considerable       on account of the less abundance of these
  exhalations.        In   places   where they were heated by their
  mixture, they liquefied (tones, and threw up volcanic islands,
  as in Iceland.         In the last place, these subtle exhalations

 plied halos, paraselena and parhelia observed that year.                         The
 heat increasing, and the earth continuing to furnish exhala
 tions in proportion to the preceding humidity, these were
 communicated to the atmosphere in a manner almost insen
 sible    : but the atmosphere being at length saturated,                        these
 exhalations       underwent new decompositions ; storms                         were
 formed,       the atmosphere          was cooled, and suffered to escape a
 part of these exhalations, which fell again towards the earth,
 and in one day Europe was covered with a dry fog *. Local
 circumstances,           in regard to moisture, winds, and clouds,
exempted certain places from it for some time.                            The earth,
however, continuing to surnisli exhalations, and these being
united to those which the atmosphere, as we may fay, had
 deposited, descending              and ascending thunder were seen till
 the exhalations of the earth and the atmosphere were con
sumed.         The    atmosphere          being gradually purified, and the
source      of   the   exhalations exhausted, the earth ceased to be
 convulsed.
XVIII.        Report on the Conversion of Soft Iron into Cast Steel
      by means nf the Diamond.                Read in the French National

   1 HE        Class will recollect the account which                  I gave of the
grand experiment of              the combustion        of  the diamond in oxy
gen gas in the focus               of   the lens   of Tschirnhausen,         and the
new facts which            I  thence deduced        respecting      the true nature
of    the diamond       ;   plumbago, which is its oxyd in the first
degree;       carbon,      which     is its oxyd in the second degree; and
the carbonic acid, which is the produce of its complete oxy-
    *
       The   fame   fog,   I  presume, took     place in America,     where there had.
been great complaint         of drought for eight years.       It was not Hen in the
optn sea, because     it was absorbed      by the water:    for this reason it did not
appear in countries      where the sky was overspread with clouds.

90             On the Conversion of Iron into Cajl Steel
 gcuation.        They   suggested    to our brother,      C. Clouet,    the
 idea   of  searching for a confirmation of a new kind, by trying
 to make soft iron pass to the state of steel by cementation
 with    the diamond.
     It has hitherto been considered as cert-tin, that iron does
 not melt but bv passing to the state of steel or cast iron.            But
 in what state docs the carbon enter into that combination ?
 It might      be conjectured, that it is in the state       of plumbago,
 or oxyd of the first degree; since that which is separated by
 acids    exhibits the brilliant blackness and incombustibility
 which form its principal characters.              Hence some were in-1
 clined to conclude, that the carbon entered into this union in
 the   state   of an oxidule; that consequently the carbon em
 ployed    in   the cementation of steel began by deoxydating it
 self to a certain degree.         This was even in some measure
-proved    ;  as the   carbon employed for this operation was in
 deed found to have a more brilliant aspect, and nearly resisted
 incineration, like carbon in a mass burnt in close vessels.
 But if carbon really burns in            the    cementation of iron, it
 ought to disengage         from it oxygen gas.         This is a question
 which I have endeavoured to resolve by experiment.
     I cemented small bits of iron in a porcelain retort, which
 in   the preceding operation had received             a vitreous  coating,
 and    which      consequently   was    no longer permeable to air.,
 These fragments were all surrounded, on every side, by char
 coal of beech pulverised, and very dry.               The retort was put
 into the reverberating furnace, and a tube connected to it
 and carried under a receiver silled with mercury.               There was
 disengaged       a  quantity of elastic fluid, composed of carbo
 nated     hydrogenous gas and carbonic acid gas, the last of
 which     was at first only    evil in bulk    ;  towards the middle of
 the experiment,        CV13 ;  and at the end, CV15.
    The     conversion    of iron   into  steel   being found only little
 advanced,       after  three   hours and    a  half  exposure to the sire,
 we put the fame iron and the fame carbon again into the
 retort, and exposed it to the heat of a three-blast-furnace.
 This time there was only a very small quantity of gas; but
 it was still carbonated       hydrogenous gas mixed with carbonic
 acid gas, and always with the fame progression               of the latter;
                                                                      which

                        by  Means     of ihc Diamond.                        91
 which made at first only CV07 of volume, while the last por
 tions contained cri2.         The iron on this occasion was con
 verted into steel, and even the fragments had united by a
 commencement         of fusion.
    It was very probable that a part of the carbonic acid, col
lected in this operation, might have been formed at the ex-
pence of the remaining carbon and with disengaged oxygen ;
but the constant presence os the hydrogen only served to in
dicate the difficulty of freeing the carbon entirely from the
last portion   of water it contained.           I sliall here take occasion
to observe,     that this experiment seems not at all reconcile-
able   with the opinion       of some chemists, that hydrogen has
more affinity than carbon for oxygen : an opinion which
they found on this circumstance, that carbon is precipitated,
in Volta's eudiometer, when             a mixture of oxygen gas and
carbonated     hydrogen gas        is  made    to detonate, if a quantity
of  oxygen    sufficient    to acidify the two bases has not been
employed.       I  fay,   that  this affinity was not exerted in my
experiment:      for it cannot be doubted that the temperature
was high enough           to reproduce       water by the union of the
oxygen and hydrogen \ and we can here fee nothing which
could decide a preference of the oxygen for the carbon.
    These considerations        seemed to me sufficient to create a
new interest      in   regard    to the experiment proposed            by C.
 Clouet.    I  did not hesitate,        therefore,    to Employ in it one
of   the diamonds preserved         in the cabinet      of  the Polytechnic
school, according to the leave granted by the Council ; being
persuaded that if it disappeared in the operation, merely by
exposure to a high temperature,            in contact with iron, without
the accession    of  the air or any other oxygenating substance,
the fact thereby established          would leave no room to regret
having sacrificed it.
    Citizen Clouet       had   himself prepared a small crucible of
soft iron, forged on purpose out of picked heads of nails. Its
form was a solid of eight planes. (Plate II. fig. 3). Itwas shut
by a stopper of the fame iron well adjusted. (Fig. 4.)
    This crucible     was to be placed in a Hessian            crucible, sur-
niffied with    a cover      well luted.       This     was   all  the  appa
ratus for the experiment.           I cannot     give a better    idea of  the
                                      N 2                               result

       into Steel by the Diamond.
       "  The diamond employed weighed 907 milligrammes. .As
  jt did not entirely occupy the crucible,                 we silled it with
  filings of the fame iron as that of which it             was formed.      The
  crucible was         shut by its iron Hopper, which was forcibly
  thrust home,        that as little air as possible might remain in
  the inside.
                                                                      Grammes.

 cible was placed alone, and without the addition of any sur
 rounding matter, in a very small Hessian crucible, and the
 latter in     a second     crucible of the same earth        ;  but the space
 between       the two latter crucibles was filled with siliceous sand
 free from all ferruginous particles.               In   the  last place, the
 large     crucible was luted         with    earth  arising from pounded
 crucibles       and    unbaked clav,       and the whole was exposed
 about an hour lo          a three-blast-forge sire.
      •'
          The whole being cooled, we found, in the interior Hes
 sian crucible, the iron converted into an ingot of cast steel.
 (See fig. 5 )         It formed, with the stopper and filings, but
 one round       mass    well terminated, some few globules excepted,

\n order    to ascertain the nature os the iron employed.

     <e The iron and the diamond weighed, before                    the opera
 tion, 58.707 grammes; from which it follows that there was
 a loss of iron about 2.423 grammes. This iron had given to
 the Hessian crucible the colour of plumbago.
              "  (Signed)      Clouet, Welter, Hachette."
     The fusion of the iron being so far perfect as to shew on
 its surface the rudiments of the most beautiful crystallisation,
 it is not possible to think that any part of the diamond could
 have remained in the inside untouched, or that it was not in
 the most intimate state of combination.                   The difference of
 the specific gravity opposes such an idea *.
     Thus the diamond disappeared by the affinity which iron
 exercised on it bv the help of the high temperature to which
 they were both exposed, in the same manner as a metal dis
 appears in the allay of another metal.
     The diamond, therefore, has furnished here the same prin
 ciple  as  carbon, since the product of the union has the fame
 properties.
     The conversion into steel is not doubtful. The ingot hav
ing    been polished on a lapidarv's wheel, a drop of weak ni
trous acid immediately produced a dark-grey spot, absolutely
like that exhibited on English cast steel, and on cast steel
 produced by the process of C. Clouet.                Those who have often
 tried steel by this kind of proof, long ago pointed out by
 Rinmann, had occasion to remark, that the spot of cast steel,
 though very sensible, is however less black than that of steel
 made by cementation, which depends perhaps on the different
 degree   of oxydation of     the carbon which they have taken               in.

         A  DISEASED         LIVER CURED BY VITAL AIR.
   J. HE     butler of Colonel Ironside, who had been long resi
 dent in India, laboured for several years under a well-marked
 liver complaint.        He had been under the care of Dr. War-
 jen,   and other physicians, without experiencing any essential
 advantage.        Colonel TconiiJe, as all other means had been
 ineffectual, wished him lo try the vital air. He accordingly
 came under my care, and the same tonics were employed as
he had before taken        i therefore I ascribe the cure to the vital
air, which was conjoined with these, and which soon com
pletely restored him to health ; and lie has continued well-
now above a twelvemonth.
                                Observations.
    When animals         placed in pure vital air were      destroyed by
so    powerful     a stimulus,     Dr.   Beddoes   found the liver not
liver-coloured,       but of  a  florid red.    We   therefore   can easily
suppose it to act on this organ when given in a moderate
way : and as the oxy'ds of mercury and the nitrous acid,
which     are. the best remedies      for this disease, act chiefly from
their contained oxygen, it is probable that the vital air will
hereafter be found a specific in this complaint, possessing su
perior advantages over both these remedies, and will super-
cede them, although it cannot be put up into two-ounce
phials, the principal objection railed against it;             for the airs
can now (which originated from my suggestion)                 be confined
in barrels, and bottled off as easily as wine : and            I  must  obr  .
serve, that this patient had a barrel of vital air,             containing
24    gallons,  which    cost  him   one  guinea,   conveyed    for him to
his master's     feat  in   the  country,   and  a tin  pneumatic appa
ratus for inhaling the medicinal air, which stood him at the
low rate of thirty shillings; which improvements, I trust,
will grcatlv facilitate the general application of pneumatic
medicine, when it will be sure to find that level its merits-
entitle it to.

          the 16th    of April last the Electoral Academy of Sci
           Manheim held a public fitting in commemoration,
of   its deceased founder the      Elector Charles Theodore,    who"
died on the 17th     of February. On this occasion Mr. M. Col-         -
lini, a member      of the Society, read a printed oration on the
vicissitudes of the Academy.         The most flourisliing period of
this institution was that between the time of its establish
ment and the year 1777, when the Palatinate family got pos-
 sesfion of Bavaria, and Charles Theodore transferred his re
 sidence   from Manheim to Munich.             It wag not, however,
 left destitute of support ; but its distance from the electoral
 court rendered many things impossible, which, under other
 circumstances, might have been accomplished.             Still more
 prejudicial to the Academy, as well as the whole Palatinate,
 was the war which        broke out afterwards, between France
 on the one side, and the German Empire and Austria on the
 other.     Manheim was bombarded three times, viz. in De
  cember 1794, November 1795, and January 1798; and as
 often was it necessary to remove the library of the Academy,
  as well as its papers, he. to a place of safety, and to arrange
  them.     The sittings and labours    of the members were inter
  rupted ; the palace, assigned to them for holding their meet
  ings, was in part burnt ; and as the revenues destined for the
  support of the institution arise from possessions on the left
  bank of the Rhine, if these remain in the hands of the
  French, it is to be apprehended, that, like many other esta
  blishments of the fame kind on the right bank of that river,
  which had their revenues on the other fide, it will decline
  unless supported by the new regent.        Among its most dist.n*

  according to a plan of the learned Schiipflin, and divided
  into two classes, the Historical and Physical ; the latter of
 which, in the year 1780, was subdivided into the Physical
  (properly so called) and Meteorological.         The collection of
  the papers     of the Academy have been published in eleven

                     SUGAR FROM BEET-ROOTS.
      Professor Klaproth    has published the    following testimony
 in   regard to sugar procured from beet-roots       :
      "  Having, in    consequence of a request by Mr. Achard,
 that    I  would examine his process for making sugar from
 beet-roots, and communicate to him the result, convinced
 myself, by repeated experiments, of the abundance of            sac
 charine matter in these roots, that I might ascertain            the
proportion with more accuracy, I made the following expe
riment : — Twenty-five fresh roots, which weighed 32^ pounds
after they had been scraped and the tops cut off, were put
into a perforated tin vessel, and the juice was expressed by a
proper apparatus.        The juice obtained weighed 19! pounds.
The squeezed residuum was put into a tin kettle with boiling
water, and, after standing an hour, was pressed also. This
extract was added to the juice ; both were boiled to a syrup,
and strained through a woollen cloth       ;  aster which the svrup
was put into a porcelain capsule, and evaporated gradually
over a slow fire to complete dryness.           The raw sugar ob
tained, and which I put into a sealed glass, amounted to two
pounds twelve ounces.
     " That 2,5 roots, or
                             33 \ pounds of beets, produced two
pounds twelve ounces of sugar, is hereby certified, as witness

          the general
all bodies            sphere of its action ; and as the atmo
                  within the
sphere of our earth consists not only of heavy, but also of
moveable and elastic parts, which revolve around a common
axis like the! water          of    the ocean,     it    necessarily     follows that
the atmosphere must be affected by the same physical causes
which produce ^he flux and reflux of the sea.   This confe-i
quence is so immediate and necessary that it is not possible
to doubt     it   :    the question    therefore will hot be the existence
of    a flux      and but merely respecting their extent.
                          reflux,
Many philosophers have asserted, on grounds which do not
appear to have much validity, that the flux and reflux of the
atmosphere            amount to no more than those of the ocean, that
is, eight         According to their opinion,

different from that of a non-elastic.  Other philosophers,
not neglecting this consideration, have believed that the
causes which         produce        the   movement of the waters                of the
ocean can occasion           a    much greater in the aerial mass of the
atmosphere,        and must have       a very great share in producing
the regular winds, and other phenomena which depend on
them.
  .   D'Alembert         has calculated,          from the theory of general
gravitation,       those movements which                must    be produced           in
the atmosphere    by the effects of the fun and moon.                                He
found that from this influence a continual east-wind must
arise at the equator, and that, in the temperate zones, not
far from the tropics, it must be converted into a west-wind;
that on account, however, of many local circumstances, and
other impediments which come in the way, it cannot al
ways continue in the fame direction ; and that the variations
in    the state    of    the barometer,        which    thence arise,         must   be
very inconsiderable, and almost imperceptible.
  Bacon, Gassendi, Deschales, Goad, Dampier, Halley, and
<;!
others who have written on the wind, all unanimously ob
serve, that the periods            of the    year most exposed to         it    are the
two equinoxes : that storms are most frequent at the times
trf new and full moon, and particularly those which happen
near the equinoxes : that at periods, otherwise calm, a small
breeze always takes place at high water ; and that a small
nfovement in the atmosphere is each time perceived a little
ai'ier noon and midnight.  Now, as mof: of these circum-
l'ionces have a great resemblance to those which accompany
the flux and  reflux  of the sea, and take place at the same-
time ; and as in this respect the movement of water and the
                   is,
atmosphere                  according to Newton's rule, that
                         the fame,
patural effects of the like kind must be produced    the fame            by
tan es    ,both may be deduced from the fame source.

and of the regular and very perceptible effects which they
produce.          Nothing        therefore   is   necessary but to deduce their

phenomena and extent from the well-known properties of
elastic fluids. For this purpose we must have before our eyes
the following principles of aerometry, to be found in most
elementary books           :   —
     1. The elasticity of fluids is in the inverse ratio of their
density, and in the direct ratio of their rarity.      Thus air is
more elastic than water; light more elastic than air; and
ether than light.     This is one of the principles of New
ton *.
   a. The force or elasticity of the air expands and contracts
itself in the direct ratio of the weight with which it is loaded,
and diffuses itself in the inverse ratio of the force by which it
is com pressed       f.
   3. The air is rarefied, or diffuses itself, in the direct ratio of
the quantity of heat which acts upon it J.
   4. The air, as well as all fluids in general, has a tendency
ro put itself in equilibrium, and does not rest until it has
obtained it §.
  It now follows,              from these principles,                     that every thing
which increases           the weight          of    the atmosphere,               and      presses
the air more in one place than another near                                 it,   must occa
sion the air to rush from the former to the latter, where                                     it   is
lighter:   and, on the other hand, every thing that lessens the
gravity of   the atmosphere,  and increases or rarefies the air,
and makes    it      lighter than in the neighbouring                             parts,     must
occasion the air to rusti in from all sides to those parts                                    and
this continues        in   each         cafe till     the equilibrium              is   restored,
and rest again       effected.           This    is   the principal              cause     of the
origin of wind.           But,     as   a   pendulum put            in    motion does not
immediately       rest    when      it    perpendicular direc
                                         has come to        a
tion, but obtains  rest after making some small vibrations    in                             ;
the fame manner, the currents of air, from the places where
the air is,more pressed to that where     less so, will rush
                                                         it

yond the boundaries of the equilibrium, from which they
will again     fly
            back, and at length obtain rest after several
undulations.         As this        takes place          in all fluids,           it    is   more

Iq3              Observations   on the        Flux and Reflux
peculiarly common to elastic fluids; and it is observed, ac
cording to these principles, that the winds during storms
change their course, and blow exactly from those points to
which the current was before directed.
   The specific gravity of the air is 800 times less than that
of water, and its elasticity is infinitely greater. The attrac
tive power of the fun and moon lessens the gravity and pres
sure of the atmosphere towards the earth, as it draws it to
wards these bodies in the fame manner as it does the water
of the ocean.    But this power of attraction does not extend
the water of the ocean, which is destitute of elasticity, as it
does the whole mass of the atmosphere (possessed of         and               it,
exposed to the action of this power) in the ratio of the de
crease of gravity, and of the pressure of the atmosphere to
wards the earth.   Adopting, therefore, the inadmissible sup
position, that water, air, and quicksilver would be raised to
nearly the same height, and be moved in the same manner
by     the attractive   force   of the        sun and       moon; this much              at
any rate    proved, that the extension of the air, in proportion
            is
to the lessening of the gravity of the atmosphere towards the;
earth, must always take place, and produce          considerable    a
atmospheric flux, while this effect cannot occur in regard to
the flux of the ocean.          It   is   certain that fluids are more or
lesssubject to the effects of any power acting upon them,
according as they have more or less mobility, which       in                        is
the direct ratio of their rarity and elasticity. Now, as air
possessesthese properties in   degree 800 times greater than
                                          a
water, the flux of the atmosphere must very perceptibly ex
ceed     in magnitude that of water.               This,         therefore,   is    a    se
cond certain argument against those who pretend that the
flux and reflux of the atmosphere are similar to those of the
ocean.       Not only    must the attractive        power of the sun and
moon, on account of the greater elasticity and mobility of
the air compared with water, produce   greater effect on the
                                                        a
atmosphere than on the ocean, but the component parts of
 the atmosphere, as they are nearer the moon by about                                     a
 ninetieth part of the semidiameter of the earth, must be
 more strongly attracted than the watery particles of the
 ocean; in the fame manner as those which are 90 degrees
                                                        •    -
                                                                               distant

                             of  the Atmosphere.                        109
distant from the place where the moon is vertical, mast oc
casion a greater pressure on the earth on account of the
greater obliquity of the attraction, and this in proportion to
the greater       height of the atmosphere above that of the sea.
This is the third physical cause which makes the flux and
reflux of the atmosphere more considerable than that of the
ocean. To this we may add the immense space occupied by
the atmosphere         in comparison of the ocean ; for if the whole
globe were      covered with water, this general ocean would not
occupy the      fiftieth part of the space actually filled by the at
mosphere ; and in my opinion the extension effected in elastic
fluids, by the fame power of attraction, is in proportion to
their masses. Supposing this to be the cafe, the flux of air
in   an atmosphere        of  ten miles height, would be much more
considerable      than in another amounting to only a tenth part
of that height       : though this difference      cannot take place in
the flux and reflux of the ocean, because water is destitute of
 elasticity.     Besides,    lands, islands, straits, bays, the situation
of the coasts, sand-banks; shoals, &c. throw a great many
impediments in the way of the water in regard to its mo
tion ; whereas the atmosphere, which rises to a height ten or
 twelve times greater than the summits of the highest moun
 tains, is in no manner prevented from moving according to
                                                 '
 the effects of the power of attraction, unless something very
 particular takes place in its lowest strata.              It is more than
 probable    that   each   of these  causes contributes   its  part to make
 the movement of the atmosphere far more considerable than
 that of the ocean.
     It is therefore certain that the united effects of the attrac
 tion of the fun and moon on the atmosphere of the earth
 must raise and extend it in the inverse ratio of .the square of
 the distance      so as to   make it assume the form of      a  lengthened
  spheroid,    the greater diameter of which, from the same
  grounds and with the fame variations as the aqueous sphe
  roid, must nearly follow the direction of the line of attrac
  tion.
     Besides,    the heat     of  the fun,  which has no sensible influ
  ence in raising or extending the water           of the ocean, will pro
  duce an effect on that part         of the  atmosphere     exposed   to its ,
                                                                         rays

 according to the third of the before-mentioned                          principles.
That      part, therefore,      of the atmosphere which
                                                     gradually         is
turned towards the fun, must extend in proportion to the de
gree of heat which acts upon                  it,
                                  and rife above the rest and                     ;
this atmospheric swelling will constantly follow the apparent
daily course of the sun.  The moon, on the other hand, has
no power to produce or change this phenomenon       because,            ;
in all the experiments hitherto made to collect and concen
trate its rays, the smallest degree                 of heat has never been per
ceived.
    As there             two different causes, viz. the united
                  are therefore
attraction of the fun and moon, and the heat of the fun
alone    ;   by
           which the latter, except at the time of the fyze-
gies, when they both act in the fame direction upon one
point, has  particular influence on the atmosphere of the
                a
earth independent on that of the former,    thence follows        it
that they will produce three different fluxes every day. Two
of them arise from the attractive power of the sun and moon,
and in their formation, direction, and movement, are per
fectly similar to those produced                in the    ocean     from the same
causes.   The third, however,                 is    produced   by    the heat of the
fun alone    ;    and its prominent           parts     will always be in that
parallel through which             the fun           passes in the course of his
daily movement, and will continually follow that luminary,
from parallel to parallel, at small distance.
                                          a        The two first
I shall call attraSion-tides, the third heat-tula.
   The tides of attraction, like those of the ocean, and from
the like grounds, have at the fame time, at two opposite ends
of the globe, projecting parts, and these lie almost in that
line which might be drawn from the centre of the earth to
that of the moon. The heat- tides, on the other band, can
take place only on one point of the globe that        in the   ;            is,
point to which the fun      vertical. Their projecting part
                                     is
will be directed towards that luminary, and nearly follows
its movement.
    In   regard     to the effects       of   these atmospheric tides,            they
depend on the natural            stateof the aerial fluid, and on its
Test,   which     consists   in an equilibrium of all its parts. When
                                                                                  this

                   . .    vs  the Atmosphere.                   Ill
this equilibrium is destroyed, the atmosphere returns to its
former state as soon as the cause of this derangement is re
moved.       If this equilibrium is by any cause destroyed in any
one place, a movement must naturally follow from all sides,
and continue until the equilibrium is again restored ; and in
this we may discover the principal cause of the origin of
wind. Every thing, therefore, which can           derange the equi
librium of the atmosphere in any manner,          must be reckoned
among those causes which give rife to wind : such as the flux
 and reflux of the atmosphere,         occasioned by attraction and
 heat ; all other rarefaction of the air by heat ; or the con
densation of it by cold, &c; the letting loose of vapours by
fermentation and evaporation into the atmosphere ; the erup
 tion from the bosom of the earth and ascent of elastic vapours,
 volcanoes, earthquakes, and perhaps other causes not so evi
 dent, and therefore less known.           The exceedingly variable
 directions of the wind depend on the nature of the countries
 from which they blow ; and, in particular, on mountains,
 forests, rivers, marshes, lakes.       In a word, every thing that
 can oppose or favour the free movement of the aerial fluid
 has an influence on the direction of the wind.
     Among all those causes which derange the equilibrium of
 the atmosphere, and contribute to the production of wind,
 the principal and most uniform is the rarefaction and con
 densation of the air.      Both are the immediate effect of the
  different atmospheric tides.      The regular course of these tides
  from east to weft, in consequence of that of the sun and
  moon, must produce a continual east wind ; which is how
  ever exceedingly weak, but continues without          interruption,
  and prevails only in the immense seas of the Torrid zone,
  though with most regularity in the Pacific ocean, on account
  of its vast extent.    The   compressed   parts of the  atmosphere
  in the neighbourhood       rush towards those most rarefied by the
  atmospheric tides, and follow them also in their regular pro
  gress from east to west.      The parts of the atmosphere, how
  ever,  in the  west, will  have  a much less, or perhaps no move
   ment towards those which proceed from the east, on account
   of the atmospheric flux moving towards them : at any rate,
   the motion from east to west will exceed that small motion
                         7                                       from

    HZ           Observations    on the  Flux and Reflux
   from west to    east,   and  therefore produce a continual ea"st
   wind in. the parallel of the atmospheric tide. A wind also
   will proceed from the north or south of this parallel, in an
   oblique direction north and south, to the distance of about
   thirty degrees on each side of the equator. In both the tem
  perate zones the regular winds must blow from west to east
  within   these boundaries, as they incline towards the parallel
  of the atmospheric tide,     and again restore the equilibrium of
  the atmosphere, which has been rarefied by the continual
  movement of the aerial tides. These consequences, deduced
  from theory, coincide perfectly with the course of the wind
 in the ocean. At land, and on confined seas, many other
 causes exist which contribute to change the regular direction
 of the winds,    and to make them variable.
      On  the coasts,  in the torrid zone, the wind blows for the
 most part from the sea towards the land.           The reason of this
 is evident. The reflected rays of the fun, and other causes,
 heat and rarefy the air at land much more than at sea ; and
 the direction of the wind always proceeds towards the rare
 fied part of the atmosphere.        The places where the last men
 tioned winds separate themselves from the regular winds,
 must be absolutely      calm.   All   th'is is confirmed by experi
 ence throughout      the whole     torrid zone, and particularly on
 the coast of Guinea.
     Besides the determination      of the   course  of the winds in
consequence      of the atmospheric flux and reflux, there are
 an immense number of local and accidental causes which
have an influence on the creation and direction of the winds.
One of the least irregular is the pressure and gravity of the
atmosphere in the frigid zones, which must occasion a con
tinued movement of the air towards the more rarefied parts,
ami at the fame time a wind from the poles towards the
equator.      As soon, however, as this continual wind enters
the temperate zones, its direction will be overcome and de
ranged by other local causes: an examination, however, of
those winds not arising from the atmospheric udes, does not
fail within the plan of this essay.
     Those winds, on the other hand, which generally blow
at fun- rife and fun-set, are a remarkable effect of the atmo
                                                              spheric

                               of the Atmosphere,                            113
  spheric    tides   produced     by heat,     as the gentle    wind observed
  at the times      of high water in         the ocean,     even during wea
 ther in other respects calm, proceeds                  from an atmospheric
 tide produced by attraction.
     The difficulty of breathing which people experience in the
 torrid zone, under an atmospheric tide, arising from heat,
 must be ascribed as much to a rarefaction of the air thereby
 occasioned,      as to the heat     itself.    A   like effect, in regard to
 breathing, is perceived on high mountains ; which however
 arises from the thinness of the air on these eminences, for
 here the heat can have no part in the rarefaction.
     It happens sometimes,         in warm countries, that during the
 atmospheric tides, the heat and rarefaction of the air increase
 to such a degree that they create scorching and suffocating
 winds, known          under the name of Solanos            ; the  violence   of
 which     proceeds     so  far sometimes,       that  they destroy     on the
 spot those who         are immediately exposed to them.                Abun
 dant and horrid instances of this circumstance are quoted by
the Abbe Richard in his Natural History of the Air and
Meteors which have occurred in the Desarts of Arabia, in
the neighbourhood of the Persian Gulph, and other places.
    Besides     these solanos, it is observed also, sometimes,              that
 the wind       suddenly      rushes  from all quarters to that point
where the air is most rarefied, which occasions storms and
hurricanes in that part by the mutual shock of the air and
the vapours streaming in all directions towards one centre,
and the winds then blow backwards again from this point to
every quarter       of   the   heavens   till  the equilibrium     is restored.
This    effect, so natural and common, has long astonished those
who never employed themselves in endeavouring to discover
the cause.
    In  the last place, there is good reason for conjecturing that
the same physical          causes which produce the different atmo
spheric     tides,   with     their consequences,         contribute    also to
change the weather and temperature, and to produce at the
fame time a great many other meteorological phenomena.

A:„MONG                    the celestial         bodies,       the        Sun is certainly the
iirst     which         should       attract our notice.                   It is a fountain of
light      that     illuminates         the world          !       It     is the cause          of that
heat which maintains the productive power of Nature, and
makes the earth a sit habitation for man ! It is the central
body of the planetary system; and what renders a' know
ledge of it still more interesting to us that the numberless            is,
liars which compose the universe, appear,   the strictest ana                 by
logy, to be similar bodies.  Their innate light        intense,                       is   so
that   reaches the eye of the observer from the remotest re
          it
gions of space, and forcibly claims his notice.
   Now,     we are convinced that an enquiry into the nature
                   if
and properties             of   the fun     is   highly worthy of our notice, we
may also, with great satisfaction, reflect on the considerable
progress that has already been made in our knowledge of this
eminent body.        would require
                                It   long detail to enumerate  a

subject        I
               ;        shall   therefore        content myself with giving only
the most capital of them.
   Sir Isaac Newton has sticwn that the fun, by its attractive
power, retains the planets of our system in their orbite     he                                   :
has       also pointed out             the method whereby the quantities                               of
matter which              it    contains may be accurately determined.                                Dr.
Bradlcv has afliirned                the velocity of the solar light with                              a
degree of precision exceeding our utmost expectation.     Gal-
lileo, Scheiner, Hevelius, Caflini and others have ascertained
the rotation of the sun upon its axis, and determined the po
sition of its equator. By means of the transit of Venus over
the dilk of the fun, our mathematicians have calculated its
distance from the earth     its real diameter and magnitude;

      From the particulars here enumerated it is sufficiently ob
 vious, that we have already a verv clear idea of the vast im
 portance and powerful influence of the fun on its planetary
 system : and if we add to this the beneficent effects we feel
 on this globe from the diffusion of the solar rays ; and con
 sider     that, by well-traced analogies, the fame effects have
 been proved        to take place on other planets of this system,
I   should not wonder          if   we were induced to think         that no
thing remained to be added in order to complete our know
 ledge : and yet it will not be difficult to shew that we are
 still very ignorant,        at least with       regard to the internal con
 struction of the sun.           The     various conjectures which have
 been formed on this subject,                 are evident marks    of the un
 certainty under which we have hitherto laboured.
     The dark spots in the fun, for instance, have been supposed
 to be solid bodies revolving very near its surface.               Thev have'
 been conjectured to be the smoke of volcanoes, or the scum
floating upon an ocean            ot" fluid matter.     They have also been
 taken tor clouds.          They     were    explained to be opaque masses
 swimming         on the fluid matter of the sun, dipping down
 occasionally.         It has been supposed that a fiery liquid sur
rounded the sun, and that, by its ebbing and flowing, the
 highest parts of it were occasionally uncovered, and appeared
 under the      shape    of dark   spots   ;  and that, by the return    of the
.fiery liquid,     they were       again covered, and in that manner
 successively assumed different phases.               The fun itself has beeir
 Called a globe      of lire, though         perhaps   metaphorically.     The
 waste it would          undergo by        a gradual   consumption,     on  the.
 supposition     of   its being ignited,        has been ingeniously calcu
 lated   :   and, in the same point of view, its immense power of
 heating the bodies of such comets as draw very near to it
  has been assigned.
     The bright      spots,    or faculæ, have been called          clouds of
 light, and luminous vapours.                 The light of the fun itself has
 been supposed to be directly invisible, and not to be perceived
 unless by reflection        ; though the proofs         which   are brought
  in  support    of that opinion seem to me to amount to no more
 than, what is sufficiently evident, that we cannot                 fee  when!
  fays of light     do not enter the eye.

 Il6               On the Xature and ConJlruSion
    But it is time   to prosit by the many valuable observation*
we are now in        possession  of.   A  list  of    successive    eminent
astronomers    may be named, from Gallileo down to the pre
sent time, who have         furnished us with materials for exa
mination.
    In supporting    the ideas   I shall propose in this paper, with
regard to the physical construction       of the fun,       I   have availed
myself of the labours of all these astronomers, but have been
induced thereto only by my own actual observation of the
solar phenomena ; which, besides verifying those particulars
that had been already observed, gave me such views of the
solar regions as led to the foundation          of   a very rational sys
tem. For, having the advantage of former observations, my
latest reviews of the body of the fun were immediately di
rected to the most essential points ; and the work was by this
means facilitated, and contracted into a pretty narrow com
pass.
    The following     is a short extract  of my observations on           the
fun, to which I have joined the consequences                  I  now believe
myself entitled to draw from them. When all the reasonings
on the several phenomena are put together, and a few addi
tional arguments taken from analogy, which I (hall also add,
are properly considered, it will be found that a general con
clusion may be made which seems to throw a considerable
light on our present subject.
    In the year 1779 there was a spot on the sun which was
large enough to be seen with the naked eye.                     By a view of
it with a seven feet reflector, charged with a very high power,
it appeared to be divided into two parts.               The largest of the
                                                   '
two, on the     1
                  9th of April, measured 1 8 ",06 in diameter ;
which is equal in length to more than 31 thousand miles.
Both together must certainly have extended above 50 thou
 sand.
    The   idea  of its being    occasioned     by a volcanic explosion
violently driving away a fiery fluid,      which      on its return would
gradually fill up the vacancy, and thus restore the fun, in that
place, to its former splendour, ought to be rejected on many
 accounts. To mention only one, the great extent of the spot
 is very unfavourable to such a supposition.              Indeed a much
                                                                          let

                       of   the Stin and Fixed Stars t                1 17
  less  violent and      less  pernicious cause may be assigned to ac
  count for all the appearances of the spot.             When we see a
  dark belt near the equator of the planet Jupiter, we do not
  recur to earthquakes and volcanoes for its origin.          An atmo
  sphere,    with  its  natural changes,    will explain such belts.  Our
   spot on the sun may be accounted for on the same principles.
  The earth is surrounded by an atmosphere composed of va
  rious elastic fluids.       The fun also has its atmosphere; and if
  some     of  the fluids     which enter into its composition should
  be   of a  shining brilliancy, in the manner that will be ex
  plained hereafter,       while others are merely transparent, any
  temporary cause which may remove the lucid fluid will per
  mit us to see the body of the sun through the transparent
  ones.      If an observer were placed on the moon, he would
  see  the solid body of the earth only in those places where the
  transparent fluids of our atmosphere would permit him.                In
  others, the opaque vapours would reflect the light of the son
  without permitting his view to penetrate to the surface of
  our globe.      He would probably        also find that our planet had
  occasionally some (Lining fluids in its atmosphere; as, not
  unlikely, some of our northern lights might not escape his
v
  notice, if they happened in the unenlightened part of the
  earth,    and were     seen   by him in his long dark night.       Nay,
  we have pretty good reason to believe, that probably all the
  planets emit light in some degree ; for the illumination which
  remains on the moon in a total eclipse cannot be entirely
  ascribed to the     light which may reach it by the refraction of
  the earth's atmosphere.          For instance, in the eclipse of the
  moon October 22, 1790, the rays of the fun refracted by the
  atmosphere of the earth towards the moon, admitting the
  mean horizontal refraction to be 30' 5o",8, would meet in a
  focus 189 thousand miles beyond the moon; so that conse
  quently there could be no illumination from rays refracted
  by our atmosphere.            It is, however, not improbable, that
  about the polar regions of the earth there may be refraction
  enough to bring some of the solar rays to a shorter focus.
  The    distance of the moon at the time of the eclipse would
  require a refraction of 54' 6I,) equal to its horizontal parallax
                                                                         at

 at that time, to bring them                              to a focus so as to throw ligli€
 on the moon.
       The unenlightened                 part      of   the planet Venus        has also been
 seen by different persons, and not having a satellite, those
 regions that are turned from the fun cannot possibly shine by
 a borrowed light; so that this faint illumination must denote
 some phosphoric quality                      of   the atmosphere           of Venus.
       In   the instance       of our             large    spot on the sun,       I conclude
 from       appearances         that          I   viewed       the   real    body of the fun
hself, of which we rarely                           see    more than its shining             atmo->
 sphere.
       In   the year 1783           I
                             observed a fine large spot, and followed
 it up      to the edge of the sun's limb.    Here I took notice that
 the spot was plainly depressed below the surface of the sun;
 and that it had very broad shelving sides.    I also suspected
 some part, at least,               of       the shelving sides to be elevated above
 the surface of the sun                  ;    and observed           that, contrary to what
 usually happens, the margin of that fide of the spot which
• wasfarthest from the limb was the broadest.
       The luminous shelving         side of a spot may be explained by
 a gentle      a*n\l    gradual  removal of the shining fluid, which per
 mits ns       W       fee the globe of the fun.    As to the uncommon
 appeararfee           of   the broadest margin being on that fide                           of    the
 spot Whrch was      farthest from the. limb when the spot came
 near the' edge of            it,
                         we may surmise that the sun has inequa
 lities onlls surface, which may possibly be the cause of it.
 For, when mountainous countries are exposed,              should                  if   it
 chance that the highest part of the landscape are situated    as                                 so
 to be near  that side of the margin, or penumbra   of  the spot,
 which     towards the limb,
             is                 may partly intercept our view of
                                                   it
it  when the spot       seen very obliquely.
                              is               This would require
 elevations at least five or six hundred miles high but consider               ;
                                                           it by
 ing the great attraction exerted       the fun upon bodies at its
 surface,  and the (low revolution   has upon its axis, we may
 readily admit inequalities to that amount.   From the centri
 fugal force at the fun's equator, and the weight of bodies at
 its surface,     I     compute that the power of throwing down a
 mountain              bythe exertion of the former, bahneed   the                           by

                   of   the Sun and      Fixed Stars.                   119
superior force   of keeping it in   its. place   of   the latter, is near
(>A   times less on the fun than on our equatorial regions ; and
as an elevation similar to one of three miles on the earth
would not be less than 334 miles on the fun, there can be
no doubt but that     a mountain much higher would Hand
very firmly.  The   little density of the solar body seems also
to be in favour of the   height of its mountains ; for, cœteris
paribus, dense bodies will sooner come to their level than rare
ones.  The difference in the vanishing of the shelving side,
insteadof explaining it by mountains, may also, and perhaps
more satisfactorily, be accounted for from the real difference of
the extent, the arrangement, the height, and the intensity of
the shining fluid, added to the occasional changes that may
happen in these particulars during the time in which the spot
approaches to the edge of the disk.   However, by admitting
 large mountains on the face        of   the fun, we shall account for
 the different opinions of two eminent astronomers ; one of
 whom believed the spots depressed below the sun, while the
 other believed them elevated above it. For it is not impos
 sible that some   of   the solar mountains may be high enough
 occasionally to project above the fliining elastic fluid, when,
 by some agitation, or other cause, it is not of the usual
 height : and this opinion is much strengthened by the re
 turn of some remarkable spots which served Casfini to ascer
 tain the period of the sun's rotation.  A very high country,
 or chain of mountains, may oftener become visible, by the
 removal of the obstructing fluid, than the lower regions, on
 account of its not being so deeply covered with it.
    In the year 1791 I examined a large spot on the sun, and
 found it evidently depressed below the level of the surface;
 about the dark part was a broad margin, or plane, of consi
 derable extent, less bright than the fun, and also lower than
 its surface.    This plane   seemed to rise,     with sticlving        sides,
 up to the place where it joined the level        of the surface.
    In confirmation of these appearances, I carefully remarked
 that the disk of the sun was visibly convex : and the reason of
 my attention to this particular, was my being already long
 acquainted with a certain optical deception, that takes place
 flow and then when we view the moon ; which                    is,   that all
                                                                          the

  J 20              On the Nature and ConslruSHan
  the elevated spots on its surface will seem to be cavities, and
  all cavities will assume the shape of mountains.           But then,
  at the fame time, the moon, instead       of having   the convex ap
  pearance   of  a globe, will   seem  to be a large  concave  portion
  of an hollow    sphere.    As soon as, by the force  of imagination,
 you drive away the fallacious appearance of a concave moon,
 you restore the mountains to their protuberance, and fink
 the cavities again below the level of the surface. Now, when
 I saw the spot lower than the mining matter of the sun, and
 an extended plane, also depressed, with shelving sides rising
 up to the level,     I also found that the fun was convex, and
 appeared     in its natural globular state. Hence I conclude
 that there could be no deception in those appearances.
    How very ill would this observation agree with the ideas
 of solid  bodies   bobbing up and down in a fiery liquid ? with
 the smoke of volcanoes, or scum upon an ocean ? And how
 easily it is explained upon our foregoing theory.            The re
moval of the shining atmosphere, which permits us to see
the fun, must naturally be attended with a gradual diminu
tion on its borders : an instance of a similar kind we have
daily before us, when through the opening of a cloud we fee
the Iky, which generally is attended by a surrounding hazi
ness of some stiort extent ; and seldom transits, from a perfect
clearness,   at once to the greatest obscurity.
    Aug.   26, 1792.       I examined the sun with several powers,
from 90 to 500.         It appears evidently that the black spots
are the opaque ground, or body of the fun ; and that the
luminous part is an atmosphere, which, being interrupted or
broken, gives us a transient glimpse of the sun itself.           My
7-feet reflector, which is in high perfection, represents the
spots, as it always used to do, much depressed below the sur
face of the luminous part.
    Sept. 2,    1792.      I  saw two spots in the fun with the
naked eye.                           I
                 In the telescope found they were clusters of
spots, with many scattered ones besides.          Every one of them
was certainly below the surface of the luminous disk.
    Sept. 8, 1792.      Having made a small speculum, merely
brought to a perfect figure upon hones without polish, I
found that, by stifling a great part of the solar rays, my ob-
                                          7                     ject-

                         of  the Sun and     Fixed   Stars*                tai
 jfect-speculum would bear a greater aperture ; and thus en
  abled me to fee with more comfort, and less danger.                     The
   surface of the sun was unequal ; many parts of it being ele
  vated,   and others depressed.           This is here to be understood
  of  the mining surface only, as the real body of the fun can.
  probably be seldom seen otherwise than in its black spots.
      It may not be impossible, as light is a transparent fluid,
  that the sun's       real surface also may now and then be per
  ceived ; as we fee the shape of the wick of a candle through
  its flame, or the contents of a furnace in the midst of the
  brightest    glare of it : but this, I should suppose, will only
 happen where the lucid matter of the fun is not very accu
  mulated.
      Sept. 9, 1792.        I found one of the dark spots in the fun
 drawn pretty near the preceding edge. In its neighbourhood
 I saw a great number of elevated bright places, making va
 rious figures:      I  stiall call  them faculæ, with Hevclius; but
 without assigning to         this  term   any other meaning than what
 it will hereafter appear ought to be given to it. 1 fee these
 faculæ extended, on the preceding side, over about i-6th
 part   of  the sun ;     but   so  far  from resembling torches, they
 appear to me like the           shrivelled   elevations upon a dried ap
 ple, extended in length, and most of them are joined toge
 ther, making waves, or waving lines.
     By some good views in the afternoon, I find that the rest
of   the surface    of  the sun docs not contain any faculæ, except
a few on the following, and equatorial part of the fun.                  To
wards the north and south              I see no facule    : there is all over
the fun a great unevenness            in the surface,   which    has the ap
pearance      of a mixture of small points of an unequal light}
but they arc evidently an unevenness or roughness of high
and low parts.
     Sept. 11, 1792.         The faculæ, in the preceding part of the
fun,    are  much    gone out of the disk, and those in the follow
ing are come on.            A  dark spot also is come on with them.
     Sept. 13, 1792.         There    are a great number of faculæ ofi
the equatorial part of the fun, towards the preceding and
following parts.          I cannot fee any towards the poles ; but a
roughness      is visible every where.
     Vol.    V.                          R                         Sept. 16

122                      On   the   Nature and Construction
     Sept.   i5,   1792.        The sun contains many large faculæ on
the following       side      of its equator, and also several on the pre
ceding side.        I    perceive     none about          the poles.    They       seem
generally to accompany the spots                    ;   and probably,   as   the fa
culæ certainly are elevations,           number ef them may
                                              a great
occasion neighbouring depressions,  that  is to fay, dark spots.
   The faculæ being elevations, very satisfactorily explains the
reason why they disappear towards the middle of the fun, and
re-appear on the other margin ; for, about the place where
we lose them, they begin to be edge-ways to our view                           ;    and
if   between the faculæ mould lie dark spots, they will most
frequently break out in the middle of the fun, because they
are no longer covered by the fide-views of these faculæ.
     Sept. 22, 1792.There are not many faculæ in the sun,
and but few spots ; the whole disk, however, is very much
marked with roughness, like an orange. Some of the lowest
parts   of   the incqualites are blackish.
  Sept. 23, 1792.  The following fide of the fun contains
many faculæ near the limb.   They take up an arch of about
50 degrees.  There are likewise some on the preceding side.
The north and south is rough as usual, but differently dis
posed.  The faculæ are ridges of elevations above the rough
surface.
   Feb. 23, 1794.    By an experiment I have just now tried,
I find it confirmed that the sun cannot be so distinctly viewed
with a small aperture and faint darkening glasses, as with a
large aperture and stronger ones                ;       this latter is the method         I
always use.
  One of the black spots on the preceding margin, which
was greatly below the surface of the sun, had, next to                              it,   a
protuberant lump of finning matter,   little brighter than the
                                                         a
rest  of the sun.
     About all the         spots, the shining matter seems to have been
disturbed    j     and   is   uneven,    lumpy, and zig-zagged in an                 ir
regular manner.
 I  call the spots black, not that they are entirely so, but
merely to distinguish them    for there   ; not one of them  is
to-day,  which    not partly,
                         is    or entirely, covered over with
whitish and unequally bright nebulosity, or cloudiness. This,

   in many of them, conies near to an extinction of the spot ;
  and in others, seems to bring on a subdivision.
      Sept. 28, 1794.       There is a dark spot in the sun on the
  following side. It is certainly depressed below the shining
  atmosphere, and has shelving fides of shining matter, which
  rise up higher than the general surface, and are brightest at
  the top. The preceding shelving side is rendered almost in
  visible by the overhanging of the preceding elevations, while
  the following is very well exposed        ; the spot being apparently
  such in figure as denotes a circular form viewed in an oblique
  direction.
     Near the following        margin are many bright elevations,
 close    to visible   depressions.     The    depressed  parts  are less
 bright than the common surface.
     The penumbra, as it is called, about this spot, is a consi
 derable plane, of less brightness than the common surface,
 and seems to be as much depressed below that surface as the
 spot is below the plane.
     Hence,     if the   brightness of the fun is occasioned by the
 lucid atmosphere, the intensity of the brightness must be less
 where it is depressed ; for light, being transparent,          must be
 the more intense the more it is deep.
     Oil.   12, 1794.     The whole surface of the sun is diversified
 by inequality in the elevation of the shining atmosphere. The
 lowest parts are every where darkest ; and every little pit has
 the appearance      of a more or less dark spot.
     A dark spot, which is on the preceding side, is surrounded
 by very great inequalities in the elevation of the lucid atmo
 sphere   ;  and its depression below the same is bounded          by an
immediate rising of very bright light.                               ,

is drawn     so near the    margin, that the elevated side of the fol
lowing part of it        hides all the black ground, aud still leaves
the cavity visible, so that the depression of the black spots,
iind the elevation     of the faculæ,    are equally evident,

III.    On the Production     of Cast Iron, and the Operations of the
     Blqjl-Furnace.       By Mr. David MuSHET, of the Clyde
     Iron-Works.       Communicated      by the  Author.
I    T was my wisti, in the papers preceding this communica
tion, to convev a clear and competent idea of the nature of
iron as a metal ; as also of ores, and iron-stones in general.
I have endeavoured to explain, upon principles grounded on
experiment, the chief agents of change in the smelting ope
ration, so far as they affect the quality of the materials pre
 pared.       I have aimed at perspicuity rather than minuteness,
 which often becomes tedious ; and although the facts may
 not be conveyed        in  a  style so popular as communications,
 which profess a conveyance of practical truths, generally are,
 yet, I trust, this will form no real bar to their utility. When
 facts are lo be learned,      and principles satisfactorily explained,
 it is   surely best to begin by the examination          of simple causes ;
 and tracing their agency          according to their quantities, rela
 tive proportion?, and affinities.           These facts will undoubt
 edly, in the end, be more radically understood by using such
 phrases, or signs, as denote in each a respective quality af
  fixed in consequence       of a know ledge     of  its properties   and ef
  fects.     In (liort, if the language    and reasoning      of our manu
  factories    is ever to become scientific    ;  if philosophy     and che
  mistry are ever to become of general utility in the perfection
  of any branch ; then those truths which constitute the foun
  dation of all science       are not to be rejected, though clothed
  in   a dress   which at first fight appears diicordant to our ha-r
  bits, or burdensome to our memory.
       The operations I am about to describe have never as yet
   received     any explanation consonant to true philosophy or
   chemical facts ; yet there are few which present a more beau-,
   tiful chain of affinities, decomposition, and recombination,
   than the manufacture of iron in all its various stages.                An
   extensive foundry is a      laboratory fraught with phenomena of
    the most interesting nature in chemistry and natural philo
    sophy : are we not then justly surprised to find that prejudice

consigned her laborious unlettered sons to an endless stretch
of mental obscurity            ?
   The plate of the blast-furnace, given in the preceding'
Number, having a full description appropriated to          stiall            it, I
proceed to detail the train of preparation necessary before the
furnace     is   brought to produce good melting iron.
  The furnace being         finished, the bottom and sides of                      it,     for
two feet up the square funnel, receive lining of common        a
bricks upon edge, to prevent the stone from shivering or
mouldering when the fire comes in contact with it. On the
front of the furnace              temporary fire-place, about
                                   is   erected     a
four feet long, into the bottom of which are laid correspond
ing bars. The side-walls arc made       high as to reach the  so
under-surface of the tymp-stonc     excepting     small space,
                                                     ;                  a
which afterwards receives an iron plate of       inches thick       1[
ness,    by   way   of   this also preserves the tymp-stone
                         a    cover     :
from any injury  might sustain
                         it                              by
                                   being in contact with the
flame.      A
          fire  now kindled upon the bars, and
                     is                            fed occa                 is
sionally with small coals. As the whole cavity of the furnace
serves as   chimney for this fire, the draught in consequence
              a
is violent, and the body of heat carried up     very consider        is
able.       In the       course     of
                               weeks the furnace will thus
                                            three
become entirely free from damp, and sit for the reception of
the materials: when this    judged proper the fire-place
                                            is                                              is
removed, but the interior bricks are allowed to remain till
the operation of blowing commences. Some loose fuel                                         is
then thrown upon the bottom of the furnace, and  few bas                    a

                                                 ;
 thoroughly ignited before more are added.     In this manner
 the furnace     gradually filled; sometimes entirely full, and
                    is
 at other times 5-8ths or 3-4ths full.   The number of bas
 kets full depend entirely upon the size of the furnace     that                   :

   126                  On the Production        of Cast Iron,
   coals  will    be equal to 198,000 Ib.          When      we reflect that this
   vast body      of ignited matter is    replaced every third day, when
  the furnace is properly at work, a notion may be formed of
  the immense quantity of materials requisite, as alfo the con
  sequent industry exerted to supply one or more furnaces for
  the space      of one   year.
      When        the furnace is sufficiently heated          throughout, spe
  cific quantities of cokes, iron-stone, and blast-furnace cinders
  are added : these are called charges.                The cokes are com
  monly filled in baskets, which, at all the various iron-works,
  are nearly       of  a size.    The weight of       a basket, however, de
  pends entirely upon the nature and quality of the coal, being
  from 70 to 1 izlb. each *. The iron-stone is filled into boxes,
  which, when moderately heaped, contain 561b. of torrefied
  iron-stone      ; they often exceed this when the stone has been
 severely roasted.          The first charges which a furnace receives,
 contain but a small proportion of iron-stone to the weight of
 cokes    :   this is afterwards    increased     to a  full burden, which is
 commonly 4.baskets cokes,32olb.               ; 2 boxes   iron-stone, 1 1 2lb. ;
  1 box blast-furnace cinders, 6oor7olb.f                      At new works,
 where these cinders cannot be obtained, a similar quantity
 of limestone is used.
     The     descent   of the charge, or burden,       is facilitated by open
 ing the furnace below two or three times a-day, throwing
 out the cold cinders, and admitting, for an hour at a time,
 a body of fresh air. This operation is repeated till the ap
 proach       of the iron-stone       and   cinder, which is always an
nounced by a partial fusion, and the dropping of lava through
 the iron bars, introduced to support the incumbent materials
while       those on the       bottom are carried away. The filling
above is regularly continued,             and when the furnace at the

description,     to give a just idea of the proportions used at various blast

of lime  ; being already vitrified,  they are of much easier fusion, and tend to
preserve the surface of the hearth by glazing        it over with a black vitrid
crust.

top has acquired a considerable degree of heat, it is then
judged time to introduce the blast; the preparations necessary
 for which are the following : —
      The dam-stone is laid in its place firmly imbedded in fire
 clay; the dam-plate is again imbedded on this with the fame
 cement, and is subject to the same inclination.            On the top
 of this plate is a slight depression, of a curved form, towards
 that fide farthest distant from the blast, for the purpose of
 concentrating the scoria, and allowing it to flow off in a con
 nected stream, as it tends to surmount the level of the dam.
 From this notch to the level of the floor a declivity of brick
  work is    erected,     down which the scoria of the furnace flow*
  in   large quantities.      The opening betwixt the dam and side-
  walls of the furnace, called the fauld, is then built up with
  sand, the loose bricks are removed, and the furnace bottom
  is covered       with    powdered   lime or charcoal-dust.    The ig
  nited cokes are now allowed to fall down, and are brought
  forward with iron bars nearly to a level with the dam. The
   space between the surface of the cokes and the bottom of the
   tymp-plate is next rammed hard with strong binding sand ;
   and these cokes, which are exposed on the outside, arc co
   vered with coke-dust.           These precautions being taken, the
   tuyere-hole is then opened and lined with a soft mixture of
   fire-clay and loam : the blast is commonly introduced into
   the furnace at first with a small discharging-pipe, which is
   afterwards     increased as occasion    may require.    In two hours
    after blowing,       a considerable  quantity of lava will be accu
    mulated ;      iron bars    are then introduced,    and perforations
    made in the compressed matter at the bottom of the furnace;
    the lava is admitted to all parts of the hearth, and soon tho
     roughly heats and glazes the surfaces of the fire-stone. Shortly
     after this  it rises to a level with the notch in the dam-plate,
     and by its own accumulation,         together with the forcible ac
     tion of  the blast, it flows over. Its colour is at first black 5 its
   , fracture   dense, and very ponderous ; the form it assumes in
     running    off  is flat and branched, sometimes in long streams,
     and at other times less extensive. If the preparation has been
     well conducted, the colour of the cinder will soon change to
     white: and the metal, which in the state of an oxyde formerly

quality and quantity of the iron, conic next under considera
tion.   Let us, however, first notice the characteristic features
exhibited      the different kinds of iron while in fusion,
               by
whereby the quality of the metal may be justly defined.
  When line (No. 1.) or uipercarbonated crude iron                                          is     run
from the furnace, the stream of metal,                              as   it   issues    from the
fauld, throws off an infinite number                            of brilliant           sparkles         of
carbon.       The       surface    is    covered           fluid pellicle of car
                                                        with   a
buret of iron, which,              as    it   flows, rears itself up in the most
delicate folds      :   at first the fluid metal                appears         like    a   dense,
ponderous stream, but, as the collateral moulds become
filled,   exhibits
         it          general rapid motion from the surface of
                            a
the pigs to the centre of many points; millions of the finest
undulations move upon each mould, displaying the greatest
nicety and rapidity of movement, conjoined with an uncom
monly beautiful variegation of colour, which language                                       is     in
adequate justly to describe. Such metal, in quantity, will
remain fluid for twenty minutes after      run from the fur    it   is
nace, and when cold will have its surface covered with the
beautiful carburet of iron, already mentioned, of an uncom
monly rich and brilliant appearance.   When the surface of
the metal     is   not carburcted;           it   is   smooth like forged iron, and
              v                                                                           always

  always convex.       In this state iron is too rich for melting
  without the addition of coarse metal, and is unfit to be used
  in a cupola furnace for making fine castings, where thinness
  and  a good skin are requisite.
     No. 4, or     oxygenated    crude iron,      when issuing from the
  blast-furnace, throws off from all parts of the fluid surface a
 vast number       of metallic    sparks   : they arise from a different
  cause than that exerted in the former instance.             The extreme
  privation   of carbon renders the metal subject         to the  combina
 tion of oxygen so soon as it comes into contact with atmo
 spheric air.      This truth is evidently manifested by the ejec
 tion of small spherules of iron from all parts of the surface :
 the deflagration does not, however, take place till the globule
 has been thrown two or three feet up in the air; it then in
 flames   and    separates,   with  a  slight hissing explosion, into a
 great many minute particles           of brilliant sire. When these
 are collected they prove         to be a true oxyde        of iron, but  so
 much saturated with oxygen as to             possess  no magnetic obe
 dience. The surface of oxygenated             iron,   when running, is
 covered   with waving      flakes  of   an obscure smoky flame, ac
 companied with a hissing noise ; forming a wonderful con
trast with     the sine rich covering of plumbago in the other
 state of the metal, occasionally parting and exhibiting the
 iron in    a  state  of the   greatest apparent       purity, agitated in
 numberless minute fibres, from the abundance of the carbon
 united with the metal.
    When iron thus highly oxygenated comes to rest, small
specks of oxyde begin to appear floating upon the surface :
these increase in size 5 and when the metal has become solid,
the upper surface is found entirely covered with a scale of
blue oxyde of various thicknesses, dependent upon the stage
of oxygenation or extreme privation of carbon. This oxyde,
in common, contains about 15 per cent, of oxygen, and is
very obedient to the magnet. In place of a dark blue smooth
surface, convex and richly carbonated, the metal will, exhibit
a deep, rough, concave face, which, when the oxyde is re
moved, presents a great number of deep pits. This iron in
fusion stands less convex than carbonated               iron, merely be
cause it is less susceptible    of  a state   of  extreme division ; and
    Vol.   V.                         S                              indeed

130                On the Produftlon    of Cast Inn,
indeed    it seems a principle    in all metallic fluids, that they
are convex in proportion to the quantity       of carbon with which
they are saturated.       This iron flows  dead aud ponderous, and
rarely parts in (hades but at the diuance of i'oaie inches from
each other.
     This is a slight sketch of the appearance of the two ex
 treme qualities    of crude, or pig-iron, when in a Hate of fu
 sion.    According to t!ie ilivilioa formerly made, there still
 remains two intermediate flakes of quality to be described :
 these are, carbonated and carbo-oxygena'.ed iron; that is,
 No.    a and 3   of  the  manufacturers.     Carbonated iron exhi
 bits, like   No.  1, a beautiful   appearance    in the runner and
 pig. The breakings of the fluid, in general, are less fine :
 the agitation less delicate ; though the division of the fluid is
 equal, if not beyond that of the other.           When the internal
 ebullition of the metal is greatest, the undulating shades are
 smallest    and most     numerous   : sometimes     they assume the
 shape   of small segments; sometimes fibrated croups; and at
 other times minute circles, of a mellower colour than the
 ground of the fluid.       The surface of this metal, exposed to
 external air, when cooling is generally slightly convex, and
  full of punctures : these, in iron of a weak and fusible nature,
  are commonly      iinall in the diameter, aud of no great depth.
  In strong metal, the punctures are much wider and deeper.
  This criterion, however, is not infallible, when pig-iron of.
  different works is taken collectively.           At each individual
  work,    however, that iron will be strongest whose honey
  combs are largest and deepest.
      Carbo-oxygenated, or No. 3, pig-iron, runs smoothly,
  without any great degree of ebullition or disengagement of
  metallic sparks.      The partings upon     its surface are longer,
   and at greater distances from each other than in the former
   varieties ; the shape they assume is either elliptical, circular,
   or curved.   In cooling, this   metal acquires a considerable  por
   tion of oxyde;     the surface  is neither   markedly convex nor
   concave; the punctures are less, and frequently vanish alto
   gether. Their absence, however, is no token of a smooth
   face succeeding    : in qualities of  crude   iron oxygenated be
   yond this,   I have already mentioned that a concave surface
                                                                     is

                end the Operations    of the Blajl-Furnace.             131
 is the consequence         of  the extreme   absence   of carbon    ; and
 that, in proportion as this principle is absent,         the surface    of
 the iron acquires roughness and asperity.
     It may perhaps be proper here to mention, once for all,
 that although, for convenience, the manufacturer has, from
 a just estimation of the value of the metal in a subsequent
 manufacture, affixed certain numbers for determinate quali
 ties of iron, vet it is difficult to fav at what degree of.satu-
 ration of carbon each respective term commences: suffice
it then    to say, that the two alterative     principles, oxygen and
carbon, form two distinct classes, that in which oxygen pre
dominates, and that in which carbon predominates ; the
latter comprehends No. 1 and 2 of the manufacturers, the
former includes oxvgenated,            white and mottled ; and the
equalisation of these mixtures form, as has already been no
ticed, the varietv of carbo-oxvgcnated crude iron.
    I  shall    now observe some things relative to the various
faces which        crude iron assumes.       No. 1 and 2, with their
intermediate qualities, possess surfaces more or less convex7,
and frequently with thin blisters: this we attribute to the
presence of carbon, which being plentifully interspersed be
twixt and throughout the particles of the metal, the ten
dency which the iron has to shrink in cooling is entirely
done away ; it tends to distend the aggregate of the mass,
and to give a round face, by gradually elevating the central
parts   of   the surface,    which   are always last to lose their flu
idity.
    Again, that quality of iron known by           the name     of No.   3,
or caibo- oxvgenated, is most commonly found with a flat
surface.       If we still farther trace the appearance of the sur
face of pig-iron, when run from the furnace, we (hall find
No. 4, either with        a white   or mottled fracture,     possessed   of
concave     faces rough and deeply pitted.         Beyond this it may
be imagined        that every degree of further oxygenation would
be productive of a surface deeper in the curve, and rougher,
with additional        asperities.  The contrary    is the cafe  :  when
crude iron is      so far debased   as to be  mn from the furnace in
clotted    lumps highly oxygenated,         the surface   of  the pigs is
found lo be more convex than that of No.              1 iron ; but then
                                    S a                                the

1^3                    On the Produclion of Cajl            Inn,
the fracture of such metal presents an impure-mass covered
on both faces with a mixture of oxydated iron, of a blueifh
colour, nearly metallic.  In short, this quality of iron is in
capable   of receiving      such a degree          of fluidity     as to enable   us
to judge1 whether the convexity of'its surface is peculiar to iis
state, or is owing to its want of division as a fluid, whereby
the gradual consolidation of the metal is prevented.
   These features sufficiently distinguish betwixt the various
qualities of crude iron after they are obtained from the blast
furnace   there are, however, criterions not less infallible,
          :
whereby we can prejudge the quality of the metal many
hours before it is run from the furnace. These are the ca-                              '
lour and form of the scoria,                 the colour    of the vitrid crust
upon the working bars, and the                    quantity of carburet which
is attached to it. The variety of colour and form in the cin
der almost universally indicate the quality of the metal on
the hearth.   Hence, from a long course of experience, have
arisen the following denominations : " Cinder of sulphury
iron;"    " Cinder of No. 1, No. a, and No. 3 ;" and " Cin
der of ballast iron." Although at different works, from local
circumstances, the fame kind of scoria may not indicate pre
cisely the same quality of iron, yet the difference is so small
that the following description of the various cinders may
convey a very just idea of their general appearance.
   When the scoria is of a whitish colour and short form,
branching from the notch of the dam, and emitting from its
stream beautiful sparks of ignited carbon, resembling those
ejected from a crucible of call steel in fusion, exposed to ex
ternal air, or to the combustion of sine steel filings in a white
flame ;     when issuing from the orifice of the furnace,
          if,                                                                 it   is
of the purest white colour, possessing no tenacity, but in                         a
state of the greatest fluid division, and, when cold, resembles
a  mass of heavy torrefied spar, void of the smallest vitrid ap
pearance,       hard    and durable,     it       is   then certain that the fur
nace contains       J'ul   bury iron,
                                 super-carbonated iron.

                              a       of air   thrown  in per      is
minute, super-carbonated crude iron will be obtained with                          a
cinder of   longer form, with
                a                  rough fljnty fracture to

   That cinder which indicates the presence of carbonated
iron in the hearth of the furnace, forms itself into circular
compact streams, which become consolidated and inserted
into each other ; these are in length from three to nine feet.
Their colour, when the iron approaches the first quality, is a
beautiful variegation of white and blue enamel, forming a
wild profusion of             the elements       of   every known figure ; the
blues are lighter or darker according to the quantity                           of the
metal and the action of the external air while cooling.                         When
the quality of the pig-iron is sparingly carbonated, the blue
colour is less vivid, less delicate ; and the external surface
rougher, and more" sullied with a mixture of colour.       The
same scoria, when fused in vessels which    are allowed to cool
gradually, parts with all its variety of light and shade, and
becomes       of
              yellowish colour, sometimes nearly white when
                    a
the quantity of incorporated metal has been small.
   The cinder which is emitted from the blast-furnace when
carbo-oxygenated (or No. 3,) iron is produced, assumes a
long zig-zag form.    The stream is slightly convex in the
middle ; broad, flat, and obliquely furrowed towards the
edges.  The end of the stream frequently rears itself into
narrow tapered cones, to the height of six or eight inches :
these are generally hollow in the centre,                       and      are easily de
molished, owing to their excessive brittleness.       The colour
of this lava is very various; for the most part it is pale yel
low mixed with green.     Its tenacity is so great, that   while              if,
fluid,   a   small       iron hook    is   inserted into   it   at   a   certain degree
of   heat,    and        then drawn from              with
                                              quick but steady

with ease. If the colours are vivid and variegated, the thread*
will possess, upon     minute scale, all the various tints of co
                              a
louring which        found in the columnar mass.

ing-pipe,      it   isupon the return of the blast impelled with such
velocity as       to be blown into minute delicate fibres, smaller
than the most ductile wire; at first they float upon the air
like wool, and when at rest very much resemble that sub
stance.

   extending from the notch to the lowed part of the declivity;

   to form conical figures r these are, however, seldom perfect:
   for the quantity ot fluid lava, coaveved through the centre of
   the column, accumulates falter than the external sides of the
   cone are consolidated; and thus, when the structure isonlv
   half sinifhed, the       small crater vomits forth its superabundant
   lava, and is demolished.          The current of such lava falls hea
   vily  from    the   dam    as if surcharged   with metal, and emits
  dark red sparks resembling the agitation of straw embers.
   Its colour    is (till more varied    than the former descriptions of
   Icoriæ, and is found changing its hues through a creat va
   riety of greens shaded with browns.           Another variety ef sco
   ria, which, indicates the fame quality of iron, assumes a simi
  lar form; but has a black ground colour mixed with browns,
  or   is entirely black.        When the latter colour prevails, the
  texture     of  the   cinder becomes porous ; the quantity of iron
  left is now very considerable, and such           as  will  be easily ex
  tracted in     the assay-furnace     with proper fluxes. In cafes of
 total derangement in the furnace, the scoria will still retain
 this black colour, although the quantity of metal may amount
  to 2  j  per cent.;    the fracture,   however, becomes dense, and
  its specific gravity increases in proportion         to the quantity    os^
 metal     it holds incorporated.
      The next source of information, as to the quality of the
 iron in the furnace, is to be got from the colour of the scoria
 upon the working bars, which arc from time to time inserted
°to    keep the furnace free from lumps,           and to bring forward,
 the     scoria.    When super-carbonated crude iron is in the
 hearth, the vitrid crust upon the bars will be of a black co-
 four and smooth surface, sully covered with large and bril
 liant plates of plumbago.
      As the quality of the metal approaches to No. 2 (carbo
 nated), the carburet upon the scoria decreases both in point
 of quantity and size.
      When carbo-oxygenated iron (No. 3) is in the furnace,
 the     working      bacs    are  always coated    with,  a lighter    co-

appeared, but also the coally colour on the external surface of
the scoria ; what now attaches to the bars, is nearly of the
fame nature and colour as the lava emitted at the notch of
 the dam.
     These criterions are infallible; for, as the fusibility or car-
 bonation of the metal is promoted in a direct ratio to the
 comparative quantity of- the coally principle present in the
 furnace,      so    in the same proportion will the vitrid crust
 encircling the working bars exhibit the presence of that
 principle in the furnace.

      Errors    to be   avoided in Observations      refpttling Geology.
   ..T,HERE             arc some errors into which people may readily
   fall when they have not had long experience in any given
   kind of observation, and against which it is of importance to
   put beginners at least on their guard.
       2. One may be readily deceived            in regard    to the relative
   distances    of remote objects. All the stars and planets appear
   to be at an equal distance from us. Distant mountains all
   appear to be in the fame plain.            Thus those which are situ
    ated very far behind the rest, seem to form one body with
   them    ; so   that people believe they see continued and uninter
    rupted   chains when there are really none, and where the
    mountains, on the contrary, are insulated.
       The   absolute distance of objects, even when not very re-,
    mote,    is   equally difficult to be ascertained on high moun
                                                                        tains.

   i^S                     Hints for   the Formation    of
   tains, where the transparency of the air, and the absence of
  vapours, destroy the aerial perspective.               I have often ima
  gined that I had only two or three hundred steps to make in
  order to reach a summit, the distance of which from me was
  more than a leao;ue in a straight line.
      3. There are      a great  many errors in regard to strata. Their
  great    thickness     may make one believe that there are none
  where they really exist.          In the like manner, if the vertical
  strata, or those only very much inclined, present their planes
  to the eye     of the observer,     he will think    he sees sliapeless and
 indivisible     masses ;   while,    if their  sections   were   seen,  their
  divisions would readily be distinguished.              A mountain then
 must be      seen under aspects that intersect each other at right
  angles before we can pronounce that it is not divided by
  strata.
     4.   At other     times    accidental fissures, but produced how
 ever by a cause which           is common to them, exhibit the ap
 pearance      of strata when there are none; or when, if there
 are,   their situation is very different from that of those strata.
 It is the internal tissue of the stone only which in many cases
 can determine whether the divisions observed are the interstices
 between      strata or mere fissures ;      because   the strata arc con
 stantly parallel to the internal laminae,           or schistous texture of
 the stone.       Crystals, the lamellated texture          of which may
 sometimes       be confounded       with   a schistous   texture, may af
 ford an exception to this rule, by presenting laminae, perpen
 dicular to the planes of the strata ; but it is not difficult lo
 distinguish them.
     5. One may also form an erroneous opinion respecting
the direction of a mountain, or of its strata, when the eye is
not situated in their prolongation, or at least near it.
     6. The apparent situation of the strata may also lead into
an error.       They appear horizontal even when they are very
much inclined, and when they are not seen but in a section
formed by       a  plane parallel to the common section of their
planes with       the horizon.       It is impossible to judge of their
inclination,       and to measure it with certainty, but on a sec
tion perpendicular to the common section, which I have just
mentioned.
                                                                  6. A. The

      6.  A. The     greatest   error,   however, is that which            may
  be committed        in   regard  to the super-position       of  strata.    I
 have often seen novices in the study of mountains believe
 that one stratum reposed on another; one of granite, for ex
 ample, on one of slate 5 because they found slate at the bot
 tom of the mountain, and granite at the top ; while the slate
 was only laid against the base of the mountain, and the granite,
 on the other hand, was funk in the earth far below the slate.
 We      must not then fay, that a stratum is situated            below an
 other, but when we really fee it extending itself below it.
      7. And even when we distinctly see a rock placed above
 another, we must examine whether that which is uppermost
does not occupy that situation accidentally ; whether                   it has
not slipped, or rolled down, from a more elevated mountain ;
and, in the last place, though they may be closely connected,
one must examine whether their present situation is really
 the fame in which they were formed, and whether they have-
not been reversed, and united accidentally in a situation con
 trary to that of their original formation.
     8. One is frequently deceived, also, in regard to the nature
 of   stones and of mountains.          Though a well-accustomed eye
may often judge at some, and even a considerable diftance, of
 the kind of stone of which a mountain is composed, such
judgment is however often erroneous : mountains of granite,
 or gneiss, tender and destructible, often assume, at a distance,
 the     round form of secondary mountains; sometimes, also,
 mountains of calcareous stone, hard of their kind, and in
strata cither vertical or very much inclined,             present the bold
 forms, the peaks,         and sharp-angled indentations        of  the gra
 nite summits.
     9. People are often deceived even on a near view. A stone
 may have a foreign covering of mica, for example, while the
 interior part is of a very different nature.
      10. Effervescence with the nitrous acid is commonly con
 sidered as a certain character            of calcareous   stone;   but this
 character may be deceptive,             since barytes and magnesia ef
 fervesce    also*:    and we must not consider       it enough    to touch
     * And, on   the   other hand,  there are calcareous Itones which do not
 effervesce.

I38                           Hints for    the Formation        of
a stone with the nitrous acid, or to let fall a drop                       of the acid
on its surface,          since the absorbing earth,             whatever    it   is,   may
be only disseminated                 between argillaceous or siliceous parti
cles.         We, must therefore           immerse       a    fragment of the stone
in   quantity of the acid sufficient to dissolve
     a                                           entirely,           it                if
                                                                                        it
be wholly soluble, and observe whether there remains any
residuum that withstands solution.
     11.      The action of         the air and    of   meteors often gives fossils
appearances            absolutely    different    from those which they had
before they were subjected to it.                   We must not then be satis
fied with       a     superficial examination       :    we must sound the rocks
to the quick where the action                    of meteoric    agents has not pe
netrated.
     1   i.                              in considering compound
              People are often deceived, also,
stones as simple stones, when the composition of them does not
manifest itself on the first view, either on account of the small
ness of their composing parts, or because some of these parts
are each inclosed separately in              covering which conceals the
                                             a
interior of them.                 One may guard against this error   ob           by
serving the fossil in the sun              with
                                   strong magnifying glasses,
after having moistened its surface with water or the nitrous
acid, and still better  exposing    gradually to the flame of
                                    by             it
the blow-pipe.
   13. People are often deceived in regard to crystallisation,
either in the true form of the crystals, or, above all, in taking
for real crystals parasite crystals, or such as have been formed
in   the moulds made                by
                                  crystals of another kind.     Thus we
fee crystals          of quartz, petro-silex, and jasper, formed     the          in
moulds made              by   calcareous   crystals, and which have assumed
the form         of   the latter.
   14. In regard to errors occasioned            ignorance of the
                                                               by
distinctive characters of fossils, and of the names proper for
them, the only means of avoiding such errors          to study with  is
care good  authors   and,  above
                              ;    all, collections formed, or at
least arranged  and titled, bv able mineralogists.
   15. But   when  the slightest doubt    entertained in regard
                                                         is
to the denomination which ought to be given to any fossil,
an exact description must be made either of its external cha
racters or its molt striking physical properties, such as weight
                                                                                       and

and solubility *.              If this
                                   description is well drawn up, the
error respecting           the name may be rectified, and the observa
tion will not be lost,     it would be were there any reason to
                                     as
suspect the justness of the denomination, and no means of cor
recting it by a description f.
   16. When the characters of a fossil give it such a likeness
to another that it is found near the limits which separate the
genera or species           of   these two fossils, we must follow the ex
ample of Werner and his disciples, by marking that this fos
sil is intermediary, or forms a transition from the one species
to the other.            For    if   we stiould          ascribe        it   exclusively   to the
genus      A, without noting             which bring it near
                                            the characters
to the genus          B, another   on seeing the same fossil,
                                          observer,
might refer it to the genus B, and no one could know which
of them was deceived.
  17. People are often deceived also by mixing opinion with
observation, and giving the former for the latter; as when
people assert, that they have seen vestiges of extinguiflied vol
canoes, because they have seen black or porous stones, or
stones of a prismatic form, without deigning to describe them
with care, but by qualifying them merely as lava or basaltes.
   18. In the last place, a very frequent source of error  too                             is,
great   a   confidence          in   the fidelity        of one's memory, or in the
justness     of     one's first observations.               These two kinds of con
fidence      go often        hand in hand       cannot guard
                                                     ;     and      people
against the errors, which are the consequence of them, but
 by noting down, on the spot, all observations to which any
importance    attached, especially
                    is              they are   little complex,
                                                         if                  a

  +   A    person    now dead, who           in   his time was considered as         a   mineralo
gist, wrote    to me that he had found marine shells in granite.                      I    begged
him to give me an exact description of the stone which he called granitrt
He did so; but      I   perceived that the stone was          a   free-stone or sand-stone, and
the specimens he afterwards sent me proved that                   I     was not deceived.        We
may here recollect         Recupero's pyrites of Ætna. The errors of this kind,
arising   from  false  denominations,  are   innumerable    for an exact know

Utility both to the science of electricity in general, and par
ticularly to medical electricity, I resolved to make researches
on this subject by means of experiments. The method I
employed was as follows : — In order that I might examine
the electricity of my own body, I insulated myself on a board
which      stood on glass feet.             I   then touched, for              a   determined
time,(at first commonly half a minute, afterwards only a
moment,) the plate of my condenser, which I have described
in another                  *;   I
                      then applied the condenser to a Caval-
                    place
lo's highly sensible electrometer, as improved by M. Dc
Saussure, and, by means of a glass "tube rubbed with a piece
of woollen cloth,            examined        the kind    of electricity when an
nounced by the diverging threads.                         The electricity of the
plate of the condenser or electrometer, which corresponded
with that of the body, I marked with 4- when positive, with
—    when negative, and with o when none was present.                                                I
 made my experiments      on the 21st of February 1786; and
 since that period have repeated them, not only on myself, but
 on other persons, both male and female, of various ages and
 different constitutions, when they were in motion, or at rest ;
 dressed and undressed; when tired, and in good spirits; hot or
 cold    ; fasting     or full   ;   steeping or awake ; at different tempe
 ratures      of the weather         and    of the apartment, &c.
                            Results    of   the Experiments.
    I. Animal electricity is common to all men; for, as I
 found     in the course of my experiments, on thirty persons
              it,
 of both sexes and all ages, and of every habit of body,  can                             I
 with justice conclude on its being general.
    3. Animal electricity    different in different men, at the
                                       is
 fame place and at the fame time       not only in strength, but
                                                    ;
 also    in  kind; being in many weak, and others strong; in
              the
 some positive, and in some negative.
   3. This difference of electricity  often observed in dif

 cumstances           appear to be all equal.

ferent ; not only in different men, but also                               in the   same per
son.     In 2422 experiments, in which I examined my own
electricity, I found it 1252 times positive, 771 times nega
tive, and 399 times o. The electricity of my maid, in 94
experiments, was, on the other hand, 19 times positive, 33
times negative, and 42 times o.
   5. It often happens, that, during the experiment, the elec
tricity changes ; that                  is,
                          from positive to negative, or from
stronger positive to weaker, and at last becomes c.      then                         It
passes    from the last                 to    weak negative, and               gradually to
stronger.
    6.   It   happens        also, not unfrequently,                that the electricitv,
at the commencement of the experiment,       strongly positive           is
yr negative, but passes afterwards to the opposite kind with
the like force, which continues for considerable time.    a
    7.Notwithstanding this wonderful and almost continual
alternation, animal electricity appears to be naturally posi
tive.    As      the electric matter      throughout all na
                                                   is   diffused
ture, and adheres, in    fixed form, to no body, all the arti
                                    a
cles of our nourishment contain each their (hare of it.  The
electric fluid  disengaged, and diffused with the blood and
                   is
juices through the body                 ;     from which       it   is   conveyed off, after
being accumulated in        by the pores of the skin and other
                                    it,
ducts, when there       no interruption in them. This
                               is                             con
            by                                                                        is is

               a                                                                              a
person sits or reposes, and when there     consequently no great

loss of heat,      commonly positive.
                   it   is                Thus  the electricity of
•my body, which       examined while fitting at reft, when the
                         I
natural heat of the body was not disturbed, appeared,    332

experiments positive, in 14 negative, and in 10 was o.
  8. When animal electricity, therefore,      o, or negative,            is
the body must be in an unnatural state Qlatu violentoj.
  9. Cold changes natural or positive animal electricity into
the opposite kind, or at least lessens it. In 60 experiments
I   made on myself after coming from               cold air, the tempe

rature   of which            was at the freezing point or below      my                it,

an opportunity of observing the pleasant phenomenon, that
the negative electricity arising from cold, after pulling oft" a
cold and putting on a warm coat, was speedily converted int6
positive,    or the degrees next to it.                       When        the thermometer
stood several degrees                  above    the freezing point,               and a some
what cold wind prevailed,                      the latter was sufficient           to produce
negative or o electricity,      I experienced four times. Of
                                           as
13   times, while           I
                        lightly clothed
                                 fat     in a warm apartment,
the electricity was 8 times o, thrice   — , and twice weakly + .
Nay,   when   I clothed myself  well, and  remained any time at
a cooler part of the room, such as the open door or window,
I found     the electricity either negative or weakly positive.                                For
producing this effect, it is in general sufficient if a part only
of the warm body be exposed to cold.       When the electricity
was commonly         while -f-
                            , fat at perfect rest, on my usual

tive    my feet were extremely cold, without being able to
       if
assign any other cause for this phenomenon.         how                           It   is,
ever, fully proved                 by
                      the following circumstance  During                           :
33 times that    washed my hands and face with cold water,

pr after,   it    was, for the most part, strongly +                      .
     That cold        impedes positive electricity,                 or makes       it   less   and
reduces     it   to o, may be easily comprehended                             ;   because cold
causes every     thing                       the pores of animal
                                   to contract,         lessens
bodies,     and,      by
                    these means, obstructs the escape of the elec-
trie matter.          That        it,      this electricity into
                                        however, converts
negative, or gives to the external part of animal bodies the
property of extracting from other bodies, when in contact
with them, part of their natural electricity,
                  a                              not easy to be           is
explained    ;     for, in order to do so, they must themselves have
sustained    a    loss of their natural quantity of electricity. But
when,       by   the contraction           of
                                        they receive no more
                                                 the pores,
of the electric matter from the interior parts of the body,
they must, in order that the equilibrium be kept up, not sus
tain any loss of it. This loss  either real or apparent.
                                                  is     The
former can scarcely be asserted,                        as    there   are not sufficient
grounds for such an idea.   For                        if it   be said that the electric

matter naturally contained in the external part of the bod}\
is expelled by that accumulated more and more in the interior
parts, on account            of     the cold, and which thereby acquires                        a
 stronger repulsive power, it is of no weight ; since this power
would prevent the plate of the condenser from giving up any of
its natural electricity to the singer when applied to it. There
is more reason, therefore, to                    assert the      latter,    viz. that this
want is only apparent ; that                     is,   that the electric fluid, which
the external parts of the body naturally                         possess,   isnot expelled
by the effects of cold, but fixed, or                       so    fast   united nith the
parts       in which       it   is   contained, that            it   loses all movements
and gives no indications               of    its presence.            This kind of union
is   not uncommon in nature                  :   it    takes place      in regard to the
particles of sire, which                   produce heat         ;    when moist bodies
evaporate, or when salt                is   mixed with ice.
     10. Lassitude impedes also the positive animal electricity, or
changes   into the opposite.
              it             During id times that walked                         I
backwards and forwards in my apartment, or was otherwise
employed, the temperature of the weather being 10, 12, 14,
and more            of heat, and no cold wind prevailing at
                   degrees

              I                                         five                          +
                                                                                      ,
times o, and ten times —  .  In 32 experiments, when stand
ing at rest, the electricity was 30 times o, and twice weakly + .
In 27 experiments, while fat at rest,  I      was always strong  it
ly   +  ;   and    in   five experiments, while walking at                       a   moderate
pace,     was perceptibly +.

on mv servant and another young man.
 I   will not, however, say that the electricity, when the body
isin    state of rest, always ceases, or
        a                                 changed from positive.

Many times the strength of the body                          is     greater than to allow
of its being exhausted  fatigue, as   by                   I      have more than once
experienced.
     11. Bv rubbing             a    part   of    the body, positive electricity            i3
not impeded.              The rubbing may                 be performed           with linea
or woollen.
   12. Sudden, speedy, and violent motion can change every
kind of animal electricity into the opposite. A luminous and
beautiful appearance was occasioned                             when     I   inclined     and
railed my body suddenly                 in   turns, and threw upwards quickly
                                                                                          and

and with     a  certain degree of violence, sometimes my arms
§nd sometimes my lesjs.            Under these circumstances the
electricity was thrice changed from — to +, and 16 times
from o, or weak + , to — . On my servant, under the same
circumstances, it was eight times changed from              +  to —;
and on my maid five times from — to + .
     13. Everyother motion     of the body, not connected with such
 violence, or with uncommon agitation of the limbs, when it
does not produce much fatigue, does not impede positive ani
mal electricity.
     14. Such motion is no impediment also to negative animal
electricity.
     15. After noon, or dinner-time, animal electricity is not
greater than common.
      16. The  use of coffee makes no change in animal electricity.
      17. Continual straining of the thoughts is not only favour
able to positive animal electricity, but increases it in an un
common degree.
      18. Animal electricity is impeded by perspiration.
      19. Animal electricity is stronger in winter than in summer.
      20. Repose at noon, or any other stiort sleep when sitting in
 the day-time, does not disturb positive auimal electricity.
      21. The breath does not conduct animal electricity in a
 perceptible manner. I breathed on the cover of the condenser
 in various places, hut I never found the least traces of elcc-
 tricitv.    The electricity, in all probability,   was dispersed top
 speedily, or was too subtile to be perceptible.
      22. Bodily motion is by no means necessary for producing
 animal electricity;
      23. Neither does it depend on the movement occasioned
 by respiration.
      24.  Animal electricity    arises also without  friction of the
 clothes.     My   experiments   leave no doubt on this subject;     as
 I   found the eledlricity on my own body lively and durable for
  half an hour, or an hour, when I had on no clothes. I do
  not sav, however, that the friction of the clothes does not
  increase it.
      25. Animal electricity is excited without any friction     of the
  external parts of the body.
   .  26. There is also a spontaneous      kind of animal electricitv.

     mischievous Effects of Septic Acid are refrained by Pot-afb

     in a Letter from Dr. Milchill to Dr. Priestley, dated
     Plandome,       May 4,        1799.           Communicated        by   Dr. MlT-
     CHILL.
 o,'N        a former occasion (2 Medical Repository, p. 236 el
feq.) an attempt was made to shew that the septic acid, which
 is formed in certain putrefactive processes, was materially dif
ferent in its constitution and qualities from the nitrous acid
obtained by distillation from saltpetre.   Since the composi
tion of that piece, I have observed that Juncker, in his view
of the doctrines of Beccher      and Stahl, (2 Conspectus Chimie,
p. 280,) is of       the fame opinion, declaring, that in whatever
manner the work of separating it from the putrescent or
other bodies with which it was naturally mingled, was un
dertaken, " ne micula tamen acidi nitrosi pure sistitur," not
a particle of pure nitrous acid can be obtained. And he warns
his reader, that in the observations which he offers he means
that spirit of nitre only which is liberated from its connec
tion with an alkaline salt. On the native septic acid, which
 is,   as he   allows, furniflicd         so   largely   by   the animal kingdom,
(p. 277,) and        is   by    far the molt active           and interesting        form
of oxygenated seplon,             Juncker, like          most      other writers, has
said scarcely any thing at all.
     The highly       destructive      effects      of this offspring of      putrefac
tion have been pointed out in detail in former essay      Me

                 Dr. Milchill's        Observations      on  Pot-Jjb.             I47
      The   scptite of pot-ash       has been denominated a salt            of many
  excellent qualities, a sal poly cbrejlus ; and a great physician
  once wished, for the good of his profession, there could be
  found one other remedy so certain and steady in curing dis
  eases   as  nitre.       It  has likewise been termed an antiphlogistic
 remedy,       good for all manner            of inflammatory        diseases   with
 phlogistic density           of  the blood;       possessing   fine attenuating
 powers, being in nowise                acrimonious;        and happily       calcu
 lated to withstand a putrescent              state  of the body.       It  has fur
 ther been called         a   refrigerant,     a diuretic, and     a  carminative,
 and    employed        accordingly by those prescribes              who are in
 fluenced     by the nominal efficacy of remedies.
     Such are some of the superlative effects ascribed to this
 compound of the acid of pestilence and pot-ash : and for a
 considerable time after I became acquainted with the mis
 chievous effects,          wrought occasionally by the naked septic
 acid,   I   remained       in the belief that the strongest of the alka
 lies   could    hold it fast, and keep it entirely harmless.                      It
 therefore did not appear to me improbable                    that the charac
 ter of the compound of the two might, as in a multitude of
 other cases, be exceedingly different from that of either the
 constituent acid or alkali.
     But latterly     I   have been inclined to the opinion,              that pot
 ash is capable      of combination with            oxygenated     septon in dif
ferent degrees      ;    that is to fay, septon, before combining with
the alkali,      may have been united to more or                 less of oxygen;
 and also septon,           in  any  of  its degrees     of oxygenation, may
 be united       with     pot-ash     in different proportions : in other
words, the acid may vary in its Jlrengtb, and likewise, on
every degree of strength, may be united to the alkali in va
rious proportion.           The nitrum nitratum, described by the older
chemists, is an example of pot-ash super- saturated with nitric
acid, and, strange to tell ! has been extolled for its advan
tageous operation in ardent fevers, accompanied with thirst
and with a dry and foul tongue.                       I have strong reason to
think that there is a disproportion between the acid and al
kali in other forms of nitre              ;  as  I have known litmus-paper
to be turned repeatedly reddish by a watery solution                        of salt
petre,    the   residue      of   a quantity       which    was   swallowed by
                                        U   a                              mistakej

mistake,  and which nearly deprived a man of his life.  A set
as correct experiments is wanting to elucidate more com
pletely this part of a very curious and highly important sub-
ject.
   Be these things as they may, all experience shews that the
connexion between septic acid and pot-ash is'easv to dissolve ;
at least, a portion of oxygen separates very readily from the
nitre.        The experiment of reddening                     blood by mixing pow
dered saltpetre with               it,   was known to Hoffman,               and,  I      think,
fairly evinces        a    partial decomposition of             the salt.         It   seems ta
have    similar operation upon the residue of that fluid in ths

attracted from the nitre.
   But     heightening of colour

                                                      is

hardntfs which render                     them difficult to be cut and to be
 chewed. Tl»e septic acid seems in some degree to be dis
joined from the pot- ash, and evidently assists in decomposing,
to   a   certain point,          the      vascular    and    fibrous strr.cture of the

to cure such diseases immediately afterwards.
     While I    was considering these things, a cafe fell under my
observation, which allowed me fully to witness the operation
of this boasted cooler, carminative, and fibrifuge.                It shews,
beyond a doubt, that septic acid, though coerced by pot-ash,
is in some degree septic acid still.           Its native virulence does
 not even then wholly forsake it. Nitre ought to be ranked
 among the poisons; for, in a sufficient dose, it is truly a poi
 son. Though it may be administered in small quantities with
 out exciting terrible symptoms, it resembles in that respect
 most other venomous substances, which can be swallowed
 without     detriment, and even often with             advantage,     when
 their   dose is  not too large.     It  is time for writers     of Dispen
 satories, and on Materia Medica, to know the facts concern
 ing nitre and its operation, and to publish them for the sake
 of undeceiving their readers.              Too long has the medical
  world been the dupe of idle and partial opinions on this sub
 ject.     Read the following accident, and judge of what I have

      A carman, of middle age, had followed his business as
  usual on Saturday the 30th day of April 1799.                  On Sunday
  morning he determined          to take    a saline  cathartic for an in
  disposition    too trifling to require     the advice     of a physician.
  Accordingly      his wife dissolved an ounce of what          stie believed
   to be sulphate    of soda (Glauber's salt) in water, and gave it
   to him at a draught.         He swallowed it. Soon after he was
   severely incommoded by what he termed
                                                        "  a great weakness
   about his heart."        Nausea came on, and was followed by
   vomiting of     the contents   of the stomach, mixed with consi
   derable quantities      of blood   at each time.       His   strength   was
    exceedingly impaired      :  and a sensation     of   coldness   over th«j
    whole body was remarked by him, particularly in the extre
    mities.    I did not fee him until after the bloody vomiting
    had continued at times for several hours, and then his pulses
    at the wrist were very slow. He was however quite rational,
    and said he then felt much better than he had done.                On  ex
    amining what kind of salt he had taken, for some crystals of
    «t remained in a wide- mouthed bottle,            I  found it to be sep

   before nortn, and he had taken it at fix in the morning.              As
   it  had had no purgative      effect,  I ordered   him some castor-oil,
   and almond       milk   sweetened with sugar, or some       milk-whey,
  and some water-gruel.
       In 35 Commentar.        de Rebus, fee. p. 176, a case is men
  tioned of death from taking an ounce of nitre : and if a part
  of the quantity which this man took had not been vomited
  up, he probably would have died too.               The ol. ricini purged
  him gently, and he gradually got better, but complained
  very much of weakness about the præcordia.
      There are numerous other accidents not materially unlike
  these.     Such occurrences give us no very favourable account
  of the benignity of nitre          as a medicine.       It is a pity that
 practifers of physic do not         better   understand   the component
 parts of their prescriptions.         How     few know that, in admi
 nistering nitre, their patients are made to swallow a portion
 of the    nauseating and sickening acid of putrefaction !
      Possibly these remarks may have a tendency to remove the
 doubt contained in your letter of April 11, 1799. You will
 hereby perceive that my native acid ofsepton is a combination
 of this basis with oxvgen and water ; whereas your artificial
 acid    of nitre undergoes a partial decomposition by the heat of
 distillation, and is adulterated besides with whatever happens
 to be mingled with it during and after its combination with
 the vegetable fixed alkali.          And both these forms of acid
differ from atmospherical air ; inasmuch as the former are
 chemical mixtures, the latter is mechanical.
      It would    be better for science    if the word   "nitre" was    re
jected altogether from use. Nitria, whence the term comes,
was, vou know, a district of ancient Egypt, famous for the
quantity of mineral alkali which it afforded. (D'Anville's
Geograph. — Egvpt.)            This saline substance has thence been
called by the names nitrum, nitre, &c.                In confirmation of
which, I      observe,    in the Dictionary of Calepinus, printed at
Basil in 1538,       that   what they called nitrum was a material
employed       to cleanse clothes, and wash the bodies which wore
them.       And S. Bochart remarks,           (1 Opera. Chanan,     L. II.
cap. xiv.)      that the ancients made        %  kind of ley from    ashes,
                                                                     sodak

 need not remark to you, that I employ the word

     It is highly  desirable that some      of our men, whose opinions
 have weight with the public,          would    peruse the work of Lan-
 cisi, physician to Pope Clement XI, on the noxious exhala
 tions of marshes. (De Nox. Palud. Effluviis.)                 By the per
 severing and luminous researches of this great man, it was
 found, as long ago as the year 1716, that marsh-water, by
 simple distillation, (Ibid. Lib. II. c. xii.) manifested an acid
 quality; and that calcareous stones (Ibid. Lib. II. c.ii.) were
 better for paving the streets of cities than Jiliceous ones, be
 cause the alkaline nature of the former was adapted to imbibe
 the noxious moisture of the air, and sweeten the acid salts
 with which       it abounded. Indeed, much of the matter de
  tailed by the writers      of our     days on local      sources   of dis
  tempers,    may be found better observed, and better stated, by
  Lancisi,    than in their writings.          By the by I observe        he
  mentions the English         philosopher Mayow, (Ibid. Lib.            II.
  P. ii.  cap. 2.)
      If the philosopher      of Rome       had   reasoned upon his own
  discovery,    he could not have failed to draw the              inference,
  that by alkaline subjlanccs might the hydra of pestilence
  be overcome. — As I have mentioned this monster, I stiall
  pause a little to give you my opinion of the allegory among
  the ancients concerning her : and I attempt the explanation
  the more     willingly,  as  I believe    Lord Verulam       has said no
  thing about it. The      fable is  this : — In Peloponnesus,      between
  Mycenæ and Argos, there was a fen or marsli                of some extent
  called Lerna.      This muddy      and stagnating pool was inhabited
   by Hydra,     a horrible    and    devouring monster with several
  heads; some fay seven, others nine, and others fifty. The
   malignity of her poison was such that a wound from an ar
   row dipped into it was instantly mortal.              She made dreadful
   havoc among the people of the surrounding country, and de
   voured a great number of their sheep and other cattle.                  In
   obedience    to the orders     of   the tyrant Eurystheus, Hercules
   went to fight this destructive        and formidable creature.         On
                                                                          his

 15*         Dr. Mlithtil's     Observations   en   Pot-AJb,
his approach, a crab came forth to the assistance of Hydri J
but Hercules crushed the crab, and afterwards slew Hydra.
Of the heads of Hydra, it was reported, when one was cut
off, two would sprout from the wound, unless prevented by
the immediate application of fire. Hercules, availing himself
of the  aid  of  fire, succeeded in his undertaking.        In the ninth
figure of Montfaucon's 66th          plate, there   is a figure  of Her
cules with crabs near his feet, having, as the learned father
curiously enough remarks, a relation to some mystery which
he does not comprehend,           (i Antiquity  explained, Art. Her
cules, chap, ix.)
   Now, it    appears to me, this is an allegory expressive        of the
pestilential vapours      emitted   by the bog   of Lema,     and  of the
means found by experience            useful to drain off its stagnant
water, and to clear the adjoining and surrounding morasses.
   The word        "  hydra" is derived from iJ^o, water.           This
fluid then, detained upon the marsh of Lema, favoured oc
casionally the production of unwholesome exhalations. Such
Tapours, being at once invisible and injurious, were ascribed
to some preternatural enemy or destructive monster; and
being diffused, or wafted around the country, and often
times cutting off both man and beast, were fancied to be
the effect of the supposed monster's poison.               According to
their extent and virulence was she reported to have fewer or
more heads for preparing and inflicting this poison. The
mere draining off the water, and leaving the mud and slime
bare, was termed         cutting off an head      ; and  the increase of
deleterious gases, in consequence of exposing such a naked
surface, was aptly expressed by the sprouting forth of two in
its place.    By cauterising, or searing, was understood either
the  solar  heat   in drying the ground aster the water was drained
awav, or the burning up of the trees, shrubs, and obstacles-

The crab, who        was Hydra's ally, perhaps does not refer to the
fun's place   in   the constellation Cancer, so much as to shew the
frequent recurrence of the difficulties, and the superior strength
and skill requisite to overcome them. In the whole allegory
" Hercules"        may be understood to mean
                                                     " insuperable cou

  century, wants a Hercules. This interpretation is confirmed
 by another consideration, that the ancients had not only
 their Hydra, who lived in the water, but their Cberfydra,
 who remained           after   the inarm or fen was dried up.          Cber-  -
sydra, being derived from the two words, xfP*°Si land not Jit
for the plough ; and i/?f x, the monfler of the fens ; will thus
 mean the venomous and sickly condition of the neighbouring
 atmosphere        after the      water was exhaled, and the ground at
 the fame time not rendered arable thereby, typified by a poi
 sonous serpent : and was thus expressive of the rage of pesti
 lential effluvia, which sometimes, and under certain circum
 stances,     continue in        a  virulent state, in dry weather, near
 their dried sources.
      Hydra    is seemingly mentioned by            Virgil (Æn, vi. v.576.)
 as a fictitious    or poetical animal. Bochart, however, with his
 usual prodigious erudition, appears desirous to make the whole
 story literally      intelligible. (Hierozoici pars poster. Lib. III.
 cap.   xiii.)    But Lancisi, with a more clear and discriminating
 mind, perceives^that important physical truths are concealed
 under this two-fold allegory, and mews how they are to be
 unriddled.        (De Nox. Palud. Effl. Lib. II. p. ii. cap. 3.) —
 In considering these matters you will not fail to recoiled! that
  the classical writers,       and others, use the word          " hydrus" as
  well as    "   hydra,"      and some       of them apparently confound
  the two.        The former noun of the masculine gender is pro
  bably    the    name of the real animal, the water-Jnake, the
  latter of the imaginary one. — But of this enough.
      If pestilential    matter,     as I  observed before,    can be subdued
  by alkalies, then the formation of septite of pot ash in the
  alimentary canal must be a very frequent and common pro
  cess.    It   is universally agreed that pestilential matter may be
  taken into       thfc  stomach       bv swallowing;        and no reasonable
  doubt can be entertained os its production within that organ,
  and other parts of the intestinal tube, from the corrupted re
  mains of food.         The whole tenor of prescription, as explained
  m my     letter concerning the use          of alkaline remedies in fevers,
   (I  Medical Rcpos. p. 265.) goes to shew that the offending
   cause is   of an acid quality: and in its worst forms, T think
   the acid engendered            has fepton for its basis; since aliment,

    Mr. W. H. PepysJuii.                          Communicated      by   the Author.
 X     HE difficulty attending the exhibition of acid and al*
kaline gases, was the first inducement to Priestley, Lavoisier,
and others, to use mercury for such experiments        but the              ;
great expence and enormous weight of this fluid obliged
many accurate and experienced chemists to relinquish them
almost  entirely, as there appeared no other likely means of
succeeding but          by
                    its means and that of the exhausted re
ceiver.       Acontrivance to lessen the quantity of mercury
necessary  for  such experiments was therefore a desirable ob
ject and
      ;         by
                 introducing the dome used    Mr. Watt in his  by
 hydraulic  bellows,     have
                            I succeeded in constructing an ap
paratus      in which both of the above-mentioned requisites are
obtained at       a    comparatively small expence.                  As    it   is   hardly
                                                                                 possible

 possible to japan tin or copper so perfectly as to prevent their
 being attacked by mercury when brought in contact with
 them, I had the cylinders turned in lignum vitæ, on which
 the mercury has no action : the conducting tube is of glass ;
 and the cocks are coated on the inside with varnish,
     The   usefulness          of   an apparatus so constructed        will   appear
 sufficiently obvious, when it is recollected               that all   gases passed
 through any other fluid than mercury, water for instance,
 take up a quantity of moisture, which adds considerably to
their gravity, and makes                  it impossible    to determine        their
real weight.
  For weighing of gases I make use of a glass globe                      and stop-
cock of a smaller size than is commonly employed,                        as greater
accuracy can be obtained by using a proportionally delicate
beam than by employing a larger globe, which must be sus
pended to abeam of such strength as greatly to increase the
friction on its axes. It is of great importance, in the analysis
of   bodies, or in other chemical experiments, to be able ta
ascertain with accuracy the weight of any gas obtained by
the process.    The weight of two or more quantities of gas
should however be always tried, and the mean be taken to
prevent any error.

meter, made of glass, furnished with a cock at top, and ab'e

   small    globules of mercury by the small end b, by which
   means they are elevated into the receiver at 0. It is useful
   likewise tor removing mercury from the small cistern.
       One of the principal objections to the use of mercury in
   such experiments as this apparatus           is intended for, has been,
   the great force necessary to overcome the resistance of a co
    lumn of mercury when gases are to be received over that
    dense fluid ; a resistance     in the proportion of one inch of
    mercury to fourteen inches of water, and which very few
    lutes are able to withstand. This resistance I overcome by
     a very simple contrivance      : a bent tube fitted       into the beak
                                                                             of

ratus, and passing into the upper part of the small receiver,
as expressed in the plate at C.   By employing mercury for
such experiments, another advantage      gained    the use of     is            by
this apparatus, namely,   power of exhaustion in the retort,
                                              a

                                                  a
cury, or 38 inches of water. This will be easily conceived
when     it   is    recollected                       by
                               drawing up the large receiver

the cistern.   The cock of the small receiver       then to be              C   is
turned off, and that of the large one   to be turned on. The     A

 to the preparation of the fluid alluded to, I had made a great
 variety of experiments, in some of which I treated the ful-
  phat of iron precisely as there directed ; but since that time,
 I  have, with a view to improvement, followed the rule which
 is there prescribed strictly, and have besides, at former inter
 vals, gone over          and    varied    the
                                       experiments of Macquer,
 Lewis, Berthollet, Ribancourt,     Proust, and other celebrated
 chemists, both foreign and native, who have treated on this
 and other subjects nearly allied to it; with a view, if pos
 sible, to establish certain data upon which to ground the best
mode of fabricating the article in question, being very de
sirous constantly to obtain an ink for the common purposes
of penmanship, which, at the same time that it should flow
with freedom, should have the proper degree os lustre or glos
siness, and be at the moment of using intensely black, with
a capabilityof retaining that colour continually, even though
openly exposed to the action of the sun and air.       This, I
presume,       I   have accomplished      :    at least, during a space         of   ten
years,    I   have never    met with any formula which has so well
rewarded       my pains    as the one     which     I   am about to commu
nicate.       Having     been brought          up in    a    line of business in
which     I   am in the daily habit       of   observing       the action      of   such
substances         upon each other        as   enter    into the formation of
ink, it may                                             in
                                           a practical point of
                    be readily imagined that,
view, my opportunities for the improvement of it have fallen
little short of any individual whatever. If to this I add, that,
since the year 1794,        1   have annually supplied the public with
at least 17,000 gallons         of ink,   besides preparing powder for its
occasional production, it may be inferred that I have spared
no pains in studying what would best conduce to its perfect-
ability ; and after the many attempts which I have made,                               I
have never  found my expectation or that of my friends de
ceived, when the process has been conducted agreeably to the
following directions :— rln six quarts (beer measure) of water,
(it                 of importance whether be rain, river, or
      does not appear                                        it

wood, chipped very thin across the grain    (the boiling may
                                                         ;
be continued near an hour;) adding from time to time     little             a
tolling water,       to compensate    for waste         by   evaporation   ;   strain
                                7                                                   Uhj

the liquor whilst hot, suffer it to cool, and make up the
quantity equal to five quarts by the further addition of cold
water. To this cold decoction put one pound averdupois
weight of blue galls, or 20 ozs. of the best galls in forts,
which  should be first coarsely bruised ; 4 ozs. of sulphat of
iron, calcined to whiteness ;          i oz. of        the acetite       of copper,
which should be triturated in   mortar, moistened by a little
                                        a
of the decoction gradually added till it be brought to the
form of a smooth paste, and then thoroughly intermixed with
the whole mass.        Three ounces of coarse brown sugar, and six
ounces      of good gum Senegal,        or    Arabic,    are also to be added.
These several ingredients may be introduced one after the
other immediately, contrary to the advice of some, who re
commend the gum, &c. to be added when the ink is nearly
made ; as gum, however, is at present exorbitantly dear, three
or four ounces will        be found sufficient, with only one and an
half ounce of sugar,       unless, for particular purposes,             it is wanted
to bear a higher gloss than common.    In regard to the use
of sugar, which I have here recommended, I hope I shall not
trespass    in remarking, that my           observations,         on   a very exten
sive scale, are coincident with              those   of M. Ribancourt,            who
                 of fluidity is by its means imparted, which
fays, that a degree
allows the     of gum to be enlarged considerably beyond
                dose
what it would bear without it; and it is thereby rendered
less liable to clog the pen, which, especially when the nib is
very fine, if it does not flow freely, quits it so flow as unplea
santly to retard the writer, and is totally unfit for fine manu
scripts ; besides, by such an union             of gum            and sugar,      a de
gree   of   consistency    is given to the liquor, which enables it to
suspend  a much greater portion of colouring matter than
otherwise could be effected ; a circumstance of the greatest
importance to its hue and permanency.           It is far from my
design,  in thus  transmitting my  ideas, to induce   a supposition
that it is exactly after this manner that I, or any other person,
who supply ink by wholesale, compound it; so far from                                  it,
that the first cost of one gallon, on the plan here suggested,
would exceed twice the sum which          usually paid for  to

be particular    in their manuscripts, the rule   I  have  here   laid
down will be found fully to answer their expectations at a
cheaper rate than they are in general furnished with it. The
best vessel, in my opinion, in which to make ink, is a com
mon stone bottle, which will contain half         as  much more as
is proposed to be made, and which should be agitated twice
a day, and be left uncorked, in order to expose fresh surfaces
of the liquor to the action of the air, without which it can
not be expected to write very black when first used, but with
this precaution may be fit for use in about 14 days ; when
it may be poured from its dregs, and corked up, to preserve it
from dust, as well as waste by evaporation.         In cold weather
it should   never be suffered to freeze,   which   is found to cause
a disunion    of its parts, nor does it ever afterwards recover its
former intensity of colour, lustre, or durability.        Many per
sons, I am aware, disapprove, and therefore omit the use of
logwood, from an apprehension that it induces a tendency in
the ink to fade ; this however, from the strictest attention, I
can assert to be fallacious, at least where it is not had recourse
to by way of substitute for the other more expensive articles m}
indeed its effects are quite the reverse, where all the ingredi->
ents are properly proportioned. As to the beautiful complexion
which is given by it to the entire mass of fluid, it would be
Heedless to insist,    unless for the fake of those who are unac
quainted how a mixture of the acetite of copper and logwood
liquor work together, and by which, in this instance, a rich
ness and bloom       is given, which can in no other way be got
with equal economy and success; independent of which, the.
colouring matter of the wood, by its affinity with the oxyde
 of iron, has a very powerful effect to blacken the ink, and
to render it less capable of change from any unsaturated acid
in the sulphat of iron, or from the operation of the air.             I
 am aware, too, that the introduction of cupreous matter ha9
 been objected to, on the score of its injuring the penknife by
 a portion of copper attaching itself thereto in consequence of
 superior elective attraction, whereby it has been remarked
 that a part of the knife's edge is dissolved, and a quantity of
 oSppef answering thereto is exchanged and deposited in its
 place, which is always said to happen when the pen retain*

a little ink at the time of its being mended. This, I think,
is spinning out the effect of chemical affinity too far; for
although, with respect to the reasoning, the truth must be
admitted, I contend, notwithstanding, that its consequences
to the edge are not apparent to the eye ; nor is any sensible
detrimental change, thereby produced upon the knife, more
than what is induced by any other ink into which neither
the sulphat or the acetite of copper is introduced. As to
myself, however, I have nover yet seen a receipt for the form
ation of ink, where each of the principles were so completely
proportioned and saturated with each other as to be rnert
when applied to the surface of a piece of polished metal,
such as iron, for example; nay, even the frequent contact of
water only,       if allowed   to remain', would spoil any instrument
made       of that material.     I (hall not enlarge on this particular,
conceiving the most powerful objection I can offer in opposi

acetite of copper has always been used.    But even admitting,

true,      how many hundred pens might be made and mended
ere   it   would be requisite to bestow twopence to the cutler for
the exercise of his art?              In   short,   if    the introduction         of   the
substance alluded to into ink be                a   fault,I   consider   it   as one     of
no consequence when put in competition     with the advantages
of                                   of colour imparted

 all those precautions to avoid errors, which a knowledge of
 the various sources of them, and an earnest desire to deter
 mine a fact which I conceived to be of importance to be
 known, could inspire      :  but though all my researches tended
'to convince me, more and more, that a body acquires no ad
 ditional weight upon being heated, or rather, that heat has no
 effect whatever upon the weights of bodies, I have been so
 sensible of the delicacy of the inquiry that I was for a long
 time afraid to form a decided opinion upon the subject.
    Being much struck with the experiments recorded in the
 Transactions of the Royal Society, Vol. LXXV. made by
 Dr. Fordyce, upon the weight said to be acquired by water
 upon being frozen ; and being possessed of an excellent ba
 lance, belonging to his most Serene Highness the Elector
 Palatine Duke of Bavaria, early in the beginning of the
 winter of the year 1787 (as soon as the cold was sufficiently
 intense   for my purpose) I set about to repeat those experi
 ments, in order to convince myself whether the very extraor
 dinary fact related might be depended on ; and with a view
 to removing, as far as was in my power, every source of error
 and deception, T proceeded in the following manner: —
     Having provided a number of glass bottles, of the form and
 size  of what in England is called a Florence flask (blown as
 thin as possible) and of the fame shape and dimensions, I
  chose out from amongst       them two, which,      after using every
  mctlKjd    I could imagine of comparing         them together, ap
  peared to be so much alike as hardly to be distinguished.
     Into one of these bottles, which I shall call A,            I put
  4107,86 grains troy of pure distilled water, which filled it
  about half full ; and into the other, B, I put an equal weight
  of  weak spirit  of wine; and,      sealing   both the bottles  her
  metically, and washing them and wiping them perfectly
  clean and dry on the outside, I suspended them to the arms
  of the balance, and placed the balance in a large room,
  which     for some weeks        had been    regularly heated every
  day by a German stove,         and in which the air was kept up
  to the temperature     of  61° of Fahrenheit's thermometer, with
  very little variation.     Having suffered the bottles, with their
  contents, to remain in this situation till I conceived they
                                    Yj                            must

164                           An Inquiry      concerning the
must    have acquired             the temperature        of   the    circumambient
air, I wiped them afresh with a very clean dry cambric
handkerchief, and brought them into the most exact equi
librium possible, by attaching a small piece of very fine silver
wire to the arm of the balance, to which the bottle which
was the lightest was suspended.
  Having suffered the apparatus                     to remain in this situation
about twelve   hours longer, and finding no alteration in the
relative weights of the bottles, (they continuing all this time
to be in the most perfect equilibrium,) I now removed them
into         uninhabited room fronting the north, in which
       a large
the air, which was very quiet, was at the temperature of
ac/3 F., the air without doors being at the fame time at 37°;
and, going out of the room, arid locking the door after me,
I suffered the bottles to remain fortv-eight hours, undisturbed,
in this cold situation, attached to the arms of the balance as
before.
  At    the expiration            of that time      I   entered     the room, using
the utmost caution not to disturb                   the balance, when,           to my
great surprise,          I   found that the bottle            A   very sensibly pre
ponderated.
   The water which this bottle contained was completely
frozen into one solid body of ice ; but the spirit of wine, in
the bottle B, shewed no signs of freezing.
   I now very cautiously restored the equilibrium, by adding
small pieces of the very fine wire of which gold lace is made,
to the arm          of       the balance      to which     the bottle      B was sus
pended,    w        11   I found     that     the bottle   A      had augmented        ita

                    a  added  to the  opposite arm  of the ba

   Having had occasion just at this time to write                        to my friend,
Sir Charles Blagden, upon another subject,                          I    added   a   post
script to my letter, giving him    short account of this expe-

had been too hasty in my communication.        Sir Charles, in
his answer to my letter, expressed doubts respecting the fact ;
but, before his letter had reached me,                        I   had learned, from
my own experience,     how very dangerous it     in philoso                 is,
phical investigations, to draw conclusions from single expe
riments.
     Having          removed the balance, with the two bottles attached
to    from the cold into the warm room, (which still remained
     it,
at the temperature  of 610,) the ice in the bottle A gradually
thawed    and being at length totally reduced to water, and

this water having acquired the temperature of the surround
ing air, the two bottles, after being wiped perfectly clean and
dry, were found to weigh as at the beginning of the experi
ment before the water was frozen.
     This experiment, being                 repeated, gave nearly the fame re
sult, the water appearing, when frozen, to be heavier than
in its fluid state but some irregularity in the manner in
                               ;
which the water lost the additional weight which  had ap                          it
peared to acquire upon being frozen, when        was afterwards        it
thawed, as also      sensible difference- in the quantities of
                               a
weight apparently  acquired   in the different experiments, led
me to suspect that the experiment could not be depended on
for deciding the fact in question      therefore set about to
                                                     :    I
repeat     with some variations and improvements: — but, be
               it,
fore I give an account of my further investigations relative to
this subject,   may not be amiss to mention the method
                          it                                                                  [
pursued for discovering whether the appearances mentioned
in the foregoing experiments might not arise from the im
perfections of my balance; and      may likewise be proper to
                                                    it
give an account, in this place, of an intermediate experiment
which    made, with
           I             view to discover,
                                    a            shorter route,    by   a
and in     manner less exceptionable than that above-men
                a
tioned, whether bodies actually lose, or acquire, any weight,
upon acquiring an additional quantity of latent heat.
     My    suspicions          respecting    the accuracy         of   the balance arose
from       a   knowledge (which          I    acquired from the maker of                      it)
of the manner in which                  it   was constructed.
     The       three principal points          of   the balance         having been de
termined,            as   nearly   as possible,     by   measurement,             the axes    of
                                        6                                              motion

 166                   An Inquiry    concerning the
motion were firmly fixed in their places in          a  right line, and
the beam being afterwards       finished, and its two arms brought
to be in equilibrio,      the balance    was proved     by suspending
weights, which before were known              to be exactly equal, to
the ends of its arms.
    If with   these weights the balance remained       in equilibrio, it
was considered as a proof that the beam was just ; but, if one
arm was found to preponderate,             the other was gradually
lengthened, by beating it upon an anvil, until the difference
of   the lengths of the arms was reduced to nothing, or until
equal weights, suspended to the two arms, remained in equi
librio; care beingr taken, before each trial, to bring the two
ends    of  the beam to be in equilibrio,      by reducing, with the
file, the arm which had been lengthened.
    Though in this method of constructing balances the most
perfect equality in the lengths of the arms may be obtained,
and consequently the greatest possible accuracy, when used at
a time when the temperature of the air is the fame as when
the balance was made; yet, as it may happen that, in order
to bring the arms of the balance to be of the lame length,
one    of them may      be much more hammered than the other,
I  suspected it might be possible that the texture of the metal
forming the two arms might be rendered so tar different by
this operation as to occasion a difference in their expansions
with heat;      and that this difference   might occasion a sensible
error in the balance, when,           being charged with a great
weight, it should       be exposed    to a considerable      change of
temperature.
    To determine whether the apparent augmentation                    of
weight, in the experiments above related, arose in any               de
gree from this cause, I had only to repeat the experiment,
causing the two bottles A and B to change places upon the
arms of the balance; but, as I had already found a sensible
difference in the results of different repetitions of the fame
experiment, made a; nearly as possible under the same cir
cumstances,       and as it was above all things of importance to
ascertain     the accuracy of mv balance, I preferred making a
particular experiment for that purpose.
    My   first idea wa?, to suspend to the arms     of the balance, by
                                                                    very

                        Weight ascribed       to    Heat.                     167
very fine wires, two equal globes of glass filled with mer
cury, and, suffering them to remain in my room till they
should have acquired the known temperature of the air in                       it,
to have removed         them        into the cold, and to have
                                 afterward
feenif they still remained in equilibrio under such difference
of temperature    but, considering the obstinacy with which
                    :
moisture adheres to the surface   of glass, and being afraid
that somehow   or other, notwithstanding all my precautions,
one of ihe globes might acquire or retain more of   than the      it
other, and that          that means its apparent weight might be
                        by
increased    ;    and having found,        former experiment, of
                                             by    a
which    have already had the honour of communicating an
         I
account to the Royal Society, that the gilt surfaces of metals
do not attract moisture; instead of the glass globes filled with
mercury,     made use of two equal solid globes of brass, well
             I
gilt and burnistied, which         I    suspended to the         arms       of the
balance      by
            fine gold wires.
  These globes, which weighed                     4975 grains each, being
wiped perfectly clean, and having                 acquired the temperature
(6ic) of my room, in which they                   were exposed more than
twenty-four hours, were brought                    into the most scrupulous
equilibrium, and were then removed, attached to the arms
of the balance, into room    which the air was at the tem
                             a        in
perature     of   260, where they were left all night.
    The      of this trial furnished the most satisfactory proof
           result
of the accuracy of the balance for, upon entering the room,
                                        ;
I found the equilibrium as perfect as at the beginning of the
 experiment.
   Having thus removed   my doubts respecting the accuracy
 of my balance,   now resumed my investigations relative to
                     I
 the augmentation of weight which fluids have been said to
 acquire     upon being congealed.
    In    the experiments which        I     had made,      I   had,   as
                                                                        I     then
 imagined, guarded as much as possible against every source
 of error and deception.    The bottles being of the fame size,
 neither any occasional alteration in the pressure of the atmo
 sphere during the experiment, nor the necessary and unavoid
 able difference in the densities of the air in the hot and in
 (he cold rooms         in   which    they were weighed, could affect
                                                                their

  1 68                  An Inquiry    concerning    lit
 their apparent weights ; and their shapes and their quantities
 of   surface being the same, and as they remained for such a
 considerable     length of time in the heat and cold to which
 they were exposed, I flattered myself that the quantities of
moisture remaining attached to their surfaces could not be so
different    as sensibly to effect  the results     of  the experiments.
But, in     regard to this last circumstance,         I  afterwards found
 reason to conclude that my opinion was erroneous.
     Admitting the fact stated by Dr. Fordyce, (and which my
experiments had hitherto rather tended to corroborate than
to contradict,) I could not conceive any other cause for the
 augmentation of the apparent weight of water, upon its being
frozen, than the loss of so great a proportion of its latent
heat as that fluid is known to evolve when it congeals; and
I concluded,      that if the loss of latent   heat added to the weight
of one body, it       must  of  necessity produce     the same effect on
 another,     aud   consequently,    that the augmentation of the
quantity of     latent  heat must,     in all bodies, and in all cafes,
diminish their apparent weights.
     To determine whether this is actually the cafe or not,             I
made the following experiment           : —
     Having    provided    two bottles, as nearly alike as possible,
and in all respects similar to those made use of in the expe
riments above-mentioned, into one of them I put 4012,44
grains of water, and into the other an equal weight of mer
cury;     and sealing them     hermetically,      and suspending them
to the arms       of the balance, I       suffered them to acquire the
temperature       of my room, 61°; then, bringing them into a
perfect equilibrium with each other, I removed them into a
room in which the air was at the temperature of 340, where
they remained twenty-four hours. But there was not the least
appearance of either of them acquiring or losing any weight.
    Here it is very certain that the quantity of heal lost by the
water must have been very considerably greater than that lost
by the mercury, the specific quantities of latent heat in water
and in mercury having been determined to be to each other
as 1000 to 33 ; but this difference in the quantities of heat
lost, produced      no sensible difference      on the weights of the
fluids in question.
                                                                     Had

                          Weight ascribed    to Hea4.                     169
     Had any     difference  of weight really existed, had it been no
 nlore than     one  millionth part of the weight of either of the
 fluids, I    should certainly have discovered it ; and, had it
 amounted to      so  much as tut,Vot part of that weight,          I  should
 have   been     able to have measured it       :  so sensible, and so very
 accurate,   is the balance which      I  used    in these experiments.
    I was now much confirmed in my suspicions,                 that the ap
 parent   augmentation of the weight of the water upon its
being   frozen,   i n the experiments    before related, arose from some
accidental cause ; but I was not able to conceive what that
cause could possibly be, — unless it were either a greater quantity
of moisture attached to the external surface of the bottle
which contained the water, than to the surface of that con
taining the spirits of wine, — or some vertical current or cur
rents   of air, caused by the bottles, or one of them, not being
exactly of the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere.
    Though     I  had foreseen,   and,    as  I   thought, guarded suffi
ciently against        these accidents, by making use of bottles of
the fame size and form,         and which were blown of the fame
 kind of glass, and at the fame time, and by suffering the bot
tles in the experiments to remain for so considerable              a  length
of lime     exposed to the different degrees          of heat and   of cold,
which alternately they were made to acquire ; yet, as I did
not know the relative conducting powers of ice, and of spirit
of wine, with respect to heat ; or, in other words, the degrees
of facility or difficulty with which they acquire the tempera
ture  of the medium in which            they are exposed,       or the time
taken up in that operation; and, consequently, was not abso
lutely certain as to the equality of the temperatures of the con
tents of the bottles at the time when their weights were com
pared,   I  determined now to repeat the experiments, with such
variations as should put the matter in question out of all
doubt.
    I was the more anxious to assure myself             of the real tempe
ratures   of  the bottles and    of their contents,      as any difference
in their   temperatures      might vitiate the experiment, not only
by causing unequal currents in the air, but also by causing,
at the same time, a greater or less quantity of moisture to
remain attached to the glass.
    Vol. V.                          Z                                    to

*70                  An Inquiry      concerning  the
     To  remedy these evils, and also to render the experiment
more striking and satisfactory         in other respectsj    I proceeded
in the following manner: —
     Having provided      three    bottles, A, B,   and    C,  as   nearly
alike   as possible, and resembling in all respects those already
described; into the first,     A, I put 42^,28 grains of water,
and a small thermometer, made on purpose                 for the experi
ment, and suspended in the bottle in such a             manner that its
 bulb remained in the middle of the mass of water;                into the
second bottle,    B, I  put a like weight     of spirit of wine, with     a
like thermometer     ;  and, into the bottle C,         I  put an equal
weight of mercury.
     These bottles, being all hermetically sealed, Were placed
 in a large room, in a corner far removed from the doors and
windows,      and where the      air appeared to be perfectly quiet }
 and, being suffered to remain in this situation more than
 twenty-four hours, the heat of the room (6i°) being kept up
 all that time with as little variation      as possible,   and the con
 tents   of the bottles    A  and     B appearing, by their       inclosed
 thermometers, to be exactly at the fame               temperature,     the
 bottles were all wiped with a very clean, dry, cambric hand
 kerchief; and, being afterwards suffered to remain exposed
 to the free air of the room a couple of hours longer, in order
 that any inequalities in the quantities of heat, or of the mois
 ture attached to their surfaces, which might have been occa
  sioned by the wiping,      might be corrected by the operation
  of the  atmosphere   bv  which     they were surrounded, thev were
 all weighed, and were brought into the most exact equili
 brium with each other by means of small pieces of very fine
  silver wire attached to the necks of. those      of  the bottles which
  were the lightest.
      This being done,   the bottles were all removed into a room
"in which the air was at        30',   where thev were suflered to re
  main, perfectly at rest and undisturbed, forty-eight hours;
  the bottles A and B being suspended to the arms of the ba
  lance, and the bottle C suspended, at an equal height, to the
  arm of a stand constructed for that purpose, and placed as
  near the balance    as possible,    and a very sensible thermometer
  suspended by the    side  of it.
                                                                         At

                        Weight ascribed   to Heat.     -              \~j\
     At  the end os forty-eight hours (during whieh time the
 apparatus was left in this situation) I entered the room, open
ing the door very gently for fear of disturbing the balance ;
when I had the pleasure to find the three thermometers, viz.
 that in the bottle    A, which   was now inclosed       in a solid cake
of ice, that in the bottle B, and that suspended in the open
 air of the room, all standing at the same point, 290 F., and
 the bottles A and B remaining in the most perfect equilibrium.
     To assure myself that the play of the balance was free, I
now approached it very gently, and caused it to vibrate; and
 I had the satisfaction to find, not only that it moved with
 the utmost freedom, but also, when its vibration ceased, that
it  rested precisely at the point from which       it had set out.
     I now removed the bottle B from the balance, and put the
bottle C in its place j and I found that that likewise remained
 of  the same apparent weight as at the beginning          of  the expe
 riment,    being in the fame perfect equilibrium with the bot
 tle   A as at first.
     I afterwards removed      the whole apparatus into a warm
 room, arid, causing the icg in the bottle A to thaw, and suf
 fering the three bottles to remain till they and their contents
 had acquired the exact temperature of the surrounding air, I
 wiped them very clean, and, comparing them                  together,   I
 found their weights remained unaltered*
     This experiment I      afterwards  repeated several times, and
 always with precisely      the same result ; the water, in no in
stance,    appearing to gain or to lose the least weight upon
 being    frozen,   or upon being thawed; neither were the rela
 tive weights of the fluids in. either of the other bottles in the
 least changed, by the various degrees        of heat, aud    of cold,  to
 which they were exposed.
     If the bottles were weighed at     a  time when their contents
 were not precisely of the same temperature, they would fre
  quently appear to have gained, or to have lost, something of
  their weights ; but this doubtless arose from the vertical cur
  rents which they caused in the atmosphere         upon being heated
  or cooled in it ; or to unequal quantities of moisture attached
  to the surfaces of the bottles ; or to both these causes ope
  rating together.
                                   Z 2                                 As

1^3                       An Inquiry       concerning the
     As     I
        knew that the conducting power of mercury, with
respect to heat,was considerably greater than either that of
water or that of spirit of wine, while its capacity for receiv
ing heat is much less than that of either of them, I did not
think it necessary to inclose a thermometer in the bottle C,
which contained the mercury; for it was evident that when
the contents of the other two bottles should appear, by their
thermometers, to have arrived at the temperature of the me
dium in which they were exposed, the contents of the bottle
C could not fail       to have acquired            it also, and even to have
arrived at it before them          ;     for, the time taken up in the heat
ing       or in the cooling     of any body,          is,   cæteris   faribus,   as the
capacity of       the body to receive and retain heat direclly,                      and
as its conducting power 'inversely.
  The bottles were suspended to the balance                           by   silver wires,
about two inches long, with hooks at the ends of them  and,                      ;
in removing  and changing the bottles,     took care not to  I
touch the glass.     likewise avoided, upon all occasions, and

particularly in the cold  room, coming near the balance with
my breath, or touching   or any part of the apparatus, with
                                   it,

  Having determined that water does not acquire or lose any
weight upon being changed from     (late of fluidity to that of
                                                  a

sumed that we shall never be able to contrive an experiment
by  which we can render the weight of heat sensible.
   Water, upon being frozen, has been found to lose quan                                       a
tity of heat amounting to 140 degrees of Fahrenheit's ther

given quantity of water,                       previously       cooled to the temperature
of freezing, actually                  loses, upon being changed                          to ice,       if
                                                                                                         it

water, at the given                    temperature,             (that of freezing,) would
heat   140 degrees, or would raise
         it                          to the temperature of          it
(32° + 140) 1620 of Fahrenheit's thermometer, which
                                                                                                         is
only 60' short of that of boiling water; consequently, any
given quantity of water, at the temperature of freezing, upon
being actually frozen, loses almost as much heat as, added
              would be sufficient to make                           boil.
     It it,

          is    clear, therefore,            that the difference in the quantities
of     heat contained                by   the water in its fluid state, and heated
to the temperature of 61

between             water in     a   state     of boiling,  and the fame at the tem
perature   of freezing.
     But this quantity of heat will                       appear much more consider
able, when we consider the great capacity of water to contain
heat, and the great apparent effect which the heat that water
Jofes upon being frozen would produce, were         to be im                             it

  The capacity of water to receive and retain heat, or what

   "The globe which we judged best sot answering these con
ditions was 28-63 centimetres in diameter : its content was
123-25 decilitres, or 12,325 cubic centimetres, comprehend
ing that portion of the neck which it                           \va3thought proper lo
retain, and which was 159 millimetres.                             That we might the
more easily observe the rising and falling of the mercury in
the inside, and thence determine the volumes of gas, we ce
mented        on the outside slips of paper,                     on which we traced,
by means of measured vessels,                     scales indicating        decilitres, of
or 100 cubic centimetres.
     It may     be readily conceived, that                 it    was not possible to    fill
so   frail      with mercury in order to displace it afterwards
             a vessel
by oxygen gas.     In transferring the gas by means of water,
We should have been obliged to leave a portion of that liquid
on the interior side of the vessel. We determined, therefore,
to convey the gas,               at the moment    when it was disengaged
from the oxygenated                 muriat of pot-asli, by means of a tube
adapted to the distilling apparatus, and made to descend to the
bottom of the globe in such a manner that the common aif
should be forced to issue from the globe by another pipe fixed
in    the     stopper    of      the orifice, and communicating                 with the
 pneumatic tub.
    This process is exactly the inverse of that which I proposed
 in my Work on aerostats*, to fill a balloon of inflexible mat
 ter with hydrogen gas.     It was founded on the fame princi
 ple — the difference of  the  specific gravity of the two fluids.
 Here it had the advahtage of leaving the vessel perfectly clean j
 an important condition,                    and which it is so difficult to obtain
 when air is expelled by mercury.
      It   was readily foreseen that the first portions                    of the oxygen
 gas would become                 mixed with the atmospheric air, and that
 it wouldbe necessary to displace this mixture several times by
 new quantities of oxygen gas, that no more azotic gas might
 remain in        it,or, at least, that the remaining quantity should
 be    so    small as to be incapable of having      sensible effect ona
 the results of the experiment. We had even contrived means
 to determine           it,    by
                      receiving under the pneumatic bell the

   Ij6         Experiments made at       the Polytechnic Schoot
  last portions displaced,       that we might      subject  them to     a,
  eudiometric proof.
      With this view        we employed 18 decagrammes          (about six
  ounces) of     the oxygenated    muriat of pot-ash, which were put
  into a retort, at once to furnish, at one operation, the whole
  quantity of the gas necessary for this renewal.
     Those who have not tried themselves this method of sub
  stituting one aeriform fluid for another, might entertain some
  doubt respecting the purity of that employed in our experi
 ment; but it will be easy for me to remove it. This was an
 article of   so  much importance that we could not neglect at
 tempting to collect proofs       of it.
     We know with what          success   M. Humboldt     applied to the
 improvement of eudiometry.             The interest which he took in
 pur experiment induced me to invite him to come and deter
 mine himself with those instruments, and by those processes,
 which were familiar to him, the purity of the oxygen gas in
 which     the   combustion was to take place.          He readily ac
 cepted my invitation, as I had reason to expect, from his well
 known zeal for the progress of science ; and this article of
 our report is the production of his pen.            I had likewise the
 satisfaction of feeing him apply eudiometric instruments to
 the examination       of  the residuum     of the gas after the com
 bustion. The following is the result of the proofs to which
 he subjected that introduced into the apparatus to serve for
 the combustion:      —
     Nitrous gas,     disengaged, by means of copper, from weak
 nitric acid, was      tried with sulphat of iron and oxygenated
 muriatic acid, which sliewed in it from 0*09 to o-io of azot.
 One hundred parts of oxygen gas received, towards the mid
 dle of the operation, as it issued from the globe, in which we
 had proposed to displace, in succession, common air by oxygen
gas, were mixed with 300 parts of this nitrous gas : there
was    an aeriform residuum         of o-66 : making allowance for
C2J or 0'30         of   azot, pre-existing in the nitrous gas, we
judged that, in 100 parts of gas tried, there were still 36 of
azotic gas.
    We then continued to introduce into the globe fresh oxy
gen gas. We collected towards the end a portion which was
                       9                                       subjected

subjected to the same proof, in the same proportions,                                   with
the fame nitrous gas.   The residuum this time was only 30
parts; and as the 300 of nitrous gas employed contained
nine or ten parts for ° of azot, we concluded that this oxy
gen gas was qtiite pure.             — These        are the words        of M. Hum-
boldt.
      When this          first condition was fulfilled,
                                                      the question then
was to place,            in the centre of this globe, the diamond des
tined for the experiment.                  We    had previously        formed a small
cup of the lower portion of a furnace-pipe, the tube of which,
five centimetres in length, was fixed to an iron stalk, and this
stalk was stuck into a cylinder                 of cork destined to be inserted
in the neck of the balloon.                    This cork was dipped in mastic
to shut its pores,            and a small      glass tube passed         through it to
establish a communication                  between     the inside      of the balloon
and the mercurial tub.        (See fig. 2. Plate II»)
   We        then placed the diamond on the cup, where we left                              it,
having put there    itmeans of by               a   ribbon, which we drew from
under   in an instant, as soon
            it                                   as    the balloon had been in
verted, and its neck immersed in the mercury. The balloon
in this position was made fast hi    kind of collet, which
                                                      a
rested on the edges of an iron mortar that served as   hy-                          a
drargyro-pneumatic                tub.     We    then exhausted,            by   suction,   a
portion of the oxygen gas hifrieient to make the mercury
rife to 12 centimetres above the orifice of the balloon.
  The diamond was the                    fame that had been already exposed
            of the solar
to the action                             sire towards the end of the experi
ment of the preceding                    year, and which had lost only two
deci-milligrammes,                and consequently weighed               199.9       milli
grammes (3-766 grains), or one carat wanting ^ *.
  On the 5th Fructidor last year, at one in the afternoon,
we began lo throw upon the diamond the focus of the large
lens   of    the National         Institute.    The thermometer,             exposed to

178               Experiments made at                  the Polytechnic             School

grees of the decimal thermometer, according to the experi
ments of Cit. Pneicr, and the tables of Cit. Prony *, was
then found to be 11,470 cubic centimetres.
  Having               taken       the     necessary precautions to heat gradually
the balloon,             the point          of the luminous cone being almost in
the centre,   we were obliged to cover with a glass plate the
wooden supporter, which was already on fire.    The diamond
first exhibited a black point at the angle immediately struck
bv the fun.    We afterwards saw it entirely black, and as it
were charred             :       we distinctly perceived,           a   moment after, bril
liant points in                  a state     of ebullition,     as it were,              on the black
ground.     The solar rays, having been for a moment inter
cepted,  it  appeared transparently red.  The sun becoming
obscured by a cloud, we saw it of a much purer white than,
it had been at the commencement of the operation.
   The sun having emerged from the cloud, the surface of the
diamond assumed the appearance of metallic splendour : it
was then sensibly diminished, and there remained no more
than    quarter, of a lengthened form, without angles or per
         a
ceptible edges, but still very white, and of a beautiful trans
parency.   We observed              flight fissure at the bottom of the
                                              a
pipe which, supported              but without any separation of the
                                           it,
parts.       I     must not forget, that at the commencement of the
combustion we thought we observed purpurescentcone arising  a
from the support   the pencil of the solar rays; but this phe
                                   in
nomenon was Only an optical effect, which depended on the
position          of   the observer.
      The whole apparatus    left in the fame flatc, only de
                                                 was

          an inverted box placed over    until the 7th, when        it,
we again began, at one hour twenty minutes, to present the
diamond to the focus.   We soon observed the same pheno
mena      on the 5th, the black surface, the brilliant points in
             as
ebullition, which vanished and re-appeared according to the
intensity of the focus   we saw also     brilliant metallic ap
                                         :                      a

                    on the   Comlujlion of I be Diamond.                   1
                                                                             79
 consumed.         We     at first suspected that there still remained a
 brilliant particle     ;  but we soon judged that it was a vitrified
 point of    the support,      which was confirmed on inspecting the
 pipe when drawn from the globe.                    The question now was
 to collect the products of the combustion. No means seemed
likely to be attended with more certainty than to introduce
water of barytes into the apparatus,             taking care to adhere, as
nearly as possible,         to the proportions indicated for the satu
 ration of the carbonic acid, which               we supposed must       have
been formed to prevent              the uncertainty which the excess         of
 this re-agent might occasion in the results.               The whole ap
paratus being removed into the shade, we began on the 9th
to draw out the pipe which served as a support, and observed
on it two slight fissures occasioned by the contraction, and a
spot of four or five millimetres in diameter, the centre of
which had       a  vitreous appearance, and its edges a reddish hue.
On examining it with a magnifying glafe, we observed at the
lowest point a space         of two or    three millimetres diameter, the
surface    of which       was really vitrified,      but of a tarnished   and
unequal      colour.      We    distinguished   a  particle of white glass,
pure and brilliant, formed into a             globule some smaller por
tions of the fame nature, and two small globules of                a vitreous
substance, which had a greenish red colour.
    On     one   side  we observed on the edges several other very
small globules interspersed in a yellowish ground,               and on the
opposite a flight tinge         of  very bright red   with  very small red-
disli points.       A particle of white earthy matter was at first
taken for a fragment detached from the edges of the pipe,
but it was found friable, and ascertained, by the stain it left
on gold, to be oxyd of mercury.                   This examination being
sinislied,   we introduced         into the globe five measures of satu
rated water     of   barytes,    each  of 46-5 cubic centimetres.        The'
liquor immediately           assumed a      milky   appearance,   and there
was    a  diminution      in the volume of gas, which, calculated by
means of the attached paper scale, amounted nearly to 300
cubic centimetres. Thus we might stop here and consider
the experiment as terminated, and by making some allow
ance     for the errors unavoidable in such manipulations, and
make the result tally with the amount, determined before by
the noble experiment of Lavoisier and La Place, of the re-

180          Experiments made al        the Polytechnic     School
spective quantities      of carbon    and oxvjren which form the car
bonic acid.      Mr. Tennant      seems to have done the fame thing
lately after the combustion of the diamond by nitre.                  But   we
should onlv have confirmed what was before known,                     or  sup
posed to be known.          Our object was not only to observe, with
more attention, what took place during the act of combus
tion, but to ascertain, as accurately as possible, the nature
and quantity of the product, and the reader will find that the
labour undertaken         on this subject has not been fruitless.
    The liquor was agitated in the globe to mix the white mat
ter which had been deposited.               We drew out 4 } measures
of the five we had introduced by making use of the fame in
verted bottle silled with mercury, and which we raised on the
inside by means        of  an iron stalk composed         of  several pieces,
which could be adjusted by screws. (See sig. 6. Plate II.)
    We introduced into the balloon three new measures, each
containing the fame quantity of distilled water, which was
shaken     in the inside to detach       and    collect what adhered to
the sides.      These united liquors, being immediately filtered
in an open filtre, left 192 centigrammes (36-142 grains) of
carbonat of barytes dried in the heat of boiling water.
    It maybe readily judged what            was our astonishment        when
proceeding to examine the            liquor,   instead    of finding in    it a
flight    excess   of uncombined barytes,            we    observed    that   it
 changed neither the colour of turmeric nor that of logwood,
 and that, on the contrary, it acted on an infusion of turnsole
 as  water    charged     with the carbonic acid.           The   presence   of
 this acid     unequivocally manifested          itself,  when we poured
 upon it    a few drops     more  of barytes water, which immedi
 ately rendered      it turbid.     It was necessary to add even 4*65
 centimetres     of this water     to saturate    and    precipitate   the re
 maining acid gas.         Being informed by this phenomenon that
 the production of the gas had been more considerable than
 we expected, and that some of it still remained mixed in the
 aeriform fluid in the balloon, we took every measure neces
  sary to determine the'quantity.             This we were luckily en
  abled to do by the divisions        which     had been marked on the
  scales,   the orifice   of the globe having never been yet taken
  out of the mercury.
     When      the barytes    water was taken out, the apparent vo
                                                                         lume,

  lume was found ta be exactly 12a decilitres, the internal
  column        of the mercury above the level of the tub was 47
  millimetres      ;  the   barometer being at 759/96 millimetres,
  (Fructidor       19,   year VI.) the centegrade thermometer at
  21 "25,      the real volume, at a mean          pressure and    tempera-
.ture,     was 112.426 decilitres, or 11242-66 cubic centimetres.
       I still (invited M. Humboldt to co-operate with us in exa
  mining the nature of this residuum of gas. It was              transferred
  in his presence into a pneumatic tub prepared                  on purpose
  with distilled water,        and received into four large flasks.      The
  trial was made by the fame instruments, and with the fame
  nitrous gas, which had served for the oxvgen gas before the
  combustion, and consequently containing from 0-09 to o*io of
  azotic gas.        The trials made on portions extracted from dif
  ferent flasks varied from 31 to 34 in the quantity of the re
  siduum of gas, in a mixture of 100 parts of gas examined with
  300 parts of nitrous gas.
       I shall not even take the mean term,             I  shall stop at the
  weakest,       which    indicates   four hundredth parts of carbonic
  acid gas, which,        I  think,  I can assert to be rather below than
  above the truth ; since a portion of this fame gas, brought
   into contact with ammonia, under a receiver, experienced a
   diminution of 4*5 per cent.                                       ,
       Let us now estimate        the   carbonic acid gas which entered
   into the composition of the 192 centigrammes of carbonat
   ofbarytes.        According to Pelletier, whose accuracy is well
   known in researches of this kind, 100 of this earthy salt con
   tain 22 of acid gas*, which gives 42*24 for 192; and as the
   cubic centimetre of gas weighs 1*847 milligrammes, it fol
   lows that the 42*24 centigrammes represent 228*621 cubic
   centimetres. If we now add, on the one hand, the 449 cubic
   centimetres, found in the residuum of the gas after combus
   tion, and which,        as we saw, formed     the four hundredth parts;
   and deduct, on the other, the fame quantity from the aeriform
   fluid in which the combustion was effected, it results, that in
    1 1470 cubic centimetres        of oxygen gas contained in the bal
   loon, there remained, after the combustion, only 10793; tnat
          were consumed ; that these 677 cubic centimetres of

   Though it was not possible for me to doubt facts deduced
from calculation, I at first hesitated to admit differences so
considerable  in the manner in which the same combustible
united itself to oxygen in the quantities it could take up, and
the products of its combustion ; in a word, a carbonaceous,
combustible more abundant in real combustible matter than
charcoal itself, and which at the same time differed so much,
from it in the degree of temperature necessary to determine
the actionof its affinity. But I soon began to refledt, J                                  ft,
That this would not be the only instance of the fuss degree of
the oxydation of an acidisiable base having been operated with,
great difficulty,        while the acidification was afterwards                          com
pleted with the utmost facility  ad, That several substances
                                               :
of the fame kind presented to us also these two characters;
a greater abundance in real carbon, and greater resistance to.
inflammation;       that they naturally placed themselves in an
                        so
intermediary  rank   between the diamond and charcoal. These
two considerations,    still strengthened                     by
                                              the similarity of the
phenomena    observed    during   the  course of cur two experi
ments        in   the passage       of   the diamond to the state     of carbonic
acid, appeared to me to throw                  a   ray   of light on this subject
hitherto          so
            obscure.
     In
     regard to the first consideration  will be sufficient for
                                                          it
me to call to mind with what difficulty the commencement
                                                                              it by
of   a   composition of azot and oxygen                   is   formed             the direct
way, and the high degree of temperature which        requires,
while  nitrous gas cannot be     contact within
                                              oxygen without
passing immediately to the acid state.  Charcoal will then be
to the carbonic              acid    what nitrous gas              is   to the nitric,    and
                                                                                          the

                                                    of the Diamond.                               183
the diamond will be to charcoal what azot is to nitrous gas.
There will, therefore, be no longer occasion of wonder that
more oxygen is necessary to that substance, which as yet has
none of   than to that which has already been united with the
           it,
xjuantity necessary for arriving at the first point of saturation.
   The second consideration rests on facts no less conclusive.
Plumbago       carbonaceous combustible, which does not burn
                  is
                   a
but at   very high temperature,
          a                     or in nitre in fusion which                                ;
produces          by
             its combustion carbonic acid   which, as well as        ;
the diamond,             is   more        abundant in combustible matter than
carbon itself.            We        are indebted        to the illustrious Scheele for
the first observation               of this fact.          One part of carbon alca
ldes only five parts               of nitre one;         part of plumbago can alca-
lise ten. The operation performed in    retort on 80 centi       a
grammes of plumbago, gave him 357 cubic centimetres of
carbonic acid gas*. This agreement will not be contested
 bythose who, having been witnesses of our experiment, so
unanimously declared, that the surface of the diamond as
 sumed instantaneously                    a   leaden colour.
    This mineral     not the only body which presents these
                              is
 striking characters               of
                         substance almost incombustible, and
                                        a
 yet very abundant, in combustible matter.     described, six              I
 teen years ago, in the Memoirs of the Academy of Dijon,                                                 a
 fossil   found in            a    mass in the coal-pits             of    the    Rive-dc-Gier,
 which was             sent to meunder the name of incombustible coal,
 and which        I     then considered as real coal which had passed
 to the state          of plumbago.           I    characterised      it    in that manner.

 tbracolite       of Werner.              I     had already       suspected that                it    wa9
 neither the presence of four or five centiemes of alumine, nor
 that of    still smaller quantity of iron, that rendered

 was fully confirmed.
      The object of                the first was to determine                    if   the       alumine

 184          Experiments made at the Polytechnic School
 resist   the action  of pot-ash by the humid way : 100 partS^
 put in   digestion in that solvent, left in it 4-6 of alumine.
   The     second was, to ascertain whether this combustibley
 which    possessed  little inflammability, had also the power
                          so
 to alcalise more nitre than carbori, consequently to take up
 more oxygen. Three successive trials gave for a mean result
 the alcalisation of 7-87 parts of nitre by one part of that mi
 neral;   and the fame          coally matter, digested for four or five
 days  in oxygenated           muriatic acid, burnt completely with 6'$
 of nitre.
 «    M. Klaproth,        the celebrated     chemist      of Berlin, had      before
 submitted    to trials        of   the fame kind a fossil described by          M.
 Widenmann under      the name of incombujlible coal, and found
that 100 parts left, after combustion at a very strong heat,
Only seven of a cincritious residuum ; that treated in a cru
cible with eight parts of nitre, and the mass dissolved in water,
acids occasioned no precipitate. Kirwan, in his experiments
on coal, remarks, that that which he calls Kilkenny coal, and
which has a metallic brilliancy, which does not bum but
when carried         to    incandescence,      and   which then            comsumes
slowly without emitting flame, can decompose 9-6 of nitre.
   After this I do not fee how there can remain any doubt
that these supposed incombustible substances are real oxydes
of carbon, which, like              coal or charcoal,     have the property       of
conducting         electric fluid ; of cementing iron ; of taking
                   the
the  oxygen   from   some acidifiable bases ; but which are not
at that degree of oxydation necefi'ary for exercising this sepa
rating affinity at a weak temperature.
   I must not omit this opportunity of making some appli
cation of this principle, which may become useful to the arts.
It has not yet been sufficiently explained, why some animal
and vegetable matters produce carbon so difficult to be inci
nerated ; why charred  pit-coal, known under the name of
coke, or cinders, and which has been half burnt in the pre
paration,    is,

                   0« the Combustion      of the Diamond:             iSij
   to all*, becomes    there,  in a  certain degree, incdmbustible, as
  is proved in the experiment made by Mr. Tennant, which                 I
  have mentioned in the article Air in the DiSlionnaire de
  Chemie Encyclopedique,        Vol. I.   p. 714.
      The   answer   to all these questions       may be found in the
  theory I have laid down : they are charcoals in the first de
  gree of oxydation. Thus some of them have not yet acquired
  that which constitutes charcoal properly so called; others,
  after possessing all the qualities of vegetable and mineral car
  bon, have returned to the first degree by a real (debrulement)
 unburning of the remaining carbon ; so that by losing their
 inflammability     they become capable of fixing a greater quan
 tity  of  oxygen,  and   consequently of setting at liberty a greater
 quantity of caloric when they find themselves at a tempera
 ture sufficiently high to determine and complete their acidi*
 fication.
     Some practical consequences will doubtless hence be de
 duced in regard to processes for the reduction of metals ; for the
 cementation of steel, which it is probable takes up only oxyd
 of carbon, since it is separated from it in that state ; for the
 incineration of the carbonaceous refiduums of our analyses}
 for the carbonisation of wood, pit-coal, and turf: in a word>
 we may perhaps thence conclude the possibility             of rendering
useful those masses      of pit-coal,   said to be incombustible, found
at   Rive-de-Gier,      by mixing     it with more inflammable mat
ters, to maintain the temperature which determines its com
bustion. Its position, texture, and all its exterior characters
announce, as already          said, that it consists   of  beds  of coal
changed by a subterranean             fire ; and this is confirmed by
tradition, which preserved to that mountain, for three cen
turies, the name of the Mountain of Fire. (Montagne de
Feu.)       We can how pfonounce that it is coke too far ad
vanced, but      so  much the more susceptible          of producing    a
great heat under favourable circumstances.
                          RECAPITULATION.
     I shall  here  enumerate      the consequences,     or rather the
facts, which result from the phenomena observed in the two
     Vol. V.                        Bb                          combus*

l86"         Experiments made at the Polytechnic           School
combustions of the diamond by the solar sire, and the expe
riments which followed : —
     1.  It is not only by the colour,         weight, hardness, trans
parency,       and   other  sensible    characters,    that the diamond
differs from charcoal, as seems hitherto to have been be
lieved ;
     2. Nor is it by the state alone of the aggregation of the
matter that constitutes diamond :
     3. Neither is it en account of the 200th part of the cine-
ritious residuum left by carbon, or the small quantity of hy
drogen which it contains.                    -
     4.  It is  more   essentially   by  its chemical    properties that it
differs.
     5. The diamond is the pure combustible substance of this
 genus.
     6. The product of its combustion, or of its combination
 with oxygen to saturation, is carbonic acid without residue.
     7. Carbon burns at a temperature estimated at 1880 of the
 centigrade     thermometer     5  the diamond does not inflame but at
 about 30 pyrometric degrees, which, according to Wedge-
 wood's scale, makes a difference of 188 to 2765.
     8. Charcoal, when kindled, maintains of itself, in oxygen
 gas, the temperature necessary for its combustion. The com
 bustion of the diamond stops when you cease to maintain it
  by a furnace-heat, or the union of the solar rays.
      9. The diamond, for its complete combustion, requires a
  much greater quantity of oxygen than charcoal does, and
  produces also more carbonic acid.             One part os charcoal ab
  sorbs in this operation 2*527         of oxygen,     and produces     3"57j
  of carbonic acid. One of diamond             absorbs a little more than
  four of oxygen, and really produces            live of carbonic acid.
      10. There are substances which are in a slate              of interme
  diary composition between           the diamond and charcoal. These
  are plumbago, or native carburet           of iron ; incombustible fossil
  coal   ; the   carburet of alumine of Dolomieu ; the anthracolite
  of Werner ; the black matter united to iron in the state of
   cast iron and steel ;     carbonaceous       residuums     difficult to be
   incinerated    ;  and   carbon itself unburnt,        (d. bruit,)   by the
   action of    a strong heat   without the contact of air.

three or four hundredths                        of their weight of iron, or alumine,
give by their combustion carbonic acid, like charcoal and the
diamond.
   They approach to carbon by their colour, their lightness,

also more oxygen,                     and producing                 more carbonic acid;            by
decomposing more nitrous acid;    burning only at much         by                           a
higher temperature, even in nitre in fusion; and    their                                   by

                                                 is
able base of the carbonic acid.    Its combustion   effected in                   is
three periods, which require three different temperatures.  At
the first, which            is   the highest,             the diamond assumes               a   black
leaden colour.              It   isan oxydation in the first degree, the state
of plumbago             and      anthracolite. At the second temperature,
which           may be estimated                  at 18 or 20             pyrometric degrees,
there      is   a                                      of oxygen.

state of charcoal, or rather that in which            found after           it   is
the action of    strong aheat in close vessels  has disengaged                                     a
part of its oxygen.
   Thus plumbago        an oxyd of the first degree, charcoal an
                                 is
oxyd in the second, and the carbonic acid the product of the
complete oxvgenation of the carbon.
     Supposing, then, that we operate with sufficient precision
to take away from the surface   of the diamond the black mat

                                           suddenly withdrawing by

    After this conclusion it will be asked, no doubt, how it
happens     that the simple matter, pure carbon, the diamond,
is  so rare  while its compounds in different states are so abun
dantly diffused ? To put an end to the astonishment of those
who might entertain any mistrust, I {hall observe, that alu
minous earth is also one of the most common matters, and
that adamantine spar, as rare as the diamond, is however
only alumine ; that iron every where exists, under all forms,
except in the state of purity : the existence of native iron is still
doubtful.       The wonder exists only in the opposition of facts
to our opinions, and will disappear in proportion as we dis
cover, and appropriate        to ourselves,  the means    employed by
nature in producing the fame effects.
    Those who have never turned their attention to the phy
sical sciences, to estimate at least their influence on public
felicity, are disposed to treat as vain curiosity labours which
are not immediately directed towards a near object of new
enjoyment.        What would have been their astonishment had
they been told, that researches on the nature of the diamond
wo'ild one day produce truths which might give rife to
 happy changes in the practice of the most familiar arts ; in
 the oreparation, and in the employment of the coarsest com
 bustibles   !   Such, however, are the consequences that may
 arise from the best known properties         of the essential principle
 carbon in its different states.
 XI. A     Letter   to the  Editor, containing some Objections     to the
               Mitcbiliian   Theory of Pestilential Fluids.
        SIR,
  I   OBSERVE, in         the 15th     Number of your useful Maga
 zine, a communication            from Dr. Mitch ill, of New-Yorjk,
  shewing the utility of constructing the houses, and paving
  the streets of cities, with calcareous in preference \ojiliceous
  and argillaceous materials.           This communication      is con
  tained in. a letter from Mr. Da Costa to the Doctor,         in which
                                                                        it

                         Theory os Pestilential          Fluids.                      J 89
it is observed, that although the citv of Lisbon is one of the
filthiest in Europe, and the most infested with putrid effluvia,
yet that it nevertheless is remarkable for its salubrity. This
is attributed by Mr. Da Costa to the calcareous materials,
of which       the buildings           and pavements           are constructed, ab
sorbing and neutralising the septic fluids,                     the cause,      accord
ing to   Dr. Mitchill's theory, of all contagion.
     In reply to this I would observe, that from the author's
own account it is evident                 that the calcareous           earth     in the
city of Lisbon          does not destroy the putrid exhalations                   in any
sensible degree,          and therefore         cannot prevent          any disorders
to   which they may            give rife.       The     houses,     he observes,        are
very offensive, from the privies, and from inattention to clean
liness.   The mouths of the sewers go to the wharves, and are
bare at low water.    The fluid which comes from these con
tains    many infectious matters that its strong putrid smell
         so
can scarcely be endured!  It is plain, therefore, that the pu
trid exhalations are not destroyed, or, at least, that they are
so  quickly generated as to annoy the olfactory fense in an
intolerable degree.  The bodies of the inhabitants are con
stantly immersed           in putrid exhalations,              yet contagion is not
produced. The inference                   is,
                             that putrid exhalations arc not
its immediate cause.  Contagion arises where no putrefac
tion   going on, at least in any degree perceptible to the
        is
fenses  as when
         ;         number of persons are crowded together
                          a
in jails,      and      even     in   the houses       of the poor in the winter
season, without           sufficient ventilation.           On the other hand,
putrefaction may be present, in  very high degree, without
                                                  a
giving birth  to contagion, as may be observed in slaughter
houses, cat-gut manufactories, &c.
     But,     is   it sufficiently that calcareous matters do
                        proved
absorb and neutralise septic exhalations      Mr. Da Costa re  ?
marks, that he has observed, two or three times, in Lisbon,
dead animals upon the ruins of houses, and of course sur
 rounded       by   calcareous        earth,    in   a state   of   desiccation   ;     and,
 at the fame time, two or three fathoms distant,                         another ani
 mal dead too, and lying upon another kind of soil, in state                      a
 of complete putrefaction.   do not presume to question the
                                          I
 truth of this, since          it   was   a   matter obvious to the        senses   :    but
                                                                                  Ldeny

 190           Description    of an Improved Air-Farnace.
 I deny the      generality of the fact equally from observation.
I  suspended a piece of flesh, in a proper vessel, over a layer
of chalk, and at the same time laid chalk, in small pieces, on
gauze, a few inches above the flesh : but I did not observe
 that putrefaction was more backward than in other circum
stances, or that putrid exhalations were less extensively dif
fused around.         That quickline destroys putrefaction, is no
proof of the opinion here advanced,              since this can be ac
counted for on other principles.
    If fevers   abound on the opposite fide of the Tagus, whilst
the city of Lisbon is free from them, there are probably other
causes to which this may be ascribed, such as a marshy soil,
&c.     Whether any thing of this fort exists, the account here
given by Mr. Da Costa does not enable us to judge.
    It is the tendency of Dr. MitchilPs theory to overturn set
tled opinions, and to cause us to abandon practices, which
have been generally employed, and much relied on, for the
destruction of contagious matter. It is of great importance,
therefore, that it (hould be well founded, lest we be induced
to lay aside     means    that are efficacious on grounds not suffi
ciently     established.      Whatever becomes of Dr. Mitchill's
hypothesis,      it appears to me to receive no support from the
facts and arguments of the paper in question, although it is
considered      by him     as  affording  a strong   confirmation of its
truth.

XII.    Description    ofSIr. Howard'*         Intprovui Air-Furnace*
  A HE difficulty        of obtaining a degree of heat sufficiently
intense    for many operations in chemistrv, has been felt and
lamented by even- one engaged in such pursuits ; and, not
withstanding the researches and numberless                 experiments
made     professedly   for that purpose by the greatest men, the
best construction        of an air-furnace is still a problem ; in
                                                                  deed,

               Description     os an Improved Air-Furnace.               191
deed,      the rules laid down by those who have written on this
subject, differ so widely from each other, that we must sup
pose a great number of circumstances, hitherto overlooked,
enter into the construction           of  a good furnace.      Having    ob
served effects produced            in that of Mr. Edward Howard, of
Doughty-street, which we have seldom, if ever, seen equalled
in any other furnace, we thought we could not better oblige
our chemical readers than by giving a descriptiou of it. The
difference       in  the present composition       of Wedgewood's pyro
meter pieces,         from that used by him when he first invented
his instrument, makes it impracticable (unless the scale was
 also altered) to measure correctly the degree of heat obtained ;
 it must however be at least = 1600, and is sufficient to run
 down the best Hessian crucibles.                 The most striking devia
 tion     from    the   common       construction is in the lower part of
 the chimney, or flue, being smaller than the upper, and
  the greater depth of the ash-pit.               Mr. Howard thinks that
.something depends on the direction of the horizontal fun
  nel, which in this cafe opens to the north.                 If any of our
  readers should construct a furnace on this plan, we should be                  •
  glad to be informed          of the coincidence    of effect*.
       Fig. 1. (Plate IV.) A, the          cavity or body of the furnace,
  9   inches    square and 1 foot 7 inches deep to the bars.           B, the
  asli-pit, 1 foot 2 inches, by 9 inches broad, and 2 feet 8 inches
   deep below the bars : this ash-pit opens to the external air by
   an horizontal funnel         C, 6 feet long, passing under the floor
   of  the laboratory      :  this not only furnishes a supply of denser
   air, but prevents the unpleasant effects of the cold draught
   on the legs and feet of the operator, which happens when the
   ash-pit opens into the laboratory.              The external opening of
   this funnel is about 2 feet square, which gradually contracts
   to the ash-pit in the manner (hewn in the plate.                    D, the
   aperture      of  the    horizontal    flue, 7  inches wide by %\ deep,
   contracting in width to 4^ inches, where it enters the ver
    tical flue or chimney, which is 4^ inches square, of which
    width it continues to the height of 7 feet, and is then en
    larged to 5 inches square ; which dimensions it preserves to
        ' Dr.   Pearson's furnace, which is a very powerful one, agrees in some
     parts of its construction with   Mr. Howard's.
                                                                             the

     chimney finishes by an iron pipe about 3 feet long.
        Fig.   3, F, shews the plan   of the body of the   furnace 9 inches
     thick,    the top course    of bricks being bound together in the
    usual manner by a strong iron hoop            G. H is an horizontal
     section   of the chimney and flues*.           When only a moderate
    degree    of heat is wanted, the horizontal draught-hole C can
    be closed by a sliding door or register,         and an opening made
    into the ash-pit, directly under the bars, by removing the
    stone stopper I. (Fig. 1 and a)            This also is useful for oc
    casionally clearing the bars from scoria, or entirely removing
    them, ih order suddenly to put out the fire. The whole of
    the furnace and chimney is built of Windsor bricks.

   M,     LR.   BROWN         retired a second time to Cobbd,           with'
1
   little hopes of ever leaving the country.              Of the property^
   which the king's agents had purchased on his arrival, no
   part of the price had yet been paid. He had been insulted
   with the mockery of justice, yet obliged to thank his oppres
   sors for the compensation which their corruption and malig
   nity alone had rendered incomplete.
       He had not omitted to renew to the Melek Musa the re
   quest   which had been previously made to Miseliim and Ibra
   him. He explained to him, in the least exceptionable man
   ner, his intention of coming to Cobbe ; completely did away
  all the suspicions which his enemies had at first excited ; and
  concluded with desiring permission to go to Sennaar, or to
  accompany the Hrft/elatea (an armed expedition for the pur
  pose of acquiring slaves,) to the south or south-west j or to
  have a     safe  conduct, and one of the Sultan's slaves, to ac
  company him to BergoOj (the first Mahometan kingdom on
  the west.) By the first route he hoped lo have reached Abys
  sinia, or, if that had been impracticable, to have gone through
  Nubia      to Egypt,    or by Suakim to the Red Sea, and thence
      * The chimney    is detached about an inch from the wall behind all the

                                                                           to

so Moch:1      or Jidda.       By       the second he was almost certain        of
fettling some important points relative to the White River,
possibly of tracing it to ils source. And by the third, either
of                            tracing the course of the Niger,
     pasting directly west, and
or of penetrating through Bomou and Fczzan to Tripoli.
  To the first proposal he answered, in a manner which gave
Mr. Brown reason to doubt his sincerity, that the road to
Sennaar was impassable, the Sultan being then master of
only one half of KordofTai : that the natives of all that part
of it which         remained unsubdued               were his implacable foes,
and woiild infallibly         destrov anv person who came from                Dar-
l'ur: that     he thought,         however,         if Mr. Brown     waited    an
other year, that route might possibly be more secure ; and in
case it should, he would use all his efforts to obtain the Sul
tan's permission for his departure. — Of the Sclalca he laid, that
our traveller wou'd onlv encounter certain death by attempt
ing    as, between the jealousy of those who accompanied
       it,
him, and the actual hostility of the country, there would be
no hope of escaping.  Mr. Brown hinted, that the Sultan
rnight give him   sew attendants,
                         a        whom he was verv ready
to pav, and an order to enable him to pass unmolested  as
nis physician in search            of herbs.  lie replied, that he would
propose      such   a   measure,     but he did not expect     would re
                                                                   it
ceive the Sultan's approbation. — To the third proposal he an
swered, that he had no hope of Mr. Brown's succeeding and
concluded with strongly recommending to him to seize the
first opportunity of returning lo I'gypi; but he assured him,
if  he could accomplish ;tiu of the measures he         much            so
wished,      he would not fail to inform him and                  to afford   him
the necessary aid.  Such was- the state of affairs when Mr.
Brown returned to Cobbe, dejected, and with little expecta
tion of realising even his least sanguine hopes.   Not more
than fix weeks after this conversation                 had taken place, he was
sent for to attend             Melek,
                             the                   who was confined     by
                                                                        an old
disorder     in   his lungs.    He found him yet sensible; but his
eves    were fixed,       and extremities incapable of motion.  In
live hours after, he expired.              Thus      were blasted our traveller's
returning hopes of success: for no mediator now remained
between him and the monarch, aud no longer was there
     Vol. \'.                               C  c                              near

sense,  to whom his projects might be fasely opened.
     During the summer of 1794, five men who had exercised
eonfiderablc authority in foinc of the provinces, were brought
to El Fasher as prifoners ; it was faid that they had been de
tected in    a   treasonable            with the hoftile leader,
                                     correspondence
Hashcm, in Kordofan.      They did not undergo any form of
trial; but as the Sultan chose to give credit to the depofitions
made against them, his command was issued for their execu
tion.  Three of them were very young men, the youngest not
appearing to be more than seventeen years of age. A little
aster noon they were brought, chained and settered,                              into the
market-place,          besore one        of   the entrances        of   the palace, es
corted by a sew         of       the royal slaves armed with spears.                 Se
veral of the Meleks,              by the monarch's express order, were
present, to witness,             as he termed       it,
                                               what they might expect
to susser    is   they failed in their fidelity.              The executioner         al
lowed them time onlv to utter                 a   short prayer, when he plunged
his knise        into the neck of the oldest,                    exactly in the fame
manner       as they    kill     a   sheep.       The operation, too,       ismarked
by    the fame term, dhebbab.                 He    sell, and struggled       for fome
time'.      The    rest sussered         The three last were
                                       in their turn.
much agitated, and the youngest wept. The two first had
borne their fate with becoming firmness.   The crowd that
had assembled had scarcely fatiated                       itself with the spectacle
of their convulfive motions while prostrate in the dust, when
the sla\cs of the executioner coolly brought     small block of     a
wood and began mangling their fect with an axe.                                  Having,
cutoss their      seet, they carried        away the setters which had been
worn bv the criminals,                  though of little value, and lest the
bodies where they were.                  Private humanity,              and not public
order,   a   Horded them sepulture.
     Near the end of the year 1795                  abody of troops was mus
tered and reviewed,               intended    to replace those who had died
of    the small-pox         in   Kordofan,        which,    it   was faid, amounted
to more   than half the army.  The spoils which had been
taken from Hashcm were alfo ostentatiouslv displayed on thia
occafion.   They confisted of eighty slaves, nwlc and semale,
but the greater proportion of the lailer, many of whom were
                                                                           exceedingly

exceedingly beautiful, nor the less interesting, that, though
the change in their situation could not be very important,
their countenances were marked with despondency.                      To
these succeeded     five   hundred oxen and two hundred large
camels;     the whole procession       was closed by eighty horses,
and many articles of less value borne by slaves.             Shouts rent
the air of, Long live El Sultan Abd-el-rachman el rafliid !
May God render him always victorious !
    A  short time after,     Mr. Brown      caused    a  petition to be
drawn up, which was presented by Ali-el-Chatib to the Sul
tan, in which he stated his sufferings, requested payment of
what yet remained due to him, and permission to proceed on
his journey to Kordofan.         Though the person who presented
it was a man of considerable weight, no answer was given.
lie   therefore followed it up by       a visit   in person,    which he
had resolved     should be bis last.     His arrival     was no sooner
known than lie was directed to attend some sick person,                as
he had several times done before.          This    he positively refused,
 and it was nianv days before he could be admitted at court.
 On the    nth of   December 1795, however, he accompanied
the Chalib to the monarch's presence, and briefly stated what
 he came to request     ;  which the former seconded,         though not
with the zeal     Mr. Brown     wished.   To     his demand    of permis
 sion to travel,   no answer was returned.            But the generous
 and hospitable monarch,         who had      received from him the
 value  of   750 piastres in goods, though his claim was. well
 supported, gave him only twenty meagre oxen, in value about
 120 piastres!     The state of his purse would not permit him
 to refuse even this mean supply ; and he bade adieu to El
 Tastier,  as he hoped,     for ever.
    Having applied       the value   of the oxen to preparations for
 his journey    to Egypt,     the report   of   the caravan's departure
 growing daily stronger, he lost no time in joining the Chabir,
 who was then encamped at Le Haimer, (3d March 1796,)- a
 small village about three days journey north of Cobbe, where
 there was a tolerable supply of water, but no other requisite
 for living.
    Mr. Brown arrived        at Le Haimer about a month before
  Ramadan; and it was        not till the sixth day of El Hedge, the-
                                  C c 2                            second

 second month aster that fast, that they actually commences
 their journey to Egypt.           In the mean time, having pitched
 a tent under a great tree, where they were sheltered irom the
 rays of the fun,       he fed on polenta {as-eidj) and water with
 the camel-drivers.          He had collected eight camels for            the
journey, but        the bell   of them was stolen while grazing;         an
 other died     ; and to supply his place he was obliged to feck
 one on credit, for his whole exchangeable property at that
 time amounted only to eight piastres.
     The journey, once commenced, was continued with little
 remarkable except violent heat.              They returned by the only
 caravan route, Bir tl Malah, Leghea, Sc'lime, Sbeh, and El-
 nvab.      Their provisions were indifferent, and in small quan
 tity.    The camel-drivers        regaled themselves with the flesh of
 these animals       when    they chanced to be disabled on the road.
 When they arrived at Beiris, they were met by a Cashes, who
 welcomed tile Jelabs with an exhibition of sire-works.                   On
 this occasion it is customary        to treat the chief merchants with
 coffee,    and to present to each a hen'jb        of coarse cloth, worth
 about   a   guinea; but he expects in return a stave from each,
 worth about ten guineas.               When Mr. Brown arrived at
 Asfalt,   lie had been sour months without eating animal food;
 and the haid living,        heat, and fatigue, had brought on a di
 arrhœa, bv which he was ninth weakened; but before he left
 AlTiiit, where he passed twenty days, it was much abated.
     After some stay in Egypt Mr. Brown embarked for Syria
 on the iQlh of January 1797 ; and having visited Jerusalem,
 Damaious,        Aleppo, and various other places, proceeded to
 Constantinople ; from which he returned to England by
 Vienna, Dresden, I.eipsic, and Hamburgh.                     He arrived in
 London on         the   16th   of September     1798,     after an absence
 os nearly     seven  years.

     Fiery Meteors have been              more than usually common of
late.
   On Saturday night, the 2d of November, at half past ten
o'clock, a meteor, or ball of sire, passed through the air im
mediately over the town of Pocklington,      accompanied   with
a most beautiful train of fire resembling; the tail of a rocket,
                            15 yards in length. The direction
and appearing to be about
was from the north-east to the south or south-west, and con
tinued visible for about half          a      minute.
     On    Tuesdaymorning              of November, about six
                                     the 12th
o'clock, a meteor, or ball of sire, accompanied with a beau
tiful train, was observed in different parts of Staffbrdstiire. It
was preceded by several flashes               of vivid lightning.
     The   fame, or a similar meteor,              was seen at the fame time
in Yorkshire. The following is a description of     as seen at      it,

of November, between the hours of five and six, the heavens
exhibited an awfully grand appearance.     The setting moon
became partially obscured             by      dark cloudy spots or streaks      :
in   opposition      to her   was seen         a lunar rainbow of the molt
beautifully varied colours;           after which, the middle region            of
the air was illuminated              by    meteors      crossing   each   other in
different directions, and leaving behind them long sparkling
trains, which were visible for two or three minutes after these
luminous bodies had disappeared     one of these meteors, more
                                               ;

              CONVERSION"         OF1  IRON INTO STEEL.
    In our last we noticed that Mr. Mushet, in varying the
 experiments suggested by C. Clouet's process for the conver
 sion of iron into steel bv cementation with carbonat of lime,
 had    found that when lime, previously deprived of its car-
 ionic acid, was used with the iron, the result was, notwith
 standing, cast steel ; and that, therefore, he found himself
 •bliged to reject the idea of the carbon necessary to the con
 version of iron into steel, having been furnished by the de
 composition of carbonic acid.
    We     also in our last     Number laid before our readers C.
 Guyton's      report   of  the  conversion of iron into cast steel by
 means    of  the diamond,      which     is generally held  to be pure
 carbon, and which, having disappeared in the process, was
 therefore    believed to have entered into chemical union with
 the   iron by the affinity exerted between them by means of
 an high temperature.
    From the tenor of the letter from            Mr. Mushet, which fur
 nished us with matter for the            notice first above referred to,
 we were led to suspect that, however probable it might be
 that in the    case last mentioned the carbon, which went to
 fteelisv the iron, was furnished        by the diamond; yet, as Mr.
 Mushet'    s experiments     went to (hew that carbon could find its
way from the ignited gas of the furnace to the iron, through
 materials which, on first view, one would hardly think per*
 vious to such a principle, it was certainly possible that the
 French      chemists   might be mistaken, and that the carbon^
which converted tiic iron, might not after all have been
 furnished by the diamond.
    Since, then, we corresponded with Mr. Mushet on the sub
ject,    and proposed      that  the   experiment made at the Poly
technic School should be repeated, only keeping out the dia
mond.       As   the idea arose from,       and might indeed be said to
be embraced        in, the facts presented by Mr. Musliet; and aa
the process coincided so nearly with others which he had
 communicated as executed and in train, wo knew no person
                          8                                            so

 *o   likely to do it complete justice, or so well qualified by great
 experience to guard against error.                 In this we have not been
 deceived.         Mr. Musliet, whose zeal in every thing that con
 cerns     the    improvement of the British iron manufactory en
 titles him to the gratitude           of his country, has proved, by se
 veral conclusive       experiments, that the French chemists would
 have had steel from their experiment even                  if no diamond had
 been employed         in it.   We fliall not       detain our readers longer,
 but content ourselves with laying before them
 An Account of the Experiments                -made   hy  Mr. Mit/bet with a
     view     to prove   whether       the  Experiment made at the Poly
     technic School respecting the Conversion              of Iron into Seel by
     means of the Diamond is conclusive.
     T.  " I    introduced into       a   crucible some pieces of soft mal
 leable iron weighing 1250 grains.                     A larger crucible was
 next taken, half silled with sand pounded from the fire-
stone of which the blast-furnace hearths at Clyde are made.
The small crucible containing the iron was inverted upon the
surface of the sand in the second Crucible, and forced so far
into it as to bring the iron and sand nearly into contact. The
space      betwixt the exterior surface of the small crucible, and
the interior        surface   of   the large one, was completely filled
with      the    fame   sand;     the bottom        of the inverted one also
received       half  an inch     of    sand.      This quite silled the outer
crucible, and made it have the                  appearance of being entirely
filled with sand: a well fitted fire-clay cover scaled the whole.
After a violent heat for 65 minutes the crucibles were with
drawn from the furnace              : when cool,       I found a slight crack
in the exterior one ; the sand however remained entire, and
firmly cemented together, though not vitrified, forming a
thick porous lute surrounding the small crucible.                      Upon re
moving the sand, and examining the interior vessel, I found
the pieces of iron fused into one solid mass, which proved soft
steel. The mass of sand, which occupied the mouth of the in
verted pot, contained several detached globules                 of  steel j these,
during the intensity        of   the heat,       and  the extreme division      of
the fluid,       had penetrated       the sand,     and one    of them had ac
tually reached the bottom of the outer crucible.                   These masses

had  in their descent conveyed a bl:ickish-bluc colour to the
sand, and the sufion of the whole had glazed the bottom and
fides   of    the     crucible, unoccupied by the sand, with
                      inverted
the fame colour.    The principle button, and small pieces,
weighed 1229 grains: loss, 21 grains, —       of the original             .f'.0
weight of the iron.
   " The qualitv of this steel was uncommonly red-short, and
it   was with disriculty             it   would take     a   form under the hammer.
When         cold    it   was much, tougher than good steel                ever found
                                                                                  is

part of the result possessed  crystallised sursace more or less
                                                a
accurate.   Upon   the whole, the quality of this steel                                      is,
                                                                                              I
think, fimilar to fome described lately        C. Clouet.   Its      by
uncommon foftness, while       possessed  not  the
                                               it  property of
drawing into shape with     smooth uncracked sursace, led me
                                           a
to conceive that the sufion was urged too speedily, and besore
the sussicient quantity os carbon had been taken up which,
Constitutes         good steel. This induced                 me to repeat the experi
ment in the           following manner:—
      II. "     Having       in an annealing- surnace,
                                   prepared,                                                three
crucibles, made from Sturbridgc clav, of various fizes                                  ;    into
the smallest one           I       put five pieces       of malleable iron weighing
1875 grains; upon the top of which      wedged    high-baked I                    a
cover of fire-clay upon the top:of this  cover, and  to  level                           a
with the edges of the crucible,   introduced insufible fand.
                                                     I
This operation was persormed upon      plate of red-hot iron, a
lest lie sudden contact of the cold air should endanger the
        I
foundness           os the pots.           The (mall crucible                 was next intro
duced        into the second fixe, and               a     cover fitted           over the two.
Lastly, this double crucible was placed into one lo much
larger as to admit of     stratum of sand, nearly half an
                                           a
inch 'hi     in such
                !:,   manner as to insulate the former most

 crucible with  large fire-clay cover.
                          a                  reafon for leaving   My
 the vacant space betwixt the two innermost crucibles not
 filled up was, to guard against anv error in the result, which
 i:.iv'ht probably be occafioned                     by   tlie action of the interior
 fire-clay cover,             and the fand, in their respective degrees                            of

derate white heat for nearly an hour, and for forty minutes
further a heat equal to the whole power of the furnace. The
crucibles were safely withdrawn, and, when examined, the
following facts presented themselves : —
    " The outer crucible remained entire; the sand, next,
formed an entire vessel considerably connected. The second
crucible was       also sound,   but in the bottom of it I found an ir
regular metallic mass.           A    small hole in the side of the interior
pot had allowed nearly one-half of the original weight of iron
to pass; the remainder of   forming    very beautiful circular
                                      it,               a
button, rested upon the bottom. The surface was crystallised
in radii, (hooting from    central point upon the upper sur
                                  a
face of the button.   The collective weight was 1858 grains                           :
loss, 17 grains, =t£t part the weight of the iron. When the
metal was lodged in the small crucible, the sides and bottom
were glazed, as in the former experiment.
  III. "          The  experiment was repeated with bottle
                        fame
glass, and  similar length and degree of heat applied. The re
             a
duction of the glass was entire. Betwixt the exterior and mid
dle crucible,the glass appeared as an entire interposed vessel,
completely surrounding the two smaller ones.        Upon exa
mining the interior crucible,   found  that the
                                             1   contact of the
bottle-glass had fused the cover of sire-clay fitted over the iron,
and that the promiscuous fusion of the glass and clay formed a
very sine dark-green transparent                     mass, beneath which lodged
the metallic buttpn.             The        upper      surface   still   preserved the
aeuteness of the original angles upon one piece of iron the                     ;
others had resolved themselves    fusion into    by
                                              very sine ingot       a
of soft   steel    with partially crystallised edges. The weight of
the whole was          1759 grains;     less  than when put in, five
                             part of the whole. — am convinced

that   by   prolonging the heat ten minutes, the whole iron would
have entered into fusion.             I  would from this and other expe
riments     insejr,     that the iron       of more difficult carbonation
                                             is
when   a    fused medium         is   made use of, than when either pure
sand, pure lime, or clay, are used.

lution in caloric, and to obviate anv objection which might
probably be started against this, by supposing that the carbon
might be conveved through the porous medium of the earth?,
or the bottle-glass, before it entered into fusion, I made the
following experiment : — Having made a mould in sand, I
poured  into it thinly fused calcareous stone ; and, while the
fluid was thin, introduced a small rod of red-hot iron, sus
pended by a very small brass wire.   The dimensions of the
rod were so proportioned to the mould that 5-8U1S of an inch
of    a vitrid crust        encircled the iron on all sides.               The wire
became fused and   disengaged as the fluid was consolidating,
so that every avenue to the iron was completely shut up. The
mass was carefully cooled to prevent stiivering, and as care
fully heated, when introduced into the furnace, in a crucible
inverted      in   one larger, and the vacancy
                                          betwixt each shut up
from air by means of pounded bottle-glass. A cover was
fitted on, and a violent heat urged for nearly two hours. The
crucibles were Jakcn out, free from blemish, and cemented as
one compact mass.      When cool, I found the metal in the
interior crucible resolved into a very sine ingot, which proved
afterwardsto be soft steel ; capable,                  however, of hammering
and hardening to great advantage.                       The weight of steel ob
tained       was  157 grains ; loft, 33

 great difference in the loss of metal sustained    these two last in

     " Theseis one experiment which would, if successful, esta
blish the point. C. Clouet calculates, that, to constitute grey
crude iron, i-6th of carbon is necessary.   Were six parts of
iron, and        a    diamond, equal to              i-6th of this,           subjected to the
same process as formerly,                      and the result grey, or carbonated
crude iron, instead               of    steel, the inference would be just,                and
the conclusion satisfactory.
        " In   the present state          of my information, I doubt whether
the diamond afforded                    even one particle of carbon to the iron.
From many experiments, wherein I used, very pure well char
red wood and malleable iron, I uniformly found that the
weight os the steelisied ingot nearly equalled the sum of that
of      iron and carbon originally introduced : so that, in
        the
place           a loss of real iron equal to ^, as experienced
             of having
by the Parisian chemists, had the diamond been taken up
by the iron, the ingot of steel would have weighed within
T^5 part of the aggregate weight of both, and from                                        ^   to

     LUMINOUS         APPEARANCE PRODUCED BY SUGAR.
    In  the process    of breaking     fine white sugar in a dark apart
ment, a very perceptible            luminous appearance is observed,
 the cause of which is as much unknown to us                      as that pro
 duced    by rubbing against each other two flints, particularly
 those   of Iceland.      The following is offered by Dr. Juch*, of
 Wurzburg,       as a  kind of explanation of this phenomenon:
                  breaking refined sugar," says he, " in small
     " While
 pieces with a hammer and blunt knife, I suddenly perceived
 a very singular smell, which had a great resemblance to that
 of fuming nitrous acid.            I looked immediately round me to
 fee  whether some       vessel   containing that acid might not be in
  the neighbourhood ; but I saw none, and was certain that
  nothing of the kind had been in the room. I then examined
  the circumstance more narrowly, and found, on breaking sine
  sugar, that a smell similar to that of aquafortis was always
  perceived    by every person present.
     "This    simultaneous      disengagement       of light,  and  of the smell
  of nitrous acid,     I  explain in     the following     manner     : — Wheu

  sugar is broken,         a new surface being presented to the air, a
  real acidifying      process instantly takes place:     a small portion
  of   the oxygen of the atmosphere unites itself with the sugar,
  but not enough to form saccharine acid, as the quantity is not
  perhaps sufficient for that purpose j and at the same moment
  the atmosphere in contact with the new surface of the sugar
  is  so changed, in regard to the proportion of its component
  parts, that it affects the olfactory organs in the fame manner
 as nitrous acid. This phenomenon may receive some farther
 illustration by repeating the experiment in          a close vessel."
                A SINGULAR       OXYDATION OF IRON.
     Dr. Juch    also gives the following singular notice: —
     " I    had," fays he,     " a small leather flask filled with iron
 filings,    which   I   frequently  used   with my electrophorus both
charged       and uncharged.      I had   occasion, one day for a quan
tity of pure iron,       and, having no other at hand, had recourse
to the filings in the flask, which          I  knew were pure.    I emp
tied it on a piece of paper.          I laid the paper on my hand in
order to convey it to the place of its destination ; but I had
scarcely held it a few seconds when I perceived a strong heat,
which      increased    so  much that     I   could no longer hold the
paper.       Some minutes after, the paper became brown, and
at length took fire. It did not, however, flame.               The iron
filings were in a state of ignition ; and when the heat had
decreased, I found the iron converted into a highly friable
                         ELECTRICITY OF ICE.
     The    same author mentions,         that electric sparks may be
obtained      by the  usual   manipulation      from a cylinder of ice.

    I.   On different          Sorts     of Lime        used in Agriculture,               By
                   Smith s o n Te n n a n t, Esq. F.R.S.*
J. WAS             informed last summer, that, in the neighbourhood
of Doncastcr, two kinds of lime                          were       employed     in agricul
ture, which were supposed to differ materially in their effects.
One of these, which was procured near the town, it was ne
cessary to use sparingly,                 and      to spread very evenly over the
land  for it was said, that a large proportion of
         :                                             instead of              it,
increasing, diminished the fertility of the soil       and that,             ;
wherever    heap ofa    was left in one spot, all vegetation was
                                 it
prevented for many years.                         Fifty or      sixty    bushels  upon an
acre,        were      considered       to be as much as                could be used with
advantage.             The other        sort   of lime, which           was obtained from
a   village near Ferry-bridge,                   though considerably dearer from
the distant carriage, was more frequently employed, on account
of its superior              utility.     A      large quantity was            never found
to be injurious          ;    and the spots which
                                              entirely covered  were
with       instead of being rendered barren, became remark
             it,
ably fertile. The different properties ascribed to these two
kinds of lime were       very distinct, that
                                   so         seemed probable        it
they could not be imaginary    and    therefore appeared to
                                                    ;        it
be worth the trouble of ascertaining them more fully, and

of attempting     to discover the nature        of  the ingredients front,
 whence the difference         arose.     For this purpose I procured
some pieces of each fort of limestone,               and first tried what
 would be their effect upon vegetables, in their natural state,
 by reducing them to coarse powder, and sowing in them the
 seeds   of different plants.         In both kinds the feeds grew
 equally well, and nearly in the fame manner as they would
 in  sand, or any other substance which affords no nourishment
 to vegetables.      Pieces   of  each fort   of  stone were then burnt
to   lime;   and, after tliev had been exposed for some weeks to
the air, that their causticity might be diministied, some seeds
were sown in them.           In  the kind     of lime which     was found
most beneficial to land,        almost    all the feeds came        up, and
continued lo grow       as  long   as they were supplied      with water;
and the roots      of  the plants had many fibres, which had pe
netrated    to the bottom     of  the cup in which they grew.         Upon
examining the composition of this fort of lime, it proved to
consist entirely of calcareous earth,           liy its exposure to the
air for about three        months,      it was found to have absorbed
4-5ths of the fixed air required to           saturate it.    In the other
kind, a few only of the seeds grew,            and' thp plants produced
from them had hardly any stalks or roots, being formed al
most entirely of the two seed-leaves, which lay quite loose
upon the surface.        This fort of lime, being spread upon a
garden soil, to the thickness of about the tenth of an inchj
prevented nearly all the feeds which had been sown from
coming up, whilst no injury was occasioned by common)
lime used in the fame manner.              Upon examining the com-
p )sition of this substance, which was so destructive to the
plants, it was discovered to contain three parts of pure cal-
cireous earth, and two of magnesia.                 The quantity of fixed
air which it had absorbed, by being exppsed for about the'
same time as the pure lime just mentioned, was only 42                 him,
dredths of that combined with it before it was burnt.
    .As it seemed probable that the magnesia contained in this'
lime was the cause of its peculiar properties, the following
experiments were made, to determine the effects qf that sub
stance upon the growth           of  vegetables.      Some   seeds,  chiefly
df colewort, which      were preferred from their growing quickly,
                                                                       were

          bn    different Sorts    of Lime      used in Agriculture.       3 1X
Urere sown     in uncalcined       magnesia; but, though they sprouted,
the leaves never         rose  above the surface, and the plants were
entirely without roots, nor did they appear to grow better in
magnesia which had been washed in water containing fixed
air.    Calcined magnesia w:ts, however, much more destruc
tive,  as the feeds would not come up in it.                  To compare its
effects  on   vegetables      with   those    os  lime,  each  of these earths
was mixed, in different proportions, with sand, in small cups,
in which feeds were then sown. The lime was obtained from
marble; and, before it was put into the sand, was made to
fall to powder, by being moistened with water.                      In a mix
ture of four ounces of sand with three or four grains of cal
cined magnesia, it was a long time before the feeds came up,
and the plants had hardly any roots or stalks ; and, with ten
grains or more of magnesia, there was no appearance of ve
getation. Thirty or forty grains of lime did not retard the
growth of the feeds more than three or four of magnesia, and
the injurious effects were not so lasting.                 The lime, by ab
sorbing    fixed    air,   soon  lost  its destructive    properties ; so that,
after keeping these mixtures four or five weeks,                    feeds were
found to grow in that with forty grains of lime, nearly as
Well as in pure sand ; but, in that with sour grains of mag
nesia,   they produced          only the seed-leaves, as was described
before.      It was necessary occasionally to break in pieces (lie
sand which had so much lime, as it would otherwise have
been    too    hard to admit the             seeds to penetrate through it.
 Plants will bear        a  much larger proportion of magnesia in ve
getable     foil than in sand : with twenty grains, however, of
calcined magnesia, in as much foil as was equal in bulk lo
 four ouiices of sand, the seeds produced only the seed-leaves
without roots ; and, with about forty grains they were en
 tirely prevented from coming up.
    In countries where the magntsian lime is employed, it
was said, that the barrenness of any spot on which a heap of

     As
      the preceding experiments were tried during the winter,
in   room warmed
     a                  fire, perhaps under circumstances more
                                           by
favourable to vegetation, the fame quantity of magnesia would
not be equallv pernicious.
  Magnesian limestone may be easily distinguished from that
which     purely calcareous by the slowness of its solution in
                is
acids, which       considerable, that even the softest kind of
                             is      so
the former              is   much longer            in    dissolving     than marble.         From
this property of the magnesian limestone, there appeared to
be reason for suspecting that the kind of marble which had
been           called        Dolomite,             from    M. Dolomieu,             who first re
 marked its peculiarity in dissolving slowly, might also be
 similar in its composition.   An analysis of this substance
 was lately given in the Journal de Pbypque: but this   pro                               is
 bably erroneous               j          for, upon examining three specimens,                 they
                                                                                               were

magnesian limestone          ; so    that it ought no doubt to be consider
ed as the fame species            of stone, but in a state of greater purity.
The    pieces   of dolomite       were from different places;                       one      of them
being found among the ruins of Rome, where it is thought
to have come from Greece, as many statues of Grecian work

                            ;
the western isiands         of Scotland.                 In many kinds of common
marble, small particles and veins may be observed, which are
a long time in dissolving.    These, upon examination,    dis                                I
covered  to contain      considerable
                             a        proportion of magnesia                                        ;
but, as they were probably not quite free from the surround
ing marble,     I did not ascertain the quantity precisely.
     The crystallised structure which may generally be observed
in    the magnesian        limestone,             seems to shew               that      it   has not
been formed by the accidental union                              of    the two earths,           but
must have resulted from their chemical combination.    The
difficulty of dissolving           it,
                         may also arise from the attraction
of    the different component parts to each other.                                   The mortar
formed from this kind of lime                          is   as soluble       in    acids as com
mon marble; and the substances of which                                it    consists are easily
separated.   The magnesia may be taken from          boiling                   it    by             it

     As   the preceding method            of estimating    the quantities of
magnesia and calcareous            earth is liable to considerable    error,
 I  afterwards    examined       them in the following manner,        which,
seems capable          of   great   exactness  : — Twenty-five    grains of
 each    substance were dissolved, by marine acid, in a cup of
 platina, and, after the solution was evaporated to dryness,
it was made red-hot for a few minutes. The mass remain
ing in the cup, which consisted of muriated lime, and of the
 magnesia freed from the acid, was washed out with water,
 and poured into a phial.               There was then added to it a
 known       quantity of diluted marine acid, somewhat more
 than was sufficient to redissolve the magnesia, and, after the
solution, a certain weight of calcareous spar, part of which
would be dissolved by the superfluous acid. By the quantity
of spar remaining undiflblved, it             was Jearnt how much acid
 was required to dissolve the magnesia.               The iron and argil
 laceous     earth    contained in some specimens, were precipi
tated by the spar, and therefore could not occasion any error.
The calcareous spar, however, dissolved more slowly where
there was argillaceous earth, as it became coated with it ;
but this incrustation was occasionally removed, and, in all
the experiments, the spar was left in the solution till it suf
fered no further diminution.              For this   purpose it was neces
sary to keep them slightly warm for some days, during which,
time the phials were generally closed, to prevent any escape
of the acid.
    The    first experiment in the following table was made upon
known quantities of magnesia                and   calcareous   earth, to try
the accuracy       of  the process.      For this purpose, also, the se
cond was repeated upon a piece of limestone, previously pow
dered, to render every part of it of the fame quality.                  The
first column shews the quantity of calcareous spar which
might      have    been dissolved      by the aejd required to take up
the magnesia.          The    second shews the corresponding quanti
ties   of  magnesia      in  25 grains of each suhstance,         The third
expresses the quantity of lime.              This was inferred by sub
tracting      the  weight     of  the  magnesia, and of the iron and
clay, from 13.2 grains, the weight of the whole quantity of
parth in
             a^ grains
                           of limestone. This is probably not very

         Instruments      necessary    for   the Geological Traveller.
 t-   J_ HE        most necessary instrument is the miner's hammer.
 It will   be requisite to have two,           of  different  sizes: one small,
 to break small fragments              of rolled pebbles, by holding them
 in the left hand while you stiike with the right.                    Its weight,
 including the handle, ought to be about ten ounces. The
 Other must        be larger,       to detach     fragments of rock, and to
 break large pebbles         :   its weight ought to be quadruple that
 of the small one.           When I       travel on horseback,      I  have these
 two hammers suspended from the bow of my saddle.
     I. A. Two stone-cutter's chisels : one small, of from                  a  line
to a line and a half, to detach small crystals, or other objects
 of  small bulk      ;  the other, seven or eight lines.
     S. To try the hardness of fossils,             a   piece  of  steel to strike
 fire will be necessary        ;   also a triangular file, pretty sine, and a
 strong bodkin         of tempered steel.
     3.   Nitrous       acid, with M. De Morveau's                boxes    of    re
  agents.
     3. A. An artificial magnet, in a cafe, with                    a steel  pivot
 on which it can be placed, to try the magnetism                    of fostils.
     4.  A    magnifying       glass    of  three   inches focus, in order to
 enable      the observer to form a           general idea of any foflil : an
 other, os an inch focus,             to examine its separated parts;           and
 one    of live or fix     lines for closer examination.             These three
  magnifiers must be always              in the traveller's pocket, or ready
  at hand     :  but, besides these, he must have, for his closet at
  home,     a   microscope furnished with a micrometer.
     5. Telescopes,        to observe       inaaceslible     mines and distant
  mountains.
     6.   A   pocket portfolio, with prepared paper for writing on,
       Vol. V,                                 F f                            with

  2 18                      Hints far  the Formation of
 with     a  pencil of tin solder,     which it is not necessary always
  to cut, and the writing          of which is not     so easily effaced as
  that of plumbago.           In this portfolio the traveller must write
  out, on the spot, the sketch of his journal, and insert such
  observations as occur to him ; but lie must take the trouble
  to transcribe these notes at more length, preserving the pri
 mitive notes, which will always retain a character of truth,
  and for that reason people arc fond of recurring to them.
      7. Some quires of brown paper, a few sheets of which
  may be carried         in the pocket for wrapping up on the spot
  specimens of the stones you collect, the characters of which
 ought to be marked on the cover. You may afterwards pack
  them with hay into a bag destined for that purpose, until you
 have a sufficient quantity to form a box, which you may send
 home by the public carriages wherever you find an oportu-
 nity   ;   but,   as it is fatiguing for the traveller to load his poc
 kets during the time         of his excursions, and as the guides often
 lose them on purpose in order to get rid            of them, I have be
 hind my saddle two leathern bags, into which I put them till
J    come to some halting-place, where I have time to pack
 them with hay into a bag.               M. Bclson recommends to those
 who undertake sea voyages to write with China ink the cha
racters which ought to accompany minerals in long passages,
because common             ink may   be effaced by accidents.
     8.   A   blow-pipe,      with  its  apparatus.    As I make much
life of this instrument, which at length fatigues me, though
 I  can blow with my checks without exercising my breast, I
caused to be constructed a pair os portable double bellows,
the     sides    of which contain        each  sixty-two square inches.
These bellows can be suspended from the edge of a table ;
and I put them in motion by pressing together, between my
knees, the two handles, which afterwards separate bv the
action of the spring.           This apparatus      may be easily carried,
and is very convenient.
    9. A graduated semicircle traced out on a copper-plate of
a form exactly rectangular, with a plummet suspended from
the centre of the semicircle.              This semicircle is the most
convenient instrument for measuring the inclination of strata,
of    veins and declivities j and it may always be carried in a
pocket      of  the portfolio.
                                                                    10. A

     10.   A   compass, furnished     with a cross staff, to find the di
 rection of mountains, chains, rallies, and strata.
    11.    Portable barometers       with two mercurial thermome
 ters ;  one affixed lo a barometer to estimate the temperature
 of the mercury in the latter,         and the other with a bare bulb
 for measuring the temperature of the air. Those who study
 meteorology, as well as geology, ought to be furnished also
 with an hygrometer and an electrometer.
    12.   For ascertaining the temperature of the sea, at great
depths, it will be necessary to have a thermometer constructed
like that described in my Travels through the Alps*: for
lakes, an apparatus like that pointed out in the note of Sec
tion 1399, will be sufficient.
    13. Those who understand a little geometry, ought to pro
vide themsels'es with a sextant, having an artificial horizon,
and also a chain,        in  order that they may be able to measure
a  base, and thus take the altitude          of an inaccessible peak, the
 breadth     of  a river, &c.     &c.     With this      sextant  they may
also find the latitudes.         In regard to the longitudes, they re
quire, besides instruments, an expertness in this, kind of ob
servation, which cannot be attained but by mariners or pro-i
fessed astronomers.
    14.   It will  be necessary also to have       within    reach tools for
repairing an instrument          in cafe it should        happen   to be de
ranged    ; such as pincers, files, turnscrews, compasses, gim-
blets,   wire,   needles, thread, ami packthread.
    15. Lastly, some good map, pasted on canvas, of the cotin-t
try you propose to examine; and this map ought frequently
to be compared        with your itinerary, and the bearings given
by vour compass.
    16.   In  regard to the care required for the traveller's person,
he must have a light dress made of cloth, without lining, of
a white colour,       as   well as his hat, that he may be less ex
posed to the heat of the sun's rays; with jackets, some cool for
the warm regions and the vallics, and the other warm for
the cool      regions    and   eminences;      a good great coat ; green
spectacles, and a black crape, to secure the eyes and face from
the snow. Lastly, if he is to pass the night in the open air, a

      17, A solid light walking-pole : mine for the high Alps
is a young fir-plant, extremely dry, seven sect in length and
18 lines in diameter at the lower end, which is shod with
iron tapering to a strong point. These dimensions may appear
large, but nothing can be too strong for the steep rocks, gla
ciers, and snow, when you are obliged to take your point of
support      at a distance from you, and to rest the whole weight
 pf your      body on your pole, by holding it in a situation very-
much inclined, and even horizontal, as may be seen in the
Vignette to the First Volume of my Travels through the Alps.
 .— For mountains which            are not so steep,    the traveller mav
 be satisfies with poles of less strength and size; but it will
 still be neceflary that they should be four or five sect in height,

 himself with his two hands by holding them in a horizontal

 is on the left side at top of the before-mentioned vignette ; for,
 in    traversing   or descending     a  rapid declivity, or in walking
 on the margin or edge of a precipice, the traveller must al
  ways support himself by his two hands, holding the pole to

  who have not learned the art of travelling through mountains.

  plats, which     are still more dangerous,    I would  recommend iron
  cramps, such as those which 1 have caused to be engraved in
  the third plate of the first volume, and which I have long
  used with' success.         In my last excursions, however, I pre
   ferred stipes, the thick soles of which were armed with strong
   Jacks, at the distance of eight or nine lines from each other.
  The heads of these taeks are of steel, and shaped like a square
   pyramid: I have some small ones, the points of which are
   only two lines aijd a half in height, and of about the fame

   double these dimensions, for the hard (now.

bag filled with charcoal,and a pan of tinned copper or iron,
form my kitchen apparatus for the mountains : wooden plates
and spoons may be found in the remotest huts. It will be
proper, however, to carry always in the pocket a cup of
gum elastic, jn order that the traveller may at ail times easily
quench his thirst, a want to which he will be frequently ex
posed in his excursions.
    From what has been said, it piay be readily seen, that the
study of geology will not suit the indolent or sensual ; for the
life of the geologuc must be divided between fatiguing and
perilous journics, in which he is dpprived of almost all the
conveniences of life, and the varied and deep researches of
the closet.       But what is still more rare, and perhaps more ne
cessary than the zeal requisite to surmount these obstacles,                          is,
                                                                                        a

truth alone, rather than with     desire for raising or destroying

fond of such studies, ought not, however, to be discouraged
 bythese difficulties; there  no traveller who may not make

  LT will now           be easy to bring the result of these observations
into    a   Ten,' narrow compass.        That the fun has a very exten
sive atmosphere             cannot be doubted           ;   and that this atmosphere
consists      of    various    elastic fluids, that are more or less lucid
and transparent,              and    of which      the lucid one        is that which
furnishes us with light, seems also to be fully established                                 by-
all the phenomena os its spots, of the faculæ, and of the
lucid surface itself. There   no kind of variety in these ap
                                              is
pearances    but what may be accounted for with the greatest
facility, from the continual agitation which, we may easily
conceive, must take place in the regions of such extensive
clastic fluids.

to be generated in its atmosphere.                          An analogy that may         be
drawn from the generation of clouds in our own atmosphere,
seems to be  very proper one, and full of instruction.
                    a                                  Our
clouds are probablv decompositions     of some of the elastic
fluids of the atmosphere itself, when such natural causes, as
in this grand chemical laboratory are generally at work, act
upon them          :            admit, that in the very exten
                       we may therefore
sive atmosphere of the sun, from causes of the fame nature,
similar phænomena will take place    but with this difference,
                                                        ;
that the continual              and    very extensive decompositions              of   the
elastic      fluids of the fun are of              a   phosphoric nature, and          at
tended with lucid appearances,                     by   guing out light.
   If  should be objected, that inch violent and unremitting
        it
decompositions would exhaust the fun, we may recur again
to our analogy, which will furuitb us with the following                               re
flections.          The     extent   of our own         atmosphere,     we fee,   is   still
preserved, notwithstanding                    the copious decompositions         of its
fluids in clouds and falling rain in flasties      ;                 of lightning, in
meteors, and other luminous phænomena         because there are  ;
srefh supplies         of   clastic vapours continually ascending             to make

 good   ihe    waste occasioned       by those decompositions.      But it
 may be urged, that the cafe with the decomposition of the
 elastic fluids in the solar atmosphere would be very different,
 since light is emitted, and docs not return to the fun, as cloud*
 do to the       earth  when they descend in showers of rain. To
 which     I  answer,     that, in the decomposition of phosphoric
 fluids, every other ingredient but light may also return to the
 body of the sun.         And that the emission of light must waste
 the sun, is not a difficulty that can be opposed to our hypo
 thesis :   for,  as it is an evident     fact  that the fun does emit
 light,   the fame objection,       if it could be one,     would equally
 militate against every other assignable way to account for the
jphænomenon.
    There are, moreover, considerations that may lessen the
 pressure of this alledged difficulty.         We know the exceeding
 fubtilty of light to be such, that in ages of time its emanation
 from the fun cannot very sensibly lessen the size of this great
 body. To this may be added, that, very possibly, there may
 also be ways of restoration to compensate for what is lost by
 the emission      of light, though      the manner in which this can
 be brought about should not appear to us.             Many of   the ope
 rations of Nature are carried on in her great laboratory which
 we cannot comprehend, but now and then we fee some of
 the tools with which (lie is at work.             We   need not wonder
 that their construction should          be so singular as. to induce vis
to confess our ignorance         of the method of employing them,
 but we may rest assured that they are not a mere lufus na
ture. I allude to the great number of small telescopic co
 mets that have been observed, and to the far greater number
still that are probably much too small for being noticed by
our most diligent searchers after them. Those six, for instance,
"which my sifter has discovered, I can from examination af
firm, had not the        least appearance     of any  solid nucleus,  and
seemed to be mere collections           of" vapours condensed     about a
centre.      Five more, that I have also observed, were nearly of
 the same nature.          This throws a mystery over their destina
tion, which seems to place them in the allegorical view of
tools, probably designed for some salutary purposes to be
wrought by them ; and, whether the restoration of what is
                                                                       loft

lost to the sun by the emission of light, the poflibility of which
we have been mentioning above, may not be one of these
purposes, I (hall not presume to determine.             The motion of
the comet, discovered         by  Mr.   Messier in June 1770, plainly
indicated how much its orbit was liable to be changed by the
perturbations of the planets; from which, and the little agree
ment that can be found between the elements               of the orbits
of all  the comets that have been observed,          it appears clearly
that they may be directed to carry their salutary influence to
any part of the heavens.
    My hypothesis, however, as before observed, does not lay
me under anv obligation to explain how the fun can sullain
the waste of light, nor to (hew that it will sustain it forever;
and   I  should also remark that, as in the analog}'      of generating
clouds,    I merely allude to their production as owing to a de
composition of some of the elastic fluids of our atmosphere,
that analogy, which firmly rests upon the fact, will not be
less to my purpose, to whatever cause these clouds may owe
their origin.     It is the fame with the lucid clouds, if I may
so call them, of the sun.           They plainly exist, because we see
them ; the manner          of  their being generated mav remain an
 hypothesis   — and  mine, till    a better can be propoled, may stand
 good ; but, whether it does or not, the consequences I am
going to draw from what has been said will not be affected
 by it.
    Before   I proceed    I fliall only point out, that, according to
the above theory,        a dark    spot in the sun is a place in its at
mosphere which happens to be free from luminous decom
 positions ; and that faculæ arc, on the contrary, more copious
 mixtures of such fluids as decompose each other. The pen
umbra, which attends the spots, being generally depressed,
more or less, to about halfway between the solid body of the
 fun and the upper part of those regions in which luminous
 decompositions take place, must of course be fainter than
 other parts.     No spot favourable for taking measures having
 lately been on the fun, I can only judge, from former ap
 pearances,    that the      regions in which      the luruiftous solar
 clouds are formed, adding thereto the elevation of the facu
 læ, cannot be Id's than 1843, nor nu,cn more than 2765
                                                                   niiks

miles in depth.          It    is true that in our atmosphere             the extent
of the clouds is limited to a very narrow compass; hut we                                _
ought rather to compare the solar ones to the luminous de
compositions which take place in our aurora borealis, or lu
minous arches which           much farther than the cloudy
                                    extend
regions. The density of the luminous solar clouds, though
very great, may not he exceedingly more so than that of our
aurora borealis. For, if we consider what would be the bril
liancy of a space two or three thousand miles deep, silled with
such confiscations as we fee now and then in our atmosphere,
their apparent intensity, when viewed at the distance of the
sun, might hot be much inferior to that of the lucid solar
fluid.
     From    the luminous atmosphere              of   the sun   I   proceed to its
opaque body, which, by calculation from the power it exerts
Upon the planets, we know to be                 of great solidity; and from
the phænomena of the                 dark spots, many of which, probably
on account of their high situations,                    have     been    repeatedly
seen, and otherwise              inequalities in their level, we
                                   denote
surmise     that its surface is diversified with mountains and
vallies.
     What     has been said enables us to come to some very im
portant conclusions, by remarking, that this way of consi
dering the fun and its atmosphere removes the great dissimi
larity we have hitherto been used to find between its condi
tion and that of the reft of the great bodies of the solar system.                       •
    The fun, viewed in this light, appears to be nothing else
than a very eminent, large, and lucid planet, evidently the
first, or, in strictness of speaking, the only primary one of our
system, all others being truly secondary to it. Its similarity
to the other globes of the solar system with regard to its so
lidity,    its atmosphere,          and its diversified surface,        the rotation
upon its axis, and the fall of heavy bodies, leads us on to
suppose that it is most probably also inhabited, like the rest
of              by beings whose organs are adapted
     the planets,                                                            to the
peculiar circumstances of that vast globe.
   Whatever fanciful poets might fay in making the fun the
abode  of blessed spirits, or an^ry moralists devise in pointing
it out as a     place for the punishment of the wicked,

 not appear that they had any other foundation for their as
 sertions     than mere opinion and vague surmise ; but now I
think myself        authorised, upon astronomical principles, to pro
 pose   the    sun as ah inhabitable world j and am persuaded that
 the foregoing observations, with the conclusions I have drawn
 from them, are fully sufficient to answer every objection that
 may be made against it.
     It may, however, not be amiss to remove a certain diffi
 culty, which arises from the effect of the fun's rays upon our
 globe. The heat which            is here, at the distance     of 95 millions
 of miles, produced by            these. rays,    is so considerable,   that it
 may be objected,         that the sin face     of   the globe  of the sun it
 self must be scorched up bevond              all conception.
    This may        be very     substantially answered by many proofs
drawn from natural philosophy, which shew that heat is pro
duced by the fun's rays only when they act upon a calorific
medium ; they are the cause of the production of heat, by
uniting with the matter of sire which is contained in the sub
stances that are heated ; as the collision of flint and steel will
inflame      a  magazine of gunpowder, bv putting all the latent
fire it contains into action.               But an instance or two of the
manner in which the solar rays produce their effect, will
bring this home to our most common experience.
    On the tops of mountains of a sufficient height, at an alti
tude where clouds can very seldom reach to slicker them from
the direct rays       of  the fun, we always find regions          of ice and
snow.       Now, if      the    solar rays themselves       conveyed    all the
heat we find on this globe, it ou^ht to be hottest where their
course is least interrupted.            Again, our aeronauts all confirm
the    coldness     of  the upper' regions         of  the atmosphere ; and
since,    therefore,     even on our earth, the heat         of any situation
depends upon the aptness              of  the medium to yield to the       im
pression of the solar rays,            we have only to admit, that, on
the   fun   itself, the  elastic   stuids  composing its atmosphere, and
the matter on its surface, are of such a nature as not to be
capable      of  any excessive affection      from its own rays: and, in
deed,     this seems to be proved by the copious emission of
them    ; for if the clastic fluids of the atmosphere,           or the mat
ter contained on the surface of the sun, were of such a nature
                             7                                               as

as to admit   of an easy, chemical combination with its rays,
their emission would be much impeded.
   Another well known fact          that the solar focus of the

heat in the place where      has been kept for itconsiderable                      a
time, although its power of exciting combustion, when proper
bodies are exposed, mould be sufficient to fuse the most re
fractory substances *.
   It will not be necessary to mention other objections, as                                               I
can think of none that may be made but what proper con                             a
sideration of the foregoing observations will easily remove;
such as may be urged from the dissimilarity between the                                                   lu
minous atmosphere of the sun and that of our globe will be
touched upon hereafter, when     consider the objections that
                                                      I
may  be assigned against the moon's being an inhabitable                                                   sa

 I     mall now endeavour,                     by    analogical reasonings, to support

admit, to stiew that our moon                           is     probably inhabited.                       This
satellite     is   of all   the heavenly             bodies the nearest, and therefore
most within the reach                   of our
                                        accordingly we find,

by repeated inspection, that we can with perfect confidence
give the following account os it: —
   It   is   a    secondary planet,          of considerable size; the surface

the moon our globe will appear to be                                 a   very capital        satellite,

328                   On tbi Nature and Conjlt uclian
on the      e trth.    There seems only to he wanting, in order to
complete the analogy, that it should be inhabited like the
earth.
      To this it may be objected, that we perceive no large seas
in     the moon     : that its atmosphere (the existence of which has
even been doubted by mam-) is extremely rare, and unfit for
 the purposes of animal life : that its climates, its seasons, and
 the length of its days, totally differ from ours : that without
 dense clouds (which the moon has not), there can be no rain ;
 perhaps no rivers, no lakes.           In short, that, notwithstanding
 the similarity which has been pointed out, there seems to be
 a decided difference        in the two planets we have compared.
      JSIy answer to this     will be, that that very difference which
 is now objected will rather strengthen the force of my argu
  ment than lessen its value : we find, even upon our globe,
  that there is the most striking difference in the situation of
  the creatures that live upon it.           While man walks upon the
  ground,       the birds fly    in  the air, and fishes swim in water ;
  we can certainly not object lo the conveniences afforded bv
  the moon, if those that arc to inhabit its regions are fitted to
  their conditions       as well  as we  on this globe are to ours.  An,
  absolute, or total sameness, seems rather to denote imperfec
   tions, such as Nature never exposes to our view ; and, on this,
   account,      I  believe  the   analogies  that have been mentioned
   fully   sufficient to establish the high probability of the moon's
   being inhabited like the earth.
        To proceed, we will now suppose an inhabitant of the
   moon, who has not properly considered such analogical rea
   sonings      as  might induce him to surmise that our earth is in
    habited, were to give it as his opinion that the use of that
   great body, which he fees in his neighbourhood, is to carry
    about his little globe, tha,t it may be properly exposed to the
    liirht of the sun, so as to enjoy an agreeable and useful variety
    of illumination, as well as to give it light by reflection from
    the fun when direct day-light cannot be had. Suppose also
    that the inhabitants of the satellites of Jupiter, Saturn, and
     the Georgian planet, were to look upon the primary ones, to
     which they belong, as mere attractive centres, to keep toge
     ther their orbits, to direct their revolution round the suna and
                                                                        to

                        cf    the   Sun and Fixed Stars.                                       229
to supply them with                 reflected      light in the absence of direct
illumination. Ought                 we not to condemn their ignorance, as
proceeding from want of attention and proper reflection? It
is very true that the earth, and those other planets that have
satellites about them, perform all the offices that have been,
named  for the inhabitants of these little globes; but to us,
who live upon one of these planets, their reasonings cannot
but appear very defective,                     when we         fee   what    a   magnificent
dwelling-place          the     earth          affords    to numberless           intelligent
beings.
      1 hese            ought to make the inhabitants of the
                considerations
 planets wiser than we have supposed those of their satellites
 to be. We surely ought not, like them, to say " the sun
 " (that immense globe, whose body woujd much more than
 "    sill the whole orbit                of   the moon) is merely an attractive
 "          us." From
      centre to                            experience          we can affirm,         that the
 performance of the most                   salutary offices to inferior planets is
 not inconsistent            with the dignity of superior purposes                         ;   and,
 in    consequence       of    such analogical reasonings, assisted by te
 lescopic       views, which       plainly favour the fame qpiinqn, ,>ye'
 need not hesitate to admit that the fun is richly storeq" with
 inhabitants.                                                                                         ,
      This way of             considering the fun is of the utmost import
 ance  in its consequences.   That                         stars     are funs can hardly
 admit  of a doubt.  Their  immense                            distance     would perfectly
 exclude them from our view,                         if   the light they send us were
  not of       the solar kind.            Besides,       the    analogy      may     be traced
  much farther.               The fun          turns on its axis       :    so does    the       star
  Algol:        so do    the stars called
                              |3 Lyrae,           » Anlinoi,         2" Cephei,
  c Ceti, and many more ; most probably all.    From what
  other cause can we so probably account for their periodical
  changes? Again, our fun has spots on its surface: so has
     the star Algol,          and    so    have the         stars     already     named,         and
     probably every star in the heavens.                         On our fun         these spots,
     are changeable       :    so they are on             the star    0    Ceti, as evidently
     appears from the irregularity                  of    its changeablp         lustre,       which,
     is often broken in upon by accidental changes while the ge
     neral period continues unaltered.  The fame littje deviations
     have been observed             in.   other periodical stars, and ought to bo
                                                                                           ascribed

   Z$o                  On the Nature and ConJlru3ion
   ascribed     to the same        cause.     But    if stars are funs, and funs-
   are inhabitable, we fee at once what an extensive field for
   animation opens itself to our view.
      It is   true that analogy may induce us to conclude,                   that,
  since   stars appear         to be funs, and funs, according to the
  common opinion,             are bodies     that    serve to  enlighten, warm,
  and sustain a system of planets, we may have an idea of num
  berless globes that serve for the habitation of living creatures.
  But if    these suns themselves             are   primary planets,     we may
  fee some thousands          of them with our own            eyes, and millions
  bv the help of telescopes, when at the fame time the fame
  analogical reasoning still remains in full force with regard to
 the planets which these suns may support.
     In  this place      I mav,    however,     take notice, that, from other
 considerations,        the idea     of funs or    stars being merely the sup
 porters   of    systems    of  planets,   is  not   absolutely to be admitted
 as a general one.           Among the great number of very com
 pressed    clusters     of  stars   I have given in my catalogues, there
 are some which            open a different view of the heavens to us.
 The    stars    in them      are so very close together, that, notwith
 standing the great distance at which we mav suppose the
 cluster   itself to be, it will hardly be possible to assign any
 sufficient mutual distance to the stars composing the cluster,
to leave room for crowding in those planets, for whose sup
port these stars have been, or might be, supposed to exist. It
should     seem, therefore, highly probable that they exist for
themselves; and are, in fact, only very capital, lucid, primary
planets, connected            together    in   one great system       of mutual
support.
    As in this argument I              do not proceed        upon conjectures*
but have actual observations in view, I sliall mention an in
stance in the clutters No. 26, 28, and 35, VI. clafe, of my
catalogue      of   nebulae, and clusters         of stars. (See Phil. Trans.
Vol.    LXXIX.         Part   II.   p. 251.)     The stars in them are so
crowded      that    I cannot      conjecture them to be at a greater
apparent     distance      from each other than five seconds, even
after a proper allowance for such stars, as, on a supposition os
a globular form of the cluster, wiil interfere with one another,
has been made.            Now,     if we  would leave       as much room be,
                                                                          tween,

                         of  the Sun     and Fixed Stars*                         lyt
tween each        of  these stars as there is between the Sun and                  Si-
rius, we must           place    these clusters 43104 times as far from
us as that star is from the fun.                  But, in order to bring down
the    lustre    of Sirius     to that    of   an equal star placed at such a
distance,     I  ought to reduce          the     aperture of my 20-feet tele
scope to less than the two-and-twenty                      hundredth part of an
inch j when certainly             I  could no longer expect               to fee any
star at all.
   The fame remark may be made with regard to the number
of very close double stars, whose apparent diameters being
alike, and not very small, do not indicate any very great mu
tual distance: from which, however, must be deducted all
those where the different               distances      may be compensated by
the real difference         in their respective magnitudes.
   To what has been said may be added, that, in some parts
of the milky way, where yet the stars are not very small,
they are so crowded, that in the year 1792, Aug. 22,                                 I
found by the gages that, in 41 minutes of time, no less than
258 thousand of them had passed through the field of view
of my telescope *.
    It  seems, therefore,         upon the whole, not improbable that,
in many cafes, stars           are united in such close systems as not to
leave much room for the orbits of planets or comets; and
that consequently, upon this account also, many stars, unless
      The star-gages ran thus :

   Nov. i&, I794. Eight spots in the fun, and several sub
divisions of them, are all equally depressed.
   The fun is mottled every where.
   The mottled appearance of the fun is owing to an inequa
lity in the level of the surface.
   The sun is equally mottled at its poles and at its equator;-
but the mottled appearances may be seen better about the
middle of the disc than tovvards the circumference, on ac
count of the fun's spherical form.
  The onevenness arising from the elevation and              depression1
of the mottled     appearance      on the surface of the sun,   seems   in-
many places to amount to as much, or to nearly as much, as-
the depression of the pemimbræ of the spots below the upper
part of the mining substance, without including faculee,
which are protuberant.
   The lucid substance of the fun          neither

          .                              considers carbon as the substance which
nourishes vegetables f.   Ingenhous, in his work on the nu
trition of plants, published in 1797, endeavours to prove,
that if carbon has any influence in this respect, it can be
only in the state of carbonic acid, as that acid is absorbed
and decomposed            | by vegetables ; while the ligneous carbon,
furnished           by Nature, produces no effect on the expansion of
 plants.           Mr. A. Young              has endeavoured                    to demonstrate          the
fame thing by experiments.                             M. Rafn,              desirous    of    discover
ing the truth amidst these contradictory opinions, made, for
three years, a series of experiments, from which he con
cludes,  by the expansion, size, and colour of the plants em
ployed, that carbon, either vegetable or animal, has a de
cided influence in the nouristiment of vegetables.    What is
new, and particularly worthy of remark in these researches,
   that, according to M. Rafn, the carbonic acid produces
 is,
exactly the fame effect                    as   charcoal of wood.                      The following

234                     Exlra£l of a Memoir, and
nitv,    the    carbonic     acid   gas would     be disengaged,        which
would furnish the means              of knowing      its influence on the
vegetation.         Another    box    was  filled merely with mould, a
third merely with charcoal, and a fourth with animal car
bon. These were to be employed in comparative experi
ments, and barley was (own in them all.
    Though the plants which germinated in the first box were
sown     in   a   stratum   of mould about two or           three inches     in
thickness, they had no resemblance, either in strength or co
lour, to those sown in the second box filled with mould alone;
but they had, on the other hand, such a perfect resemblance
to those     of  the third box silled     with charcoal, that it would
have been difficult to distinguifli the difference.              This  resem
blance continued several weeks, after which they seemed to
have not quite the same vigour as those which grew in the
charcoal, for which it is not difficult to assign a reason. The
author convinced himself that              a   decomposition had really
taken place, because, on examining the first box in autumn,
he found that sulphat os lime had been formed.                      Thtse ex
periments seem proper to conduct to a knowledge of the man
ner in which plants attract the carbonic principle, which all
the researches        of  the author demonstrate         to be necessary for
vigorous^egetation.            He   proposes   to repeat them on a larger
scale, and to vary them          as  much   as  possible*.      He   repeated,
 several   times, those os     M. Humboldt on germination,             accele
 rated by the oxvgenated muriatic acid, and always with success,
 though with this difference, that this acid did not favour ve
 getation so much as that philosopher asserted.
     M. Kafn sowed barley in a mixture of mould, sand, and
 manganese, in order to see whether the oxygen gas would
    * These experiments       would   be more conclusive   hud not the author
 added mould       in the boxes into which he put the      rubbish.   It is will
 known that mould contains a ure.tt quantity of (aibon, cxadtlv in the state
 which renders it fit for the nutrition of vegetables.
    M . A. Young, on the other liv.id, asserts, that plants grow exceedingly
 ill in charcoal : and this observation agrees more with the others, and
 with the reasoning, which induces us to believe th.it caibon- must be dis
 solved ro enter into combination with the other principles of vegetables.
 As plants grow exceedingly well iu pure water till a certain period, it
 would appear that they ought to grow equally well in watered charcoal.
                                                                            not

hot be disengaged in such a manner as to produce some effect:
on plants.           At first he obtained no effect ; but having wa
tered this box with diluted sulphuric acid, he remarked that
the    barley visibly grew faster in this box than in those not
watered      in the same manner *.
    Of all      the mixtures which             he tried for sowing, none ap
peared to       him     better    than that of equal parts of charcoal,
mould, and sand, moistened with water filled with infusion
animals, which may be easily obtained by steeping flax in
the water destined              for that purpose.          He  observes,     on this
occasion, that, of all the substances he tried, flax is that which
furnislies the most of these animalculæ.                    An incredible mul
titude of them are found in the water in which women dip
their fingers when they are employed in spinning.                                The
water put into a vessel for that use in the morning, is found
filled with         them in the evening.               The author      ascribes     to
these small animals a much                  greater influence on vegetation
than has hitherto been believed.
     Hassenfratz relates, that he could not make plants vegetate
well in simple earths.              The author asserts, that he had great
success     when he reared them in pure silex, quartzy sand thrice
washed, fine sand from the sea-shore, &c.                       But these plants
continued stunted and pale, and their roots were twice as
long as the whole of the part above the earth. In charcoal,
on the other hand, the parts were large and vigorous ; they
were of an exceedingly dark colour, and their roots were not
a sixth part of the length of the plant itself f-
     Coal-ashes, on which              the    German and Englisti farmers
bestow such praise,            destroy the plants        if the foil contains an
eighth part of that admixture.                   The   leaves become faded, as
    * The sulphuric        acid cold does     not disengage the oxygen of the oxyd
of  manganese     :  besides,  according   to  the  experiments of lugenhous,     ti.it
acid alone,     in (mall quantity,    (tuns to have    the property of rendering   ve
getation more active.
    t  The   first results are perfectly similar to thole obtained by     C.  Hassen
fratz.    In  regard    to the second,   tuty   depend on die purity of the char
coal employed,       which    may  contain wood undecompofed, and consequently
disposed   to putrify, and to yield a liquid which may hold the carbon in
solution.

 V. On the Assaying of Iron Ores and Iron-Stones by Fusion.

                                                                             of operation

 sults,   the proportion        of flux       must be varied according to the
 mixtures in the iron-stones or ores                      ;   and that no universal
solvent can be used as capable                  of   assaying       all ores.
    As   the gradation        of mixtures in the ores is almost imper
ceptible, there are,           in fact, no fixed limits by which Nature
has distinguished          the various classes           :   we find all the varieties
diminishing their predominant earth, and assuming, in equal
proportions, those of each other, thus constituting the class
of equalised mixtures; yet, here, the variety of combination
 ceases not, the predominating earth gradually becomes the
minor part of the mixture, and that which only held a se
cond rank, as to quantity, is now the chief component earth ;
the permutation goes round,                    till  the earth,         which   existed   in
the most sparing quantity, now predominates to excess.

appeared in our Number for          July    last,  (Vol.    IV. p.   178,)  but bv an over

     la   such an infinity       of variation it             is difficult to arrange the
combinations of which these substances are capable.   To de
rive the name of a class, or genus, from the predominancy of
an earth, seems most eligible                ;    and to consider                        those as va
rieties    of the      fame class, which           are altered by the proportion
of   the second and third mixtures.                Again, each of these va
rieties are susceptible         of   a   multiplicity of modifications before
an earth is       so   far diminished        as to give               an ascendency               to an
other, or before the third rank of proportion has assumed
that of the second or first. The simple combination of the
earths,     and their degrees            of predominancy, may                             be thus ar

  G,sUM          Sandarac is an article of trade brought from the
  southern     provinces of the kingdom of Morocco.                     About six
  or seven hundred quintals of it are exported every year from
  Santa Cruz, Mogador, and Sassy.                    In the language of the
  country it is called El graffa.             The tree which produces it

 Tunis*.               It    was       made       known             several years           ago by           Dr.
 Shaw, who named                       it,

                              ;    of these learned men was ac
 quainted   with  the economical use os this tree   probably be                     ;
 cause, being not common in the northern part of Barbary,
 the             find little advantage in collecting the resin
             inhabitants
 which exudes from it. This resin hitherto has been ascribed
 to the Juniperus communis,                     Juniperus Lycia, or the Cedar of
 Lebanon,            without           reflecting that the Juniperus communis
 does not grow       Africa, and Sandarac seems to belong ex
                             in
 clusively to that part of the world. M. Schousboe, who saw
 the species of Tbuia in question, fays that   does not rife to                 it
 more than the height of twenty or thirty feet at most, and
 that the diameter of its trunk does not exceed ten or twelve
 inches.         It
             distinguishes  itself, on the first view, from the
 two other species of the fame genus, cultivated in gardens,
 by having   very distinct trunk, and the figure of
                    a                                real tree                              a                 ;
 whereas in the latter the branches rife from the root, which
gives  them the appearance rather of bushes.      Its branches
also are more articulated and brittle. Its flowers, which are
not very apparent, (hew themselves in April      and the fruit,                    ;
which are of            a    spherical        form,          ripen in September.                      When
a    branch of this tree               is    held to the            light,   it    appears to be in
terspersed with              a   multitude of transparent                     vesicles which con
tain the resin.                  When         these vesicles               burst      in   the summer
months,         a   resinous       juice      exudes from the trunk and branches,
as      is    the cafe       in other coniferous trees.                            This     resin     is   the
Sandarac, which                  is   collected         by   the inhabitants               of   the coun
try, and carried to the ports, from which                                     it   is   transported          to
Europe.         employed in making some kinds of sealing-

 adulterated.      Care, however, must be taken that the Moors
 do not mix with it too much sand.                  It is probable that a
tree  of the fame kind produces the gum skndarac of Senegal,
which is exported in pretty Considerable quantities.
    Another     article of commerce in which the kingdom of
Morocco participates with Senegal, is that gum called Gum
Arabic, known by the name of Al leilk. The tree which
produces     it grows only in the southern provinces of that
state.    The quantity of this article exported to the different
parts   of Europe from the ports of Morocco may amount to
about eight or nine quintals.           M. Schousboe says, that this
tree is the Mimosa nilotica, named in the country Al tblah;
but this is no reason why the same kind of gum stiould not
be collected in the more southern countries of Africa from
the Mimosa Senegal,         and even from other trees         of  the fame
species,   as we are    told  by various     authors.     In Barbary      the
people make a difference        between      the gian     of  Senegal    and
that of the country.        The former      is preferred on account        of
its purity, whiteness,     and transparency,       which in general are
the properties sought for in this article.
   The gum which I collected myself in the                     province of
Mogador, says M.         Schousboe, exudes from the trunk and
branches of the tree, in the fame              manner      as  that of our
fruit-trees.     It is in round lumps,      of  the size  of  a hazle-nut,
or rather that of a walnut.             These lumps, indeed,         by be
coming united to each other, form              masses   sometimes     of the
size of the fist, or even of the head          ; but this only happens
in  consequence       of the adhesion      which takes place between
the pieces    of gum, when      still fresh, after they have been de
tached from the tree, and chiefly at that part which was at
tached to the bark, where the resinous           juice  has not had time
to harden.       If earth,  small stones,     and other foreign bodies,
are sometimes       found in these masses, it arises from fraud ;
and   M. Schousboe       suspects that this circumstance has given
rife to the opinion of the gum being found at the bottom of
the tree, and that it exudes from the roots, which, as he
thinks, is void of foundation.          Were this     the cafe, it appears
to him that, besides the earth and sand with which                 the gum
is accidentally dirtied, balls    of these    matters ought to be found

in   the inside,   and even so mixed with the mucilag'inom sub
stance     that it would be impossible ever to purify it com
pletely; while, on the other hand, the gum which comes
from Senegal is still purer than that of Barbary.
    M. Schousboe, however, observes, that the fandarac and
gum exported from the port of Saffy have a brown or red
dish colour; but he ascribes this colour to the quantity of
 the    red oxyd    of iron mixed with          the foil   of  the ptovince    of
 Abda, where this port is situated.              This oxyd communicates
its colour even to the whitest wool ; and the inhabitants of
 that province may be distinguished by the reddish tint of their
 clothes, which cannot be entirely destroyed by any process.
 In   the months      of July     and August,       when heavy dews fall,
 the gum loses a great        deal   of  its transparency,        as well as of
its other good qualities. A hundred weight of this substance
 cost at Mogador, in 1793, about 2/. sterling, without in
 cluding     about   4$. custom-bouse duty.             The gum docs not
 appear     to be employed by the inhabitants of Morocco for
Illy    purpose whatever    :   the whole     of what they collect        is fold
to the    different commercial nations of Europe.

   The climate of Sicily, in general, is represented as favour-

more analogous, in the qualities of temperature and humi

with the exception of a few days, it equals the finest spring
weather in the North of Europe t, and the Eastern States ot

particular, the season is so little affected by the severities of
cold and tempest, that, during its whole course, and in its
most boisterous state, the sky is never totally obscured for a
singleday§. Yet in this climate did Verres, the voluptuous
prætor of Sicily, that monster of atrocity and lasciviousness,
so entirely seclude himself from all impact and influence of
the atmosphere, as only to learn the approach of spring by
observing the dew glisten on the verdure which surrounded
his palace          [|.     As      the season            advances,       the heat rapidly in

many, and the total want of others, of the most nutritious
and refreshing vegetables of the northern climates, in despite
of that fertility of soil which, from time immemorial, has
conferred on Sicily the appellation of the granary of Europe.
   But, notwithstanding the general pleasantness and health-
fulness    of this island,                the concurrent testimony        of ancient and
modern writers evinces                       the       noxious condition of particular
places.
                "   The      least    stagnant          water is sufficient, in the heats
of summer, to poison                  the atmosphere          :    its effects on the coun
tenances of the poor        people, who live in its vicinity, are very
evident;        and a stranger, who travels through the island in
this season, ought to avoid ever pasting a night near them *.
As soon as the fun enters the Lion, this country becomes
the house of death : fevers, of the most malignant kind, seize
upon       imprudent or unfortunate wretch that spends a
          the
night near them (ponds and marshes) ; and few escape with
life, when attacked by so virulent a disorders." Instructed,
probably, by experience of the calamities consequent on a
near residence to marsties and stagnant waters, the inhabi
tants in various parts of Sicily have built their towns on ad
joining eminences               J.         To     avoid the dangers          which beset the
                     through this country in the sultry and
stranger in journeying
autumnal seasons, was probably one of the motives of the
Roman prætors for performing the tour of the island in the
time of harvest §. By a neglect of similar prudence, the ce
lebrated M. De Non became affected with a violent fever and
ague,     after an incautious exposure to the heat                            of   the sun and
the    chill of        (he     evening, in an unwholesome part of the

  From this brief account of the climate of Sicily,                                  it   will   be
evident, thai, how favourable soever     may be esteemed,         it                             in
general, to the health and longevity of the natives, and how
vegetables will not thrive in it.                 Currants, raspberries, and gooseberries,
are unknown         to the natives;         and foreigners, who have attempted to culti
vate -hem, have never been able to succeed."

pleasant soever many parts           of it deserve to be considered as a
winter and even vernal residence for strangers ; yet, in other
seasons, and particularly for visitors from colder countries,                  it
must be in most parts            unsahitary, in others certainly fatal,
and, in some, not to be long continued in, with impunity,
by the inhabitants themselves.                And, as this remark refers
wholly     to   ordinary years and circumstances, it will afford
some ground for estimating the effects               of one of the most un
healthy situations in the country, in the sickly season of the
year, with a constitution of the atmosphere favourable to
epidemic     diseases,   on an army of foreigners, tumultuous and
ill-accommodated,          worn down with fatigue, or sinking in
despondency.       — With     this reflection impressed on the mind,
we may now proceed to a description of the city of Syracuse,
and the country immediately adjacent, as they existed in an
cient times, occasionally supplying illustrations from the ac
counts of modern travellers.
     The once beautiful city of Syracuse consisted of five prin
cipal divisions, traces of all which are still discernible. 1 . The
isle Ortygia, Nasos, or Nason: a. Achradina: 3. Tyche, or
Tycha : 4. Neapolis, or the new city : and, 5. Epipolæ *.
     Ortygia, enclosed by the two ports— the great port on the
west and      the little port on the east, and connected with the
continent by a bridge — is of an oblong form, and about two
miles in circumference          f.   Here the original settlement com
menced, and this was always considered as the wealthiest and
most desirable part       of  Syracuse.       It  was the ancient residence
of   the kings   ;  and, in the time of Cicero, still contained the
house    of Hiero.        It was ornamented with various public
buildings, particularly the temples of Diana and Minerva;
and, in part, watered by the poetic fountain of Arethusa. As
the population increased, the sound, which divided Ortygia
from the Continent, was silled up, and the isle converted into
a peninsula J.        Carlos III. of Spain removed the earth by
which they were united ; and Ortygia is again an island, and
connected with the Continent, as formerly, by a bridge §.

 246                On    the   Pestilential Diseases which
    The    situation     of Ortygia      is important,    for it commands
both the ports      ;   and though supposed itself to be commanded
by Achradina,         yet,    while that quarter of the city remained
in   the possession    of   the Syracusans, together with the isle, and
the opposite promontory            of Plcmmyrium, the town       was nearly
inaccessible     to a naval force      *. At present Ortygia      is the only
city.     To this    state it was reduced       by the Mussulmen.        It is
strongly defended         towards the land, weakly towards the fea-r
fide.     Its quay is small ; its streets narrow, winding, and
wretchedly built; and its population does not exceed 18,000
persons    f-    The fountain of Arethusa,          after repeated changes
of  situation   J,  is still discoverable     in the west part of the isle ;
but its beauty and its honours have fled with the mythology
to which it is indebted for its fame.
    Achradina.         The quarter of Achradina,          at the   period   to
which this      essay has particular reference,         was  the most     spa
cious, well built, and strongly fortilied part of the city.                  It
extends over two considerable levels, divided by a natural
wall of calcareous rocks ; the one as elevated as Tyche ; the
other, and more considerable, on a plane with Ortygia, and
thence conferring on this quarter the character of the lowest
division of Syracuse.            The eastern part was the most com
modious,      and   not    less  extensive than the modern Paris. The
whole was adorned with a large forum, a beautiful portico,
prytaneum, curia, and the temple of Jupiter Olympus ; bor
dered on three sides by the sea, by the great port on the west,
the lesser on the south, and the port of Trogilus on the east';
and, on all sides, nearly impregnable.                   The rocks of this
quarter    of  Syracuse,      which    are formed   by marine depositions,
possess the singular property of dissipating              or absorbing the
moisture     of dead    bodies so speedily,     that they are preserved in
vaults excavated for the purpose, in their proper form and ha
biliments.        Achradina is remarkably fertile, and naturally
adapted for bringing to perfection every tropical production                §>

dina to Epipolæ; commencing at the bottom of the port of
Trogilus, which forms its south-eastern boundary.    East, it
was defended by              a strong      wall    ;    and a wall divided                it,   on the
west, from Neapolis.  The famous gat&of Hexapylon was on
the eastern wall, and opposite to the little town of Leon.
Tyche was ornamented        the Gymnasium  by  and, though                      ;
now desolate, was once silled with inhabitants.   It very                                       is

Achradina.         The Bay ofThapsus runs up behind Achradma

somewhat      less  than a mile and a half from Neapolis, (whose

the river Anapus empties into the great harbour. This stream,
which is only twenty-four feet wide, and twelve or fifteen
deep at its mouth,         flows, in a serpentine course, through a
small extent       of country, which, though slightly elevated on
its south or south-western          side, on the north and north-west
consists   of an extensive marshy         plains-
   Between the Anapus and the promontory of Plemmyrium
was situated the little suburb of Olympia, surrounding the
scite of the ancient temple of Jupiter Olympus, built upon
an eminence,         and bounded on either side by the vast              Lysi-
melian marshes,        extending from the head of the great har

directly essential to the main design of the paper; but there

    Sect. II. — The          pestilential    diseases    prevailing   in the
neighbourhood of          Syracuse,     to   which    the   present   inquiry
is limited, occurred at three distinct periods : at the three
sieges of that city, by the Athenians and their allies, under
Nicias   ; by the Carthaginians,           under Imilcon ; and by the
Romans, under Marcellus.              It is exceedingly to be regretted,
that, considering the singular mortality which distinguistied
each    of  these plagues,       the  information concerning them is
so scanty    and    general. But the precision which remarkably
characterises     that which remains, renders it of sufficient im
portance to deserve particular attention.               It is the purpose of
the present Section to place before the reader, in a succinct
narration,     the circumstances       which the historians have pre
served relative to each        of these interesting events.
     In the  second year of the famous contest between the Sy-
 racusans   and the Athenians, of which Thucydides has left so
minute and        so  touching an account, the Athenians, whose
 principal    encampments were on the east of Syracuse — at
Leon,     at Thapsus,      at Labdalium,        and   on the port of Tro-
 gilus — undertook       the construction      of a wall,    which extended
 to Epipolæ,      and was designed, after crossing the plain and
 the marsties    of  the Anapus, to reach to the great harbour on
 the west, and inclose the city.            From the completion of this
 enterprise they      were   prevented by the exertions of the Syra-
 cusans,    who carried     a  division-wall     from the city across the
 marsh, and thus opposed            an    insurmountable barrier to the
 progress   of their besiegers.        To promote his         design,   of  the
 success   of which he now           began to entertain doubts, and to

 the Athenian general fortified and transported his army to

  changed   :   their  fatigue was great and incessant ; every trifl

  distant and uncertain      ;  and they became         a  prey to despond
  ency, not a little heightened by a sense of the injustice of

 unwholesome ground *," a situation              "  always unhealthy for
 an army, and especially in this season of the yeartj" a pes
 tilential disease shewed itself in the camp, extending with the
 progress    of  the season, and the continued exposure          of  the sol
 diery, or,     as Plutarch expresses himself, by contagion ; till^
 harassed by the enemy on one part, and worn down by fa
 tigue and sickness on the other, the Athenians were driven
 to the fad necessity of attempting a forced and secret retreat,
 with the dereliction of their camp, their wounded, and their
 sick.      The consummate        eloquence      of Thucydides      alone is
 adequate to the description        of this  scene  of horrors.
     Of   the numbers who perislied by this pestilence,           and   of its
 particular symptoms, no record is transmitted down to us.
 The event of this siege is known.             The Athenians were sur
 rounded on their retreat, and defeated with immense destruc
 tion, and under the most melancholy circumstances of dis
tress   :  their general, worthy of       a better fate,   was cruelly put
to death     ; and the greater part      of  those who were made pri
soners perished       in Syracuse,    the   victims of   diseases   induced
by    excessive labour and unwholesome food.               A  few   (in  such
honour was poesy among the ancients,) were emancipated by
the recollection and recitation          of  even a single    verse   of the
pathetic tragedies of Euripides J.
     At a subsequent period, and during the War between the
Carthaginians and Dionysius the elder, Himilco, or Imilcon,
after several successful       enterprises    in other    parts  of Sicily,
marched against Syracuse.            He invaded      it with an army of
300,000 foot and 3000 horse ; while the Carthaginian fleet,
of 200 ships, under the command of Mago, followed by 500
barks, entered        the great   port in a triumphal manner, and
laden with the spoils of the ravaged cities of the island. Imil
con pitched his tent in the very temple of Jupiter, then
standing at Olympia ; and his army encamped                  around him.

 In this situation,      *' an   eminence between two morasses,
 highly favourable for a camp, and for rendering it impreg
 nable," he continued thirty days, laying waste the country
 on all sides, plundering the temples, and demolishing the
 tombs of the kings, and in vain offering battle to the Sy-
racufans, who had not the courage to attack or oppose him.
Nature, more powerful than themselves, arrested the progress
of that fate which threatened to overwhelm them. " It was
now in the midst of summer, and the heat this year was ex
cessive."     While Imilcon continued         at Olympia, spreading
devastation    around him, and anticipated a signal revenge upon
the hostile Syracusans, a pestilential malady shewed itself in
his camp.       It appeared first among his auxiliaries, the Afri
cans, who, forced into the service by fear of the Carthagi
nians, whonv they hated, were probably least carefully ac
commodated.         From them it soon extended, by the increas
ing virulence and activity of the exciting cause, throughout
the army.       Neither care nor medicine afforded relief. At
first the sick received     some assistance from the well ; but the
pestilence    and the mortality multiplied themselves so rapidly
in   every  direction     that this soon became impossible,         nor
were there men to be found for the performance of the rites
of  sepulture    to the   accumulating dead.
                                                  " Violent dysente
ries, raging fevers, burning entrails, and acute patns in every
part of the body," were the usual symptoms of this terrible
disease.    Some were even seized with madness, and in their
phrensy attacked and endeavoured to destroy all that were
exposed to their assaults. Meantime the Syracusans, in health
and safety in their elevated, dry, and airy city, watched the
progress   of the pestilence among their enemies, and, profiting
by   their forlorn  condition, captured or involved in flames their
mighty fleet; and, storming their camp, impregnable to the
greatest force when defended by even a small body of healthy
troops, defeated them with exemplary destruction.                Thus
beset, enfeebled     by  disease and humbled by defeat, the proud
Imilcon, who, a short time before,          held  the conquest,     not
only of Syracuse, but of Sicily, too       cheap and easy a victory
for  so formidable an host, was reduced to purchase          his safety

   The history of             the last   of    those pestilential diseases,              which
are particularly selected for present consideration, deserves a

   The Roman army, under                       the command            of Marcellus,         de-
tamped from their station at Leontium, the modern Lentini,
and, arriving at Syracuse, encamped at Olympia.   After an
unsuccessful attempt at negociation, the city was besieged in
due form ; and the attack commenced on Hexapylon by
land, and on Achradina by water.      But the Roman general
was not successful at Syracuse, as he had been at Leontium :
all his exertions were rendered nugatory by the talents of a
Angle citizen ; and the genius of Archimedes triumphed over
the power of Rome.

   The Carthaginians   seem  to have been destined to owe the defeat of
many of their most promising enterprises in Sicily to pestilential disease*.
In a former part of the same war, whose unhappy termination has been
described above, Hannibal, the predecessor                     of Imikon,   laid siege to the
city of Agrigentum (,Girgenti), in the south-western part of Sicily. For
the purpose of raising a wall without, which should overlook and command
the city walls, he collected all the materials within his reach, and, among
the rest, destroyed, and converted to this use, the tombs standing round a
city very ancient and populous, and then containing 200,000 inhabitants.
From the uncovering and disturbing of so many dead bodies arose a ter
rible pestilence, which carried off immense numbers of the Carthaginians,
and the general himself.     Afflicted at this dreadful mortality, the besieg
ers attributed     it,
                  with the superstition of the age, to the vengeance of the
gods, incensed against them for violating the repose of the dead.         The
healthiness of the situation, the season, and the thorough appointment and
supplies of the Carthaginian army, leave no room to doubt as to the real
cause of the sickness, which gradually disappeared: but two remarks, of
some    importance,       are   suggested     by   it.    1.   The folly of modern nations,
especially in warm climates,           in suffeing the interment of the dead within
their cities.      2.  Thewisdom of          some ancient nations, in       having   a   dead, as
well   as   a   living town.
                                                                              Necessitated

          appeared in the Neighbourhood    of Syracuse.       053
   Necessitated  to defer the further operations of the siege, the
consul directed   his arms against, several other Sicilian cities,
and struck his enemies with terror by his brilliant achieve
ments.     About the     fame   time the Carthaginian general,
Himilco, arrived at Agrigentum, to the aid of the Sicilians,
with an army of 25,000 foot, 3000 horse, and twelve ele
phants.     Hippocrates, one of the Syracufan leaders, with a
part of the Syracufan troops, marched out to meet himj
Epicides having been left, with the remainder, for the de
fence of the city.    After some skirmishes with the Sicilian
army, in which he was fortunate, Marcellus returned to
Syracuse, whither he was soon followed by Himilco and
Hippocrates, who, having formed a junction, fixed their
camp at the river Anapus, about eight miles from the city.
Nothing of importance occurred while the armies lay near
each other.     The combined chiefs    soon drew off their forces;
the Carthaginian     general   took up his winter residence at
Agrigentum,      and  the   Sicilian at Murgantia.      Marcellus,
who had been for some time busied in the interior, now
again returning, appointed Crispinus to the command of the
ancient camp at Olympia, and built and fortified a camp at
Leon, on the eastern side of Syracuse, for himself. ,
   The Romans commenced their operations early in the
spring. Some of them having gained an entrance into Sy
racuse in the night, by stratagem, the gate at Hexapylon was
broken open,, and Marcellus entering, secured possession of
Epipolæ before any effectual resistance could be attempted
by Epicides.     Tyche and Neapolis surrendered at discretion ;
the fortress of Euryalus speedily submitted ; and the consul
disposed   this part of his army against Achradina, in three
places, hoping to carry it by attack, or subdue it by famine.
   While these preparations were going forward on the part
of the Romans, Himilco and Hippocrates suddenly returned
 to Syracuse,   and encamped on the great harbour.           From
 hence they attacked Crispinus in the ancient camp of the
 Romans, while Epicides, in concert, sallied out from the city
 upon the posts of Marcellus.      Neither of  these assaults suc
ceeded.     Crispinus repulsed the allies, and pursued them tri

compelled Epicides to take refuge            within the walls  of Achra-
dina.     After this, both of       the Roman commanders strength
ened their encampments.
   Such was the progress and state of the war when a pesti
lence, common to both armies, appeared both in the camp-
of the allies and of Crispinus, and naturally diverted their
attention from hostile operations : for the autumnal               season,
their unhealthy situation, and the heat, (much more                intole
rable without than in the city,) affected almost every              person
in either camp. At first they became sick, and died,                simply
from the effects of the          season  and the unhealthiness of their
situation   :   afterwards, fays the historian, the care and contact
of the sick spread the disease ; so that those who were attacked
with it   perished,     neglected    and forsaken,    or their attendants
fell victims to their humanity.             Deaths and funerals passed
before the view in rapid succession, and day aad night re
sounded with lamentations.              At length these scenes of cala
mity   became      so  familiar,   that   they not only neither wept,
nor lamented the dead, but even ceased to remove, or yet to
inter them.        Their lifeless bodies lay extended in heaps, in
the very      fight of those who expected a similar sate ; while
the dead     infected the sick, and the sick those who were in
health,    as   well with fear    as  with the corruption and pestife
rous exhalations from the bodies            : so that, impatient of lifer
and desirous rather to fall by the sword, some singly invaded
the stations of the enemy. The plague raged with far greater
violence in the Carthaginian than in the Roman camp ; for
the Romans,         from long residence in the vicinity of Syracuse,
had become accustomed to the air and water. As soon as
the Sicilian auxiliaries of the Carthaginians perceived that
the   disease spread from the insalubrity of the place, they
betook themselves to their nearest cities ; but the Carthagi
nians, admitted into no city, together with their generals,
Mimilco and Hippocrates, totally perished.                Marcellus, ob
serving how fast the disorder increased, drew the remainder
of his troops into the city, where, under shelter, and in the
shade of the houses, they regained health and vigour, not
                                                            withstanding

              appeared in the Neighbourhood       of Syracuse.        255
withstanding many of the Roman army were carried off by
the same peltilence *.
   Thus    the  Lysimilian marshes triumphed over         a third army ;
and    a number not less than 30,000 were added to those who
had fallen of the soldiery of Nicias and of Imilcon.                  The
practical consideration of these events belongs to the suc
ceeding Section.
   Sect. III. —The          simplicity and uniformity of the preced
ing   statements     and narrative, preclude the necessity for labo
rious investigation and argument. The deductions to be made
are unavoidably         simple   and uniform;      but their force and
tendency may be more distinctly perceived from a methodi
cal arrangement.
    i.  Climate     and season. — The climate      of Sicily in general,
and particularly      of   the city  of Syracuse,   is remarkably plea
sant during a considerable part of the year. But the summers
are excessively sultry; and this heat, operating on marshy situ
ations and stagnant waters, never fails to engender malig
nant fevers.       To   these they are peculiarly liable     in the sum
mer and autumnal months.              The pestilential diseases which
proved    so fatal to    the armies of Nicias and Imilcon, and to
those   of the Carthaginians       and the Romans, occurred either
in   the autumn       or in the height of summer ; and, in every
instance, in the immediate vicinity of Syracuse.
   2. Situation. — The camp of Nicias was near or at Psem-
myrium      ;  of Imilcon, at Olympia; of Crispinus, at Olympia
also ; and     of Himilco and Hippocrates, at the head of the
great harbour.         The whole of this territory is a vast marsh,
but partially covered with water even in spring, extremely
offensive in summer, and noted, from time immemorial, for
its insalubrity.
                                        —
   3. Condition of the armies. The Athenian army wai
in constant action, and constantly unsuccessful.               The army
of Imilcon was in perpetual movement, but fortunate, and
full of courage. The adverse armies, at the third siege, were
in a state of inaction. These are certainly considerable dif-

                                                                ferences   :

 Sjo*             On the Vestilentud Diseases which
 ferences : why should they not modify the event       ?  It may   be
 doubted whether any moral cause would be sufficient to pro
 tect, for a long period, an unaccustomed resident in a marshy
situation from the usual consequences.         Fatigue and despon
dency are certainly favourable to the access of disease ; and
inaction, particularly in camps, is generally admitted to be
scarcely less so.     The uncommon heat of the year of Imil-
con's irruption into Sicily, may be a satisfactory explanation
why his successful troops were so readily affected by the un-
 wholesomeness of his camp.
    4. Progress of the disease. — The sick, in the army of
Nicias, were not numerous at first, but the number gradually
increased.     This is attributed, by Plutarch, to contagion ;
but Thucydides, a cotemporary and more sagacious histo
rian, expresses no such opinion, nor does it seem probable.
The growing desperation of the Athenian affairs, and the
tendency of the season to augment the extent and heighten
the virulence of marsh exhalations, sufficiently account for
the increasing predisposition to sickness,     and for its more ge
neral prevalence in their army.
    The fame reasoning will apply, generally, to the cafe of
Imilcon's army ; but there were, in this instance, additional
causes for the production of such immense mortality.            The
commencement of this pestilence was among his African
auxiliaries.    The circumstances of their impressment into the
service, and of the contempt in which they were held by the
Carthaginians, render it probable that less care was taken to
accommodate them than the others. Some peculiar habits
of body, modes of life, or varieties of native climate, might
influence    this event;   or they might have been previously
subjected   to greater fatigue.    Be this as it may, the sickness
soon became universal, and so mortal that the dead lay           tin-
buried.    In   a situation like this, there is no reason to believe
that much attention was at any time paid to the necessary
duties of cleanliness.     When the sick could find no attend
ants, and the dead none to inter them, it requires but little
sagacity to infer that no means were used for the removal of
excrementitious matters.        And as a large proportion of this
 army were afflicted with dysentery, and the number cf pur
                                       7                    Uesying

            appeared in the Neighbourhood      of Syracuse.          259
The    sickness   in the Athenian army is simply called a fever,
said to be contagious by Plutarch,       but probably not so. Livy
describes no symptoms       of the plague recorded by him.         Dio-
dorus Siculus is somewhat         more particular   ; but only    so  far
as to mark the variety     of form in which     the soldiers  of Imil-
con were attacked by the disease.        In some, in the shape of
enteritis, or inflammation of the     bowels ; in others, of dysen
tery, sometimes invading as a violent fever, with acute pains
in every part of the body, and sometimes with madness or
delirium.      Yet,  even these scanty particulars are     of import
ance, as they serve to identify the disease, and to proclaim its
strict affinity to those which are the common offspring of
such situations as that in which the army were encamped,
and those which have spread so much apprehension,              and ex
cited so much discussion in our own country.
    7. Ceflation of the pestilence.
                                          — Another circumstance
which characterises the disease under consideration, is the
manner in which it was extinguished. So long as Nicias
remained in his camp, he saw his men constantly dying
around him by sickness* His removal, notwithstanding the
subsequent calamities which bcsel him, appears to have tho
roughly delivered his army from fevers.           The  survivors   were
employed      as slaves in Syracuse ; which     could scarcely     have
happened     had they been sick,    or had the Syracusans      dreaded
the introduction      of  a contagious disease     by their means.    —
Imilcon preserved the residue of his army only by flight : there
was no other hope for their safety ; and, after his return to
Carthage, he exclaimed, in the bitterness of his grief, that the
plague, not the enemy, had conquered him ! But neither
then nor before did the dry and airy city of Syracuse suffer
from any sickness ; nor did the fear of contagion prevent the
Syracusans from repeatedly attacking the Athenian and Car
thaginian camps.        Their minds    were probably unwarped by
the bias of system    ;  and they discerned,  in the position of their
enemies,     the true cause  of their misfortunes. — The      facts re
lated   by Livy are singularly precise and important.            In the
first place,   neither the citizens of Syracuse, nor the army of
Epicides, which had poflesfion of Ortygia and Achradina,
                                 L  1 2                              nor

06o                    On Pestilential Diseases.
nor that part of the Roman army which, under the command
of Marcellus, was stationed in the elevated quarters of Tyche,
Neapolis, and Epipolæ, were in the least affected by the
plague.      But this calamity was limited to the Romans under
Crifpinus, in    the ancient camp at Olympia ; and to the allies,
who were encamped at the head of the great port. Crifpinus
and his troops, who had lived at Olympia a considerable part
of the two preceding years, or at least had remained in the
vicinity of Syracuse, and had become in a degree habitu
ated to the air and water, suffered less severely than their
enemies    ;  and, when the sickness became general among
them,    recruited,  and ceased to be taken sick, in consequence
of a removal to the high grounds of the city, occupied by
their countrymen.         The natives of the island, seeing the
danger to which they were exposed, took refuge in their own
cities, and escaped the disease ; but the Carthaginians, with
out any "place of refuge, and entirely unaccustomed to their
situation, totally perished.
    8. On the whole, then, it appears that the mortality, in
every instance, occurring in the armies near Syracuse, ori
ginated entirely from local causes : that there is no reason to
suspect that this mortality was heightened by contagion, in
the usual acceptation of that term : that the symptoms, so far
as we have any account of them, were similar to those which
occur, under similar circumstances, in the East and West
 Indies, in our own country, and in every part of the world :
 and that,   as no difference is recorded  as existing  between these
 great epidemics or endemics before and after the causes were
 increased   by animal putrefaction, the advocates for the foreign
 derivation of pestilential diseases must relinquish the distinction
 between fevers from animal and vegetable putrefaction ; or,
 if they maintain the contagious quality of the former, must
 admit, on equal evidence, the fame quality as characterising
 the latter. To this it may be added, that, as it was the uni
  versal practice   of  the ancients to designate      any and every
 wide-wasting disease by the name of plague, without any
  special reference to its peculiar symptoms, so there is an
  equal  propriety in our conferring      the fame     appellation on
                                                                   cur

              appeared in the Neighbourhood                      of     Syracuse.              2J7
trefying carcases must have been immense, and as the limits
of the camp were not very extensive, and they were now
sorely pressed        by a vigorous enemy, incapable themselves of
resistance,        and suddenly precipitated from triumph to inevit
able defeat and shame, we shall find no difficulty                             in   assigning
causes sufficient and satisfactory                  for the extraordinary fatality
of this pestilence.
   The third plague commenced                       at the fame time            in both the
Carthaginian            and Roman camps.                  At   first,    as   in the former
instance, the sick were attended                       to; but          the number soon
became so great as to render this impossible.    In this cafe,
as in the other, the dead were left unburjed, and to putrefy ;
and   in this      cafe,      as   in that,    there      is no reason to doubt but
that the causes and fatality of the diseases were in conse
quence exceedingly augmented.      It may reasonably be
doubted, however, whether the historian is accurate in
ascribing any part of the spread of the pestilence to contact
of the sick. The belief of this doctrine has been of long
duration and extensive prevalence ; but late observations do
not   seem    to countenance its validity.                     To     establish     it,   would
inevitably annihilate               a   distinction much insisted on                      by   the
advocates         for the importation          of pestilential          diseases    into the
United       States     but this argument      not wanted for that
                                                           is
                       is ;
purpose.          It   more probable that the pestilence, in this in
stance,      as   in that preceding, was rendered more general                                  by
the increasing quantity and concentration of marsh effluvia                                     ;
by  the excrementitious matters in the camps, suffered to
assume, unremoved,       putrescent action
                                    a       and by noxious        ;
exhalations         from putrefying bodies.   There are no facts
which      authorise    the opinion that  specific matter emanates
                                                       a
from any part of the body, during pestilential or any other
fevers properly    called, capable of generating

the living body, or deprived of life,                       is  liable, under certain
circumstances of temperature       and moisture, to undergo                                     a

  this view of the question, there need be no objection to the
  testimony of Livy ; nor have we any ground, from a know
  ledge    of the symptoms of the plague he describes, to oppose
  or fortify his narration.
      5. Mortality of the pestilence. — Of the mortality of the
   sickness   which affected the army under Nicias, we only
  know that it was considerable.          Our knowledge is not muoh
  more definite respecting the number of the Carthaginians
   who perished of the army of Imilcon. There is reason, how
   ever, to believe that it far exceeded that of the Athenians,
   and probably it was not less than 100,000 men.             For it mull:
  be recollected,    that many had been        regularly interred in the
  first  of the plague,   and that all the sick and wounded were
  left behind when their general ingloriously fled from Sicily.
  Nor is it probable that a number greatly exceeding 50,000
   fell in the battle which preceded his flight.        In  the last cafe,
  our computation may be nearer            the truth.   The army with
  which Himilco invaded Syracuse amounted to 28,000, ex
  clusive of his Sicilian auxiliaries, and of the troops from that
  city which joined him under the command of Hippocrates.
  The defeat of this last, by Marcellus, the preceding year;
  the secession of the Sicilians; and his own losses in the va
  rious actions in which he had been previously engaged, had
  no doubt reduced his army below its original strength.             But,
  when it is remembered that all this army perished, and that
  a less, but still a great number      of  the Roman army also were
  destroyed by the plague, there is reason to estimate the whole
  loss as exceeding 30,000.         Thu entire number of men sa
  crificed to this unhealthy situation, in three successive periods,
  could not be less than 150,000 : a most melancholy illustra
  tion of the influence of climate, season, and soil, on the health
  of mankind ; and an example of the activity of local causes
„ in producing disease, compared with which, all the yellow
  severs of the United States, whether originating here, or im
  ported from abroad, scarcely deserve to be remembered.
      6. Symptoms and nature of the pestilence. — On this
  point our information        is lefe complete than on any other.
                            7                                         The

It   is employed     in vapour j its action      is speedy, and seldom
alters the colour.
    The means of removing greasy spots are well known.
This effect is produced by alkalies, fullers' earth, volatile oils
dissolved in alcohol, a heat proper for volatilizing grease, &c.
Spots occasioned by ink, rust, or iron-mould of any kind,
and all those produced by the yellow oxyd of iron, are re
moved by the oxalic acid : the colour may be restored by al
kalies, or a solution of the muriat of tin. These spots may
be removed also by the oxygenated            muriatic acid, when they
are on white stuffs or paper.
     The action of alkalies,       and that   of  perspired  matter, are
the same     : their spots may be effaced by acids,         or even by a
weak solution of the muriat of tin.             When these spots arise
 from several unknown causes, in order to destroy them re
 course must be had to polycbrejl compositions.            The following
 may be considered as one of the most efficacious.               Dissolve
 white soap in alcohol, and mix this solution with the yolks
 of from four to six eggs : add gradually essence of turpen
 tine  ;  and incorporate with the whole some fullers' earth,            in
 such    a manner as to form balls           of  a suitable   consistence.
 Moisten the spot ; and, having rubbed it with these balls,
 the spot will be removed by washing the stuff.                AU spots,
 except iron-mould and ink, may be removed in this manner.
     Washing     destroys  the   lustre,   and leaves a tarnished place
 disagreeable     to the  eye  ;  but    the lustre may be restored by
 drawing over the washed place, and in the direction of the
  pile, a brusti moistened in water impregnated with a little
  gum.      You may then apply a sheet of paper, or a piece of
  cloth, and a considerable weight, under which the cloth must
  be left to dry.

  IX.  Description ofsome Improvements invented by Mr. a MES          J
     Burns, of Glasgow, applicable to Fire-Grates, Stoves,
     &c. by which Rooms and Halls of every Description may
     he heated more speedily      and effectually, and with a smaller
     Wasle os Fuel, than      by  the Methods now in Use*.
       HE     principal merit of      Mr. Burns's improvements, and
 it k not   a trivial one, consists      in his contriving      to maintain
 the combustion of the fuel in           open  stoves or grates,     without
 employing for that purpose the air of the room in which they
 are placed.      The heat liberated and thrown out into the
 apartment is thus prevented from being unnecessarily wasted
 and hurried up the chimney, as is unavoidably the cafe in
 the usual method, where the combustion is maintained by
 air from the apartment, the waste of which is supplied by
 exterior cold air that comes pouring in at the bottom of the
 doors and the sides of the windows,             thereby undoing      a great
 part of   the effect produced by the fire.
    To prevent this      waste,   the air that maintains         the fire    in
Mr. Burns's grates, or in others to which his improvements
 are applied, should be brought through a tube from the out-
 fide of the house f, or be made to pass from the outside of
 the house, between two of the joists, where the floors and
 ceilings are found enough to allow this, so as to be brought
 to the bottom bars of the grate, without having any commu
 nication with the interior air of the room, while at the fame
time the grates, and parts connected with them, should be
 so  constructed, that, when the fire is not wished to be sup
 plied with cold air from the outside of the house, the passage
may be shut, more or less perfectly, by means of a valve, a
 small door, a cock, or any similar contrivance. When con
 venience does not admit of the air-tube being carried to the
    • Mr. Burns  has lately obtained a patent  for these improTements.
    f The fame principle had been    already successfully applied to close fur
naces : Mr. Howard's, of which      we gave an account in our last Number,
furnishes an example.     But its application to common open fires is a new
idea, and will probably produce an entire revolution in the construction of
gratis for common use.
                                                                      outside

valence and degree,         their appearance and disappearance, and
which would, in all probability,              yield to the same regimen
and remedies.
VIII.     Observations      on the   Art of Scoivering different Kinds
                      of Stuff.    By C.   Chaptal       *.
 T.HIS        art supposes,     ift, a knowledge of the different sub
 stances    capable      of staining any kind of cloth ; 2d, of the
 substances to which recourse must be had in order to make
 those deposited       on the stuff to disappear ; 3d, a knowledge
 of the effects produced on colours by those re-agents which
 it may be necessary to employ to destroy stains ; 4th, a know
 ledge of the manner in which the cloth is affected by those
 re-agents     ;   5th, of the art of restoring a colour changed or
 faded. — Of those bodies which occasion spots on different
 kinds of cloth, some are easily distinguished by their appear
 ance, such        as greasy substances ;    but others have more com
 plex effects, such as acids,         alkalies, perfoired matter, fruits,
  urine, &c.          Acids redden     black,    fawn, violet and puce-
  colour, and every shade communicated with orchilla-weed,
  iron, astringents, and every blue except indigo and prussian
  blue.     They render the yellows paler, except that of arnatto,
  which they change into orange.
      Alkalies change to violet the reds produced by Brazil wood,
  logwood, and cochineal. They render the greens on woollen
  cloth yellowish, make yellow brownish, and change the yel
  low produced by arnatto to aurora. Perspired matter produces
   the fame effects as alkalies.
      When       the spots arc    produced by simple bodies on stuffs,
   it  is easy     to remove     them by the means already known.
   Greasy substances are removed by alkalies, soaps, the volk of
   eggs, fat earths; oxyds of iron, by the nitric and oxalic acids;
   acids by alkalies, and reciprocally.           Stains of fruit on white

26a                     Observations   on the Art of
 stuffs may be removed by the sulphurous acid, and still better
by the oxygenated        muriatic acid.    But when    the spots are   of
a complex kind,        it will be necessary to employ several means
in  succession.     Thus : to destroy the stain of coom from car
riage-wheels, after the grease has been dissolved thf oxyd of
iron may be removed by the oxalic acid.
    As colours    are often changed      by re-agents, it will be ne
cessary, in order to restore them, that the scowerer should
possess    a thorough knowledge of the art of dyeing, and
how to modify the means according to circumstances. This
becomes the more difficult when it is necessary to re-produce
a colour similar to that       of the rest of the stuff, to apply that
colour only in one place, and often to restore the mordant by
which it was fixed, and which has been destroyed, or even
the first tint which gave the colour its intensity.           It may be
readily conceived that the means to be employed must depend
on the nature of the colour and the ingredients by which it
was produced ; for it is known that the fame colour may be
obtained from very different bodies, Thus, after an alkali has
been employed        to destroy    an acid spot on browns,       violets,
blues, poppies,      &c.   the yellow spot which remains may be
made to disappear by a solution of tin ; a solution of sulphat
of iron restores the colour to brown stuffs which have been
galled ; acids restore to their former splendour yellows which
have been rendered dusky or brown by alkalies            ;  blacks pro
duced     by logwood become red by acids ;             alkalies change
these red spots to yellow, and a little of the astringent prin
ciple makes them again become black.               A solution of one
part   of  indigo  in  four  parts of  sulphuric acid, diluted with a
sufficient quantity of water, may be employed with success to
revive the blue colour of cotton or wool which has been
changed. Scarlet may be revived by means                   of cochineal
and a solution of the muriat of tin, &c.
    The choice of re-agents         is not a matter    of indifference,
Vegetable acids are preferable ; the sulphurous acid however
may be employed for stains occasioned by fruit : it does not
change the blue of silk nor colours produced by astringents :
it does not degrade the yellow of cotton. Ammonia succeeds
better than, fixed alkalies in removing spots produced by acids.
                                                                       It

outside     of    the house,            if   carried to a cellar, larder, stair-case,
or any lumber-room, the same end will be gained ; with this
further advantage, that such cellar, larder, &c. will thereby
                  and prevented from acquiring or retaining
be well ventilated,
any unhealthy or disagreeable smells.
  The form of the grates may be varied indefinitely 5 but the
one we are about to describe answers the purpose so well, and
is at the fame time capable of being made, by the aid of a
good architect, so highly ornamental to any apartment, that
our readers will fully comprehend the facility with which it
may be accommodated       to circumstances.
  Fig. 1, (fee Plate V & VI.) represents a grate of the improved
construction, and Fig. 2 is a section of it. The air that main
tains the combustion is supplied through the pipe or tube A,
(Fig. 2 and Fig. 4,) or from between the under-ceiling and
floor as before-mentioned, from which it parses up by the
back or side of a drawer B, Fig. 2, according as it is most
convenient to bring it up by the one or the other ; the back
however is preferred, where convenience admits of it. The
front of this drawer, in its place, is seen in Fig. 1, at C.
The intention of this drawer is to receive the ashes that fall
from the bottom bars of the grate, sections of which are
represented at DD, Fig. a.      The ashes, as they fall from,
the bars, strike against the sides of the internal cavity E,
and then are carried by their own gravity through the narrow
part F, and fall into the drawer. This part of the con
struction may be easily understood by conceiving it to be an
hollow vase, as it actually      with   drawer     is,

  air-tube, the other end of which is on the outside of the
  ho;:se, or in any cellar or other apartment, as before de
  scribed.      When the air has passed through the aperfnre I,
  it  finds no difficulty in passing on to the bottom of the grate,
  that back or fide of the drawer next which the aperture is
  being made low to allow it to flow in freelv.
      The   grates are recommended       to be made of a circular or
  elliptical form, as being most convenient, where the fence or
  screen,     to be immediately    described,  is wished to be applied
  along with Mr. Burns's other improvements.              The fence is
   intended to prevent those dreadful accidents, which too fre
   quently occur, of women's and children's clothes being set
   on fire by sparks from the grate.          When it is wished to be
   adopted,     the inside  of the chimney,     where the grate is to
   stand,    had best be a semi-cylinder,      or nearly so,  (as repre
   sented in Fig. 3,) with a lining or cover a as, best made
    of metal, at such a distance from the semi-cylindrical wall,
   NNNN, as to give sufficient room for allowing the safe
    guard or fence to be slid round into it when the fire »
    wished to be left open, when fresh fuel is to be added, or
    when the drawer with the ashes is to be removed.
        The fence is a frame-work of metal, which, when filled
    up with glass or with wire-work, forms a portion of a cylins
                                                                     der

 in one or more pieces, and moving in a circular groove,
  bbb, in or upon the hearth, which serves to conduct it into
  its place behind the grate, when the frre-place is wished to
  be left open,     as before mentioned.        The   top  of  the front  of
.the opening of the        chimney O, Fig. 4,         projects in a cir
 cular form, or is furnished with an added projection, made
 of metal, marble, or any other fit material ; but in either
 case the    projection is furnished with a circular groove on its
 under surface, of the fame radius with the one in, or planted
 on the hearth, for the purpose of receiving the upper part
of the    frame-work of the fence or safeguard,             which frame
 work may be filled up with glass, either plain or bent, and
 either colourless or coloured, or stained or painted with
 figures   or designs of any kind.           By this means complete
 safety is obtained against any            such  accidents as have been
 alluded to, while at the fame time the comfort arising from
 the view     of  a  cheerful sire is   not prevented by the interposi
 tion of any opake body        j  but for nurseries or the like, where
 convenience      and safety is more the object than elegance or
 luxury, the frame-work may be. filled up with wire-work.
 The fence may be seen in its place at P.
     Where either the glass or the wire- work           fence, or both    of
 them, are meant to be applied to square or rectangular chim
 neys, without the trouble of giving them the semi-cylindrical
 form, the lining to receive the fence or fences may be intro
 duced at the fides or jambs of such chimneys ; or the fence
 may be made to rise by means of pulleys into the wall above
 the opening, or slide sideways into the walls at the fides          of the
opening.
     These improvements maybe introduced              together or singly,
and may be applied to many             of the grates now      in common
use.
     Besides   the advantages       already   pointed out    as connected
with     them, they possess also the following.          — Any room or

X.    On the Chemical ASion of different Metals on               each other
    at the common    Temperature     of  the Atmosphere.      By C. Fa b -
    BRONI*.
  JL HAT       particular sensation, first made known by Sultzer,
 which is felt on the tongue on bringing two metals into mu
 tual contact, and which would have excited none if they
 had been applied        separately to that organ, has been ranked
 among the galvanic phenomena.                C. Fabbroni, however, in
 stead   of ascribing    these effects to an agent almost unknown,
 such as the electric fire, is     of opinion that it        depends on a
 chemical operation, perhaps          as the sensation      of  taste itself.
 He    has endeavoured     to prove the truth        of this opinion by a
 number of observations        and experiments.
               '* From Stlletin des Sciences,   Vol. II. No. 5.
                                                                         He

    He had remarked that several metals, such as mercury,
tin, lead, retained their metallic brilliancy as long as they
were pure, while compounds of them became soon tarnished
and oxydated ; that the mere contact of two different metals
seemed to hasten their oxydation ; and that, in this manner,
the    mixture      employed     for soldering the plates of copper
which cover the observatory of Florence, had been speedily
changed into a white oxyde at the outer edge of its contact
with the copper, &c. He thinks that, in this cafe, the metals
have a reciprocal action on each other             ; and that this action,
more efficacious and more sensible when the attraction of ag
gregation of the metals is destroyed by fusion, exists no les*
between      solid metals when they touch each other.
     If the  effects, as rapid as those     of lightning,   occasioned on
the tongue        by two metals brought         into  contact, have been
 by some ascribed to a peculiar fluid not galvanic, or to the
 electric fluid, it is because they did not recollect that che
 mical action is exercised between two bodies with the utmost
 rapidity. The signs of electricity which have been sometimes
 observed on separating         two metals in contact, are rather the
 consequences       than    the cause  of that action ; for it is known
 that the greater part of chemical operations change the elec
 tric equilibrium of bodies, and must consequently give birth
 to electrical phenomena.             Without totally excluding elec
 tricity,  therefore,     from  all galvanic facts, C. Fabbroni thinks
 that this fluid has some (hare in the sensation experienced
 by the tongue from two metals in contact. This action of
 metals in contact is proved by the following experiment : —
      C. Fabbroni put into two glasses filled with water, pieces
 of different metals, one in each glass. In other glasses he put
  two pieces of different metals, but kept them from touching
  by interposing a plate of glass.          In a third series of glasses he
  also put two pieces         of different  metals,   but in contact.      In
  the metals     of  the two first series he observed no change, while
  the most oxydable metals          of the third series were covered with
  an oxyde, which considerably           increased in the course   of  a  few
  days,    and the metallic pieces even contracted           a strong     ad
  herence.       The quantity of      the caloric which disengages itself
   in  these   combustions is too small to be measured,              yet the
                                                                        light

  light which     emanates from it may be seen, if the eye itself
  forms a part of the experiment, by holding a piece of silver
  in the mouth, and applying a bit of tin to the ball of the eye.
  After these two metals are made to communicate, you fee a
  feeble but distinct light, which disappears at the end of a
  few seconds, because the eye becomes accustomed to this
  feeble sensation ; but it may be renewed             by drawing     the
  metal over the opake cornea, and then over the transparent.
 The author      ascribes  to a convulsive      sensation that kind of
  flash which    some persons      think they perceive * at the mo
 ment of the contact of these metals, applied one on the
 tongue, and the other under it.
     To make the oxydation of the two metals take place under
 water, the presence of air is also necessary. C. Fabbroni thinks
 that air is useful in this circumstance, to add to the water a
 sufficient quantity of oxygen to be taken up by the metal, as
 silver is added to gold    in order to perform the operation of
 quartation.     If a piece of silver and a piece of tin be put in
 contact in water, inclosed in a flask of flint-glass hermeti
 cally sealed, the tin is oxydated ; but the o.xyde of the lead of
 the flint-glass is decomposed, and the glass becomes black.
 Philosophers, who ascribe these phenomena to electricity,
 bring, as a proof of their opinion, that they take place when
 the metals are connected even by means of a pretty long
chain.      C. Fabbroni    has determined the length       of this chain
 at about 18 or 20 feet. Beyond that distance these pheno
mena are no longer sensible ; while, on the other hand, the
electric fluid is communicated to indefinite distances.
     If the phenomena      of  the experiment      of Sultzer  belonged
really to electricity, they ought to take place with all metals,
 whatever may be the relation of these metals to each other.
C. Fabbroni mentions        a great   number of these combinations
which     produced no effects ; and other combinations, of the
fame metals, which produced sensations ver)' distinct. Thus,
if silver  be placed on the eye, and gold on the tongue, making
them communicate by means of copper, the sensation is al
most nothing; but it becomes very evident if the iron touches
    • The perception is as real as that induced hy drawing the metal over
the cornea ef the eye.  Edit.                                          :

     In   regard to the hydrogen         of  the decomposed          water, the
author thinks that it may also be absorbed by the metal : he
even considers as an hydro-oxyde of tin, the octaedral crystals
which he remarked on the surfaces of the pieces of tin em
ployed in these experiments. — It is clearly seen, fays C. Fab-
 broni, by the results which I obtained from the simple con
 tact of two metals in water, that is to fay, by the oxyde and
 saline crystals,    that a chemical operation takes place, and that
 to it we ought to ascribe the sensations experienced on the
 tongue and by the eye.              It appears to me, then, probable,
 that it is to these new compounds, or their elements, that we
 are indebted      for that mysterious stimulus which produces the
 convulsive     movements of the animal libre in a great part at
 least   of  the galvanic phenomena.
  XI.     On the  Art of Hardening          Copper.      By P. I.     Hjelm f.
  V>»OPPER, in            its pure    and perfect state, is exceedingly
  soft and malleable        : its toughness is then so great, that it is
  exceeded only by gold and iron.              When      copper is hammered
  a long time cold, and still more when rolled, it is found, as
  is well known, somewhat harder than before, but it does not
  thereby acquire that strength which deserves the name of
  hardening, or which enables it to make sufficient resistance to
  strong impressions.           By being brought to a bright-red heat
  in the fire, and suddenly quenched in water, copper obtains
  no perceptible addition to its hardness ; but, on the contrary,
  becomes more pliable, and consequently softer than before.
   If the copper is kept a long time in fusion, or often fused in
   a strong heat,     without any covering of flux or charcoal pow
   der, it    becomes      brittle and unmalleable, and consequently
      * This is no conclusive argument                the effect
                                              against              being electrical :
   it is taking for granted that the laws and properties of        the electric  fluid
   have all been ascertained.     Edi r.

   harder : but these properties are soon lost when the copper Ii-
  melted in contact with carbonaceous matter. If melted cop
  per be poured into water, as is done        in the operation of gra
  nulating or corning,     it does not appear that it acquires any
  perceptible   degree  of hardness,   or such as can be compared
  to that which is communicated to steel by the fame means.
      Considering all these circumstances, which have been con
  firmed by experience, it could not but excite attention to
  find, by the most undoubted testimony, that the ancients
  actually possessed the art of hardening copper, which they
 employed      for instruments of all kinds ; such as daggers,
 swords, bows, fliields, javelins, &c.          Though ancient au
  thors often mention these weapons, none of them have given
 us any account of the method of hardening the copper.            This
 deficiency some have attempted to supply by conjectures,
 which have given rife to a variety of experiments, but not
 one of them was ever attended with success.                As it was
 imagined     that   in hardening copper     it would  be necessary to
 follow the fame process as that employed for steelifyihg.
 iron,  most   of their researches   have been directed    to a similar
 method ; and for that purpose they have not only prescribed,
 for the hardening of copper, such processes as are employed for
 hardening iron when it is to be converted into steel, but even
 the most absurd methods founded upon these processes. These
researches,    however, instead of answering the intended pur
pose,   only   tend to shew the ignorance of those who think
they find in the greatest absurdity the most important secrets,
and to involve us in still greater darkness.
     The art of hardening copper         has therefore   of late  been
considered    as one of those known     to the ancients,  which   were
afterwards    lost ; and it would no doubt have still remained       in
that state, had not several of these monuments of our ances
tors been brought to light by some fortunate accidents, and
the respect for their great antiquity been overcome by a desire
for becoming acquainted with their composition.                 When
this method, the only certain and decisive one, was once
chosen, it was no great difficulty to discover that the whole
art did not depend on any process like that employed in re
gard to iron, but on the addition of % certain quantity of
                      7                                          some

some other metal                 melted     with the copper,            by which it was
rendered harder than before.
     The      abbe Mongez               first wrote   a treatise on the metallic
composition of the ancient bells, which he transmitted to the
Academy of Inscriptions.    He found that this composition
was in general            nearly the fame as that still used for bell-me
tal, that         is,   copper and tin.  M. Mongez afterwards trans
mitted to         M.     Dize the point of an ancient copper dagger,
the appearance               of which      on the fracture sufficiently shewed
that     it   had been fused and cast.                When       dissolved in pure     ni
trous acid, there remained    white powder, found to contain
                                            a
tin, and that which had been dissolved was merely copper.
It evidently appeared, therefore, that the supposed art of the
ancients for hardening copper, was nothing else than fusing
itwith    certain quantity of tin.
              a                    This was still farther con
firmed when              M. Dize found           the fame component parts               in
some  Greek, Roman, and Gallic coins, which he obtained
on the fame occasion for the purpose of examination. The
tin in them formed about twenty-sour parts in                              a   hundred of
the mixture.
     In   support       of this opinion,        respecting the art         of hardening
copper among the ancients,                   I   have the honour           of laying be
 fore the Academy some experiments lately made on this sub
ject. — Last summer, Professor A.  Retzius, of Lund, trans
                                                      I.
 mitted to me    part of the blade of
                             a            two-edged dagger,     a
which, together with some stone-cutters' chissels, were found
in hill of earth on the low lands of Scandinavia, where
     a
whole swords of ancient workmanship have often been found.
This fragment, on the outside, had rather yellowisli appear       a
ance like brass, than the red colour of copper; the edge waa
exceedingly thick, and roundish    the fracture seemed also
                                                      ;

cast.  When tried    the file,  was not quite

gun-metal.              The newly-filed          surface
                                              reddish-yellow   had    a

not in the   least attracted by the magnet, which clearlv proved
that there was no iron in the composition.          It exhibited as
little traces of any other metals, as far as could be judged
from the ascending vapour.        In order to ascertain with what
metal        the      copper            had    been       mixed,    twenty-five       assayer'g

diluted with distilled water; and a few- of the filings were
thrown into it : when the first quantity was dissolved, a few
more were added, and this was continued till the whole quan
tity was put in. The solution was made to boil for a quarter
of an hour, and then diluted with a little more distilled wa

dily   fall to the bottom.                    After this       was done,   the bright blue-
coloured solution, which                        was found lo contain nothing but
copper, was carefully poured out, and distilled water was
poured over the white powder, which was washed several
times in the famejnanner, after it had each time remained
at rest long enough tst allow it to fettle, when it was thrown
upon filtering paper to be farther washed. This white pow
der, when dry, weighed $\ assayer's pounds, which gave 214
pounds of tin calx in the whole hundred.                                      Now, tin calx
loses, by being revived, ~, or 25 per cent, of its weight; and
therefore this 21! pounds of tin calx must have given 16^
pounds of metallic tin in the hundred, which, in an experi
ment made for the purpose, was found to be nearly the cafe,
and the regulus obtained was found to be pure. The metallic
compound of the before-mentioned dagger blade was made
therefore of 83 J. copper, and 16 j tin; or, to reckon without
fractions, of 84 parts of copper, and 16 parts of tin.

appearance            of the fragment of the dagsrer.                      Where      the edge

   What has been here said may perhaps be sufficient to con
firm the opinion respecting the art employed the ancients                       by
to harden copper, and may furnish some hints for the em
ployment of such compounds in common life.         Besides, we
are hereby enabled to appreciate the different opinions enter
tained on this subject.                     M. Monnet imagined that                       the cop
per     in ancient           times was mixed with arsenic,                   which rendered
it   hard.        No         real objection can be made                  to this being pos
sible ;but as long as no ancient implements made of this
mixture are found, the above assertion may at any rate be
doubted,  without mentioning other circumstances which
seem directly to oppose it.
   M. Dize mentions the addition of iron to copper, as the
                     *
means of rendering the latter harder    and endeavours to          ;
prove that Geossroy the younger, who first drew this con
clusion, (from an experiment he made, where copper, mixed
with sixteen parts of iron in the hundred, was found to
be equally hard, to have the fame grain on the fracture, and
to be as sit for making cutting                        instruments         as    the hardened
copper       of   the ancients,)             was      too precipitate in forming                  his

opinion.  The question, however, assumes a different appear^
ance, when we take into consideration the experiment as re
lated by Count Caylus,  in his work on the Egyptian, Etrus
can, Greek and Roman antiquities * : for it there appears that
M. Geossroy undertook the above-mentioned experiment by
the desire of Count Caylus, who describes various kinds of
arrows and javelins of ancient workmanship, which, though
they had the appearance of copper, were mixed with iron ;
because filings of them were   attracted by the magnet ; be
cause the  fracture had a different appearance from that of
other instruments made of the hardened .copper of the an
cients mixed with tin, and              was at the fame time less fusible.
M.    Geoffroy thinks it rather remarkable that mankind should
so early have fallen on the method os uniting copper with iron
in   an uniform mixture,         which      even at present is considered
as a difficult process.       It    is well known that the most com
mon copper ore consists of copper and iron mineralised with
sulphur, and which is called pyrites of copper; not that the
copper makes the greater part of               it,
                                      but because the copper
is of the greatest value, though the iron seems most generally
to constitute the principal component parts.    When this ore
   smelted, the first copper obtained, or the      called black
                                                               by so

or raw copper,     is
                    necessarily rendered impure      greater or        a
less quantity of iron, according as more or less care has been
employed    to separate     it during the operation.           It
                                                           therefore   is
in our power,   it   is   said, not only to obtain copper combined
in this manner with         as   much iron      as may be necessary,             but
also to cast all kinds      of instruments of        it,   and afterwards         to
hammer them cold, or to expose them to the same process of
hardening as they were of pure steel. Some assert that this
               if
method has been attended                 with complete      success.           Count
Caylus tried also to harden pure copper     melting   by
                                                     but, in               ;

may at least express a wish             that some person would make,
of   copper     mixed in this manner with iron, different in
struments,      and then endeavour to (hew real antique works
made    of   the fame mixture,          in order that they may be com
pared.      Until this     be accomplislied,       it will be best to adhere
to that process which             seems to have been chiefly followed,
and   of which indubitable proofs are still in existence.
   The history of the antiquity and use of metals in the period
to which this question properly alludes, is involved in so great
darkness,     that nothing decisive on the present subject can be
derived from it.          This much,       however,     is certain, that the
works of ancient authors still extant                 speak  of gold,    silver,
copper,     iron,     tin,   and lead,     as known      at the   fame    time,
and employed for various purposes.                  In regard to copper in
particular, it is found more abundantly in a native state
than any other metal, and                 requires    nothing farther than
smelting to be immediately used.                In   process of time man
kind would become acquainted with the art of extracting th*
metal from other ores of copper ; not, however, without
greater labour, and therefore at first none but rich ore could
be used ; and we may with justice conclude, that copper was
one   of the first metals worked.
   Tin    is not found in a native state, but its ore is abundant
in certain     places, and is easily revived, or brought to the me
tallic state, especially when people are acquainted with the
process of smelting other metals. The antiquity of tin, there
fore,  is as well established as that          of the other metals among
which it is named.             In  the time   of  the Tyrians     a consider
able trade was carried on in this metal, which                 they brought
from the Cafliterides islands, beyond the pillars of Hercules,
under which name England is no doubt meant.
   Whether        the art    of mixing      these two metals together by
fusion   was     first found out by accident, or by experiments
made for the purpose,            it is not to be doubted that       cast works
of  such a composition are mentioned at the same period with
the simple metals.            Besides, the works in bronze of the an
cients are a sufficient proof of their skill in combining me
tals,   of their      art "of modelling after Mature,            and   of their

 readiness in casting.   AH their   instruments   and edged toots
 of this kind hitherto found have been cast, and not ham
 mered ; and of this kind, without doubt, were the instru
 ments mentioned by Professor Pallas as having been found
 near the Tfchudi mines. All of them, except a few, con-
 fisted of a composition of  copper and tin.
     The art of preparing    and  separating  iron may have been
 discovered as early as that of preparing other metals. As this
 art, however, requires a greater degree of dexterity, it was
 doubtless less common at first, and must have been diffused
 more slowly.      This must have been the cafe much more
 with the art of preparing steel, which naturally would be
much later than that of preparing iron, and melting tin and
 copper.    The method of preparing steel may have been ge
nerally known in one country before it was communicated
 to another, where copper, hardened in the above manner,
 may have been used in its stead. The Japanese still use mir-
fors of white copper, which consists of a mixture of that me
tal and tin. The metal of the Chinese gongs consists of cop
per, mixed with 18 parts in a hundred of tin, and probably
a little nickel ;  and these instruments are at the fame time
subjected    to strong hammering     when cold.      The Chinese
form their ill-shaped razors of iron (not hammered) filed to
an edge, and which cut so badly, that, after every stroke on
the beard, they must be drawn over a file.           Many tribes
who have been discovered in modern times, and who are
unacquainted with the use of metals, employ hard kinds of
stones for making knives, hammers, arrow-heads, axes, &c.
Industry always supplies itself with its necessaries, and em
ploys for that purpose such materials as can be obtained,
without taking into account the degree of labour which the
preparation of them may require.

                                      the year 1783,             a
up in the neighbourhood of Iceland, excited no little atten
tion.  According to the account of the sea-captain, who first
saw     exactly at the time when
          it,                         first arose, smoke and       it
flame seemed to                  rise     from the        sea,     but no land or island         was-
to be seen.                It   needs excite            no wonder,       therefore,       that    the
observer         was         thrown           into the greatest consternation,               as he
fays himself, when he beheld                               the sea on fire    !      He   and the
whole crew therefore concluded                                  that the end of the world
had arrived, and they all began to prepare themselves for
the awful moment but, as they heard no trumpet, and as

flames          arose from Hecla,                  the well-known           volcano os that

 turning, in order to convey intelligence of this event to
 Denmark ; but very luckily they soon after discovered the
 coastof Iceland.
    The place where this volcanic eruption                 was seen, lies     only
 7 J- nautical miles, fifteen to a degree, from the south-west
 extremity of Iceland.      Hitherto they had seen no land, but
 recognising Iceland, the ship reached the place of destina
 tion, and completed her voyage.       Other ships, which arrived
 later, saw a small island from which the eruption had arisen;
 but it always exhibited, as might naturally be expected, a
 different appearance.    The fame year smoke and flames were
 seen    to arise from the nearest part             of   the opposite   coast   of
 Iceland.
    As     there have been many instances             of such eruptions from
the sea producing islands, this event                 attracted the notice of
government, and the year following orders were given to the
(hips bound to Iceland to examine the new island ; but it
 had entirely disappeared,            so that    no traces of it were to be
found.       Towards            of the year, however, an
                             the conclusion
unfortunate accident happened, which, without doubt, was
occasioned by sunken rocks forming a part of the island
which had disappeared.
   A Danish sliip of war of 64 guns, called the Infb'dsreiten,
was expected from the East Indies, and intelligence had al
ready been received that slie had failed from the Cape of
Good Hope; but after that period no farther account was
heardof her till the year 1785, when some vessels returning
from Iceland reported, that some fragments of this sliip, to
gether with the long-boat, had been driven ashore on the
coast    of that island.According to every account, and by
comparing the different  circumstances, it appears to me cer
tain that the above (hip was wrecked on these rocks, then no
longer visible above the surface of the sea.  It is impoflible
that such a large boat could have been conveyed from a sliip
without the hands of men, unless the sliip had been daslied
lo pieces.  This boat was not only driven to land entire,
and in good condition, though without any person in        but          it,
there was found in      box silled with wax candles.
                             it   a                    At the

28a                 On  the Volcanic Ijland thrown up
found various pieces of the fame stiip, which could be easily
known by some distinguishing marks.               These parts, of dif
ferent forms and sizes, would not have been thrown on sliorft
so    near    each   other  if  the  misfortune    had   happened     at a
greater distance;       the billows,   currents,  8cc. would certainly
have driven them on shore at places more remote              from each
other.       Besides,  these fragments were      driven on shore by a
wind which blew in a direction from these rocks, and no
 thing else of this misfortune had been perceived on the coast.
     From all these circumstances I conclude that this vessel
 had experienced       a very bad    vovage   home from the Cape of
 Good Hope, for that yeas easterly winds were exceedingly
 prevalent in the northern seas.            A great many mips, and
 particularly men of war, preferred going round Great Bri
 tain to the passage through the Channel.            It is probable that
 the ship in question may have been in want os some necessary,
 such perhaps as fresti water.         The captain, besides, was well
 acquainted in Iceland, where I myself was with him, some
 years ago, as lieutenant on board a stiip which he then com
  manded, and on this account he probably intended to run into
  some of its harbours, but unfortunately struck on the sunken
  rocks, the remains of the volcanic island.            In this distressed
  situation the crew, no doubt, had recourse to the only pro
  bable means left for saving their lives by hoisting out their
  long-boat, and while employed in this labour the stiip, it is
  likely, went to pieces, and the people were lost, as none of
  them were ever seen or heard of.
      During my expedition          to  Iceland   in the year    1786,     I
   made    it my business to make iome researches in regard to
   this volcanic island, though at that time no suspicion was
   entertained     that the above ship had been wrecked in this
   place  ; for this conjecture was only          a consequence drawn
   from my researches.
      When I arrived in Iceland, where, on account of the bu
   siness entrusted    to my charge, as well as on account of the
   observations which I was obliged to make for the improve
   ment of charts, I found it necessary to remain some time
   with my stiip in Holmens-hafcn,           and had at my disposal a
   small vessel which was lying there, I ordered Lieutenant,
                                                                       now

 now Captain Grove, to cruise about with this small vessel in
  the neighbourhood of the place where the volcanic island had
 been seen.      He    remained        there    some     day*,  and though he
 often   sounded     with a line of more than a hundred fathoms,
 found no bottom,         so that he lost all hope of making any dis
 covery ; but, just when he was about to return, he observed,
 contrary to all expectation, that the waves broke over some
 rocks lying exactly level with the surface of the water. As
 he now entertained no doubt that he had found what he had
 been sent in quest of, he took the bearings and distances from
 the nearest part     of  the coast     of Iceland,     and transmitted    to me
 an account     of his   observations.
     When     the business     of   the    expedition was ended, and I
 was about to return         at the end of the summer, I resolved to
 visit this interesting point myself,               arid to ascertain   its rcr.l
 position   by actual observation.            I   took mv departure,      there
 fore, from some small islands, or rocks, which lie before Cape
 Reikianiis, the south-west extremity of Iceland, and the out
 ermost   of which is called the Grenadier's Cap, distant si
 miles south-west      from the Cape. As the weather was exceed
ingly favourable,       I was so fortunate as to obtain its latitude
 by the meridian altitude of the fun, and its longitude by a
timekeeper.       Though the timekeepers which I carried with
me were not of the          best  kind,     as  I  had quitted .the fame day
one    of  the ports     of Iceland,       where      I observed their rate    of
going, their relative errors could not be of great importance.
I determined, therefore, the position of the rock called the
Grenadier's Cap at 630 43' 40" north latitude, and 25°
35  '40"   west longitude        from the meridian of Paris.                This
agreed pretty      nearly with the observations of Verdun de la
Crenne, Borda, and Pingre ; especially as I have good rea
                                       *
son to believe, that, from a want of sufficient knowledge of
the coast    of this country,        they placed Cape Reikianos three
minutes too far north, as they make the latitude lo be 630
55'.    As I found also, by the most accurate observations that
could be made at       sea,   that these dangerous          rocks lie 47° in    a
direction    south-west      from the true meridian, and just four

¦milesfrom the before-mentioned Grenadier's Cap, the posi
tions of these rocks will be 63° 3a' 45 "north latitude, and
30° a' 50" west longitude frcm the meridian of Paris.
   As I now proceeded to get a fight of these rocks, Captain
Grove, who was on board my ship, concluded, from his
former observations, that we could be at no great distance
from them, having now quite lost fight of the Icelandic
coast; and the before-mentioned rocks, which lie to the
south-west from   Iceland, though the weather was clear,
being now scarcely discernible.  My companion, therefore,
asked whether it was prudent to advance so straight upon it.
While         we were talking on this subject the people called out,
and immediately every eye was directed                                    to the spot,    where
we saw before  us the waves breaking over a rock.    We im
mediately put about stiip, and heaved the lead, which was
in readiness, and found the depth twenty-six, and soon after
forty fathoms, but a little farther no ground was to be found
with      a   line of    a    hundred fathoms.                     Some tallow had been
put into the bottom of the lead, as usual, to enable us to de
termine the nature of the bottom by the substances which
adhered to it.               By   these means we obtained small fragments
of stone which were entirely                           lava,    or of      a   volcanic nature.
The rock is not large, and the                         water around it is exceedingly
deep.         Its height is exactly equal to that of the surface of the
sea,      or rather a little lower  ; and for that reason it cannot he
seen      till   one    approaches        very near to              it,   or when the waves
break over it.
      The origin of          the volcanjc island,                  which       was seen in this
place in the year 1783, explain in the following manner: —

The rock which now remains formed the crater, which at
 that period threw up flames and smoke.   The large quantity
 of lava which  issued from                  it,
                               being accumulated on the bot
 tom of the sea around the crater, may at length have been
 raised above the surface               of   the sea, and even to                a   considerable
 height.         But    as             part of the ocean where

that of water,            was cast on stiore in Iceland, and found float
ing on the       sea by       mariners.
    Had    the eruption taken                 place       in   a   calmer   sea,   and the
depth around it been less abrupt, the thrown up mass would
have consolidated itself by its own weight, and would have in
time become an island; of which we have had instances in
the Archipelago,                 in the East Indies, and different                 parts       of
the ocean.           Had it         taken place on the continent,                  or in an
island, it would have formed a mountain.    It is not necef-                                           -
sary that  a volcano should always arise from  a mountain:
volcanoes  have been seen to burst forth in plains ; but the
invariable consequence    that the volcanic matter, by being
                                        is,
accumulated, and, as    were, piled up, forms

Now, as the violence of the waves may have easily washed
away the loose matter accumulated round the crater, there                                         is
no absurdity in supposing, that, as the billows rolled over the
mouth of the crater, the fire was at length overcome        the                         by
water, and the volcano extinguished.
    The    crater,         consisting      of rock,       has remained.            It   is   well
ascertained        that     a     rock existed       in   this place before the erup
tion;     and    it   is   confirmed,         by   late observations,       that    it   exists
still.     An    obscure notion prevailed                  among the seamen                  who
frequented           Iceland,        that there
                                            was    blind rock* in this
                                                               a
 neighbourhood called             Fugle-Skior (Bird's rock). This name
I   have retained           in my charts, though the existence of                            it   is
 denied     by
          many seamen, because they pasted without seeing it.
 But, under such circumstances, the testimony of one who
 has seen      of more weight than
              it     is               hundred who deny its     a
 existence       because          they did not see it.              This confirms        me       in
 the     opinion that the crater                   had    existed     long before        in   the
 fame state.
    To concludcj      may not be superfluous to remark, in
                              it
 order to strengthen this opinion, that, nearly in the famt                                    di
 rection from the south-west extremity of Iceland, as already
 mentioned, there are five small islands or rocks, the outer-

    go to, or come from, the west fide of Iceland, commonly
   pass through them, when they first get fight of the land
   and rocks.       By    the   Danish seamen they are called Pugle^

   fowl ; but by the inhabitants they are called Eld Eyarncy
    (sire islands.)     May not this afford reason to conjecture that
   in former times they had volcanic eruptions ? and the vol
   cano which        appeared     in   the  year 1783 may probably have
   existed long before.

  of red-hot coal, exhibited all the effects of gunpowder. As
  he made the experiment only once, he thought it of import

 it might be repeated.

 rested two days,         he distilled   this mixture.      He then  poured

 retort, and filtered the whole.             The oxalic acid crystallising
 on the filtre, he put the whole again into the retort, and
added a pretty large quantity of water, which had served to
wash the filtre.        He distilled off     a part os the water;     but as
the residuum        did not crystallise,       returned, by elevating the
receiver, what had passed over j and, after repeating this ope
ration several times, obtained for residuum an acid liquor of
the weight     of   the silk employed, and which contained small
granulated     crystals.
     This liquor    fiiewed no traces       of  the   oxalic acid.   It was
yellowish, and communicated that colour to the fingers and

                    saturated
centrated it, he added alcohol, which took up a matter of a
gummy appearance.      The alcohol, diluted with water, being
evaporated,  there remained   a yellow substance mixed with
solutions of the nitrat and muriat of lime.                              These salts were
decomposed by carbonat of pol-afti, and the liquor, separated
from the carbonat of lime, was subjected to evaporation. It
gave golden-coloured crystals, which had the fineness of silk;
and detonated like gunpowder, producing a black smoke.
These crystals are soluble in water and alcohol, and crystallise
on cooling. They are deprived of their colour by the oxygen
ated muriatic acid. The sulphuric acid disengages from them
 the odour          of   the nitric acid. The muriatic acid precipitates,
 from    a solution        of them, small micaceous, whitish, volatile crys
 tals, which in the fire exhale a bitter and inflammable smoke.
    Thisgoldcn-yellow coloured detonating and cry stallisablesub-
 stance is by the author called amer (bitter) ; its crystals appear
 to be octaedral.  As animal substances become yellow by the
 contact of the nitric acid, C. Welter endeavoured to extract
 amer from raw beef; but he found it combined with another
 substance,          which,       like   it,   could not be altered           by   the nitric
 acid.         This combination,               soluble   in   the concentrated           nitric
 acid,  separated from
           is                             by

 powder, which does not lose its colour   exposure to the air, by
 and which might perhaps be useful in painting.
   What made C. Welter presume that this powder         com                         is
 posed of amer and another substance,    that he obtained the is,
  latter       by
             treating sponge with the nitric acid.      colour-              It    is

   XV.   Reflections    on the     Quality    of Earthen-Wart, and tit
      Results of    the Analysis of some Earths and common Kindi
     ef EartbetnWdre.           By C. VxuauELiN *.
   Jt OUR things may             occasion   the difference     in  the  quali
  ties  of earthen-ware       :  ist, the nature or composition of the
  matter : 2d, the mode of preparation ; 3d, the dimensions
  given to the vessels; 4th, the baking to which they are sub
 jected.     By composition of          the   matter,    the author under
  stands the nature and proportions           of  the elements    of which it
  is formed.      These elements, in the greater part of earthen^
  ware, either valuable or common, are filex, argil, lime, and
  sometimes a little oxyd of iron.            Hence it is evident that it
  is not so much by the diversity of the elements that good
  earthen-ware differs from bad, as by the proportion in which
 they are united. Silex or quartz makes always two-thirds at
 least of earthen-ware ; argil or pure clay from a fifth to a
 third; lime from       5 to 20 parts in the hundred; and iron from
 o to J   2 or  15    parts in the hundred.            Silex gives hardness,
 infusibility, and unalterability ; argil makes the paste pliable,
 and renders it sit to be kneaded, moulded, and turned at
 pleasure.     It  possesses ^t the fame      time the property of being
 partially fused by the         heat which unites its parts with those
 of   the filex ; but it must not be too abundant, as                it would
 render the earthen-ware too fusible and too brittle to be used
 over the fire.
     Hitherto    it has not been proved by experience that lime
 is necessary in the composition of pottery : and if traces of
 it are constantly found in that substance, it is because it is
 always mixed with the other earths, from which the washings
 and    other manipulations have not been able to separate it.
When this earth, however, does not exceed five or fix parts
in a hundred, it appears that it is not hurtful to the quality
of the pottery ; but if more abundant, it renders it too fu-
fible.

 baking, to the          vessels      in which it forms       a   part,    has the pro
perty of rendering them fusible, and even in                         a greater degree
 than lime.
     As    some kinds          of pottery        are destined to melt very pene
trating      substances,        such as salts, metallic oxyds, glass,                &c»
they require        kind of paste, which is obtained only by
                   a sine
reducing       the       earths
                        employed   to very minute particles.
Others destined for melting metals, and substances not very
penetrating, and which must be able to support, without
breaking, a sudden transition from great heat to great cold^
require for their fabrication a mixture of calcined argil with
raw argil.   By these means you obtain pottery, the coarse
paste of which   resembles breebe, or small-grained pudding-
stone,      and which          can     endure      sudden   changes        of   tempera
ture.
   The baking of pottery is also an object of great importance.
The heat must be capable of expelling humidity, and agglu
tinating the parts which enter into the composition of the
paste, but not strong enough to produce fusion ; which, if to©
far advanced, gives to pottery                   a homogeneoulness         that renders
it brittle.       The                    in regard to the fine
                          fame effect takes place
pottery, because the very minute division given to the earths
reduces them nearly to the fame state as if this matter had
been fused.        This         the reason why porcelain strongly baked
                              is-
is   more or      less    brittle, and cannot easily endure alternations
of temperature.            Hence coarse porcelain, in the composition
of which certain quantity of calcined argil
              a                                       employed,           is
porcelain retorts, crucibles, tubes, and common pottery, the
paste of which     coarse, are much less brittle than dishes and
                         is
saucers formed           of   the fame       substance,     ground with more         la
bour.
     The  general and respective dimensions of the different parts
of   vessels of earthen-ware have also considerable      influence
en their capability to stand the fire.
     In   some cafes the glazing or covering, especially                        when too
thick, and of   nature different from the body of the pottery,
                   a
also renders them liable to break.      Thus, in making some
kinds of pottery,       always  essential, ist, to follow the best
                              it

   A  REMARKABLE CURE OF AN ULCER OF THE LEG.
Mi
iVlR. RODERICK M'KENNON,                             aged 67, went in the
year 1758 as Assistant Apothecary to St. George's Hospita',
where he had his warning, board and lodging sound him,
with    a suitable salary.       In June 1795, whilst in this employ,
he went to fee        Dr. M'Nab, who then resided in Great Suffolk-
street   ;   and as he was at the door, a bitch in the house, who
had puppies,         furiously flew at him, and seized him near th«
calf of     the leg, making a deep lacerated wound. The wound
soon after became dreadfully inflamed, poultices were applied,
and it was near          a fortnight    before he made his cafe known
to the surgeons        of  the hospital.    He   was now confined to his
room, and         these most experienced and eminent practitioners
continued their humane attentions to him above a twelve
month, trying a variety of different applications, until, find
ing his cafe baffle all their endeavours, he was dismissed his
employ, and left the hospital as incurable.                   Added to this
dreadful and unforeseen affliction, he had an asthma, which
had. existed on him above ten years, and was obliged fre
quently to       sit up the greatest part     of the night with the win
dows wide open to procure breath.                 lie  was now in the vale
of   years,     and    with   a  gloomy prospect       before  him  ; for no
salary       was allowed this almost superannuated             servant  of  a
public charity,         to which    he had    been attached     above thirty
years     ;  and he had     a  wife and daughter to provide for. After
quitting the hospital,          Mr. Carpue, a surgeon no less distin
guished for zeal than abilities, for some months attended him ;
but finding all his endeayours ineffectual, he reluctantly took
 his leave of him as incurable. Such was the deplorable state
 of this unfortunate sufferer, when Mr. Carpue recommended
 him for the trial of the oxygen air, using these very express

                               York- Hospital,
          DEAR SIR,
    I  have    seen    Mr. M'Kennon,          and have examined his leg,
 and think the cure you          have    wrought on it is indeed very
 astonishing. When he first came under my care, he laboured
 under an immense ulceration, extending from the external
 ancle of the right leg, which reached             as   high    as the junction
 of  the tendons       of  the gastroenemii     and solæus muscles.           At
 this period the tendons of the peronæal muscles had fluffed,
 and in consequence I applied charcoal, which produced very
 considerable     good    ;  but upon mentioning this to a friend,
 who knew the           cafe well   *, he said, " It was immaterial
 what remedy I used, for it was a cafe in which he was
 certain nothing would prove effectual."                 After this I applied
 the diluted nitrous acid, and seemingly with advantage;                     but
 being obliged to go into the country,                  I  left him under the
 care of another surgeon ; and when                   I   saw    him, after an
 absence   of   six    weeks,  I found      the fore in a very unfavour
 able condition      ;  and for four months       I used different applica
 tions, but to no purpose, and I conceived the case now to
 be perfectly incurable, and as such mentioned it to you:
 when I had the pleasure of meeting you at Mr. Ileavifide's ;
 and I then proposed him to you for the trial of the oxvgen
 air, as his cafe, if successful,, would prove most decidedly
 jts efficacy; for, in the multitude of fore legs                    I have at-

 that quantity of atmospheric air. The ulcer discharged pro
 perly, but seemed to heal very slowly : in consequence I gave
 him a double dose, and after a fortnight it produced very
 feverish symptoms,       when he took by your order some pur
 gatives,   and then he resumed       his usual dose of superoxyge-
 nated air daily,    until the ulcer, diminishing by degrees, was
 at last completely healed, there being no discharge, the whole
 cicatrising, and the new-sormed surface looking extremely
 healthy.     During this period no particular application or
 dressings were made use       of by me, nor any medicine directed
 by you,    but  what   before  he said he had taken gallons of; so
 that I attribute his extraordinary cure entirely to the efficacy
 of  the oxygen air.     Happy in being able to give my testimony
 Jo  so remarkable    a  cafe, I have the honour to be, dear Sir,
                    With    the profoundest   respect,

                 REMARKS        BY DR. THORNTON.
     As Mr. M'Kennon took bark, some of the Faculty may
 not be willing to give to the oxygen air the merit in this
 cure ; I will therefore endeavour to state shortly my reasons
 for attributing every thing to this new remedy.
                                                                  I. The

394            Eleventh Communication from                   Dr. Thornton.
    I.   The operation of bark               had been before tried ; he had-
taken, he said, gall&ns of it.
   3. When I first saw him, the fore, and muscles surround
ing      it,
        were wholly insensible; he did not feel       needle                       a
piercing them, nor could he perceive even the corrosive ope
ration of caustic.
  3. After inhaling the vital air but                       a    few days,        sensibility
was restored, as both Mr. M'Kennon                           and      Mr. Carpue wit
nessed.
    4. Having cleansed the wound,       would remain dry but
                                                      it                               ;
even whHst inhaling   the vital air, the whole surface was im
mediately covered with               a   sine dew, as        Dr. Monro            and other*
witnessed.
    5.   To        shew the progress         of amendment whilst inhaling
the superoxygenated               air,
                                     I    am happy to be able to lay before
the philosophic world the following testimony of an impartial
observer, Dr. Douglas of Baliol-College,  Oxford:
   " Towards the middle of March 1798, first saw Mr.                  I
M'Kennon.     He had then      large and very foul ulcer, ex
                                             a
tending some inches above the right ancle.                              From that time
to the         present    (April 30)     I   have repeatedly             seen      him, and
each     time could not possibly         fail    to   bejenjible       of   a   mo/1 manifest
improvement.
                      '
                          At   present the ulcer    diminished at full one-
                                                       is                         I
half in Jize since Ifrjlfaiv              him; the edges have fine healthy   a                   v.
appearance,           and      its general   surface        is   astonishingly altered
for the better."
   6. W hen the oxygen air was left off, the fore remained
stationary, and visibly improved when he again refunded it.
    7. My strongest argument, however,    the success in this    is
and in other cafes equally desperate.
    Mr. Munt          had been before cured             of   a   sore leg        of eighteen
years standing.
    Mr. Atwood was cured of fore             a         leg      of two       years.    When
I   askedMr. Cruikshank whether                        it    was      true      he had con
demned          the leg   ?    he answered,     with his usual emphasis, "                 I
not only condemned his leg,                   but his life for he was of
                                                                 ;                          so
washy     constitution that he could not have lost the one
               a
without the other."
    Next the cure of Patterson.                   When       I       sent     him to shew
                                8                                                          his

                Eleventh Communication from                  Dr. Thornton.              295
    his leg to Mr. Cruikshank, which still possesses the marks of
    numerous ulcers, seeing varicose veins, this experienced sur
   geon said :
                      " Tell Dr. Thornton that he is mistaken if he
    supposes he has made a permanent cure ; for varicose ulcers
    were never         cured      without an operation, which,             if  he wislies,
    I   will perform."            The man, frightened at first, and then               asto
                                ' Sir, I have been cured
    nished, replied          :                                   perfectly now         these
    three years.' —         "   That alters the cafe,"          answers      this distin
    guished anatomist;
                                   " then     tell   Dr. Thornton      that he has per
    formed     a most    wonderful cure."            — Patterson  still continues well ;
    nor does there        seem     the smallest cause to suspect a relapse.
         The      Sure      of Mr. Wilkinson *, who had                       a  sore     kg
     twelve     years,      is not less extraordinary.           In this      cafe   I   ob
     served a peculiar phenomenon,                    alone  explicable by the ope
     ration of the oxygen air.                The fingers of both hands            at their
     ends looked very red, as red as raw meat,                     were swollen, and
     felt very painful.            The same was mentioned to me in private
      conversation       by    Dr.   Beddoes in a patient of his, who, finding
      an asthma       relieved by a small dose of vital air, took as much
-     as he could at one time, produced                  a fever, and    this fame phe
      nomenon        I  have just mentioned above.
         This    leads me to repeat an observation                I  have before often
      exprested,      that oxygen air promises to be an useful remedy
      in  sore legs ;      for why have we not sore arms ? The nearness
      of this     part    to the      heart     seems to be the only philosophic
      reason   ;   and therefore        a  direct powerful stimulus to the heart,
      as oxygen       air, promises the most certain good, aided by the
      invigorating effects of bark, steel, and other tonic medicines;
      not but that I would advise, where it can be properly done, a*
       in hospitals, trials to be made with the vital air without me
       dicine, to prevent            all cavil    ;  although it is undoubtedly un
       important to the sufferer by what means he is treated, so that
       he is but cured; and, until                  the contrary is proved, I sliall
  '
       ever think,        that medicines, judiciously employed, certainly
       cannot Impede the operation of oxygen, but may ajjijl.
           I now    take       my   leave,   of    the philosophic world,         not from
       dearth of materials, for             I   have cures     by me yet more im-

  _L  HE   Electoral    Academy       of Sciences    at Manheim hag
proposed    the following     question   as the subject  of a prize for
the year 1801 : —
    " Are the azotic (Jlick) gases, which are produced from so
many totally dissimilar substances, and in ways so different,
exactly the fame in all their chemical properties             and bases
(simple azotic gases,) with that of the atmosphere          ?  and has
the nitrous acid the fame azote for its acidifying base,          as the
atmospheric azotic gas ?
    " The partizans of       the   antiphlogistic   doctrine seem to
admit both, but without          satisfactory   proof.   1, Since,    for
want of sufficiently      accurate     examination, they admit in
each of these gases all the known properties of azotic gasr
because they destroy animal life, extinguish flame, and ma

(u) whether the electric spark, in its passage through oxy

composition,    and    furnish    the    basis   of  the  nitrous   acid ;
(b) and how, by the fame means, (a red heat, and the elec
tric spark,) the nitrous acid is decomposed into oxygen and
azotic gases, and can be again recomposcd from them ; and,
 (c), since oxygen and azotic gases have lo great an affinity
for each other in the atmosphere, why, when the former is
added in a sufficient quantity, imperfect, nitrous acid is not
immediately produced,       as   is the    cafe when oxygen gas         is
added to the azote      in nitrous    gas, by which perfect nitrous
acid is immediately produced        ?

                            HOLLAND.
    The Dutch Society of      the Sciences at Haerlem           proposed
in 1793, and afterwards in 1796,               the  following question   :
" What light has Lavoisier's system, and his method of exa
mining organic     substances,     furnished towards a more accu-
rate knowledge     of  the  human body?"            But,  as no satisfac
tory answer was received, they have proposed it again in the
following manner : —
    I. As a great number of nrv discoveries have been made
since the question was first proposed, and as the ciivumstances
of it   have thereby    acquired    more exient than to admit of
their being properly comprehended in a single treatise, the
Society have resolved to divide the different objects of it into
three new questions for the present year, and to six the period
of receiving answers at the ist of No' ember 1800.
    1.  What light has the new chemistry thrown on the phy
siology of the human bodv ?
    a. How far has the light, thrown on the physiology of the
human body, contributed to a better knowledge than before
of  the nature and causes of certain diseases; and what useful

consequences,          more or
                            confirmed by experience, can be
                                  less
deduced from it in regard to the practice of medicine ?
  3. How far has the new chemistry contributed to afford an
accurate idea of the mode of action of different internal and
       medicines, which have been long used, or only lately
external
recommended ? And, what advantages can arise from a more
accurate  knowledge of this point in regard to the treatment
of certain diseases ?
  As    some learned men have introduced hypotheses                          built on
too weak a foundation,     in regard to the application of the
principles of  the   new   chemistry to physiology, pathology,
and therapeutics; and .as this is highly prejudicial to the
progress of these sciences, to which the new chemistry, how
ever, promises so much light,                 if,   according to Lavoisier's rule,
we admit nothing in chemistry,                       or the employment of che
mical principles, but what   founded on decisive experiments,
                                        is
the Society requires, that those who are inclined to answer
these questions        will make         an     accurate      distinction    between
what    is   proved,       and what      ismerely hypothetical   and that,
                                                                      ;
in regard to hypotheses,               the candidates will confine them
selves to bare mention of them, and of the few grounds on
             a
which they reft because the principal point which the So
                       ;
ciety willies to obtain          is,   that those who follow the medical
or chirurgical profession               in Holland, and who are not yet
sufficiently acquainted with the progress of the new chemis
try, and its application, on well-founded principles, to phy
siology, pathology and therapeutics, will procure such works
as may be best calculated to inform them what light the new
chemistry has actually thrown on these sciences                       ;     and what
facts are sounded on too weak grounds                     ;   and what have been
too rashly adopted, or are still too doubtful to be depended
on. Each of these papers will be examined separately: those,
therefore, who wish to answer more than one question, must
send   a   paper for each.
  II.      The Society       requires    a    plan, capable      of being     carried
into execution, for rendering productive the large unculti
vated districts of the republic, particularly in Guelderland,
Overyflel,       Dreunthe,      and Dutch Brabant.
                                                                            III.   The

                  Foffil Wood found at      a great Height.              299
     III.    The following prize      questions  are again proposed    : —
     1.  A natural history of         the whale; in order to furnish
  hints    for its being more easily discovered and caught, and
 afterwards       converted   to use.    This   question   to be answered
 before the       1st of November     1802.
     2. What has experience taught in regard to the use of cer
 tain animals which in the Netherlands appear to be hurtful;
 and what means arc to be employed for extirpating them?
 For this question no period is defined.
    3. What indigenous plants, the virtues                 of which have
 been hitherto unknown,           might be employed        in the apothe
 caries stiops in Holland        to supply the place      of foreign medi
 cines?      The virtues of them        must be established,     not by fo
 reign testimony, but by the testimony of natives of the coun
 try. — The time for answering this question is indefinite.
    4. What indigenous plants, not yet employed, might be
 introduced into use as good and cheap food? And, what fo
reign nutritive plants might be cultivated for the fame pur
pose? — No definite time.
        FOSSIL WOOD FOUND AT                  A  GREAT HEIGHT.
    In a paper lately read before the French National Institute,
it appears that C. Villars, Professor of Natural History, of
Grenoble, saw, near a glacier in the department of Here, some
foffil wood buried among turf at the height of 2320 metres
above      the level    of  the  sea, and 850 metres above the most
elevated line at which          wood grows at present.         The moun
tain on which this interesting discovery was made, is that of
Lans, in the canton of Oilans.               The trees found there are,
mountain-afli,        birch, and the common larch.          The roots and
part of the trunks can be           plainly distinguislied. The last of
these trees docs not grow at present in the neighbourhood.               —
The author of this memoir           ascribes the greater degree    of cold,
which now prevails on these mountains,                   to two   principal
causes   :  first, the valleys becoming deeper,       which   has changed
the elevation        of the summits in regard to their bases and the
surrounding countries: the second is the destruction of the
ancient forests, which had gradually extended themselves to
great heights, but which, when once destroyed, cannot grow

up again at the same heights, because the trees are deprived
of that mutual shelter which they afforded to each other.
                NEW THEORY OF RESPIRATION.
    Professor   Hcrholdt   read lately, before the Academy     of Sci
ences at Copenhagen, a memoir respecting            some experiments
made by him and        M. Ram on living animals, in order            to
discover the mechanism        of respiration; having in view, at the
same time, the cure       of wounds in the breast. The professor
shewed that the best authors on surgery have hitherto explained
the mechanism        of respiration in   a manner diametrically op
posite to what it really is     ; so that, by applying their theory
to the cure of wounds in the breast, they have followed a:
method altogether false.        According to his experiments the
lungs have not, as has been maintained, an expansive force
 peculiar to them, but the movement is performed by the
 action of the diaphragm, to which sufficient attention has
 not hitherto been paid.          When there are wounds in the
 breast,   the atmospheric air enters by them on inspiring into
 the cavities   of the thorax, and     issues on expiring.   This  has
 been proved by experiments made on horses, dogs and cats.
    M.   Herholdt and Rafn, in examining the manner in which
 the frog breathes, remarked, that this animal is without a
 diaphragm,      and that its lungs at the fame time have no ex
 pansive force   ; but that  a small membrane, by means of which
 it can (hut its mouth hermetically, discharges        the function of
 the diaphragm ; so that, when it is prevented from shutting
 its mouth by inserting into it a small rod, the animal dies in
 a few minutes, because it is no longer able to breathe. When
 it  is suffered to shut its mouth before      it is entirely dead, or
 when it is only in     a state of asphyxia, it soon recovers.     If a
 frog be deprived     of this membrane, by cutting it entirely off,
  or only in part, so that its mouth can no longer be herme
  tically shut, it expires in a longer or shorter time according
  to the size of the aperture made : on the first view it appears
  verv paradoxical that man, as well as the greater part of ani
  mals, lofts his life by not being able to breathe when his
  mouth and nose arc shut, and that the frog dies because it
  cannot breathe when its mouth is opened.            The explanation
                                                                      of

of tliis phenomenon, however,             is easy when we recollect     that
the   lungs have no expansive force.               In   consequence   of this
new theory, M. Hcrholdt has succeeded in curing very dan
gerous wounds made in the breasts of dogs.
  The above experiments, which were communicated to the
Philomatic Society at Paris, by M. Manthey, were repeated
with success, by the commissioners of that Society, on frogs
and salamanders. Isa gag be put into the mouth of one of these
animals,       so as to prevent      it from (hutting its mouth, it dies at
the end of half an hour.              The respiration is performed as fol
lows   :   — The mouth being absolutely (hut, the frog dilates its
throat, and        air ruflies in by the nostrils ; it afterwards
                   the
contracts its throat, and the air penetrates to the lungs, be
cause, no doubt, there is a small valve in the nostrils which
prevents it from escaping by the same way that it entered ;
for the membrane, which the Danish authors assert they ob
served in the mouth, could not be seen by the commissioners.
 Lizards       and serpents, which have ribs, breathe like other         ani-
 malsj and       a forced     opening of the mouth does not kill them.
                MEDICAL PNEUMATIC INSTITUTION.
      All who wish well         to the interests   of humanity will rejoice
 to learn   that this institution, as useful as novel, is at last so
 far established that there is every reasonable ground to believe
 the objects of it will now receive that ample and fair investi
 gation their importance demands.     The learned, ingenious,
 and meritoriously persevering founder of                it,
                                              has already pub
 lished  Notice
           a             of
                   Observations made at the Institution, which
 contains some highly interesting remarks on the effects of                     a
 gas not before applied to medicine, but which promises, in
 (kilful hands, to be one of the           safest and most     powerful agents
 hitherto discovered.
    Mr. Davy, superintendant of the institution, than whom                      it
 would hardly be possible to find one better qualified for the
 situation, having made some experiments on dcpblogiflieated
 nitrous gas,       so
                  named              by
                             its discoverer Dr. Priestley, which
 proved that its composition, properties, and mode of action,
 had been mistaken              by
                         the latest experimenters, was induced
                      7                                                         ty

   to inhale it.      Dr. Bcddoes       relates   the circumstances     in the
  following words       :
      " The    first inspirations   of    the gas produced     giddiness, ful
  ness  of  the head,      and, in short, feelings resembling those of
  incipient     intoxication,     but unaccompanied by pleasurable
  sensation.      At this next experiment I             was    present.    The
  quantity was larger, and the gas more pure.                  The scene ex
  hibited was the most extraordinary I had ever witnessed, exT
  cept  in the     case  of that epileptic patient, whom I have de-
 scribed [Considerations on Airs, part iv. p. 13.) as agitated, in
 consequence of the respiration of oxvgen gas, with a long suc
 cession of the most violent movements.                  The two spectacles
 differed, indeed, essentially          in one respect.       In the former
 every thing was alarming           :   in the latter, after the first mo
 ments of surprize, it was impossible not to recognize the ex
 pressions of the most ecstatic pleasure.              I find it entirely out
 of my power        to paint the appearances,        such as they exhibited
 themselves to me.           I saw and heard shouting, leaping, run
 ning; and       other gestures, which may be supposed to be exhi
 bited by    a  person who gives full loose to feelings excited by a
 piece   of joyful     and   unlooked-for       news.    As in    the cafe   of
 the epileptic patient, no weariness or depression folUtved ; so,
 in tills cafe, no exbaujlion or languor or unca/y feeling tvik
flace.     The experiment Mr. Davy                 has very frequently re
 peated, and generally         with   the   highest pleasurable sensations;
 and, except under particular circumstances, with considerable
 muscular exertions, which have not in any instance been                  suc
 ceeded by fatigue or sadness."
     A  number of persons afterwards inhaled the fame gas : the
following extracts will convey some idea of the very singular
effects produced by it :
     " Mr. J. W.Tobin         (after the first imperfect trials), when the
air was pure, experienced sometimes sublime emotions, with
mniquil     gestures     ; sometimes       violent muscular action,       with
 sensations     indescribably exquisite ; no subsequent debility —
no exhaustion. — His trials have been very numerous.                        Of
late he has felt only sedate pleasure.              In Mr. Davy     the effect
i»  not diminished,
                                                                         Mrs,

   "   Mrs.   Beddoes    —'Pretty uniform     pleasurable    sensations  —
propensity    to muscular exertion,        could walk much better up
Clifton Hill — has frequently          seemed to be ascending        like a
balloon, a seeling which Mr. Burnet strongly expressed.
   " Mr. James Thomson. Involuntary laughter — thrilling in
his toes and singers — exquisite sensations ot pleasure — a pain
in  the back and knees, occasioned          by fatigue the day before,
recurred a few minutes afterwards. A similar observation we
think   we have made on others          ; and we impute it to the un
doubted     power of the gas to increase the sensibility, or nervous
power, beyond any other agent, and probably in a peculiar
manner.
   " Mr.     Stephen Hammick, Surgeon of the Royal Hospital,
Plymouth.       In  a small dose, yawning and languor. — It should
be observed,      that the first sensation has often been disagree
able, as giddiness     ;  and a few persons,      previously   apprehen
sive, have left off inhaling as soon as they            felt  this. —-Two
larger doses produced a glow, unrestrainable tendency to
muscular action, high spirits, and more vivid ideas.
   " Mr. Robert Southey, for many hours after the experiment,
 imagined that his taste and smell were more acute, and is
certain that he felt unusually strong and cheerful.                In a se
cond experiment, he felt pleasure still superior — and has since
poetically remarked, that he supposes the atmosphere of the
highest of all possible heavens to be composed of this gas.
   "Robert Kingleake, M.D. Additional freedom and power
of respiration,      succeeded by an almost delirious         but highly
pleasurable     sensation     in the head, which became universal,
with    increased tone     of the muscles.     At last an intoxicating
placidity absorbed for five minutes all voluntary power, and
left a cheerfulness and alacrity for several hours. A second
stronger dose produced a perfect trance for about a minute ;
then   a   glow pervaded        the system.    The permanent         effects
were,    an   invigorated      feeling of vital power and improved
spirits. By      both   trials, particularly by the former, old rheu
matic feelings seemed to be revived for the moment.

from him, kept breathing on laboriously with an open mouth,

away, though aware of the ludicroufnefs of his situation — all
 his muscles seemed to be thrown into vibratory motion — he
 had a violent inclination to make antic gestures — seemed
lighter than the atmosphere,         and as    if about    to mount.       Be
 fore the experiment, he was a good deal fatigued               after   a very
 long ride, of which he permanently lost; all fense.                 In  a se
 cond experiment nearly the same effects, but with                 less plea
sure.      In a third, much greater pleasure."
    The cases in which its effects were prejudicial are also
 stated with great candour. These were of the hysterical kind ;
but the consideration of the whole of these phenomena led to
 a happy application of the gas to the cure of palsy, and of dis
eases proceeding from a defect of nervous energy ; and seve
ral instances of success are stated, which are well deserving
of attention.
    "We desire further," fays the author, "to try the effects of
our new agent in palsy, and in the various cafes of true deficiency
of nervous power, which we have well learned to distinguisti
from cafes of relative defect of irritable power. As the limit*
of the efficacy of every remedy ought to be determined, we
shall not stirink from any cafe, by reason of its inveteracy. We
intend to oppose our Nepenthe to the equable decay induced
by time and intemperance ; and we hope to palliate some of
the evils of extreme old age itself.
    " We are emboldened bv experience              to pledge ourselves for
the   safe   employment of the gas.        We (hall, indeed, be sadly
disappointed if it do not sometimes prove the most delicious
of luxuries,    as well  as the most salutary      of remedies.       In  fay
ing this, it may be allowed me to suggest to those, who have
not attended to the tenor of my opinions, that I now for the
first time venture to hold forth these hopes.                 However ur
gently     I  may have recommended the investigation, my lan
guage, with regard to its issue, has always been, that would        /
not answer for the discovery of a gaseous remedy in any denomi
nation whatever      of  disease.   That natural or forced decay may
be repaired,    and  the faculty of pleasurable      set fation renovated,

is now no longer     a mere    conjecture supported by loose analo
gies — we     fee the strongest probabilities daily accumulating in
favour of the opinion.  It must only be remembered, that so
desirable a change cannot be effected by the agent applied in
any manner to any constitution.    It mull be properly used in
proper cases.
    "
    Considering the present abundance of expert chemists, we
cannot presume that others will not be able to prepare the
gas perfectly without       our instructions.              Nevertheless, those
who attempt to use it medicinally should be apprized that the
utmost care is necessary in its preparation and employment.
A   deleterious, instead of       a salutary      fluid,      as the    author can
attest from his own painful experience,             may easily be obtained.
Probably neither Dr. Priestley, nor the Dutch chemists, ever
procured that which can be respired with safety. The differ
ence, and its causes,      will   hereafter   be pointed out.
    "   If,
         therefore,    consequence of that promptitude which
                       in
journals afford, experiments tending to invalidate any part of
the preceding statement should be published, we hope that its
perfect fidelity will not on that account be doubted. The ex
perimenter will be found to have employed   different agent    a
from ours. This we have no hesitation in declaring that we
shall be able to shew."
  From the preceding short extracts, our readers will fee what
an interesting field opened for the advancement of physio
                       is

to    be        4/0326.      C. Ponticr found it in         the    department         of
Var,       a la Bastide de la Carradc,          near    Gassin,    and considered
it   as the brown-          blende, to which indeed          it has a consider
able degree   of resemblance, except that its specific gravity
is far greater.   This fubllance being analysed in the labo
ratory of the mines bv C. Tassaert, was found to be chromat
of iron, that is to fay, a metallic salt formed by the combi
nation of iron with the acid arising from the new metal dis
covered by C. Vauquelin, to which he gave the name ot
chrome. It seemed to contain, in 100 parts, 63*6 of that'acid,
36 of iron ; loss, 1-4.  Chemists may now flatter themselves
that chrome, which hitherto has been found only in the red
lead of Siberia, in the ruby and the emerald, may be ob
tained in sufficient abundance to enable them to subject it
to new researches.
  C. Vauquelin and Tassaert, by continuing their experi
ments on this substance, have ascertained the following
facts:
     1.    It not melt alone by the blow-pipe, but with
                 does
borax, to which it communicates a green colour like that of
the emerald.
     2.    It   is soluble in the muriatic acid, but slowly, and" in small
quantity.    From its solution, which is of a greenish blue
colour, it is precipitated white bv alkalies.
  3. It is soluble in oxygenated muriatic acid. From this
solution,          almost     it is precipitated of a reddish
                             colourless,
'brawn bv alkalies, and of an orange vellow by nitrat of lead.
  4. It is not decomposable by potash, or the carbonat of
potasti, without the assistance of a degree of heat which car
ries it to incandescence.
     5.    It may       easily be reduced by the known means.                  It   then
gives       an alioved     having only an external metallic
                              mass,
aspect, easily fused with borax ; brittle, but hard as steel'.
   6. This mass is exceedingly difficult to be decompoled. It
 mult be treated successively                and   several times with potast),
 which combines with the                     chromic     acid     and    dissolved    it,
aud with            the   muriatic    acid, which        dissolves      the   oxvd'   of

  believe it to be composed           of the following substances     :
                    Chromic acid             -      -       43

    They are of opinion also, that, the chromic acid being in
 sufficient quantity to saturate the oxyd of iron, this mineral
 is a triple combination             of the chromic       acid, the oxyd of
 iron, and argil.
    8. The oxyds of chrome, or the chromic acid, may be
 employed in the porcelain manufacture.                     When pure, they
 give   an   emerald      green, more beautiful        than  that of copper;
 and, mixed with lead or antimony, a canary-bird green.
 They may be employed also in painting, by separating the
 acid from the iron,           and combining it afterwards with dider-
 ent   metallic     oxyds by double affinities.
         METHOD           OP CHECKING            DECAY IN TREES.
    The     chestnut     lives  a  long time, and often         attains to an
extraordinary size          ; but unfortunately the texture of its wood
alters    under      certain    circumstances: it becomes soft, falls
into dust, a cavity is gradually formed in the heart of the
tree, aud      this cavity, by the progress          of  the decomposition,
becomes       still   larger ; so that, at last, the trunk seems to
consist of nothing but bark ; and being too weak to support
the branches, and resist the violence of hurricanes, it cannot
long exist.        It is by similar changes and decompositions of
the ligneous principle, that trees, which have been growing
for   asres,  are seen to perish in a very little time.
    C. Chaptal, in travelling through different              parts of France,
and particularly the Cevennes              and   the .department    of Allier,
observed, that a great number              of  chestnut-trees   were hollow,
and charred over the whole internal surface.                     He was told
by the inhabitants of the country, that this process was em
ployed to stop the progress of the qaries, which otherwise
would destroy the whole tree.               When      they observe that this

disease,     which is very common and exceedingly fatal to the
chestnut-tree, begins to make any progress, and to excavate
the trunk, they collect heath and other vegetables, and set
fire to them in the cavity, till the whole surface is completely
charred. It happens very rarely that the tree peristies by this
operation, and it is always found that this reined v suspends
the effect of the caries.       It is practised with the same success
 on the white oak.        By comparing the effects of the cautery
 on the     human bodv, in analogous cafes of degeneration,           we
 perceive a new similarity       between     diseases  which   affect the
 living    organised   beings of the two kingdoms,          and between
 the remedies by which they may bo checked.
                 ON THE     GRAVITY OF TUNGSTEN.
       The difficulty of bringing    tungsten    to complete   fusion has
  hitherto prevented the specific gravity of thU new metal from
  being with certainty determined. Some fixed it at 17-6, ac
  cording to the experiments of the brothers d'Elhuvar; but
  many could not believe it to be so considerable.            C. Guyton
  lately obtained      a well-formed button, of the weight of 35
  grammes, in       a three-blast-furnace, where the intensity of the
   fire may be carried to about 1850 of Wedgewood : but this
   button having broken by the pasture of the vice, into which
   it  was put in order to be fawn, there was discovered at its centre
   a part not agglutinated, which, by exposure to the air, speedily
   assumed a purple colour, similar to that which the best-fused
   tungsten, of such a degree of hardness as to render a file bril
   liant, exhibits on its surface.        It results, from these experi
    ments, that the specific gravity os the fused portion, separated
    from that which was only fused imperfectly, was 8-3406 ;
    that the infusibility and brittlcness of this metal leave no
    other hopes of applying it to the arts, though there are abun
    dant mines of it in France, but by mixing it with other me
     tals, or by the property discovered in its oxyds of yielding
     fixed colour*, and fixing vegetable colours.

aii account of his       observation  of   the  last opposition of Mars,
 with the calculations on that subject          ; and by comparing it
 with that of 1790, he has found that only 58 seconds are to be
 deducted from the place of the aphelion of Mars, employed
 in the last edition of his Astronomy.             He announces a large
 work on this planet by C. Lefrancais-Lalande,               his nephew.

       A  monument has lately been erected in the cathedral of
   Upsal, to the memory of the great Linneus. It consists en
   tirely of the porphyry of Elfwedal ; is properly a pedestal
   in the form of an altar, the steps of which are of the brown
   done of Oeland      ; and supports    a  medallion containing      a bust

                       SUBSTITUTES FOR COFFEE.
        Count von Burgsdorf has lately laid before the Royal Aca
    demy of Sciences at Berlin, samples of coffee prepared from
     the solid parts of the beet-root, after the saccharine juice has
     been expressed.
         After the  most careful examination       of all the substitutes for
     coffee hitherto employed, the Academy           of Sciences at Peters-
     burgh has made known that the acorn is the best, as it pos
     sesses, when proper means are used to communicate to it the
      oily properties,  all the requisite qualities of coffee.     To com
      municate these oily properties, the following process is re

           SUBSTITUTK FOR TINCTURE OF BARK.
     Dr. G. F. C. Fuchs, teacher extraordinary of medicine at
 Jena, has prepared from the ripe fruit of the horse chestnut,

 an extract, which,         according to his experiments, may be
 used, perhaps, instead       of the expensive extraftum china;, since
 the bark   of this    tree has been long known as a substitute for
 cinchona.
                      SUBSTITUTE FOR GALLS.
    A   German apothecary, named Tromer, has lately disco
 vered, that the excrescences or knots on the roots of young
 oaks may be used as a substitute for galls. These excrescences
 are produced, in the fame manner as the galls, by an insect,
which, after pricking them, deposits its eggs in them. With
vitriol of iron, in the fame proportion as galls, they give 3
beautiful black ink, and may be used also in dyeing.             In the
spring, these excrescences may be found in great numbers on
the small roots of the oaks, particularly on the south side, of
ten about a hand's-breadth below the earth.            Those found in
summer have, for the most part, small apertures, capable of
admitting a moderate-sized needle, but thev are no longer
filled with eggs.        At this period they are more woody, and
not   so good j     and therefore   they ought to be collected   in the
spring.
                         TRAVELS IN AFRICA.
    Mr. Horneman,          whom we some time ago announced to
have set   out with the view of exploring the interior of Africa,
has written a letter to       Sir Joseph Banks, from Tripoli. He
had travelled from Cairo, in Egypt, through the Lybian De
sert, to Fezzan, the largest Oasis in the Great Sahara j a
route hitherto unexplored by any European,              whose   travels
                                                                   have

hive been communicated to the public. In the journey from
Cairo to Fezzan, he halted at Sewah, which, from the no
tices of Mr. Brown, some months ago, had been clearly as
certained to be the Oasis   of Ainmon.
    Mr. Horneman's new observations,          made at his leisure on
the spot, now place this matter beyond all manner            of doubt.
Mr. H.    was   too late this season     for the caravan     that goes
 from Fezzan to Soudan, comprehending under that name
Jlourses, Caslinou, Burnou, the great kingdom near the Ni
ger.    Meanwhile he has sent from Tripoli, by another con
veyance,    not yet arrived, the journal of his present travels ;
and there is every reason to hope that he will accomplish his
great undertaking of visiting the unknown central regions of
Africa, especially from the following occurrences mentioned
in his letter : — He was followed from Sewah by a large party
sent to seize him, on suspicion of his being a French spy. But
 his manners and behaviour were         so completely Moslem, and
 he approved himself so thoroughly master of the Koran, that
 he was released with blessings and alms as a good mussulman,
 and sent forward on his journey.
               CEMENTING       OF BROKEN          GLASS.
    C. Pajot, of Charmes,        lately  transmitted   to the    Philo-
 matic Society and the National Institute, small        bits of glass of
 different qualities, which he had joined and soldered        so firmly
 that the glass would rather break close to the joining than in
 the actual place.    The sunn of the fracture does not at all
 prevent the operation. The line of junction is scarcely dis
 cernible, and in some places not visible.           C. Pajot has not
  made his process known.
     C. Swediaur informed      the Society,    that  a person    named
 Hollenwegcr,     about twelve or fourteen years ago, had in his
 presence,    and  that of Lavoisier and Meunier,            performed
 lome experiments, by means of which he joined in a solid
 manner,    so as to make the junction hardly visible, fragments
  of blown glass.
     C. Chaptal said    also that some      person   had {hewn him,
  about fifteen years ago, a glass bottle, the neck of which
  was so perfectly soldered to the glass stopper, that, when cut
  through, the circle of junction was scarcely perceptible. The
                                                                  bottle

 312                                   Death.
 bottle contained liquor of flints, and had Iain on its side tor
 a long time.          " After feeing this fact, said Chaptal, I con
 ceived the possibility of soldering together two plates of glass.
 I explained       my ideas on this subject, and (hewed the bottle,
 in my public lectures ; and I am of opinion, that, by gra
 dually withdrawing the dissolving alkali, it might be possible
 to unite such plates."
     Before we dismiss this article, we beg leave to remark, that
 there appears        to be nothing so wonderful in joining broken
 pieces of glass, in the "way above described, as to justify Pa-
jot in concealing the process. A little reasoning will lead
 any one to it. All that is necessary is to interpose, between
 the parts, a glass ground up like a pigment, but of easier fu
 sion than the pieces to be joined, and then exposing them to
 such a heat as        will  fuse the cementing ingredient,        and make
 the pieces agglutinate without being themselves fused.                       A
 glass    fit for  the   purpose    of  cementing    broken    pieces of  flint
 glass, may be made by fusing some of the fame kind of glass,
 previously reduced to a powder, along with a little red lead'
 and borax, or with the borax only.

        cerning the Eruptions resembling the Small- Pox, <wbicb
       sometimes appear in the Inoculated Vaccine Dijease.
    Jl    O R reasons,    the explanation       of which would    lead into
    too long a detail,     and which,     indeed,    cannot be given with
    perfect   propriety in this sheet;        I  feel myself compelled to
    publish some      observations     concerning     the eruptions  which
    appear, in some instances,        in the cow-pock by inoculation.
        Although    the   new inoculation       in the present year has
   been, 1 mink, sufficiently extensive to manifest the advan
   tages of it over that for the small-pox, so that it is not likely
   to be ever totally laid aside; yet the unexpected               appear
   ance    of eruptions   has inclined many persons to be       of opinion
   that no beneficial consequences can be produced by this prac
   tice,   or, at least, that such consequences at best seem to be
   problematical.       It may be useful to observe, that some of the
   Advocates for the cow-pock inoculation contend, that erup
  tions are never produced by it ; accordingly, they assert, that,
  in    these eruptive    cases,   the disorder    was not the cow-pock,
  but the small -pox;       the variolous poison       hiving either  been
  inserted    inadvertently, or the constitution having" been af-

cumbent on the Assertors either to prove that such errors have
been committed, or at least thev ought to be able to oppose
equally extensive experience to that of the adverse party : for no
sound reasoner will consider opinions, which are only founded
in conjecture,       to be demonstrated       truths.    I will not, how
ever, take upon myself the un required             task   of attempting to
vindicate others        from the above charges ; but I shall only
perform a duty in stating the result of my own experience
with regard to the point in question ; conceiving that by this
 means the truth may be brought to light,             if aided by the evi
 dence from experience          of future inquirers.
     In  the course      of my practice the latter end of February,
 and    in   March following, I distinctly recollect four cases
 in which I     first saw eruptions from the vaccine            inoculation
 resembling     so  much those of the small -pox, that I should not
 have hesitated to consider them as belonging to this disease, if
 I  had not excited them by a different          poison from the vario-
 lous.     I observed,    however,     at that time, some appearances
 of  these eruptions different from thole which usually occur in
 the small-pox. Almost all the eruptions, in the stage of desic
 cation, afforded ihining,smooth, black or reddilh-brown scabs;
 very few of them having previously suppurated.                 Finding, in
 two other instances, that tiie matter from the inoculated pustule
 of these patients produced a similar eruptive disorder, and alfo
 the same being the event in the practice of two or three of my
 correspondents, whom I had furnished with matter from the
 above eruptive       cafes,  I from   that time used matter only from
 the cases in which no eruptions appeared.              After this   precau
 tion,   no eruptive cafes resembling the small-pox occurred in
 tny practice during the whole of last summer and the present
 winter.      I say, no cases occurred resembling the small-pox ;
 but certainly eruptions, in number from a single one to about
  a dozen, which were large, red, hard pimples, with little or no
  lymph,     and never with any pus, occurred, probably,              in one
  cafe out   of twenty or thirty.       These spots, so unlike the small
  pox, produced no trouble ; and were of such a short duration,
  that, when I speak of eruptions, I do not include them in the
   number ;    I  include in the account those only in which the
                            7                                      eruptions

                       in   the inoculated   Vaccine Disease.               31,5
 truptions resembled              the small-pox     :   nor do   I reckon among
 the eruptive cases those in which, now and then, a rash broke
 out about the 14th day after inoculation ; and which was 'as
 troublesome as the Urticaria.  Mv experience, then, with re
                  of eruptions being diminished in number
 spect to the cases
by avoiding inoculation with matter of similar eruptive cases,
coincides with Dr. Woodvillc's ; and confirms what he has
already so usefully communicated to the public.      It was ob
vious to suspect, on the first occurrence of the eruptive cases,
that variolous matter, in au unobserved way, but from sources
which could not even be conjectured, had been introduced
into the constitution instead of the vaccine poison.       This
conjecture, in spite of the clearest evidence of sense respect
ing the nature of the matter used, received some countenance
from the non-appearance of eruptions as above stated ; but,
from the occurrence of such                in the practice of other
                                           cases,
Inoculators,          in the last autumn and this winter, I think it
is very unreasonable to doubt any longer, that, either on
account of peculiar states of the human animal ceconomy, or
an account of some co-operating agents, the genuine vaccine
poison does now and then               produce      a   certain variety of the
cow-pock,           characterised     by the appearance       of pustules, like
those    of the variola. I have good evidence also to shew, that
even in the hands      of those very Inoculators, who a little time
ago would not allow that the vaccine poison                      could produce
eruptions, such cases have lately occurred.
  In     the   month of Octoberlast I inoculated a child two
years    of
          age with the vaccine   poison. The original mat
ter, which had produced this matter, I took from the cow in
March      last ;            time the vaccine disease had been
                      since which
excited by      it,
                 in my hands, in      great number of patients.

The   vaccine disease took place with  the usual appearances, in
the inoculated part, and affected the whole constitution in the
ordinary manner; but      few eruptions broke out on the
                                  a                                          se
cond or third day aster the slight fever; they were, however,
only the red large pimples above mentioned, not at all like
the small-pox.   Mr. Keate carried matter from this child to
Brighthelmstone,            where   Mr. Barret inoculated two children,
Kilo    took, the disease     ;   and from one of these Mr. Keate ino-
                                       S i
                                         s                              Buhtcd.

st5           On the Eruptions which sometime* appear
culated    three children.    They all had the usual fever about
the e.jflvh ciav, and all had a number of eruptions, except
one, which had only five or six, and these dried on the fifth
clay,     Thi? last case was probably that which Mr. Keate in
forms me had, in the inoculated part, the genuine vaccine
pustule; but in all the others Mr. Barret observed that. in
the inoculated part the pustule was ragged at the edges, and
flat, more resembling the variolous pustule.           Matter from
these patients      was sent to Petworth,    where   Mr. Andre in
forms me he inoculated with it fourteen children.          They all
took the disease, and had eruptions like the variolous. Three
 children at the breast had from three to twelve pujlulei.
The remaining eleven children had from fifty to several hun
 dred eruptions.       The state of the arms, and the characters of
 the pustules of the inoculated part, are not mentioned. None
 of the above patients died, nor is any mention made by Mr.
 Keate, Mr. Barret, and Mr. Andre, even of any apprehension
 of danger.      Dr. Thornton sent me lately a case with eruptions,
 produced     by  matter which I originally took from a cow. Ac
 cording, then, to experience, we draw these conclusions : —
  i. That in certain constitutions, or under the circumstances of
 certain co-operating agents, the vaccine poison produces a dis
 ease resembling the small-pox; and of course the pustule in the
 inoculated part is very different from that of the vaccine pock
  ordinarily occurring, and the eruptions resemble very much,
 if not exactly, some varieties of the small-pox. 2. That in
 some instances      these eruptions have occurred although the
 inoculated part exhibited the genuine vaccine pustule. 3. That
  the matter of such eruptive cases, whether taken from the
  inoculated part, or from other parts, produces universally, or
  at least generally, similar eruptive cases, and has not, I believe,
  been seen to go back, by pasting through different constitu
  tions, to the state in which it produces what is called the ge
   nuine vaccine    disease.  4. That eruptions, of a different ap
   pearance    from variolous ones, sometimes occur in the true
   cow- pock.
      Now, whether the vaccine poison, when it produces          these
   cafes resembling the small-pox,      has really become,  by com-
   pofitian or decomposition, variolous matter, is undetermined.
                                                                    If

                  in the  inoculated Vaccine Disease.                   317
If   this should be found to be the cafe by future experiments,
still we must consider the two poisons as of distinctly different
species, on account       of the different characters        of the  pustule
in the fmall-pox and cow-pox ; although, as just said, by the
combination of some other substance with the cow-pox poi
son, or by the separation         of some one     of   the constituent   in
gredients     of this poison, the variolous poison may be pro
duced.       To illustrate this theory let it be considered, that
 magnesia and sulphate of magnesia are different species of
substances ; although they agree in some of their principal
 effects on the human constitution, and in other properties ;
 but, by the union of magnesia with sulphuric acid, it becomes
 sulphate of magnesia.          Or the illustration may be given con
 versely.     As, then, we have distinct denominations for these
 two substances, so we ought to have them for the two poi
 sons, and the two different diseased states they produce, name
 ly, the cow-pox and the small-pock. Accordingly, Dr. Odier,
 of Geneva,      whose powers as a Dialectician,         and whose acute-
 ness as a Philologer,       I can attest from the period of his aca
 demical studies, has       " baptised" (to use the language of Dr.
 De Carro,) the new         disease  La  Vaccine, or Vaccina, rejecting
  the absurd name       of the  Englifli, variola vaccina.
     But,   to return to the immediate question           under discussion,
  granting that eruptions are liable to be produced              by the ino
  culation of the cow-pock, what difference ought this accident
  to make in our estimate of the value of the new practice,
  from the estimate on the supposition that no such eruptions
  would occur     ?   I apprehend     the value   is hereby depreciated,
  but not to such    a degree as to create any reasonable         apprehen
  sions  of  the failure  of  the Vaccine Inoculation         in superseding
  and extinguishing the small-pox.            Because,
      1.  If the precaution be taken       of avoiding      the inoculation
   with matter from eruptive cases, as far as I have seen, not
   above one case, with variolous-like eruptions, will be pro
   duced among 200 instances of inoculated cow- pox.
      2. These eruptive cases are,       as far as   I  have observed, like
   the. ordinary kinds     of inoculated fmall-pox.
      3. I have seen     no  disfigurations of the skin from this va
   riety of cow-pox j but I think it just tp acknowledge that »
               3                                                         from

 31 8                  Observations         respeeling the Earthquake
 from the experience I have had, no practitioner can answer
 for such cases not occurring in any instance, and as danger
 is always in proportion to the number of eruptions, which
 number           no one can pretend to limit, it is evident that the
chance of life during this disease is lessened, although but a
very little. Provided this statement be made to the patient, it
does not appear to me that the fact                           of   the   liability to eruptions
ought to impede the progress of the Vaccine Inoculation ;
but     if,
      on the contrary, the patient assured that such erup      is
tions will not occur, there                         is   good ground for the practice
falling into discredit, or at least for many persons, with rea
son, being discontented.
   After this representation of an unfavourable part of the
history of the cow-pock,       consolatory to be able to coun
                                            it    is
terpoise   with some new facts, which, like that of the erup
              it
tions,  have been discovered in the course of further experi
ence.         It   now appears that a person who has had the small
pox,     is      not susceptible of the cow -pox      inoculation *          by                       j
nor    is    a   person susceptible            of   the constitutional affection from
the cow-pox poison more than once.                                  On       the whole,         then,
we have gained                perhaps        as   much as we have lost since the
publication of              the original          account: and unless some new
adverse facts shall be discovered,                        and considing that the public

with    flames,   either from their craters or through their lateral
fissures.      In  the midst of the molt profound calm there is
frequently heard         a  dreadful bellowing noise, the forerunner
of earthquakes,        to which this part of the world is often ex
posed.      After   the year 1791, this noise was frequently heard
in   the neighbourhood of the mountain of Tunguragua.              An
tonio Pineda and Nee, the two naturalists employed in the
expedition round the world, when examining the declivity
of this volcano, the lava of which had been hardened more
 by the internal sire than by the ardour of the fun, were struck
 with terror by the horrible found which thev heard, and the
 heat   which they      experienced.     Pineda, that valuable member
of    society,   whose     premature death is still deplored by the       ,
 friends of science,       foretold that a terrible eruption was pre
 paring in the mountain of Tunguragua ; and his conjectures
 were confirmed by the event.            On the 4th of February 1797,
 at three quarters past seven in the morning, the summit of
 the volcano was more free from vapours than usual ; the in
 terior part of the mountain was agitated by frequent shocks^
 and the adjacent chains burst in such a manner, that in the
 space    of four minutes      an immense    tract of country was con
 vulsed by an undulating movement.              Never did history relate
 the effects of an earthquake so extraordinary, and never did
 any phenomenon of Nature produce more misfortunes, or
 destroy a greater number of human beings.                A number of
 towns and villages were destroyed in a moment : some of
  them, such as Riobamba, Quero, Pelileo, Patate, Pillaro,
  were buried under the ruins         of the neighbouring mountains ;
  and    others in the jurisdictions of Harnbata,            Latacunga,
  Guaranda, Riobamba, and Alausi, were entirely overthrown.
  Some sustained prodigious loss by the gulphs which were
  formed,      and   by the reflux of rivers intercepted in their
  course by mounds of earth ; and others, though in part
  saved, were in such a shattered state as to threaten their total
  ruin.     The number of        persons   who perished during the first
  and    succeeding       shocks  are  estimated   at 16,000.    At ten
  o'clock in the morning, and four in the afternoon, the fame
  day, (February 4,) after a dreadful noise, the earth was again
  agitated   with    great violence,    aud  it did not cease  to stiake,
                                                                 though

    J20       Observations     respecting an Earthquake in Peru.
    though faintly, for the whole month of February and March ;
    but, at three quarters past two in the morning of the 5th of
    April,   the villages already ruined were          again exposed to such
    violent shocks    as would have been sufficient to destroy them.
    This extraordinary phenomenon             was selt throughout the ex
    tent of 140 leagues from east to           weft,   from the  sea as far as
    the river Napo     ; and without doubt farther, for we are little
    acquainted    with these districts which arc inhabited by the
    favages.     The distance north-east and fouth-west between
    Popajan and Piura, is reckoned to be 170 leagues; but in
   the centre of that district, 1 degree i6.6 from these places,
   is fituated the part totally destroyed, and which comprehends
   forty leagues from north to fouth between Guarandam and
   Machache,       and twenty leagues        from    east to west.    But,  as
   is  an earthquake       alone had not been sufficient to ruin this
   sertile  and   populous country, another misfortune, hitherto
   unknown, was added.            The earth opened, and formed im
  mense gulphs;        the summits      of the mountains tumbled down
  into the valleys,      and from the fissures in          their fides there
  issued an immense quantity           of  setid water, which in a little
  time filled up valleys a thoufand           seet in depth and fix hun
  dred in breadth.        It  covered the villages, buildings,       and in
  habitants ; choaked up the fources of the purest springs, and,
 being condensed by deficcation, in the course of a sew days,
 into an earthy and hard paste, it intercepted the course of
 rivers, made them flow backwards for the space of eighty-
 seven days, and converted whole districts of dry land into
 lakes.     Very extraordinary phenomena, which will doubtless
 be one day mentioned in history, occurred during these
earthquakes; I shall, however, content myself with men
tioning only two of them. At the fame moment that the
earth shook, the lake of Quirotoa, near the village of In-
filoc, in the jurisdiction of Lacatunga, took fire, and the
vapour which rose from it sussocated the cattle and flocks
that were seeding in the neighbourhood.                   Near the village
of    Pelileo,  a large  mountain      named     Moya,    which  was over
turned in an instant, threw out a prodigious stream of the
besore-mentioned thick setid matter, which destroyed and
covered the miserable         remains of that city.         Naturalists will
                                                                        one

           Tanning Principle and Gallic Acid in Barns.                   331
one day find, in these ravaged countries, objects worthy of
their researches.      Fragments of the minerals and earths of
Tunguragua are about to be transported to Spain : but it is
not in such fragments that we ought to search for the cause
of these   surprising  phenomena; we must visit the country it
self, where this conflict of the elements took place, and where
the ruins it occasioned are still to be seen *.
 III.   Experiments to determine the Quantity of Tanning Prin
    ciple and Gallic Acid contained in the Bark of various
    Trees.     By  George Biggin, Efq.f
        HE   bark of trees contains the astringent principle called
gallic   acid,  and also that principle which has a peculiar affi
nity to the matter of skin, and which, from the use to which
it   is applied, is called the      tanning principle.          But, in the
present mode of tanning,            bark is applied in         mass to th«
skins ; consequently, both principles are applied. It remains
for examination, whether both principles are useful in the
process    of tanning   ; for, if they   are not both useful, probably
 one is  detrimental.
    To a nobleman, whose zeal on every occasion by which
the sciences or arts may receive illustration or improvement,
is eminently conspicuous,          and to whose public energy,              as
well    as  private friendship, I feel myself much indebted, to
his Grace the Duke of Bedford, I owe the means of prose
 cuting some experiments on this subject.                 His Grace, by
collecting a variety of barks, at Woburn,                gave me an op
portunity of making some experiments to ascertain the quan
 tity of tanning principle and gallic acid each bark contained.
For that purpose I made use of the following methods, ac
 cording to the principles laid down by M. Seguin : —
    By dissolving an ounce of common glue in two pounds of
 boiling water, I procured a mucilaginous liquor, which, as
k    contains the matter of skin in solution, is               a test for the

 tanning principle. By a saturated solution of sulphat of iron,
 I obtained. a test for the gallic acid.
         I   then took one pound of the bark                          I    meant         to try, ground
 as for the use                 of   tanners,     and divided             it into five parts,         each
 part being put into an earthen vessel.     To one part of this
 bark I added two pounds of water, and infused them for one
 hour.   Thus I procured an infusion of bark, which I poured
 on the second part of the bark, and this strengthened infusion
 again on the third part, and so on to the fifth.    But, as a
        portion
 ¦certain        of the  infusion will  remain attached  to the
 wood of the bark after the infusion is poured or drawn off, I
 added a third pound                       of   water        to the first part, and then fol
 lowed up the infusion on the several parts till the three pounds
 of water, orso much of them as could be separated from the
 bark, were united in the fifth vessel ; from which I generally
  obtained about one pint of strong infusion of bark *.
    To a certain quantity of this infusion, 1 added a given
 measure               of   the solution        of glue, which formed                    an immediate
  precipitate, that may be separated from the infusion by filter
 ing paper. When dried, it is a substance formed by the che
 mical union of the matter of skin with the tanning principle,
 and          is,
        in fadt, powder of leather. By saturating the infusion
                                a
 with the solution of glue,                       the whole           of   the tanning principle
 may be separated                     by   precipitation.

 ready            deprived       of its tanning principle    these quick infuby

 when tried by the test of the solution of glue; but, with the
 solution of sulphat of iron, it gives a strong black colour,
 (the common black dye,) which differs in density according
 to the quality of the bark : this may be further proved, by
boiling a (kain of worsted in the dye, by which the grada
tions of colour will be very perceptibly demonstrated.
    Having thus obtained a point of comparison ; by making
a  similar infusion, under similar circumstances, of any bark,
or vegetable substance, and paying strict attention to the spe
cific gravity of the infusion, the quantity of precipitate of
leather, and the density of colour produced by given quanti
ties of one or the other test, the result will be, a comparative
statement of the respective powers of any bark, or vegetable
substance.     This  comparative    statement   I conceive to be suf
ficient for all commercial purposes.
    As oak bark is the usual substance employed          in the   trade
of tanning, if    a quantity of tanning principle is found to be
contained in any other bark or vegetable, the commercial
utility of that bark or vegetable may be determined, by com
paring its quantity of tanning principle and price with those
<*f oak bark.
    For an accurate chemical analysis,      I  have tried a variety   of
acids, and simple and compound affinities ; and, having pur
sued the above experiments at the fame time that I was em
ployed on some in dyeing, I found the muriat of tin (the
method of using which is described by Mr. Proust in the
Annales dc Cbimic,) very convenient. A solution os it being
added to the infusion of bark, forms a precipitate with the
tanning principle, leaving the gallic acid suspended : the pre
cipitate is of a fawn colpur, and is composed of tanning prin
ciple and oxydated tin.
    By theft means I have been enabled to form a compara
tive scale of barks ; which, however, I do not produce as
accurate.     Oak bark, in its present state, as procured for
commercial purposes, differs very much in quality, from ac
cidental circumstances     :  the season  of  the year in which it is
collected   occasions  a still more important difference,       conse

distinctness of principle, and may perhaps open a new field
for saving oak bark in dyeing, as the willows, sallow, ash, and
others, produce a very fine black.     It is also worthy of ob-
 ervation, that the quantities of gallic acid and tanning prin
ciple do not differ in equal proportions between the winter
and spring felled oaks. This fact may lead to the discrimi
nation of the proper time for cutting ; which     probably,             is,
when the sap has completely filled and dilated that part of
the vegetable intended for use. This will make        difference        a

 these manufactories              the workmen dye at one time                  a   mass    of
 skains weighing             thirty- five occas;    each occa being equal to
  about fifty ounces.
    The                  that of cleaning the cotton, for which
             first process       is

       second bath given to the cotton is composed of soda
     The
and sheep's dung dissolved in water. To facilitate the solution
the soda and dung are pounded                          in    a   mortar.     The proportions
of    these ingredients employed, are, one                               occa of dung, six of
soda, and         forty of water.              When              the    ingredients are well
mixed, the liquor expressed from them is strained, and being
poured into a tub, fix occas of olive oil are added to   and                                   it,

giving     a    rosy hue  to the red.      thereforeIt      is                  probable that         it
is to this ingredient that the red dyes of the Levant are in
debted for their splendour and vivacity.  This much, at any
rate,    certain, that the Morocco leather of the Levant

nuts have been boiled.  This operation renders the cotton
more fit for being saturated with the colour, and gives to th«
dye more body and strength.     After the galling comes alum-

           Grecian Method of dyeing Cotton Yarn Red.            ^i,J
must     be performed with    care,  as it is this operation which
makes the colouring particles combine best with the cotton,
and which secures them in part from the destructive action
of   the air.   When the second aluming is finished, the cotton
is wrung ; it is then pressed, and put to soak in running wa
ter, after being inclosed in a bag of thin cloth.
    The workmen then proceed to the dyeing. —To compose
the colours they put in a kettle five occas of water and thirty-
five occas of a root which the Greeks call ali-zari, or paint
ing colour, and which in Europe is known under the name
of madder. The madder, after being pulverised, is moistened
with one occa of ox or sheep's blood. The blood strengthens
the colour,    and the dose is increased or lessened according to
the shade of colour required. An equal heat is maintained
below the kettle, but not too violent ; and when the liquor
ferments, and begins to grow warm, the fkains are then gra
dually immersed before the liquor becomes too hot. They
are then tied with packthread to small rods, placed crosswise
above the kettle for that purpose,      and when the liquor boils
well, and in an uniform manner, the rods from which the
fkains were suspended are removed, and the cotton is suffered
 to fall into the kettle, where it must     remain till two-third*
of    the water is evaporated.     When one-third only of the
liquor remains, the cotton is taken out and washed in pure
water.
    The   dye is afterwards brought to perfection by means      of a
bath alcalised with soda.     This manipulation is the most     dif
ficult and the most delicate     of the whole, because it is that
which gives the colour its tone.        The cotton is thrown into
this new bath, and made to boil over a steady fire till the
colour assumes the required tint.        The whole art consists in
catching the proper degree : a careful workman, therefore,
must watch with the utmost attention for the moment when
it is necessary to take out the cotton, and he     will rather burn
his hand than miss that opportunity.
    It appears that this bath, which the Greeks think of          so
much importance, might be supplied by a ley of soap ; and
it is probable that saponaceous water would give the colour
more brightness     and purity.
                                                             When

$2$                     Exlraff of a Memoir            on the
   When the colour is too weak, the Levantines know how
to strengthen it by increasing the dose of the colouring sub
stances ; and when they wish to give it brightness and splen
dour, they employ different roots of the country, and, in par
ticular, one named fajsari, specimens of which    have sent to     I
France.
   The ali-zari, which is the principal colouring matter em
ployed in the Greek dye-houses, is collected in Natolia,
and is brought to Greece from Smyrna : some of it comes
also from Cyprus and Mesopotamia.       The superiority of this
Levantine plant to the European madder is acknowledged by
all those acquainted with the art of dyeing, and may arise
from two              manner in which it is cultivated, and
               causes ; the
the method employed for its desiccation.
  As the ali-zari appears to be of a weaker constitution than
the common madder: as its branches are more delicate, its
leaves    smoother      and    tenderer,        and its stem more fragile,         it
is supported by sticks, as pease are among us. A well nou
rished stem acquires in this manner more consistence, and
fends forth more roots.            It   is to be observed,             that it is the
woody part       of the                                      of
                          roots which affords the greatest quantity
colouring particles.    The ali-zari is not collected till the
fifth or sixth year, that is to fay, when it has acquired its
full strength ; while in France and Zealand, where land is of
more value than in the Levant, the inhabitants wish to reap
too soon, and collect the madder before it comes to complete
maturity.
 The method employed in the desiccation                           contributes also
to improve the quality           of   the   ali-zari.        The Levantines dry
it in    the    open    air;
                     and this operation is easy in a country
where great dryness prevails in the atmosphere, while, in our
damp climates, we are obliged to dry the madder by stoves.
Hence it happens that the smoke, which mixes itself with
the cold air, and penetrates the roots, impregnates them with
fuliginous particles, which alter the colouring substance ; an
accident which does not take place when the madder is dried
without        the assistance   of fire.    "
                                                It   is,   however, possible, that
the ali-zari and madder may never produce the same tone of
colour, notwithstanding all the care that may be employed

 in    the culture and drying                    of   the latter      ;   because there may
 be as much difference                between           these two plants, so like to
 each        other,    as    between         the goats            of France and        those      of
 Angora.
       It
     is probable, also, that the superiority of the ali-zari over
 madder may arise only from its stem being tenderer, and by
 its consequently having                a greater disposition               to transform it
 self into succulent roots. In that cafe, several of our indige
nous plants of the family of the rubia might be substituted
in its place with advantage; such as the gallium luteum and
gallium fiore albo, found in abundance on the hills of Poitou,
and the madder, which grows on both sides of the Alps, and
 which        has been       distinguished    by the name of rubia lavis
 Tourinenjium.              All    these plants give a red as beautiful and
 as pure as the best              madder; but               I   do not know whether the
quantity of their colouring matter is equal to their beautiful
quality.
    The chief manufactories for dyeing spun cotton red, esta
blished in Greece, are in Thessaly.  There are some at Baba,
Rapsani, Tournavos, Larissa, Pharsalia, and in all the vil
lages       situated    on the fides of                Ossa and       Pelion.      These    two
mountains may be considered as the alembics that distil the
eternal vapours with which Olympus is crowned, and which
distribute them throughout                            the       beautiful   valleys    situated
around them.                Of    these valleys,            that of Tempe has at all
times been distinguished by the beauty of its shady groves
and of its streams. These streams, on account of their lim-
pidness,  are very proper for dyeing, and supply water to a
great number   of manufactories, the most celebrated of which,
are those of Ambelakia.
  Ambelakia, on account                     of the activity which               prevails in    it,
has    a    greater resemblance              to   a    town of Holland than             a   vil
lage    of Turkey.           This village,            by    its industry, communicates
life and activity to all the neighbouring country, and gives
birth to an immense trade, which connects Germany with
Greece in       a   thousand ways.                Its population, which               has been
tripled within         these fifteen years, amounts at present to 4000,
and all these people exist                  by   dyeing. None of those vices or
cares produced              by   idleness    are    known here.  The hearts of

Servitude, which degrades the countries watered by the Pe-
neus, has not yet ascended to these hills : no Turk can reside
or live among these people ; and they govern themselves, like
their ancestors, by their protoyeros and their own magistrates.
Twice have the savage muflulmans of Larissa, envious of their
ease    and   happiness,     attempted      to scale their mountains           in
order to plunder their houses ; and twice have they been re
pulsed by hands which suddenly quitted the shuttle to assume
the musket.
    All   hands, and even those of the children,                are employed
in the    dye-houses     of Ambelakia;        and while the men dye the
cotton,     the women are spinning and preparing it.                   The    use
of   wheels is not known in this part           of Greece    ;   all the cotton
is spun on a distaff: the thread, indeed,                is certainly not so
 round or equal, but it is softer, more silky, and more tena
 cious ; it is less apt to break, and lasts longer ; it is also more
 easily whitened,      and    more proper for being dyed.                 It is a
 pleasing spectacle to see the women of Ambelakia, each spin
 ning from a distaff, and sitting conversing together on the
 threshold of their doors ; but as soon as a stranger appears,
 they instantly retire and conceal themselves in their houses,
 manifesting, like Galatea, in their precipitate retreat, a desire
 of flying   and  of (hewing     themselves      : —

     The   eye can only have a cursory view            of  the shape    of  some
  of  these women      ;  but it still observes,       with     surprise,   those
 slender    and  graceful     forms of the ancient Grecian females,
  which    served as models to the most beautiful statues in the
  world.

chiefly frequent      the southern           part of the river de la Plata,
as far as Rio Negro, the country of the Patagbnians, 8cc.
The wild horses of all these countries live in numerous herds>
some of which, it is said, consist of ten thousand.   As soon
as they perceive domestic horses in the fields, they run to
wards them on a full gallop, pass through the middle of
them, or near them, caress them, and invite them with a
kind of grave and prolonged neighing. The domestic horses
are soon seduced,  unite themselves to the independent herd,
and depart   along with them.     It happens not unfrequently
that travellers are stopped on the road by the effect of this
desertion.   To prevent          it,
                            they halt as soon as they perceive
these wanderers, watch their own horses,                     and endeavour        to
frighten away the others-    In              such cases the wild horses fol
low a  certain kind of tactics some are detached before, and
                                         ;
the rest advance in   close column, which nothing can in
                       a
terrupt.     If
             they are           so
                          alarmed as to be obliged to retire,
they change their direction, but without suffering themselves
to be dispersed  sometimes
                  :           they make     great number of
                                                         a
turns around those which they wish to seduce, in order to
frighten them; at other times they retire after making one
turn. These manœuvres are not employed during the night,
for the wild horses then make no attempts. The author                             is
ignorant whether any thing of the fame kind takes place
between one herd       of wild         horses and another for the purpose
of recruiting their number* He asserts that Buffon     mis                is
taken  in saying that these wild horses have more strength
and fleetness than the domestic horses of the country, and
that they do not differ from the latter either in height or
shape  but he indeed observes, that no comparison can be
        :
made    between    the independent and                 domestic   state   of   these
animals, as in that country both states are almost similar.
  Those who possess ejlanclas, or pastures for keeping do
mestic horses, place in them      certain number of mares,
                                             a
which are never broke or mounted. They remain during
their whole lives     in   a   state   of    perfect    liberty
                                                             ;  and for every
thirty or forty mares          there    is   a   stallion, which enjoys the
fame independence.  They are counted once or twice    week,               a
in order that they may not stray from the habitation.  But

33*                      An Account of     the
 too little care is employed in the choice of the stallions ; and
 this, in all probability, is one of the principal causes why
these horses, though left at full liberty, are neither so beau
tiful nor so good as those of Andalusia, from which they are
descended.       The industry of man improves      the breed  of those
 animals     which   be appropriates to his       own use, and, by
bringing their shape and organs to perfection, indemnifies
them for that liberty of which he deprives them. Each
stallion takes possession of a small troop of mares, which he
keeps collected by preffing them       with his  chest, and by biting
them    if they do not obey with sufficient docility : the mares,
on the other hand, remain attached to their sultans.            If twa
stallions fight, the mares do not abandon the conquered for
the conqueror, unless the former has (hewn among them a
deficiency of vigour.
   . The sillies remain with their mothers.        When it is time
to break the colts they are cut, for no person mounts a horse
until that operation has been performed. After castration,
a halter is put upon the animal intended to be broke ; he is
tied to a stake   ; a saddle is placed upon his back, and well
girded,    but  without  crupper or breast-leather, and a thong
is tied round his under-lip, to which is fastened, on each
fide, a rein, in order to govern him. The horseman then
mounts with large spurs, and rides out into the fields. At
first the young horse capers and jumps         until he is quite fa
tigued; after which he is brought back to the stake. This
exercise is repeated several times in the course of the same
day, and is renewed after the interval of several days until
the courser capers no more. He is then employed as a broke
horse, but with a halter oply ; a bridle is not put upon him
till a year after, at which time he quits the name of rodo-
mont to assume that of horse.
     As soon as the horses are cut, they are separated from the
mares, and put among the animals of the horse species Used
for service, which receive no other shelter or food than what
they find in the fields.    They are accustomed to live in one
canton,     which they    never   quit.   Each unites himself to a
companion, and with          such   intimacy    that instances have
been known of some of them, after running awav, having
                                                             returned

returned more than sixty leagues to rejoin their old friend.
These friends know each other by their neighing, their smell,
and the noise of their pace.
   When the proprietors are desirous to prevent a numerous
troop of domestic horses from separating, they place among
them a young mare with a small bell, and which is then
called the godmother. They all follow her, and they all
know and seek for each other as members of the fame so
ciety. The same effect may be produced by attaching the
bell to one of the horses of the troop.
   When the inhabitants have need of horses, a man on
horseback, bearing a lance, proceeds towards a troop of
these animals, and drives them into an inclosure formed of
pallisades.  A horseman then enters      and, when he it,                     it
within reach, entangles the horse which he wishes to
catch with         a   kind of rope     ;    for, though these horses are fit
to be mounted,           and    said to be docile, they       will not suffer
themselves   to be touched with the hand.
   From   what   has been said,    may be readily seen that there
                                            it
is really very little difference between the habits of these wild
horses and of those which live in       state of domesticity.
                                                 a                             It
needs excite no wonder, therefore, that there should be very
little in regard to their form, size, and qualities.
      When        the inhabitants wish to convert some          of   these   wild
horses into         domestic          mounted on horseback
                                    ones,   people
proceed towards     troop of the former; and when they ap
                         a
proach them they throw some of the ropes already mentioned
around their legs,      that, being prevented from running,
                               so
they have time to secure  them. They are then tied to stake,           a
 or   a    not by the four legs, as some have said, but with
          tree,
a  simple halter made of leather.   They are lest two or three
 days without food or drink, are afterwards
                                            cut, and are then
 broke in the fame manner as the domestic horses. The horse
                    he had never been wild   but        not true
                                                                it
 behaves then as        if                                 ;    is
 that they lose all desire of recovering their liberty.    They
 readily unite with   troop of wild horses
                           a               and how can ;  be                 it
 otherwise, since those even which have been reared in state             a
 of domesticity have no repugnance to join them                 ?

those horses which have been tamed,               not only to        endeavour
frighten away the wild horses, but even to exterminate them.
With that view they beat the woods in quest of them, drive
them,             if   possible,    into ravines,        and      kill them by          means    of
lances.
    The Pampas eat their flesh, and particularly that of the
fillies, colts, and mares ; but they sometimes kill a very fat
stallion to make a fire with his grease and bones, as in the
country of Pampa wood is extremely scarce.
   The Spanish author often contradicts Buffon, not only in
regard to local observations, which is not astonishing, but
also     in       regard      lo   general      ideas,    such as the influence            of cli
mate, &c.                D. Felix Azara          refutes the assertion            of   the French
naturalist, who ascribes more strength                                    and   fleetness to the
wild than                         of these countries. He even
                        to the domestic horses
asserts, that he has not been correct in saying that each wan
dering troop submit, by common consent, to a chief, which
serves as a guide;                  which regulates            and    directs their move
ments    forms them in the order of battle, by files, compa
              ;
nies, squadrons, &c. The truth, according to the author,                                         is,
that each stallion appropriates to himself as marry mares as
he can, which he takes care of, and keeps collected that                                  j
he combats any other stallion which attempts to deprive him
of them;      and that each wandering troop consists, therefore,
of   a    number of small distinct bodies, which sometimes unite
into one.
     In   the great number                of wild        troops    which        the author saw,
he never observed any other prevailing colours than bay,
dark brown, and jet black. If sometimes happens that      it                                     a
pied or dirty grey coloured individual   seen, or one of any         is
other colour,    may with certainty be concluded that
                             it                                                            it   is   a
domestic horse which has deserted. According to the author,
there      are ninety            bay for one dark brown horse   and black         ;
horses are              so   uncommon, that one of them   scarcely seen in is
two thousand.                     He   thence    infers, that these three colours,
bay, dark brown, and jet black, are      primitive mark, which a
distinguishes, at least in part, the horses which recover their
liberty   that the first horse and mare which existed had one
           ;
•f   these three colours,                 and most probably the bay, since                       it
                                                                                          appears

appears that, among the wild horses, the black is becoming
extinct, and that this will be the cafe also with the brown ;
that, taking the colour as an index, we might fay, that the
best breed of horses is the bay, then the brown, and next
the black    ;  all the other colours being inferior, as they are
the result of more distant degradations from the primitive
horse,    which must have been the most perfect.               Experience
seems,    in some measure, to confirm these conjectures ; for,
 except   in a few cafes, which are of little consequence, the
 bays are the most esteemed,         and    the   browns hold the next
 rank.    He   observes, that in France a prejudice is entertained
 against   the   last-mentioned colour, which he thinks unrea
 sonable, and which in his opinion seems to (hew that the
 French, in this respect, have not so much discernment as the
 Spaniards. These observations, and the inferences which the
 author draws from them, seem to weaken the confidence
 which might        be placed in what has been said by Buftbn, on
 the authority of Herodotus, Leo Africanus, and Marco Polo,
 of wild white horses said to have existed in Arabia and Nu-
  midia.    We know how          suspicious     the testimony    of the an
 cients is in regard to natural history, and that the authority
  of Buffon himself has little weight when he gives testimonies
  instead  of  observed facts.

   FiROM         the accounts    of the former      pearl fisheries at Cey
  lon, it will   be found, that none have ever been so productive
  as this year's.      It  was   generally supposed that the renter
   would be infallibly ruined, as the sum he paid for the pre
  sent fishery was thought exorbitant when compared with
   what had been formerly given : but this conjecture in the
   event appeared ill-founded,        as it  proved   extremely profitable
   and lucrative.
      The farmer this time was           a   Tamul merchant, who, for

  the privilege of fisliing with more than the usual number of
  donies or boats, paid between two and three hundred thou-
  land Porto-novo pagodas         ; a sum  nearly double the usual rent.
     These boats he farmed out again to individuals in the best
 manner he could, but for want of a sufficient number of
 divers some of them could not be employed.
     The fishing, which commonly began about the middle of
 February, if wind and weather allowed, was this year, for
 various reasons, delayed till the end of the month ; yet, so
 favourable was the weather, that the renter was able to take
 advantage of the permission granted by the agreement, to fisli
 a little longer than the usual period of thirty days.
    The fishery cannot well be continued after the setting-in
 of the     southern    monsoon, which usually happens about the
 15th of April, as, after that time, the boats would not be
able to reach the pearl banks, and the water being then so
troubled by heavy seas, diving would be impracticable ; in
addition to which, the sea-weed, a species of fucus, driven

ble distance from the shore, would be an impediment.
    Many of the divers, being Roman Catholics, leave the
fishery on Sundays to attend divine service in their church at
Aripoo     ; but   if either  a Mahomedan or         Hindoo  festival hap
pens during the fishing days, or          if it is interrupted by fiormy
weather, or any other accident, this lost time is made up by
obliging the Catholics to work on Sundays.
    The    fear   of  sharks,   as  we shall fee hereafter,    is also an
other cause of interruption.            These, amongst some others,
are the reasons that, out of two months, (from February till
April,) seldom more than thirty days can be employed in the
fishery.
    As this time would          be insufficient to fish all the banks,
(each of which has its appropriate name, both in Dutch and
Tamul,) it is carried on for three or four successive years,
and a new contract annually made, till the whole banks have
been fished     ; after which they arc left to recover.
    The length of time        required  for this purpose,   or from one
general fishing to another, has not yet             been  exactly deter
mined    3
            it was therefore a practice to depute some persons to
                                                                      visit

  visit the banks annually,            and to give their opinion,          whether
 a fishery might be undertaken with any degree                     of  success * ?
      From various accounts, which I have collected                     from good
 authority, and the experience of thole who assisted at such
 examinations, I conjecture, that every seven years such a
 general fishery could be attempted with advantage, as this
 interval seems sufficient             for the pearl shells to attain their
 growth : I am also confirmed in this opinion by a report,
 made by a Dutch governor at Jafnas, of all the fisheries that
 have been undertaken at Ceylon since 172a ; a translation ot
 which is to be found in Wolfe's Travels into Ceylon.                          But
 the ruinous condition            in which        the   divers   leave   the pearl
 banks at each fishery, bv attending only to the prosit of in
 dividuals, and not to that of the public, is one great cause
 that it requires twice the above-mentioned space of time, and
 sometimes longer, for rendering the fishing productive. They
 do not pay the least attention to spare the young and imma
 ture sliells that contain no pearl ; heaps of them are seen
 thrown out of the boats                as   useless   on the beach       between
 Manftr f and Aripoo : if these had                  been    suffered   to remain
 in their native beds, they would,                   no doubt, have produced
iiiauv line pearls.           It might therefore be advisable to oblige
the boat-people to throw them into the sea again before the,
boats leave the bank.              If this circumspection, in sparing the
small      pearl    shells to perpetuate        the breed,      was always ob
served,      succeeding fisheries might be expected sooner, and
with     still  greater success: but the neglect of this simple pre
caution will, I fear, be attended with similar fatal conse
quences        here,   as have already        happened      to the pearl     banks
on the coast        of  1'ersia, South America,            and Sweden, where
the fisheries are by no means so profitable at present as they
were formerly.
     Another       cause   of   the destruction       of numbers of both old
and     young pearl sliells         is   the   anchoring of so many boats

on the banks; almost all of them                           used    differently formed,
clumsy, heavy, wooden anchors, large stones, Sec. &c.       If
this evil cannot be entirely prevented, it might, at least, be
greatly lessened, by obliging them all to use anchors of a
particular fort, and less destructive.
  This season the Seewel Bank only was fished, which lies
above twenty miles to the westward                              of Aripoo,     opposite to
the fresh water rivers           of Moosalee, Modragam,
                                                   and Pompa-
ripoo.       It                that
                   has been observed, the pearls on the north
west part of this bank, which consists of rock, arc of a clearer
water than those found on the south-east, nearest the shore,
growing on corals and sand.
   Condatchey is situated in a bay, forming nearly a half
moon, and is a waste, sandy district, with some miserable
huts built on it. The water is bad and brackisli, and the
soil producesonly a few, widely scattered, stunted trees and
bushes.   Those persons who remain here during the sistiery
are obliged to get their water for drinking from Aripoo, a
village with a small old fort, lying about four miles to the
southward.   Tigers, porcupines, wild hogs, pangolincs, or
the Ceylon armadillos, are, amongst other quadrupeds,   here
common.             Of amphibia,          there       arc tortoises,     especially    the
tejludo geometrica,           and      various kinds of snakes.              A    concho-
logist meets here with a large field for his enquiries.     The
presents which  I made  to the people employed in the   n'sherv,
to encourage them to collect all sorts of (hells which the
divers bring on shore, produced but little effect; as they were
too much taken up in searching after the mother-of-pearl
{hells to pay attention to any other object.      However, my
endeavours        not entirely useless; I will specify here a

      During     the fishing season,       the desert, barren place        Con-

  nishing.     A   heterogeneous     mixture of thousands of people, of
  different colours, countries, casts, and occupations; the num
  ber of tents and huts erected on the sea-sliore, with their
  shop.*   or bazars before       each    of  them ; and the many boats
  returning on shore in the afternoon, generally richly laden ;
  all together form a spectacle entirely new to an European
  eye.     Each owner runs to his respective boat as soon as it
  reaches the shore, in hopes         of finding it fraught with immense
  treasure,    which is often much greater in imagination than
  in the shell ; and though he is disappointed one day, he relies
  with greater certainty on the next, looking forward to the
  fortune promised        him bv his (tars, as he thinks it impossible
  for the astrological     predictions of his BrAhmen to err.
     To    prevent     riot and disorder,       an officer with     a  party of
  Malays is stationed here.         They occupy       a large square,     where
  they have a field-piece, and a flag-staff for signals.
     Here and there you meet with brokers, jewellers, and mer
  chants, of all descriptions        ;  also sultlers,     offering provisions
  and other articles to gratify the sensual appetite              and   luxury.
  But   by. far the greater number are occupied with the pearls.
  Some are busily employed in assorting them ; for which pur
  pose they make use of small brass plates perforated with holes
  of different sizes ; other? are weighing, and offering them to

the purchaser; while others arc drilling or boring them,
which they perform for a trifle.
    The instrument these people carry about with them for
this purpose is of       a very   simple     construction,       but requires
much skill and exercise to        use  it  ; it  ii made in the following
manner:       The principal    part consists      of  a piece   of soft wood,
of an   obtuse, inverted, conical shape, about six               inches high
and four in diameter in its plain surface; this is supported
by three wooden feet, each of which is more than a foot in
length.      Upon the upper flat part of this machine are holes
or pits for the larger pearls, and the smaller ones arc beat
in with a wooden hammer. On the right fide of this stool,
half a cocoa-nut shell is fastened, which is filled with water.
The drilling instruments         are iron       spindles,   of various   sizes,
adapted to the different dimensions             of  the   pearls,   which are
turned round in a wooden head-by a bow. The pearls being-
placed on the flat surface of the inverted cone, as already
mentioned, the operator, sitting on a mat, prides on the
wooden head of his instrument with the left hand, while,
with his right,       he moves     the    bow which        turns round the
moveable part of the drill ; at the fame time he moistens the
pearl, occasionally dipping the little singer of the fame hand
into the water of the cocoa-nut               (hell   with  a  dexterity that
can only be attained by constant practice.
    Amongst the crowd arc found vagabonds                  of every descrip
tion, such     as  Pandarams, Andee or Hindu monks, fakirs,
 beggars,    and the like, who are impertinently                troublesome.
Two of      these wretches particularly attracted           the attention    of
 the mo!),    though their superstitious penance must have dis
 gusted   a   man of the least reflection: one had a gridiron, of
 one foot and      a  half long and the fame in breadth, fastened
 round his neck, with which he always walked about, nor
 did he take it off either when eating or sleeping; the other
 had fastened round that member which                   decency    forbids me
 to mention, a brass ring, and fixed to it was a chain, of a
 fathom in length, trailing on the ground ; the links of this
 chain were as thick as a man's finger, and the whole was
 exhibited in    a   molt scandalous manner.

  insufferably offensive when the south-west                 wind blows, that it
  sensibly affects the olfactory nerves             of any one      unaccustomed
  to such cadaverous           smells.     This putrefaction        generates  im
  mense numbers            of worms, flies,     muskitoes,     and other vermin,
  all together forming a scene strongly displeasing                  to the senses.
       Those who are not provided with a sufficient stock of mo
   ney suffer great hardships, as not only all kinds of provisions
   are very dear, but even every drop of good water must be
   paid for.       Those who drink the brackish water of this place
*
   are often      attacked by sickness.            It may easily be conceived
   what an effect the extreme heat of the day, the cold of the
   night, the heavy dews, and the putrid smell, must have on
   weak constitutions.             It is therefore   no wonder, that of those
   who fall sick many die, and many more return home with
   fevers, fluxes, or other equally fatal disorders.
       The many disappointments usually experienced by the
    lower    classes of men in particular, make them often repent
    of their coming here. Thev arc often ruined, as they risk
    all they are worth to purchase pearl shells : however, there
    are many instances of their making a fortune beyond all ex*-
    pectation. A particular circumstance of this kind fell within
                                                                                   *
    my own observation : a day labourer bought three oysters
    for a copper fanam, (about the value of two-pence,) and was
    so fortunate as to find one of the largest pearls which the
    fistiery produced        this  season.
        The donics appointed for            the fishery are not all procured
   -at Ceylon      ;   many came from the roasts of Coromandel and
    Malabar,         each of which has its distinguishing number.
     About      ten o'clock       at night a gun is fired as a signal,         when
     they fail from Condatchey with an easterly or land wind,
     under the direction of a pilot.                If the wind continues fair,
     they reach the bank before day, and begin diving at fun-rife,

    Each boat carries twenty-one men and five heavy diving-
stones, for the use of ten divers, who are called in Tamul
 iooly kdrer;    the rest   of the crew confists       of  a  tandel, or head
boatman, and ten rowers, who assilt in listing up the divers
and their shells.
    The diving-stone      is a piece      of coarse granite, a foot lone;,
fix inches thick,     and    of  a  pyramidical shape, rounded at the
top and bottom.         A   large hair rope is put through a hole in
the top.     Some of the divers use another kind of stone, shaped
like  a half moon,     to bind round their belly, fo that their sect
may be free.       At  present     these are articles       of  trade at   Con-
datehey.     The   most common, or pyramidical               stone, generally
weighs about thirty pounds.               If a boat has more than five
of them, the crew are either corporally punished or fined.
    The diving, both at Ceylon and at.Tutucorin, is not attend
ed  with   Co manv difficulties      as  authors imagine.          The divers,
confisting of different      cafts and      religions,    (though chiefly of
Parrawer *      and   Mussulmans,) neither make their bodies
smooth with oil, nor do they stop their ears, mouths, or
noses with any thing, to prevent the entrance of falt water. .
They    are ignorant    of  the utility    of diving-bells,      bladders,   and
double flexible pipes.         According        to the    injunctions of the
shark conjurer they use no food while               at work,      nor till they
return on shore and         have bathed         themselves     in fresh water.
These Indians, accustomed            to dive from their earliest insancv,
searlessly descend     to the bottom, in a depth             of from     five to
ten fathoms, in search of treasures.              By two cords       a  diving-
stone   and   a  net arc connected           with   the boat.       The diver,
putting    the toes   of his right foot on the hair rope of the
diving-stone, and      those of his lest on the net, seizes the two
cords with one hand> and, shutting his nostrils with the other,
plunges into the water. On reaching the bottom, he hangs
the net round his neck, and collects into it the pearl fhells

as fast as possible       during the time he finds himself able to
remain under water, which usually is about two minutes.
He then resumes his former posture, and making a signal, by
pulling the cords, he is immediately lifted into the boat. On
emerging from the lea, he discharges a quantity of water from
his mouth and nose, and those who have not been long enured
to diving      frequently discharge some blood; but this does not
prevent     them from diving again in their turn.                      When the
first five divers come up, and are respiring, the other five are
going down with the fame stones.                        Each brings up about
one hundred oysters in his net, and,                 if not interrupted by any
accident, may make fifty trips in a                 forenoon. They and the
boat's crew get generally from the owner, instead of money,
a fourth of the quantity which they bring on shore; but some
are paid     in  cash, according to agreement.
    The   most skilful divers come from                Collifli, on   the coast  of
Malabar      ; some    of them      are so much exercised in the art, as to
be able to perform it without the assistance                of the  usual weight,
and for a handsome          reward        will remain under water for the
space    of   seven minutes       :   this   I saw performed by a Cassry
boy, belonging          to a citizen at Karical,           who had often fre
quented       the fisheries     of    these banks.        Though Dr. Halley
deems this impossible,           daily experience          convinces us, that,
by long practice, any man may bring himself to remain under
water above       a  couple of minutes.              How much the inhabit

    Every one of the divers, and even the most expert, enter
tain a great dread of the sharks, and will not, on any ac
count, descend until the conjurer has performed his cere
monies.        This prejudice          is so deeply rooted in their minds,
that the government was obliged to keep two such conjurers

his inclination for wealth.      I will not pretend to determine how far this

  always in their pay, to remove the fears of their divers.
  Thirteen of these men were now at the fishery from Ceylon
  and the coast, to profit by the superstitious folly of these
  deluded     people.     They     are called in      Tamul    Pillal Kadtar,
 which     signifies one who binds the sharks,             and prevents them
  from doing mischief.
     The manner of enchanting consists in a number of prayers
 learned by heart, that nobody, probably not even the con
jurer himself, understands, which he, standing on the shore,
 continues muttering and grumbling from fun-rife until the
 boats return : during this period they are obliged to abstain
 from food and sleep, otherwise their prayers would have no
 avail  ;  they are, however, allowed to             drink, which privilege
 they indulge in        a  high degree, and are frequently so giddy
 as to be rendered very unfit for devotion.                 Some of the con
jurers accompany the divers in their boats ; which pleases
them very much, as they have their protectors near at hand.
Nevertheless, I was told, that in one of the preceding sislieries
a diver lost his leg by a stiark ; and when the head conjurer
was called to an account for the accident, he repHed, that an
old witch had just come from the coast, who, from envy and
malice, had caused this disaster by a counter-conjuration,
which made fruitless his skill, and of which he was informed
too late    :  but he afterwards          shewed    his superiority by en
chanting the poor sliarks           so  effectually, that, though they ap
peared in the midst of the divers, they were unable to open
their mouths. During my stay at Condatchey, no accident
of this kind      happened.         If a  sliark is seen, the divers imme
diately make a signal, which on perceiving, all the boats re
turn instantly.        A diver who trod upon a hammer-oyster,
and was somewhat wounded, thought he was bit by a shark,
consequently       made the usual signal; which caused many boats
to   return; for which mistake            he was afterwards      punished.
    The owners of the boats*             sometimes     fell their oysters, ami
at other times open them on their own account.                     In the latter
cafe,    some put them on mats in a square, surrounded with a

ftnee;    others   dig holes of almost a foot deep, and throw
them in till the animal dies; aster which they open the
shells,  and take out the pearls with more ease.                Even these
squares and holes are fold by auction aster the fishery is
finished,   as pearls often   remain there mixed with the fand.
   In spite of every care, tricks in picking out the pearls from
the oysters can hardly be prevented.             In this the natives are
extremely dexterous.         The following is one mode they put
in practice    to essect their purpose     :  when     a boat-owner em
ploys a number of hired people to collect pearls, he places
over them an inspector of his own, in whom he can confide ;
these hirelings previoufly agree that one of them shall play
the   part of a thies,     and bear    the punishment, to give his
comrades an opportunity of pilsering.               If one of the gang
happens     to  meet   with   a  large pearl,    he   makes a fign to his
accomplice, who instantly conveys away one of small value,
purposely, in such a manner as to attract notice.                  On this
the   inspector and the       rest  of the men take the pearl from
him    : he is then punished, and turned out           of their company.
In   the mean time,      while  he is making a dreadsul uproar, the
real thies secures the valuable pearl, and asterwards the booty
is shared with him who sussered for them all.               Befides tricks
like these, the boat-owners and purchasers often lose many
of the best pearls while the dony is returning from the bank ;
for, as long as the animal is alive, and untouched, the shells
are frequently open near an inch ; and is any of them con
tain  a large pearl,    it is eafily discovered, and taken out by
means    of  a small piece of stiss grass, or bit of stick, without
hurting the pearl fish.       In this practice they        are extremely
expert.     Some of them were discovered whilst               I was there,
and received their due punishment.
   Gmelin     asks, is the animal    of the mytilus margaritiferus is
an ascidia?      See  Linn. Syst.    Nat. torn. I. p. vi. 3350. This
induces me to believe that it has never             yet been accurately
described ; it does not resemble        the ascidia of Linnæus, and
may, perhaps,      form a new genus. It is fastened to the upper
and lower shells by two white flat pieces of muscular sub

about two inches from the                   thick part of the body, growing
gradually thinner.                The extremity of        each ear lies loose, and
is surrounded           by    a double    brown fringed line. These he al
most      the third          of  an inch     from the outer part of the shell,
and      are continually moved              by the animal.              Next  to these,
above and below, are situated two other double fringed move-
able substances,             like the branchiae of         a fish.     These ears and
fringes are joined to a cylindrical piece of flesh of the size of
a man's thumb, which is harder and of a more muscular
nature than the             rest  of  the body.       It  lies about the centre        of
the shells, and is firmly attached to the middle                       of each.    This,
in    fact, is that part         of the pearl fish which serves to open and
shut the         fliells. Where this column is fastened, we find on
the flesh        deep impressions, and on the shell various nodes of
round or oblong forms, like imperfect pearls.                            Between this
 part and the hinge (cardo) lies the principal body of the ani
mal, separated from the rest, and shaped like a bag.                                 The
mouth is near the hinge of the shell, enveloped in a veil, and
has      a double flap or lip on each fide ; from thence we ob
serve the throat {œsophagus) descending                        like    a thread   to the
stomach.             Close     to the    mouth there         is a curved brownish
tongue, half an inch in length, with an obtuse point ; on
the concave fide of this descends a furrow, which the ani
mal opens and shuts, and probably uses to convey food to
its mouth *. Near its middle are two blueish spots, which
seem      to be the eye?.            In  a pretty deep       hole, near the     base   of
the tongue, lies the beard                  (bxjsus),      fastened by two fleshy
roots,       and consisting        of   almost   one     hundred fibres,       each an
inch long, of             a   dark green colour, with              a  metallic lustre ;
     *  The     depth at which the pearl fi(h generally is to be found,         hindered
mt from paying           any attention to the locomotive power,         wnich I have not
tiic   least    doubt it possesses, using for this purpose its tongue.        This   con
 jecture     is  strengthened by the accurate observations made on muscles by
the cc'ebra:ed Reaumur,            in which he found th.it this body serves them as
a leg or arm,        to move fiom one place to another.          Though the divers    are
very ignorant with regard to the ceconomy of the pearl Alb, this changing
of habitation has been long since observed by them. They allege, that it
alters its abode, when disturbed by an enemy, or in search of food. In the
 former     case they      say it commonly   descends    from    the summit of the bark
to its declivity.
                                                                                    they

            An Account of the Pearl        Fishery at Ceylon.            347
 they are undivided, parallel,         and flattened.     In   general,  the
 hyffus   is more than three quarters            of an inch   without the
 cleft (rima)   ; but if  the animal      is disturbed, it contracts it
 considerably.      The  top of each of these threads terminates
in a circular gland or head, like the Jligma of many plants.
With this byffks they fasten themselves to rocks, corals, and
other solid bodies; by it the young pearl fisti cling to the
old ones, and with it the animal procures its food, by ex
tending and contracting it at pleasure.               Small shell fish, on
which they partly live,         are often found clinging to the for
mer. The stomach lies           close to the      root of the beard, and
has, on its lower side, a protracted         obtuse point.      Above the
stomach are two small         red bodies,     like lungs;    and from the
stomach      goes a long channel or gut, which takes a circuit
round the muscular column above mentioned, and ends in
the anus, which lies opposite to the mouth, and is covered
with a small thin leaf, like a flap. Though the natives pre
tend to distinguish the sexes          by the appearance of the shell,
I   could not find any genitalia.              The large flat ones they
call males,     and those that arc thick, concave, and vaulted,
they call females, or pedoo- chippy, but, on a close inspec
tion, I could not observe any visible sexual difference.
    It is remarkable that some          of  these animals are as red as
blood, and that the inside of the shell has the fame colour,
with the      usual  pearly lustre   ;  though my servants found a
reddish pearl in an oyster       of this colour,     yet such an event is
very rare.      The  divers attribute this        redness  to the sickness
of the pearl fish, though it is most probable that they had it
from their first existence. In the shade they will live twenty-
four hours after being taken out of the water.                This animal
is eaten     by the lower class of Indians, either fresh in their
curries, or cured by drying ; in which state they are exported
to the coast; though I do not think them by any means
palatable.
    Within a mother-of-pearl sliell I found thirteen murices
tiudati {vide Chemnitz'sNew System, Cabt. Vol. XI. tab. 192,
f. 1831 and 1852), the largest of which was three quarters
of an inch long; but, as many of them were putrid, and the
pearl fish itself dead,     I  could not ascertain whether they had

 crept in as enemies,     or were drawn in by the animal itself.
At any rate turtles and crabs are inimical to the animals, and
a small living crab was found in one or them.
    The pearls are only in the softer part of the animal, and
never in that firm muscular column        above mentioned.       We
find them in general near the earth, and on both sides of the
mouth.      The natives entertain the fame foolish opinion con
cerning the formation of the pearl which the ancients did :
they suppose them formed from dew-drops in connection with
fun-beams.       A Brahmen informed me that it was recorded
in one of his Sanscrit books, that the pearls are formed in the
month of May at the appearance of the Soatee star (one of
their twenty-seven constellations), when the oysters come up
to the surface of the water to catch the drops of rain.          One
of  the most celebrated                  *
                            conchologists supposes that the pearl
is formed by the oyster in order to defend itself from the at
tacks of the fholades and boreworms . But we may be as-               _
sured that in this supposition he is mistaken ; for, although
these animals often penetrate       the outer layers    of  the pearl
shell, and there occasion     hollow nodes,   yet, on examination,
it will   be found that they are never able to pierce the firm
layer with which the inside of the shell is lined.          How can
the pearls be formed as a defence against exterior worms,
when, even on shells that contain them, no worm-holes are
to be seen ? It is therefore more probable these worms take
up their habitations in the nodes in order to protect them
selves from the attacks of an enemy, than that they are ca
pable of preying on an animal so well defended as the pearl
fish is.   It is unnecessary to repeat the various opinions and
hypotheses of other modern authors; it is much easier to
criticise them, than to substitute in their place a more ra
tional theory. That of Reaumur, mentioned in the memoirs
of  the French Academy for 1712, is the most probable, viz.
that the pearls are formed like bezoars and other stones in
different animals, and are apparently the effects of a disease.
In sliort, it is very evident that the pearl is formed by an ex
travasation   of a glutinous juice, either within    the body, or on
the surface   of the animal : the former case is      the most com-

            An Account of the       "Pearl Fishery at Ceylon.         349
inon,     Between one and two hundred pearls have been found
within    one oyster.       Such extravasations may be caused by
heterogeneous bodies, such as sand, coming in with the food,
which the animal, to prevent disagreeable friction, covers
with its glutinous matter, and which, as it is successively
secreted, forms many regular lamellae in the manner of the
coats of an onion, or like different strata of bezoars, only
much thinner; this is probable, for if we cut through the
centre of a pearl, we often find a foreign particle, which
ought to be considered as the nucleus, or primary cause of
its formation.       The loose pearls may originally have been
 produced    within    the body, and, on their increase,         may have
 separated   and    fallen into the cavity of the shell.             Those
 compact ones, fixed to the shells, seem to be produced by
 similar extravasation         occasioned      by the friction of some
 roughness    on   the    inside  of  the  stiell.   These and the pearl-
 like nodes have      a different aspect from the pearls, and are of
 a  darker and bluer colour.          In one of the former I found a
 pretty large, true, oval pearl,       of a very   clear water; while the
 node itself was    of  a  dark blueish colour.       The yellow or gold-
 coloured pearl, is the most esteemed by the natives; some have
 a bright red lustre ; others are grey, or blackish, without any
 shining appearance, and of no value.               Sometimes, when the
 grey   lamella  of  a  pearl  is taken   off,  under  it is found a beau
 tiful genuine one      ;  but it oftener happens that, after having
  separated  the first coat,      you find a worthless impure pearl.
  I tried several  of them, taking one lamella off after another,
  and   found clear and impure by turns ; and in an impure
  pearl I met with one of a clear water, though in the centre
  of all I found a foreign particle. The largest and most per
  fect  pearl which I saw during my stay at Condatchcv w.w
  about the size of a small pistol bullet, though I have been
  told since my departure many others of the fame size have
  been found.      The spotted and irregular ones are fold cheap,
  and are chiefly used by the native physicians            as an ingredient
  in their medicines.
     We may judge with             greater or lesser probability,    by the
  appearance    of  the pearl shell,     whether they contain pearls or
  not.    Those that have a thick calcareous crust upon them,

  1 HE       happy applications which C. Berthollet has made
of the oxygenated muriatic acid, in the bleaching of stuffs
manufactured from vegetable substances, seems to have car
ried this art very near to perfection ; but this method is not
every where attended with the fame degree of economy. Be
sides, the process requires very skilful hands, that the stuffs
may not be destroyed by too corrosive leys, or leys impro
perly, employed; and therefore we ought not to omit making
known other processes, in order that manufacturers may
choose those which they may         think   most beneficial.     I  shall
therefore here describe a process, both simple and economical,
for bleaching cotton yarn.
   At the distance of about         one foot four inches from the
grate of a common furnace,         place a copper kettle    of a  round
form, one foot and     a half in depth and four feet in diameter,
and fix it  in thai position.     The brim of this kettle, about
six inches in breadth, being bent outwards, will rest on the
lateral edges of the mason- work of the furnace. The re
mainder of the furnace must be constructed of cut stone, in
the form of an oval boiler, six feet in height, and in breadth,
measured from the centre, five feet.          The upper part of the
furnace has a round aperture, in diameter about a foot and a
half.    This aperture may be closed by means of a moveable
stone,  or a cdpper lid made for the purpose.          On the edge of
the copper kettle, which forms the bottom of this species of
digester, place a kind of grate consisting of wooden bars,
brought pretty near to each other in order that the cotton
laid upon them may not fall through, and sufficiently strong
to sustain the weight of about 1600 pounds. When this
apparatus    has been constructed, impregnate the cotton dis
posed   in bundles, with a flight solution of soda, rendered
caustic   by lime: this operation must be performed in a
wooden or stone trough, in which the cotton may be trod

burning the cotton or the bottom of the boiler.       To form
the alkaline ley, soda of Alicant may be .employed equal to a
tenth part of the weight of the cotton on which you operate;
and in a boiler such as I                    have described,        about 800 pounds
of cotton may be subjected                    to the process at one time.                 At
the moment when the cotton is introduced and arranged in
the boiler, the aperture at top is shut, by its usual covering,
as closely as possible, in order that the vapours may assume
a. greater degree of heat, and re-act with more force on the
cotton. The sire of the furnace is then to be kindled *, and
the ley must be kept in a state of slight ebullition for from
twenty to thirty-six hours.   It is then suffered to cool, and
the cotton being carefully washed,                       must       be exposed on the
grass for two or three days, extending it on poles in the day
time, and spreading it out on the grass during the night. The
cotton will then have acquired a superb degree of whiteness j
and     if,     by
           chance, any parts of the cotton are still coloured,
it   must be put into the kettlesecond time, or be exposed

few days longer on the grafs.   These shades in the bleached
cotton are owing in particular to its not having been all
equally and completely impregnated with the ley they may                    ;
arise also from the arrangement                 of the cotton in the boiler,               if
it   has been heaped up too                 much in certain points. When                   it
is   judged that the ley has been exhausted                         by   ebullition,      the
cover       of   the kettle       is   to be taken off, and the dry cotton must
be besprinkled with               a    new solution of soda
                                             without this pre   ;

 are bleached            for about seven         shillings sterling. This process
 was brought to us from the Levant some time after the in
 troduction of the process for dyeing the Adrianople red.                                      It

354                   Method of preparing Inks, tac.
paper   by Philip Christian Pitel of Minden *, in which he
recommended an ink, discovered by him, which was hide'
structiblc, and could be obliterated neither by the oxygen
ated muriatic acid, nor by any other corrosive substance.
This induced M. Werys                   to examine this       ink,   and the fame
thing was undertaken by                 M. Gruner f.          According to their
experiments, this ink, however, was obliterated in the course
of nine hours by the oxygenated muriatic acid, and also by
caustic pot-asti ; but at the fame time an opinion entirely
opposite was announced by                Dr. Lentin      J,   M. Thorey §, and
M.     Wiegleb     ||,   who all, in consequence of their having em
ployed the same test,         declared the ink to be indestructible.
These different opinions are therefore directly contrary to
each other.   M. Gruner found that the ink could be de
stroyed      by   the oxgenated          muriatic      acid, and     by   caustic   al
kali   :   M. Thorey         observed,    that its blackness         was only les
sened      by   the oxygenated           muriatic acid, and          by   the vapour
of   that acid.    He found, however,             as   M. Gruner did, that          the
caustic alkali dissolved the ink entirely from the paper, but
that, like several acids,  destroyed the paper. M. Lentin and
                                   it
Wiegleb deduced from their experiments, those of the for
mer being made with oxygenated muriatic acid, and those
of   the latter with the same, as well as several other acids, and
even caustic alkali,           that this ink was entirely indestructible.
These contradictor)' results M.Westrumb endeavoured to re
solve in his examination of Pitel's indestructible ink, which
he found to be only common ink mixed with indigo;                             and he
proposed the following             mixture for an ink which could not
be destroyed      : — Boil    i    oz. of Brasil wood, and ozs. of pul
                                                                     3
verised galls, with 46 oz. of water; strain the liquor, which
must be boiled down to 32 ozs., and pour      still warm, over it,
11  oz. of perfectly pure sulphate of iron, 1^ oz. of gum ara
ble, and    ioz. rtsined sugar.    When these ingredients are
dissolved, add from      to    oz. good indigo ground exceed
                               1        i^

                        M. Bosse's Paper.
   It is well known that M. Pitel, of Minden, gave the first
account of a kind of ink which withstood the oxygenated
muriatic acid, at the desire of Dr. Lentin, who excited the
attention of the public to various deceptions practised at Paris
with common ink by means of the oxygenated muriatic acid.
As this ink consisted merely of a decoction of logwood and
galls with water, in which sulphate of iron, gum arabic, and
sugar had been dissolved, and with which indigo and lamp
black had been mixed mechanically, according to the ana
lysis  of M. Westrumb, it may      be easily explained  why it exhi
bited such different appearances when brought to the test.
M.    Gruner, apothecary in Hanover, as appears by his letter
to the editor of the Hanoverian Magazine, was able to obli
terate   it entirely by the muriatic acid ; while, on the other
hand, its indestructibility by that acid is confirmed by
M. Wiegleb       and Thorey.     Both   are in the right   : as soon
as the   ink is well stirred round, it withstands this acid ; but,
if not stirred,   this acid dissolves the black oxyd of iron, and
the   paper    in the places wrote upon is restored to its pris
tine state.     Now, though this ink, when stirred round, does
not entirely fail of its object, this circumstance, however,
may be often forgotten ; and this the more readily, as even
without stirring it has all the blackness when used of com
mon ink, on account of the oxyd of iron which it contains.
Since that time I have made experiments in order to produce
an ink which might withstand the oxy-muriatic acid, and vet
contain no iron.      I have been able to accomplish this, as well
as the   composition of some other inks which contain iron,
though it does not make their chief component parts, but
serves only to give the     ink  a  black colour.     I made experi
ments also with the juice of green plants, according to the
process by which M. Murray made an indestructible kind of
ink from      the fame substances.      Iron must not be the chief
component part of an ink destined to withstand the muriatic
acid, because in the state of a black oxyd it is easily dissolved
by the acid.      But as it acts on vegetable colours only when
they are    capable of taking up oxygen, and does not destroy
                                Zz    %                       them,

356                  Method of preparing Inks, &c.
them, but produces by its action a modification of the co
lour, they are exceedingly proper for this purpose. As none
of these, however,      were found entirely black,      I was obliged
to employ some mineral            body which     might be black and
yet hold a great deal of oxygen. The most part of the me
tallic oxyds of a black colour contain verv little oxygen, ex
cept that of manganese, which contains a great deal. I made
choice therefore       of this oxyd,    and found, after repeated ex
periments, that it answered the intended purpose.
    The oxy-muriatic acid dissolves all metals in            a metallic
form    as well   as metallic calces combined with       a small quan
tity of oxygen, but not those which contain a great deal, as
it has itself an excess of it. It is therefore capable,
    i. Of dissolving metals in a metallic state, as the metals
take up its superfluous       oxygen, by which,     as is well known,
they become soluble in acids.
    2. Such metallic oxyds as contain little oxygen are capable
of abstracting it from acids, and they then dissolve in the
acids, which then contain         less oxygen.
   The grounds which induced            me to employ oxyd of man
ganese    for  preparing   an  ink  capable of withstanding the oxy-
muriatic acid, were as follows : —
    I.  Its' black colour   ;  2. its containing  a great   quantity of
oxygen, by which it is insoluble in the muriatic acid ; 3. be
cause it possesses so great an affinity for oxygen, that whenever
it  has   lost any   of its original    quantity by being brought to
a red heat, or exposed to the action         of acids, it immediately
draws it from the atmosphere, and again becomes black.                 I
shall now describe the method of preparing this ink: — Boil
1 oz. of Brazil wood with 12 ozs. of water for a quarter of an
                '
hour;     add     oz. of alum   :  evaporate the whole to 8 ozs., and
mix with the liquor 1 oz. of exceedingly soft, finely pulverised
manganese, mixed up with I oz. of pulverised gum arabic.
   Brazil wood alone, by mere boiling, gives an ink not al
together     unfit for use.    Acids,  less abundant in oxygen, such
as the nitrou6 and muriatic acid, naturally exercise an action
on this ink ; but as these change the paper in a perceptible
manner, deception is not to be apprehended.
    Indigo also affords an ink that withstands            the muriatic
                                                                  acid  :

             History   of Mining in Devon and Cornwall.                    357
acid   :  it therefore    makes a chief component part of that pre
pared by Pitel,       but   it is mixed in it only mechanically. The
following is a prescription for preparing an ink of the like
kind, but in which the indigo is actually dissolved.
    Boil 1 oz. of Brazil wood, and 3 ozs. of coarsely pulverised
galls, with 9 ozs. of vinegar and as much water, for the space
of eight minutes        : in the liquor, after being strained, dissolve
l~   oz.   of  sulphat of iron and 1 oz. of gum arabic, and then
add to the whole a solution of              i oz. of indigo in 1 oz. of
concentrated sulphuric acid.
    The oxy-muriatic acid dissolves the oxyd of iron in this
ink, but the indigo remains undecomposed.                      The principal
point to be attended to is, that the ink may contain such
matters as are not affected            by the oxy-muriatic        acid  :  w'uth
other substances        less  deception is to be dreaded.
    In the     last place,    I  shall mention     an   ink  made    with the
 principal ingredients of common ink, but in preparing
 which, instead of the usual liquids,            I  employed the expressed
juice of some plant: the fittest for this purpose I found to
 be the leaves of the caper spurge, Euphorbia lathyris Linn.j
 the common holly, Sambucus niger, and common grass.

 IT      must be regretted        that a subject   of  so great  national im
 portance, undertakings which engage                 so  large a capital, and
 give employment to so many hands,                  as working the various
 mines in these kingdoms,              should   gain but little attention
 from any but those immediately concerned in them, and near
 the places in which they are situated ; it is the more to be
 wished that men of science should devote some thought to
 these concerns, as those, under whose management most of
 these works are carried           on, are often not men of sufficient
 ability or science to strike out capital           improvements.         To be
 a good      miner requires         an active mind, with industry and
  strict observation      j   these should    be    accompanied by some
                                                                        general

find these qualifications general at present, but the existing
ignorance might surely be soon removed,       the attention of   if,

                   Mining in Devon and Cornwall.                                       355
attracted, long ago,        the visits of other more enlightened
nations.
  The tin of Britain        was known in distant parts                of the world
at a very      remote     period.   It   is generally believed                  that the
Phœnicians        were   the nation principally    engaged in trading
with Britain for this article. Tin           works were certainly car
ried on before iron was in use in England.                        Many tools of
oak are now found which tradition among the tinners make
to have belonged to the Saxons or Danes ; but it is probable,
for the reason before stated, that they were employed before
the time of their having a sooting in this country.
  The greatest quantity of tin was formerly, it is asserted,
found on the forest of Dartmoor, in the county of Devon ;
and works to a vast extent must have been carried on there,
if it   be true, as we are told, that thirty thousand                      men found
employment upon this tract; for all the miners now in Corn
wall do not amount to more than ten thousand.    It    how                       is,
ever, to be considered, that in the ancient mode of working,
without the aid of machinery, many more hands must have
been necessary than at present — should think more than in
                                         I
the proportion of three to one.  All these works on Dart
moor were only on or near the surface  now, however, the
                                                     :
lodes     * or veins of tin found on this district              are not valuable
 enough, or do not continue to such              a   depth as to make them
 very profitable to work.
    Almost all the tin procured in former ages was probably
 from stream-works, in bottoms or low grounds, where frag
 ments of the ore, washed from the lodes in the neighbouring
 hills, subside, and are separated from the earth in granu                      a
 lated form       by
                washing. This, of course,      obtained without

 any subterranean  work.    In such situations as these probably
 metals were first discovered, mixed merely with the upper
 soil, or lodging in clefts of rocks. Thus         gold found inis
 America,        in Africa, in the county of Wicklow                       in Ireland,

 veins or lodes of this metal might doubtless be found near
 the places where such depositions are met with.

  more difficult task than coming at the metal in the way of
  ftream-works ; it requires more energy of mind, and a more
  advanced state of the arts.           The difficulty that must attend
  keeping     a  mine,    funk   to  some  depth, free from water by
 manual labour only, could not but prevent men, before the
 application of machinery, from diving deep into the bowels
 of the earth. We have, however, some instances where old
 workings are found at so great a depth as to be even now
 with difficulty kept dry by          means   of machinery     ;  but these,
 though they may be counted ancient, were probably opened
 long subsequent to die origin of mining in this county.
      There are many mines which could not possibly be worked
 without      the aid of gunpowder, and, until the discovery of
 this powerful agent, underground operations must have been
 uncertain and difficult.          The hammer and wedges of metal
 were probably the first instruments for splitting rocks (and
 they still continue, in the ground that will yield to them, to
 be much used in          Cornwall), and the pick, or instrument for
 cleaving the ground, having a head for driving the wedges
 called by the miners gads, from a Cornish word gedn, a
 wedge.        The form of these instruments found in old works,
 I  think,    offers an evidence    of their antiquity. A pick, which
 was found in Wheal            *  Unity tin mine, in Devon, in a part
 not worked certainly for more than eighty years, and which
 could not probably be reckoned to be less than ioo years
 old, does not differ materially from the form of that now
 used ; while one discovered          in old workings in Drake Walls
 mine, in the parish of Calstock in Cornwall, about ten miles
 distant from the other mine, is of so different a shape as to
 make one conclude, judging by the flow progression of
 changes effected on common instruments, that it is of much
 higher antiquity.         Wedges of dry wood were also very inge
 niously made use of, by driving them into the clefts, and then
 wetting      them,    so as   to cause them to swe!l and force the
ground asunder.           Fire  was an agent long ago employed            for
splitting the rocks; but the effects of gunpowder so far exceed
any thing before made use of for such purposes, that its dtf-

                        Mining in Devon and Cornwall.                                  $6t
 covery and application to works                      of this kind form a grand
 epoch     in   the history    of mining.             This, it appears, took place
 in Hungary or Germany                 about          the year 1620,        and was first
 introduced into England at the copper mine at Ecton, in
 Staffordsliire, about the year 1670, by German miners,
 brought over by Prince Rupert ; but it was not in use in
 Somersetshire  till 1684, after which, probably, the Cornish
 miners became acquainted with this powerful assistant to
 their operations.
     Tin   was the first object         of   the Cornish miner's search, and
 I (hall therefore      first take notice        of   the history   of   the   tin-works.
It   was probably first found,              as   I    have observed, near the sur
face, and not       in regular veins;            almost all the low grounds             in
 Cornwall,        and    I   believe    every bottom on Dartmoor                    forest
in Devon,   bear the marks of having been streamed.       The
Romans, probably, interested themselves in the working of
the mines ; indeed, one principal inducement to that people's
turning their attention to this istand, seems to have been the
metals that were reported to them to be found here.  The
Saxons neglected these hidden treasures, but the Normans
worked them to great advantage. From that time to the end
of the reign of John the mines were not profitable, and
mostly in the hands of the Jews.   They revived in the
time of his son Richard; but in the reign of Edward I. the
Jews were banished the kingdom, and the mines neglected.
Edmund,          the eldest son    of   the king,         and earl of Cornwall,
however, made some important alterations in the regulations
ofthe tin-works by a charter, which was confirmed by Ed
ward I. in the latter part of his reign. Indeed it is from this
time that the peculiar laws and privileges relating to the
Stannaries are chiefly to be dated. Mining infringed in some
instances       on property, and caused disputes,                   besides requiring
indulgences not general ; and thus cases arose not cognisable
by the common law.      In this way a peculiar code, springing
from custom, took its rise; and though this in some mea
sure existed before, yet it was not till this period that it was
confirmed by royal charter, and enforced by subsequent acts
of parliament.  It was by this charter that the bounding
land to the purpose of tinners working on                            it,   the duties to

vfi%                       Sketch   of   the   History of
the earl of Cornwall, and the coinages of tin, or stamping
with the earl's seal, were first established. Before the reign
os Edward I. tinners worked in the earl's land only, paying
him a fifteenth part of what they got, and they were not at
all permitted      to dig in sanctuary            ground, churches, mills,
houses,    gardens,      and so on ; and         if in working under              they
chanced to subvert   any house, or to damage a high-way,
they were obliged to make it good.     When it became an
object to search throughout any place or person's lands, a
court also to determine cases relating to the tin-works be
came necessary;   and this, adjudging under the authority of,
and   according to the code of laws before mentioned, was
first established by Edward I. and is called the Stannary
Court.
   In Cornwall        and Devon two different systems                  of Stannary
laws now exist      :    those    in Cornwall       have been         from time to
time amended and corrected               ;    but in Devon, where mining
has for a long while          slumbered,        the laws continue in their
original crude state.  As the spirit, however, of searching
into the bowels of the earth seems again to be reviving in
this county, the laws, should they be called into action, will
probably undergo some revision.
   The duke of Cornwall had royal jurisdiction, and when
the duchy came into the hands of the crown, which hap
pened      in the reign of Edward III. he made his eldest son,
the Black Prince,     the duke, and appointed   with the re    it,
venue arising from          it,   to the sons and heirs apparent                 of   the
 crown,  though no son of the king can be duke of Cornwall
 but the first-born, even though heir apparent.
       The Stannary laws          were       explained   and   confirmed, with
 some alterations        at different    times, till Arthur, eldest son of
 Henry     VIII.   made certain constitutions relating to the Stan
 naries, which          the tinners refused to observe         :     the king, after
 prince Arthur's         death,     seized     the charter as forfeited,              but
 granted   new one with fresli privileges, appointing all new
            a
 laws relating to the tinners to be made                    by
                                                parliament of    a
 their own body; and upon this footing the Stannaries re
 main.
       Great powers have been at times assumed                     by   this   jurisdic

                    Mining in Devon and Cornwall.                      g'lj
 tion, it has even taken upon it the trial for felony in the cafe
of a tinner; in general, however, the cafes where its autho
 rity interferes, are in disputes concerning tin-works or be
 tween tinners      : it provides a supply of water to a tin-work,
 giving   a   power to conduct it through any lands for that pur
 pose.
    One of the improvements, with regard to tin particularly,
 was the invention       of smelting in reverberatory furnaces with
 pitcoal, instead of the old blowing-houses, as they were called,
with charcoal sires. When this change was first introduced
is not perhaps certainly known : Dr. Watson, in his Che
mical Essays, states, that Becher resided in Cornwall some
years before he died, which was in the year 1682;                  and that
he made many improvements in the                  working of mines and
fluxing      of metals, and introduced           there the method of
smelting tin by the flame of pitcoal thrown upon the ore in a
reverberatory furnace, instead of the sire of wood or charcoal,
 in the way formerly made use of. He takes notice of this in
 the Dedication to       Mr. Bovlc of his Alphabet bum Minerale,
written at Truro in        1682,    not long before he died.         Pryce,
in his Miner alogia       Cornubienjis,    states,  that  this   mode   was
first   prompted by necessity, and many experiments were
made      upon it by Sir Bevil Granvillc, of Stow, in the time
of Charles I. though it was not effectually done till the reign
of Queen Anne.
    I find, in the revision of the Stannarv laws at the convo
cation of the parliament of Stannators assembled in the 26th
year of the reign of George II. mention is made of the
"   ancient laws and constitutions of the Stannaries relating
to tin-blowers, and refining of tin in blowing-bouses,               which
was formerly the only method            of refining of tin ;"     and  it is
said,
        "   of late years    there   has been another method found
out of refining of tin by means of reverberatory furnaces,
which is commonly called smelting of tin."
    Copper, of which so much is now sent from this part of
the country, was not an object attended to, till a compara
tively late date, by the Cornilh miners            :  even in tin mines,
which      as  they   deepened     produced    copper,   as   is often the
cafe, and where they needed to raise this ore,             it was thrown
by   as  of no   value, going by the name        of foder.      Those wh   >

live in the present more enlightened period, are now reaping
profits left to them by the ignorance of their forefathers.
This proves of what consequence it is to determine, if possi
ble, the value of all the substances passing under the miner's
observation.
 Copper, however, was probably worked at a remote period in
Wales, at the Parys mountain, which indeed is supposed to de
rive its name from the Celtic word praas, brass or precious me
tal ; and this would offer a proof of its having been worked
by the ancient Britons.    It was not attended to, or at least
not well understood, in England, till the reign of Queen Eli
zabeth, who paid great attention to the mines of the king
dom, and, by granting great privileges to Daniel Hough-
fetter, Christopher Schutz, and other Germans whom she
invited into England, commenced and established the highly
valuable and important business of finding and purifying this
useful metal.  To these foreigners, too, is owing the flourifli-
ing     state       of our   brass manufactories.            In this reign Parys
mine was granted to patentees, but was not worked, at least
to any advantage, for a century and a half.
   The copper mines of Cornwall now are works of great
magnitude, and some have been sunk to an amazing depth,
and are kept working at a vast e.xpence.   The quantity of
materials constantly used forms an extensive commerce to
this part of the kingdom                ; and      this, as well   as   the mines
themselves,           gives employment to numbers.
     The other         metals      are not        found in Cornwall in great
abundance.             Lead, with silver contained in the ore, is found
in    some places;           and in Devonshire,        on the borders of this
county,         a   very large mine at Berc afforded galena very rich
in    silver.       It was formerly worked as a royal mine, but after
wards lay idle a long time. It has since been feebly tried ;
but though a steam-engine was on                       it,
                                       they could not go (o

   The ores of many of the semi-metals, as zinc, cobalt,
arsenic, manganese, &c. are scattered in different places, and
of late have received attention.
     Mining    has been      improved within this century.

Till about a hundred years ago, the water was drawn from
the mine by dint of human labour; but within these seventy
years the application of hydraulic engines has become gene
ral.  The introduction of the steam-engine formed a grand
æra in the annals of mining j as in many situations no other
power, that could be commanded, could poffibly work the
pumps necessary to raise the water from the bottoms : the
consequence has been, that many mines have been worked
that were formerly abandoned as impossible to be prosecuted.
Other   improvements of late years have been creeping in ;
the dressing of ores, or properly separating them from the
earths, &c. in which they lie, is much better managed than
formerly.
   Great spirit is to be seen in the works in Cornwall ; pro
digious sums are laid out in erecting powerful machinery,

  X. On     the relative Proportions    of Coals and Iron-Stones used
      at the   Blaji-Furnace, and of their proper Application to
      Use.    By Mr. David Mushet, of the Clyde Iron
      works.      Communicated     by the  Author.
  I
  of
     N   the smelting operation a just proportion and association
      materials and mechanical construction ought to be blended
  in order    to produce     the  best possible     effects.   Under    the
  former are comprehended          the cokes, iron-stone, limestone,
  and blast ; by the latter is understood the furnace, the power
 of the blowing-machine, or the compression and velocity
 under which the air is discharged into the furnace, and the
 genius or mechanical (kill of the workmen.                  According to
 this division    I shall endeavour    to point out the very various
 effects    which disproportion in any         case   produces, and vice
 versa.
     In  the preceding papers the coal and iron-stone have been
 traced through their various stages          of preparation,     and that
 stage pointed out       in which they were most suitable for the
 profitable   manufacture     of the metal. It will be necessary to
 carry along with us this fact, that in the exact proportion
 which the quantity of carbon bears to the quantity of metal
 in the ore, and its mixtures, so will be the fusibility, and of
 course the value of the pig-iron obtained.              The importance
of this truth will still farther appear when we consider the
very various qualities of pit-coal, the different proportions of
carbon which they contain, and the various properties                   at
tached to every species of this useful combustible.
    Among       the many strata     of  coal   which     I  have distilled,
some      I  have   found to contain 70 parts in the 100.            This
large proportion is peculiar to the clod-coal, used al some
of the iron-works in England, and justly preferred, for
the purpose      of manufacture, to the purest and hardest variety
of splint-coal.       The latter I have found to average from 50
to 59 parts of carbon in the 100; and the soft, or mixed
qualities of coal, from 45 to 53 parts.           Such various propor
tions of carbon plainly point out, that the operations to be
followed at each individual iron-work ought not to rest upon
                          7                                     precedent,

           On the Proportions       of Coals and Iron-Stones.            367
precedent,      unless borrowed from those works where exactly
the fame quality of coal is used. This analysis also lays open
part of the source from whence originates the widely dif
ferent quantities of metal produced per week at various blast
furnaces, and the great disproportions of ore used to different
coals.
     Experience has shewn that the three qualities of coal just
mentioned, will smelt and give carbonation to the following
proportions of the fame species of torrefied iron-stone : —
   112 lb. of clod-coal cokes will smelt             -         -     1301b.
   112 lb. of splint-coal cokes will smelt           -         -     1051b.
   1 12 lb. mixed soft and hard coal cokes will smelt                 841b.
     Let the iron-stone       be supposed in the blast-furnace to yield
 40 per cent, then we find that the i-20th of a ton of the re
 spective qualities of cokes will smelt and carbonate the fol
 lowing proportions of iron, viz. — 112 lb. clod-coal cokes,
 1301b. iron-stone, at 40 per cent. = 52 lb. iron; 1 1 a lb. of
 splint-coal cokes, 105 lb. of the stone = 42 lb. of iron ; and
 U2lb. soft and hard coal cokes, 841b. of the iron-stone
  =   33  %   lb. of iron.    We then    have for the quantity       of metal
 produced by one ton of each quality of cokes :
                  Clod-coal       52     X 20 = 10401b.
                   Splint ditto 42       X 20 = 8401b.
                  Mixed ditto     33 -^ X 20
                                                 = 702 lb.
      This   furnishes a datum whereby we easily obtain the quan
  tity of   the various cokes        necessary to produce      1  ton of car
  bonated      crude    iron by common proportion : for if 10401b.
  of   metal    are produced by        1 ton, or
                                                   22401b. of clod-coal
  cokes,    the quantity     of  the fame    cokes  requisite for the pro
  duction of      1  ton, or 2240 lb. of metal, will be      :      T. C.S^li.
                                                4824-6^. = 2 308
  Splint-coal cokes 840: 2240:: 2240: 5973-3 lb. = 2 J3 1 9
  Mixed ditto              702 : 2240 :: 2240 : 7147-5^. = 3 337
      If to the quantity of cokes necessary to manufacture 1 ton
  of crude iron, we add the quantity of volatile matter driven
   off in the process of charring, which may be thus estimated
   upon the average of each quality : —

  368           On the relative Proportions  of Coals and
     Then, for the quantity of     the respective  coals  used  in the
  raw slate, we have the. following results in proportion:     —

     These great disproportions of quantity, used to fabricate
 1  ton, or 2240 averdupoise pounds of the fame quality of
 crude iron, will convey a striking and impressive idea of the
 multisarious qualities of coal which may be applied and
 made to produce the fame essects.           It should alfo convince
 the manufacturer that the study and analyfis of his own ma
 terials is the first and radical approach to true knowledge,
 and certainty of operation.       Divest him of this knowledge,
 and view him guided by the customs and rules prevalent at
 another manufactory, where the coals and ores may be as
 disssserent as has been     already mentioned, and we will no
longer wonder at the uncertainty of his results, and the num
 berless errors of his direction.
    Besore   I  enter into the practical discussion  of the applica
tion of coal, I beg leave to indulge myself in the following
calculations : — We have already seen that the production of
 3240 lb. of carbonated crude iron requires 48241b. of clod-
 coal cokes; these may be averaged to contain 4-5 per cent, of
ashes, which, deducted from 4824, gives 4607 Ib. of carbon
used for 1 ton of metal: this sum, divided by 2240, farther
gives, for     1 lb, of cast iron thus manufactured, 2-056 lb. of
carbon.
    We next find that 2240 lb. of       the fame metal requires      of
splint-coal cokes 5973-3 lb. ; we farther find, from a table of
the analyfis of coal, surnished in a former paper, that 100
parts   of the raw    coal contained 4-2 parts of ashes.     As it is
there stated to lose 50 per cent, in charring, 100 parts of
cokes will contain 8-4 of ashes ; and 8-4 per cent, deducted
from 5973-3, gives 5472 lb. of carbon. This again, reduced
by 22401b. gives for each lb. of metal manufactured, 2'442lb'.
    Again, 7147-1 lb. of cokes produced from foft mixed coals
are consumed for every ton of 2240 averdupoise pounds of
crude iron produced ; every 100 parts of the fame coals con
                                                                  tain

                    Iron- Stones    used at the  BlaJI-Furnace.               369
  tain 3-3 parts of ashes ; aud 100 parts of cokes contain nearly
  65 per cent, of aslies, which, deducted from 7147*3, gives
  6672*6 of carbon, which divided by 3240, gives, for the quan
  tity used for 1 lb. of cast iron, 2*978]^
     From these calculations it appears, that 32401b. of carbo
  nated iron, requires of carbon from clod-coal 46071b.; of
 carbon from splint-coal, 54721b. ; and of carbon from mixed
 coal, 6672 lb. : that 1 lb. of carbonated iron requires of car
 bon from clod-coal cokes 2,0561b.; from splint, 2,4431b.;
 from mixed, 2,983 lb. : and that carbonated crude iron may
 be obtained when widely different quantities                 of carbon      have
 been consumed.
     In   seeking for a solution        of  the latter fact, we must have
 recourse to the different degrees of inflammability of the car
 bon, according to the various laws of continuity imposed upon
 it in its fossil construction.           It can easily be conceived, that,
 owing      to this structure, and           the nature of the interposed
 ashes, the particles of carbon of some cokes will be more
 easily oxygenated than those of others ; in the fame way that
 we find splint-coal, when exposed to ignition in contact with
 open air, affords         1.3d of more cokes than are obtained from
soft mixed coals, though the latter, when distilled, yields more
 pure carbon than the former.
     By experiment it is proven, that 100 grains of carbonic
 acid gas is composed of 72 parts of oxygen united with 28
parts   of carbon: if the quantity of the carbon of clod-coal,
viz. 2*056 lb. used for the manufacturing of every pound of
cast iron, is reduced to grains, we will find it to consist of
 I.J302 grains; this, divided by 28, gives the acidifiable prin
ciple of 514 X 100 = 51400 grains of carbonic acid gas*                          :
    * This     is supposing,  for the moment, that the whole of the carbon is
oxygenated,       either by the oxygen contained   in the ore, or obrained from
the discharging-pipc       by the decomposition   of the atmospheric air: this,
however,      is not strictly true, as the metal takes up a small portion, by
¦tveight,  of  the carbon ; and when, by accident, moisture has been intro
duced into the furnace,       either through the medium    of the blast, or of the
materials, its decomposition furnishes a portion of both oxygen and hydro
gen, which may dissolve, and also carry off, a part of the carbon.         Atmo
spheric air being found to hold water in solution, a small quantity of hy
drogen will, even in the driest weather, be present in the blast-furn3ce.      M.

hence, as       i  cubic foot of this gas, at 2Q\84 of barometrical
pressure, and 54*5 of temperature, weighs nearly 761 grains,
we find, that in the formation of every pound of cast iron
^~ — = 67,54 cubical                  feet of carbonic acid      gas will  be
 formed;       and   in the production of 1 ton of metal, the asto
 nishing quantity of 151289,60 cubic feet.                   This quantity,
 however incredible it may seem, is only what would be
 formed under the above pressure, and at the above tempera
 ture : when we take into the account the high temperature
 at which       the decomposition and recombination are effected,
 with the consequent increase of clastic force and of volume,
 our ideas are almost unable to commensurate the sum of the
 gas hourly formed, and thrown off, ignited, to the highest de
 gree    of heat.
      If  the fame mode         of calculation is adopted with the other
 qualities of      coal, we     will have the following results : —

  cubical feet for         lib.;   and 93.3    X 2240 = 208.992 cubical

  pretty accurate notion of the quantity of atmospheric air ne
  cessary to produce I lb. or 1 ton of cast iron; an average of
  the three varieties of coal will be sufficiently accurate for this
    . .          r

  os  cast  iron.      As carbonic acid contains,     as has already been
  noticed, 72 parts of oxygen in 100, then we have for the
  quantity of oxygen gas 100 : 72 : : 62300*41 : 44856-29
  grains oxygen gas ; and as, at the ordinary temperature and
  pressure     of the atmosphere, a cubic foot of oxygen gas weighs
  591    grains,    we find 44856-29 divided by 591 = 75-89 cubic
  feet of oxygen gas necessary to form the acidifying principle
  of 8 1 -86 cubic feet of carbonic acid gas; and that the fame
  quantity of oxygen gas is necessary to the production of one
  pound of carbonated crude iron.           This leads us to the fol-
 Jowing statement for the quantity of atmospheric air used
  during the same operation; first premising that the consti
  tuent parts       of atmospheric air are nearly 73 of azote and
  27   of oxygen gas; of atmospheric air then necessary, we
  have 27 : 100 : : 75-89 : 281 cubic feet.
     I  shall now proceed from mere calculation              to matter    of
 fact, and attempt to prove the correctness of the former by
 the approximation of the latter to its results.              Let a blast
 furnace be supposed to produce 2>J tons of pig- iron per week,
  = 45360 averdupoise pounds; this, divided by days, hours,
 minutes,       and seconds, gives per day 6480 pounds, per hour
 270, per minute 4J lb., and per second 525 grains.
     From this it is evident that 1 lb. of cast iron is produced
 in 13 ,V0 seconds : experience has (hewn that a blast-furnace,
 producing, in any of the above periods, the respective quan
tity of metal, requires a discharge of air per minute nearly
equal to 1350 cubic feet; this, divided by 4,5 lb., the quan
tity produced per minute gives, for 1 lb. iron, 300 cubic
feet.      The quantity, by calculation,        we have   seen to be 281
cubic     feet —difference    19: a sum no way considerable when
we reflect upon the inequality of the movements of a blowing
machine, and when it is recollected that some allowance
ought also to be made for what air may pass through the
furnace undecomposed,           or may be lost at the place of ei\-
trance.
    from this coincidence of theory with practice,             we cannot
help    admiring      the rigorous  principles   on   which   the Lavoi-
serian system is sounded ; nor are        we   less pleased to find, that %

      From   the  foregoing particulars upon coal may be learned
 how much is dependent upon the native construction of coal
 and its constituent parts • I shall next advert to the effects
 produced by its improper preparation.
      When coals intended for the blast-furnace are sufficiently
 charred, they ought, in point of colour, to be of a silver grey;
 their fracture will appear lamellated and porous if splint-coals
 have been used ; softer coals        form themselves  into branches
  slightly curved, and, when properly prepared, are always very
  porous.      I have frequently found that the better the cokes
  were    charred,   the more water they will absorb.      Coals half
  burnt do not take up half so much water, because their frac
  ture continues in part to be smooth and less porous than
  when thoroughly burnt.
      When half-prepared cokes are introduced into the furnace,
  the metal formerly carbonated will lose its grey fracture, and
  approach to the quality of oxygenated iron.          Their presence
  is easily detected by the unusual quantity of thick vapour
  arising along with the flame. Besides, the water and sulphur,
  which raw      coals introduce into the furnace, and which always
  impair the quantity of carbon by the various solutions ef
   fected by the presence of oxygen, hydrogen, &c. the fitness
   of the coal for combustion, and the support of the ore, is
   jnuch diminished by this second course of ignition and dis
   engagement of bitumen. The pressure of the incumbent ores
    also fracture, and reduce the cokes into small pieces, which
   produce a considerable portion of coke-dust ; this is partly
   carried to the top of the furnace before the blast : sometimes
   below it appears in immense quantities, ignited to whiteness,,
   and liquid as sand.       Coal thus detached from the mase, ex
                                                                 posed

posed to the action        of a compressed current of air, is unfit for
conveying     the   carbouic principle to the metal ; and as it fre
quently belongs to the just proportion of charcoal necessary
to smelt the ores, and to carbonate their iron, its loss must be
felt, and the quality of iron impaired.
      When    cokes    of any quality     are exposed to a moist atmo
 spheric,   so as to absorb      water, their effects in the blast-fur-
 nace become much reduced,              and the presence       of the water
 is productive     of the most hurtful consequences          in the produc
 tion of carbonated crude iron.             I have found, by repeated
 experiment,      that  1  lb.  of well-prepared cokes will, when laid
 in water, take up 1? ounces in the space of half an hour; at
 this rate,     a  basket    of  cokes   weighing 80 lb. saturated with
  water, will contain 140 ounces of water, or 8 ^ lb.                  If the
  charge    contains     six   baskets,  then   we   feu   that  upwards of
  50 lb. of water is introduced regularly along with the charge,
  furnishing an additional quantity of oxygen equal to 42^ lb.,
  and of hydrogen equal to 7 lib.: it frequently happens that
  the cokes contain      a  larger portion of water than is here stated.
  When cokes thus surcharged arc introduced in quantity into
  the blast-furnace, the quality of the metal            is not always in
   stantaneously     changed, and frequently the colour and form of
   the cinder remain long without any great alteration. The con
   tact  of wetted cokes with the ore is first seen by the great dis
   charge of pale-blue gas, with the whiter flame at the top of
   the furnace; next, the accumulating oxyde upon the surface
   of the pig when consolidating indicates their presence.                Iron
   thus oxvgenatcd frequently exhibits, while fluid, that agitation
   and delicate partings peculiar to carbonated                  metal : the
    remelting of this iron is never attended with advantage, and
   is always unprofitable to the founder.
       From the properties assigned to pit-coal in this and in
    former papers, the following facts may be deduced : — That
    charcoal is the basis of the manufacture of crude iron ; that
    its proper application       produces  the most valuable      qualities  vf
    pig-iron; that, by diminishing        its relative proportion, or con
    taminating its quality by heterogeneous mixtures, the value
    and fusibility of the metal is lost ; but that, by a proper in
                                                                       crease,

  374             On the relative Proportions   of Coals and
  crease,     and always in proportion to this increase will the
 fusibility and value of the iron be mended. From the whole
 an important lesson may be learned of the pernicious effects
 of water in the furnace,       and how absolutely necessary it is to
 prepare      the cokes   without   using water, either to damp the
 fires,   as   in  the usual  mode, or to cool the cinders obtained
 from the tar kilns, to prevent their consuming in the open
 air :  in all this hurtful operation considerable quantities of
 water become fixed in the cokes, which require a very great
 degree of heat to expel.
     The     preparation of iron-stone has already been fully at
 tended to, and the phenomena           which it exhibits under every
 stage minutely described.         In  consequence    of various   expe
 riments we are authorised       to draw the   following conclusions :
That when pure calcareous iron-stone is used, it admits of hav
ing the local quantity of cokes diminished ; that argillaceous
requires a larger portion than the calcareous genus ; and that
siliceous iron-stone requires a greater proportion of fuel than
any variety of the former genera.           We have also seen that
fusibility, either connected with strength or otherwise, is de
rived from the mixture of the ores; and that excessive brittle-
ness, intimately       connected with infusibility, is also derived
from the same source.          From a review of these facts, we are
forcibly     impressed with the importance      of combining    the pre
pared iron-stones with proportions          of fuel  suited to their va
rious natures, in order to produce all the varieties of crude
iron with        the greatest  possible ceconomy.        Contemplating
farther the fame subject, it is easy to be. conceived that a
want of knowledge of the component parts of iron-stones,
and the effects which individually they produce, must lead
to great uncertainty of operation in the smelting process,
wherein the beautiful ceconomy of nature, and even real
property, will be often unprositably sacrificed to precedent.
    Besides the above causes of alteration, dependent upon
mixtures of the earths, the existence of oxygen in various
quantities in the ores ought never to be overlooked in pro
portioning the cokes to the iron-stone. This powerful agent,
                                                                  whoiift

pilose form and substance constantly eludes our vision; whose
existence is only ascertained by the wonderful changes pro-
duced by its various combinations with the iron;, and whose
presence in the same iron-stone,           in various quantities, may
produce such        variety of   result as to characterisethe ores, as
containing good or bad iron, surely forms the most interest
ing mixture which ores or iron-stones possess.  It will be a
momentous epoch in the manufacture of iron when the ex
istence of such a principle shall be fully admitted by the ma
nufacturer, and its agency, from certain visible effects pro
duced, adopted to explain its accompanying phenomena.
Tillthat period he will not perceive the utility of ascertain
ing the quantity of oxygen, and             devising   œconomical        me
thods of taking it from the ore.            An attention       to this pow
erful principle can alone root out those prejudices so inimical
to the real interests of the manufacturer, and which seem to
glance at Nature,          as having     improvidently       combined        her
most useful metal with mixtures which could resist the inge
nuity of man,         his comprehensive intellect at defiance.
                     or   set
In   the progress    of this
                      great inquiry, is it not possible that the
present expensive exertions may in part be superseded ? Is it
not possible, that, by laying open the sources of informa
tion to individuals at large, a greater mass of intellect may
engage    in the practice of this         art   ?   While    the present ex
tensive   and lofty buildings are necessary, the business is en
tirely confined in the hands of men of great capital : the ex
tent of their manufactures require that a large tract of coun
try be devoted to their supply ; a natural consequence   that          is,
innumerable small tracts of land are overlooked, or held un
worthy of notice, merely because they cannot, in       period      a
necessary to clear  great
                       a  capital and insure  fortune, afford
                                                         a
the necessary supply of materials.  Such situations, accord
ing to the present state of the iron business, must remain un
explored. Should, however,       desire for truth once gain foot
                                     a
ing  in  the manufactories    of  iron, and should this natural
impulse of the unprejudiced mind keep pace with other
branches of intellectual information, we may not despair of
seeing many imperfections removed, which were the unavoid
 able consequence         of the period of their creation.
                                                                              In

   3/6         On the relative Proportions of Coals and
      In the application of iron-stone in the blast-furnace, the
   following particulars ought rigorously to be attended to : —
      I. Their mixtures, whether clay, lime, or (ilex : their
  relative proportions to each other, judging according to the
  rules formerly laid down; which of them may admit of a di
  minution of    fuel ;  which of them will afford the quality of
  iron at the  time requisite; and which of them will be most
  likely, by a judicious arrangement, to give the greatest pro
 duce of metal, united with value and œconomy. Iron-stones,
 united with large portions of silex, have already been stated
 to require a greater proportion of fuel to carbonate their metal
 than the other genera.           When ballast' or' forge-pigs are
 wanted, it stands to reason that         siliceous   iron-stones ought
 to be used ; not that thev contain        a  greater quantitv of iron,
 but because thev form      a  substitute for the other kinds, which
 may be more advantageously          smelted    for the production       of
 more valuable qualities.
     2. Thequantity   of metal which   each individual iron fionenm*
 contain, is another object ot consideration.           Besides the pro
 portion   of mixtures,   which   chiefly  contribute    to the fusibility
 of iron-stones, a second degree of fusibility is dependent upon
 the richness   of  the ore in iron    : this is  so ob\ious in   the use
 of the Cumberland and Lancashire ores, that the conse
quences of their introduction will be perceived, bv the change
of the scoria and metal, in half the time that change would
be effected bv ordinary iron-stones.           It has been frequently
noticed, that crude iron contained pure carbon in proportion
to its fusibility ; then the more fusible, or supercarbonated
qualities, must take up, comparatively, a considerable portion
of the carbonaceous principle from the fuel. From this results
a striking consequence, that the quantity of fuel should, over
and above its relation to the mixtures, bear a just proportion
to the quantity of iron in the stone: for example, let the
weight per charge of fuel at a blast-furnace be 400 Ib., and
let this be supposed sufficiently to fuse and carbonate the iron
contained in 3601b. of iron-ilone ; let the quantity of metal
be supposed 35 percent, then the produce will be 1261b.
Should a change take place, and iron-stone richer in iron be
applied, though the same by weight, and should this iron
                                                                    stone

                Iron-Stoncs used al the Blaft-Fumace.                  377
  stone yield   of  torrefied   stone 45 per cent, its produce will be
  i62lb.    or 40 lb. more than the former. As there exists no
  greater   proportion of carbon in the furnace, it is evident
  that   the  existing quantity,         being distributed over nearly
  l-3d of   more metal, must therefore          be in more sparing quan
  tity in the whole, and the value           of   the metal  consequently
  reduced.
     3. The weight of oxygen contained in iron-stones is the
 next object     of serious consideration. I have already shewn,
 from experiment, that our iron-stones naturally contain from
 9 to 14 per cent, of oxygen, which remains after torrefaction ;
 it has also been shewn, that this quantity of hurtful mixture
 may easily be doubled by over-roasting or under- roasting the
 stone; and that the bad effects entailed are in the ratio of its
 combination with the iron.             From a review of the facts ad
 duced on this subject in various parts of my papers, its agency
 and effects   will cusilybe      credited  by men of science; its pro
 perty of constituting the acidifying base of all the acids rea
 dily explains the unalicnable consequence of its presence with
 acidifiable bases. The effects are still more pernicious when
the oxygen is furnislied by the decomposition of water in
 raw iron-stone; the hydrogen in this cafe set free, also seizes
a   portion of the carbon; and these abstractions, united to that
produced by the native portion of oxygen in the stone, form
an aggregate       which frequently reduces the value of iron 40
per cent.     So long as the principles of science are overlooked
in the manipulations of the foundry and forge, the existence
of such agents will be treated as chimeras of the philosopher
and chemist, and         the    effects hourly produced     by them in
dustriously    attributed     to causes which in point of unity or
consistency     will not     bear    the slightest   touch of investiga
tion.

XI. A     new Theory, pointing out the Situation of the Mag

    By P. R. Nugent, Esq. formerly Surveyor- General of
    Lands for the Island of      Cape Breton.    Communicated        by
    the Author.

taken by order of his present Majesty, for making discoveries
highly beneficial to mankind, particularly in what relates to
geography and navigation ; and the great desire and intention
of deriving every possible benefit from the many       observations
which such extended voyages were designed to            offer ample
room and opportunity for making, became objects of pecu
liar concern and consequence.        In addition, therefore, to the
undoubted and acknowledged abilities of the respective com
manders and officers appointed to such designations,                the
 Commissioners of the Board        of Longitude thought     sit to ap
 point, for every voyage, one or more persons on whole scien-r
tific ability, fidelity, and diligence in assisting to make the
respective observations,     they could also rest satisfied.     These
gentlemen were therefore furnished with the completest in
 struments which the most scrupulous care, intention, and
 circumspection, together with a total disregard to expence,
 could be found to procure.       Their report and testimony ii

  and undoubtedly often happens,         that the axis  of  the needle
 and its two poles do not lie in the fame plane, in which cafe
 another difficulty will arise in adjusting the needle to great
 exactness." And in page 15 of the Observations themselves,
 Mr. Wales remarks         as follows  :
     "  The dipping needle which we took ashore at this place
  (the Cape of Good Hope) was so much out of balance, and
 so difficult to get in again, thai notwithstanding we both of
 tis (Mr. Wales and Mr. Bayley) spent all the leisure time we
 had from other observations,         we did  not get it perfectly ad

 much precaution on observing with, and changing the poles
 of  the dipping needle,      &c. fays: On     the 28th  Julv  is men

 appeared regular; neither were the poles changed on receiving
 it on board,    as it was said to be well balanced : but the not
 doing it at either of these times was a ereal oversight, as we do
 not know the error of the dips with the marked end north, and
 dipping in any observations before to-day, and therefore can
 not correct them        according to Mr. Cavendisti's directions.

day will be lessened by            —          or 12a       X   cosine   of the dip."
     What error or          difference    arose between            the extreme of the
observed dips with the marked end north, and those                           with the
marked end south, are no where       down; they must, how

much greater than 8° 8', seeing the mean result of the whole*
srriall and great, gave 8° 8'. The observations made       Lord                   by
Mulgrave are of the like nature and uncertainty.
   The whole of these instruments were therefore totally in
adequate to the correct and useful purposes of navigation, or
indeed         to any correctly      useful         purpose whatever
                                                   they were,              :

of    those who made them,               were        wanting to render them as

for which they were designed   nor do    entertain any doubt

 and      which        would reconcile the continual disagreement                       be
 tween men of science on this subject : and this desire also of
necessity led me into endeavours                       to form more perfect nau
tical instruments, for without more accurate observations no"
essential utility whatever could arise to navigation from any
kind of theory however perfect .. To detail the train of reason-
ways seemed so probable, or rather necessary,                 ever since  the variation has
been    itself found to vary, and this after a certain              regular   manner ; also,
that   Mr. Phillips      before    Mr.  Bond asserted      the fame, and stated the revo
lution    to be in 3 70 years ; and after all, our learned Dr. Halley, who has
far outdone every body upon this subject, has determined it to be so, only
he has thought himself obliged to add the hypothesis of two other fixed"
poles; and from the joint effects of all four poles, and from those only,
has he been able to bring this variation of the variation to some kind of
system agreeable to the observations.              He has also been obliged to lengthen
the period        of the moveable poles' revolution; and as Mr. Bond had en
larged Mr. Phillips 's number from 370 years to 60b, so has Dr Halley
enlarged the fame farther, from 600 to 700 years ;" and Mr. Whiston, in
page 58 of the pamphlet itself, states the revolution of Dr. Halley 's inner
nucleus,      or north magnetic pole, to be in 1910 years, which, he observes,
is much slower than that of            Mr. Phillips, Mr. Bond, or Dr. Halley.
    Since Whiston's time, those who attempted the magnetic theories are :
the    celebrated       Eulcr,     who,   as  all  others have hitherto done, supposes
that the        magnetic     poles move ;      Mr. Lorimer, Mr. Churchman, Mr.
Walker, &c.         ; but   of all  these,   Mr. Churchman is the only person that
determines        their   revolution,   which     he   states  to  be, the northernmost in
 1096 years, and the southernmost in 2289 years.
    I  sliall forward, for a future number of the Philosophical                 Magazine, a
more full account of the theories that have                hitherto  prevailed,  in which I
shall entermore         fully, than my     present   limits will allow,    into the truth of
my new theory, and of the method by which I have been enabled to prove
the fallacy of the former.            In the mean time any person, even by roughly
perusing      the observation       of latitudes, longitudes, and dips, made on the
north-west       coast  of America, and comparing them with th,at at London, and
also   with    those   made off the      east coast  of South America and in the Chi
nese seas,     will   soon be enabled to ascertain, sufficiently near for the purpose
of    remaining satisfied, that the situation of the magnetic poles is as de
scribed:      my determinations are, however, drawn from a multitude of cal
culations,      and the     result compared       with all the magnetic dips and varia

the subject will admit of, lay before the public, not doubting
that an object, which actually tends to the enlargement and
perfection of science, and, in my opinion, to the benefit of
navigation, will find favourable reception, investigation, and
experiment.
Method os discovering the Longitude, the Magnetic Inclina
        tion and Latitude os the Ship being given :
                    Problem      the First, being the            Theory.
To determine the Latitude                  and Longitude              os the Magnetic
     Poles, and, in           consequence,       for     the purpose     of   discovering
     the Longitude, to ascertain a First                  Meridian.
      Let       N
         (Plate VIII.) represent the north pole of the earth,
M the magnetic north pole, S Smeerenberg harbour in Spits
bergen, and L London : also, let arches of great circles be
drawn from London to the north magnetic pole, to the north
pole of the earth, and to Smeerenberg, and also from Smeer
enberg to the north magnetic pole. There will thus become
formed three spherical triangles, which are resolved as fol
lows : —
      1   ft,    triangle NLS are given the sides NL and
                In    the

 the included angle LNS being their difference of longitude,
 so determine the angle of position NLS and the third sideLS,

 polar distances corresponding to the correct dips at London
 and Smeerenberg), to determine the angle MLS, from
 which subtracting the angle NLS lately found, there re
 mains the angle of position               N     L M.
   Lastly, In the triangle                 MLN            are   now given        the sides
L     M     and     L  N, and the included angle M N, to find the    L
 angle      L       N M, the longitude of the north magnetic pole (and
 the meridian           of the   earth pasting through the magnetic poles
i'                                                                                     and

  384        Theory  of the Situation of the 'Magnetic Poles,
  and poles    of the earth,) from the      meridian of London, and
  the fide  MN     the distance   of the magnetic   pole from the pole
  of the earth.
     The    place  of the magnetic      poles being thus obtained, the
 question    next divides itself into two points of view, namely,
 Whether the magnetic            poles or points thus determined are
 stationary    or otherwise   ?   the solution  of which    depends   on
 observation and philosophic inference.            From observation it
 is remarked, in page 121 of the late Lord Mulgrave's Account
 of his Voyage towards the North Pole, that —
     "  There is no reason at present to suppose that the dip is
 liable to any variation in the fame place at different periods
 of time. It having been observed at London by Norman,
 who first discovered it in 1592, to be 7i°.5o", and by Mr.
Nairne, in 1772,       about 720: the difference between these ob
servations,     taken at such distant periods of time, is smaller
than that found between several of          Mr. Nairne's   observations
compared with each other ; and therefore we have no reason
to conclude that the dip has altered since Norman's time.
The care with which his instrument was constructed, and
bis observations     made,    leave us no room to doubt        of their
accuracy."
    Again, Mr. Cavallo, in his Treatise on Magnetism, p. 65,
remarks, (speaking of the dip,) " Its alteration in the fame
place at different times is very small ; thus in London, about
the year 1576, the north pole of the dipping needle stood 71.50
below the horizon, and in the year 1775 it stood at 72.03: the
alteration of the inclination         in so many years amounting to
less than a quarter of a degree, which may be attributed to
the error of the instruments, since, as will appear in the se
quel, those instruments are far from having attained to any
degree of perfection even in the present age."
    Now, from philosophic inference it will naturally follow,
that   if the inclination   of  the magnetic needle    at different pe
riods of time at any one place remain constant,          the magnetic
poles are stationary';     and   if the magnetic poles are stationary,
(as appears clearly evident from above,) the meridian thus dis
covered is the Firjl (or only) Meridian from which the lon
                                                                 gitude

             .   and a Method of discovering            the   Longitude \          385
gitude ought to be counted ; I have always used it                           as   such,
and obtained the most satisfactory results.
            Problem              the Second, being the         Practice.
                      To determine the Longitude universally.
   Here are always given the ship's polar distance, the mag
netic polar distance, and the magnetic co-latitude, being-
three fides of a spherical triangle, to determine the angle at
the poI<; as the earth opposite the magnetic co-latitude, being
at all times and places the longitude of the ship east or west
(as the cafe may be) from the meridian aforesaid.
   N. B. The magnetic co-latitude is the distance of the ship
from the nearest magnetic pole ; the (hip's polar distance is
the distance of the ship from the pole of the earth next ad
joining the said magnetic pole; the polar distance is the dis
tance between either magnetic pole and the pole of the earth
nearest thereto            :    moreover,   the longitude thus obtained can
never exceed 180.                  It   may, however, be easily reduced as to
that estimated from any assumed first meridian.                       Likewise the
point       M,
           thus assumed as the magnetic pole, may, to prevent
perplexity, be better understood as being that point on the
surface     of    the globe    the dipping needle stands at
                                    at which
right angles to the plane                 of   the horizon,
                                          without regarding
whether the magnetic poles themselves are under, at, or above
the surface           of   the earth.
     Themethod of obtaining and establishing (from observation
alone)  certain data for investigating or corroborating perfect
tables of magnetic latitude and co-latitude, appears (from the
preceding theory) obvious, being, by carefully making different
dips of the magnetic needle along the meridian aforesaid, and
carefully observing the respective latitudes at which those dips
are taken, and for greater certainty                  (if
                                           thought needful) con
tinuing  them, as far as possible, into both hemispheres though             3
it   will   also be perceived they may be investigated                by    observing
different dips, along any other great circle, passing through
the magnetic poles, or having determined the precise latitude
and lontritude             of   the magnetic poles.     Correct tables may also
be deduced from correct dips at various places                    ;however, the

the magnetic needle,      taken  at the fallowing plates, (regard
also being had to determine their correct         latitudes  and lon

poles, where it is necessary to correctly determine both.) will

Atlantic Ocean, in or near the fame longitude up to and near
the Isle of Sables, at the Island of Cape Breton, the south
fide of the river Saint Lawrence in the longitude aforesaid ;
then going round to the north-east shore of the Labrador
Coast, and observing thereon at Davis's Inlet, and so on up
lo the northward under the meridian aforesaid, up to and
into Baffin's Bay, and there carefully determining the lati

 The number of places herein       set forth are mentioned iu order
 that navigators and others, as opportunity may offer, may-

 herein alluded to.
    It may also be proper to add, that hitherto the places of
 the magnetic poles have always been attempted to be found
 by means of the magnetic variation ; a method whereby the
  most able mathematicians have been continually led astray,
 for,  as the  magnetic variation is continually changing, their

don, do           of        themselves         alone    establish another important
conclusion, likewise quite different from the general opinion
of the Learned, which supposes that the magnetic variation
affects     (i.   e.    increases         or diminishes) the magnetic inclina
tion   ;   for, from the time                   which the magnetic inclination
                                                in
was first observed at London to the present                               time, the varia
tion has shifted upwards of 360 without affecting the inclin
ation and therefore, after knowing the result of
       ;                                           very great                   so
a change       the magnetic variation without having affected
                  in
the inclination, there can be no reason to conclude that                                      it
can    in       any    respect be affected thereby               :   a   circumstance that
renders         the theory             here    pointed     out still more simple and
beautiful.

I    have,   I   flatter myself,       magnetic theory of the
                                           cleared   the
abstruse and embarrassing considerations which have hitherto
bewildered      and thereby laid the foundation of
                     it,                                 most                       a
simple, general, and useful method of determining       (hip's                      a
correct place at sea, without any regard to the sun, moon, or
stars,  to good or bad weather, to the time of the day, the day
itself, months, years, seasons, or centuries, except        far as                  so
may be said to regard the magnetic inclination, which must
always be known from observation          as also the latitude of
                                                           ;
the (hip, which must likewise be known, either from observ
ation, or dead reckoning.
    Iwould not have     understood, however, that
                                      it           mean to                     I
decry the            use   of lunar        observations         or chronometers.         Far
otherwise        have devoted great application to the study of the
                 I
                 :
lunar     (and other) astronomy; aud herein      am happy to add,   I
I     have succeeded to an accuracy aud conciseness of equa
    tions  and calculations far surpassing Mr. Mayer's, or any
    lunar tables yet offered to the public.  But herein, notwith
    standing the high   esteem and  veneration in which the great
    genius and labours of Euler, and the merits of Mr. Mayer
    must ever be held                by
                           men of science,    found   necessary to
                                                                I         it
    reject, for reasons which  (hall hereafter transmit for inser
                                           I
    tion in the Philosophical Magazine, the supposition that the
    motion of the sun or earth, according to Mr. Euler, and of
    the moon according to Mr. Mayer, are different now to what
    they formerly were.   am also the original inventor, and for
                                      I
    which have, for upwards of seven years, had patent, of
             I                                                             a                a
    double sextant for making lunar observations to the right and
    left.   have also invented
             I                  metal quadrant,a     which, with          by
     fore- adjustments              and observation,        the distance       of   the moon
     can be measured    from the sun or other object, from one
     limit or extreme point of the horizon to the other.
        From the multitude of lunar places which       have calcu          s
     lated from my tables,    am   persuaded they
                                          I       are such as (hall
     not, even        at the equator,          produce     a    mean    error of five, nor
     an extreme error of fifteenmiles in longitude. The first of
     the instruments here spoken of     double sextant) measures
                                                           (a
     with  convenience, without  inverting the instrument, the
     simple limits         of   a   sextant on either side the sun or           a   fixed star:

to the other there can be no limits,                         for it measures 180 de
grees on either side. Not satisfied with doing thus much, in
order to avoid the inconvenience, trouble, and inaccuracy
arising from the use of large volumes of charts of spherical
triangles,         and     of   tables for reducing observed lunar distances
to true,       I   contrived an instrument, for which, as well as se
                        surveying and other instruments, I have also
                                       •
veral superior
got   a patent.    This instrument, which I have denominated
a suit   of circles of calculation, performs this operation with
ease, accuracy, and expedition.   It also determines the true
latitude, without knowing the latitude by account, either by
double altitudes and the time between, by double altitudes
and      the .difference              of magnetic azimuths,
                                               (which my in
 struments will correctly give.) or by simply having the alti
 tude of two known fixed stars. It determines the time of the
 day, &c. &c.    In a word, it resolves all manner of spherical
 triangles or spherical trapezia, &c.    The resolution of the
 few of these that   constitute the essentials of nautical astro
 nomy and geography, becomes by this means obvious, easy,
 and pleasant; whereas the understanding, or even the appear
 ance    of the previous burthen of                    requisites,      creates,   as is   well
 known,            a great      if not       insuperable     obstacle to the generality
 of   otherwise          well-informed             seamen.
      Having thus,              I   trust,    explained my regard and esteem for
 the lunar observations                      and  chronometers, all I would have
 understood           of   the method          of discovering       the longitude by the
 dip     is,   that   it   is   easily understood          by   the most ordinary capa
  city  ;that to others, in every instance,    becomes an auxi     it
  liary or corroborating proof, and, in the time of greatest ne
  cessity and peril,    most estimable substitute
                                    a               not requiring,        ;
  in this cafe, any calculation whatever. Thus, from the pre
  ceding theory, the dip in all places remaining the fame,
  the navigator, being perhaps several days without seeing sun,
  moon, or stars,    as to make any use of either towards de
                                 so
  termining his longitude, has this benefit left him, that he
  can, at any moment of the day, in which the extremity of
  the horizon can be seen, determine his correct dip, and
  therefore his vicinity towards the land he wissies to make or
   avoid    j      where otherwise he might cither be cast away, or, under
                                                                                             the

    or straining his ship in endeavouring to get no farther to lee
    ward, when at the fame time he might be an hundred miles
    or more from shore, and        so  lose the very wind he wanted ;
    after which,     should contrary winds assail  him,  the injury also
    becomes obvious.
    To clear apparent or observed Lunar Dt/lances from the EffiSs
          of Refraclion and Parallax by the Suit of the Circles.
       Set the vernier on the first meridian, carrying the circle or
    semicircle of position to the apparent altitude of the sun'»
   centre, or that of the star; the vernier on the moveable meri
   dian to the apparent altitude of the moon's centre; and the
   vernier on the circle or semicircle of position to the apparent
   distance    of  the sun and    moon's centres, or of the centre of
   the moon and fixed star. Let these form a spherical triangle ;
   so shall the number of degrees, minutes, and seconds on the
   equator, comprehended between the first and moveable me
  ridian, sliew the angle (or difference of azimuths) at the ver
  tex, which angle is common to the apparent and true tri
  angle.      Keeping fast, therefore, the said meridians by means
  of the equator, set the vernier on the first meridian to the true
  altitude of the fun or star's centre, and the vernier on the
  moveable meridian to the true altitude of the moon's centre;
  then    fee  what number of degrees, minutes, and seconds of
  the circle or semicircle of position or distance are contained
  between them, for that is the true distance.

     The foregoing certifioate was given to me, unsolicited, for
the purpose      of being transmitted to the Lords Commissioners

of   the  Admiralty, in    order  to procure their Lordships order
to have the merits and efficacy      of my inventions     and instru
ments officially examined into and reported upon. As to the
instruments, they were on the fame day applied for, through
Commissioner Marsh, to the Navy Office, by the above gen
tlemen.
    The   most speedy and least expensive method      of ascertaining
the precise situation   of  the north magnetic pole,    the southern
being opposite thereto, appears to be, by engaging one of the
Davis's Strait whalers to proceed into Baffin's Bay, with a
proper person duly qualified, to make the necessary astrono
mical and magnetic observations ; or rather, by dispatching
for this purpose a frigate or other vessel in the king's service
employed on the Newfoundland station. Pity it was, indeed,
that the Board of Longitude had not known of this method,
and    of  the  reasons that render all navigation into the South
Sea, by any passage to the eastward      of Greenland, totally im
 practicable.     The Hon. Captain Phipps's destination would
 in  that  cafe have been to proceed     into Baffin's Bay, where,
 had he also possessed    the angular and magnetic instruments
 herein alluded to, he would have assuredly ascertained one
 great object of his voyage, namely, the determining the fal
 lacy or utility of all previous theories, and bringing them to
 the test of experiment ; a test which would have caused the
 whole to have vanished, and none other would have remained
 but that     I have already    pointed out.    Nor   do   I entertain
 much      doubt that, by attending to circumstances, which
 might easily be pointed out, Captain Phipps would have also
 accomplistied a passage into the South Sea.
     The principles of     the whole  of my nautical magnetic in
  struments (except a variation frame for converting all steering
 into variation compasses) is the application of a quadrant,
  sextant, or double sextant, (fitted for this purpose,) to the ver
  tical magnetic axis of the horizontal needle for determining
  the variation, and to the lateral magnetic inclinatory axis of
  the dipping needle for determining the dip. These needles
  are also differently suspended from others : the dipping nee
 dle, for example,    is always at liberty to resort to, and remain
                                                                     at

 at rest  in, the common intersection of the lines of the magnetic
 meridian or variation and dip; nor can any alteration of di
 rection or motion of the sliip affect a dipping needle thus
 suspended.
     In  consequence       of this simple contrivance, the motion or
 gyration    of  the   graduated circles for either dip or variation on
 account of the motion of the stiip, becomes totally avoided ;
 for, on or in these magnetic instruments there are no divi
 sions whatever      :  the instruments themselves         can be afforded
 for half the price of others ; the navigator makes his observ
 ations like a man of science; and finally, he determines with
expedition, ease, and certainty, the magnetic dip and varia
tion, to degrees, minutes, and seconds, i. e. to the like ac
curacy that he can distinguish or read the subdivisions (hewn
by the vernier on the arch of his sextant : a circumstance ut
terly impossible to be obtained even to whole degrees, it might
be said to half a dozen degrees, by any other constructed in
struments,     as has been      herein before sufficiently verified.

.  XIII.      Description os a cheap and efficacious Ventilator for
       preserving Corn on Ship-board.             By Thomas South,
       Esq.*.
      J.   HE     importation of grain is a precarious traffic. The
   produce of       distant countries, or even of those near home,
   when long in collecting, or long detained on fliip-board, is
   subject to heat, soon becomes fetid, and is often so far spoiled
   and depreciated in its value as to fell for less than the original
   cost.    Hence the merchant, overwhelmed with losses, regrets
   his patriotism, grows shy of importation, and, unless invited
   by a certainty of gain, drops the trade,           even whilst the na
   tion stands in need of supplies.
       The   remedy here proposed is a simple,        cheap, and,   I  trust,
  efficacious method         of ventilating grain whilst confined on
  ship-board ; sufficient, I presume, to keep it sweet and mar
  ketable after sustaining a tedious voyage.

of     the node.       In      the fame figure the node is represented with

 leathered on its top,             and yielding downwards to the pressure
 of    the air when the piston is raised up.                      D    is a cross bar    of
 iron, to confine the valve, so that it may close instantly on
 the return of the piston downwards.
   Fig. 4. is a tin pipe or tube, of less than four inches dia

 being compressed on the descent os the valve,             will, by its ela
 sticity, cause it to rise again, close the aperture above, and
 retain the air delivered beneath it.            On connecting this cy
 linder with the upper end of the nosle, at e e, Fig. 2, we must
 carefully prevent anv lapse of air that way, by a bandage of
 oakum smeared with wax, on which to screw the cylinder,
 like the joints of a flute, air-tight.        I is a bar of iron, having
 a  rising in its centre, wide enough for the spindle to play
 through, hut at the same time sufficiently contracted to pre
 vent the passage of the spiral spring.
     Fig. 5. is an assemblage of tin pipes, of any lengths, fliaped
 suitably and conveniently to their situation in the ship, to the
 form of which, when sliut into one another, they must b«
 adapted    ;  observing     only, that the neck be straight for a
 length sufficient to admit the lower end of the cylinder,
 Fig. 4. as high as the letter F, or higher.
     Fig. 6. To the middle pipe, which runs alone the bottom,
 should be fixed      a  perpendicular one, fully perforated,          to con
 vey the air more readily into the centre          of  the heap    ;  and this
 may have a conical top, as represented in the plate, perforated
 with a smaller punch to prevent the air from escaping too
 hastily. In large cargoes, two or three of these perpendiculars
may be necessary; and each should be well secured by an iron
 bar g, screwed down, to prevent their being injured by the
 shifting of the cargo in stormy weather or a rolling sea. The
top   of  the conical cap      of  these pipes     may reach two-thirds
up the cargo.

Fig. 2, whereon to secure          the tube     Fig. 4, when applied to
the node. The joints of             the pipes,     when put together for
use, should be made air-tight,           by means    of bees-wax or some
stronger cement, till they reach the bottom of the vessel, when
there is no farther need of this precaution.               The horizontal
pipes should run by the side of the kelson the whole length
of   the hold.      The tin  plates    of which K is made,        should be
punched in holes, like the           rose of a watering-pot,       in two or
three lines only at most, and then formed into a tube, with
the rough fide outwards. L may have four or five lines of
the like perforations.        M, and the rest, should gradually in
 crease in their number as they advance towards the middle of
the hold, and continue fully perforated to the last pipe, which
 should be closed at its end to prevent the ingress            of  the corn.
 It  is the centre of the cargo which most requires             ventilating,
yet air should pervade the whole.              Like the trade-winds, it
 will direct its course to the part most heated,               and, having
 effected its salutary purpose there,         will disperse itself to refresh
 the mass.
     Where      the hatches are close-caulked, to prevent the influx
 of water, vent-holes may         be bored in convenient parts         of the
 deck, to be bunged up, and opened occasionally, from whence
 the    state   of the corn may be known by the effluvia which
 ascend     when   the ventilator is working.
     The power of the ventilator is determined by the square of
 its diameter multiplied into the length of the stroke, and that
  again by the number of strokes in any given time.
      To find the area of a circle, and the solidity of a cylinder
  raised on that circle, Archimedes gives the following propor
  tion : —
      As 1 is to .785398 decimal parts, so is the square of the
         diameter to the area of the circle.
      And,    as 1 is to .785398,      so  is the square   of the diameter,
         multiplied by the height, to the solidity         of the cylinder.
      The cubical contents, both of cylinders               and   tubes,   are
   found in the fame manner ; their difference consisting not
  in shape, but solidity, the latter being hollow.
      Then, to find the contents of a cylindrical vessel whose in
   ternal diameter      is ten   inches, multiply that into itself, and
                                                                           the.

the square thus obtained, multiplied by .7854, will give the
contents of the circle in cubic inches; which, multiplied
again by twenty-four inches or lengths of the stroke, being
the proportion of the barrel silled with air, gives in cubic
inches the amount of each discharge on the descent                               of the
piston. As thus :

Objcclions  made to the supposed Effect os the Ventilator, over
 ruled, it is hoped, by the Considerations -which follow them.
     First, The holes pierced           in the tin tubes which are to lie
under the corn, seem capable of issuing (especially if an effort
be made upon them) a much larger quantity of air than the
forcing-pump   will supply in a given time. Consequently, a
given quantity of these holes, under a given pressure, will
be capable of issuing the whole supply of air, without any
assistance from the remainder.
     Secondly,    If these
                      positions are just, it must happen, that
if a cargo of corn be unequally circumstanced in relation to
its permeability, the whole of the air discharged by the pump
will issue through the more permeable parts of         without        it,
affecting, in any degree, the             less permeable    ones.
     Thirdly, In       cargoes    heated     in any degree, and in those
infected     by   that worm which              fastens grains together a      by
web, the parts most affected become much more close and
densely packed together than the rest, either the swelling       by
ofthe heated grains, or             by
                           the web and dung of the worms
which occupy the intervals between the grains.
  If so, the parts of cargo which require the most ventila
                            a
tion will receive the least but, in all cafes,
                                    ;             seems likelyit
that the air discharged will not regularly permeate the whole
of the cargo, but will pass through the parts where the grain
lies lightest, and         leave untouched          those parts       where   it   is
most closely packed together.
                  Answer         to the preceding    Objections.
     Though      the holes appear
                             numerous, they must be small,
lest the corn gain admission   and many (especially of the
                                             ;
uppermost)  will be nearly,  not        if
                                 totally, stopped   the pres          by
sure of the grains upon them.      Besides, the pipes which
 convey the air towards the centre are not meant to be                             so
 fully perforated as thole at and beyond        and all may be

    And   as on the larger scale   of ventilators the pipes need not    exceed  the
fame diameter, the power of the air injected,       when its egrcl'b is stopt, will
increase sufficiently so force its way through webs, mats, and oiher obstruc
tions, though impervious to the atmospheric fluid, unassisted by such me
chanic aid.

small egress only will be made, till the pipes are filled                                 with
a fluid more dense than atmospheric air, which will then, as
is justly noticed,              issue    where it finds the least obstruction,
unless attracted           to the spot most heated.
     Many circumstances may                       cause one part         of   the cargo to be
less permeable than the rest;                       should      it prove      so,   the means
readily offer for airing and purifying even this.
     Suppose        the    hatches             to be caulked        down, and the hold
made  impervious                 to water;         in such      case,    the lapse      of air,
under the obstructions met with in its  passage, could by no
means keep pace with the influx from the forcing-pump;
consequently, if the holes in the deck, designed for its exit,
be kept close-stopped                   till    the pumper feels resistance,            all the
intervals of the cargo, be they ever so minute or irregular,
must be occupied by fresli air, which, when permitted to
escape, will carry off impurities with it.  And thus, by
stopping          and opening such vents repeatedly,                          no part    of the
cargo could miss of purification, and this perhaps                                     may be
the best mode of administering it.
   Prevention is better than a cure.
     In                 with the apparatus described, the in
          a vessel equipped
attention must be great, if the corn be suffered to sustain any
injury at all. By an early use of                         it,
                                       perspiration and damps
will   presently      be dried away;                heating of course will be pre
vented    5   and even the production                  of the pernicious grub               al

their embryos will not vivify, without                               moisture        to sustain
them.         Wherefore,            it     should seem       that       the corn-merchant
in future will        have little to fear, save the influx                     of   sea-water   ;
and even this             (if   in small quantities) will,              by   the frequent use
of    the ventilator,            gradually dry away.

 O.    'N the 30th of November last, the anniversary meeting
 of the Society was held. Sir Godfrey Copley's gold medal,
 which is disposed of yearly on this day to the moil deserving
 member, was awarded to the Rev.             Mr. Hellings.
    The    receipts    of  the Society for the year were declared     to
 have been 1736 /. and the disbursements 1563 /.
    Trie meetings of December the 5th and 12th were occu
 pied principally      in reading the conclusion of Dr. HerscheFs
 paper on the power of penetrating into space by means of
 telescopes.     According to the Doctor's observations, it is
 impossible with the naked eye to see any star smaller than
 those of the 8th, 9th, or 10th magnitude.           With his 40 feet
-reflector he has discovered stars which must be three hun
 dred thousand      times more distant than the nearest fixed star.

    At the   latter meeting, an abstract of a register of the wea

 read ; as was also a paper on annuities, respecting the con
 tingencies of three lives, by Mr. Morgan.
     December 19th. A paper, by Mr. Jordan, on the irides
 surrounding the sun, moon, &x. was partly gone through,
 when the Society adjourned for the Christmas holidays.
     January 9th, the conclusion of Mr. Jordan's paper was
 read ;   as  was    also   a paper    by  Mr. Anthony Carlisle, on
 some peculiarities      in  the arterial system of certain animals.

              SUBSTITUTE FOR CINCHONA.
   C. Zannetini, a physician who attended the French army
in Italy, has made some experiments, by which it appears
that the flowers and feeds of the common nettle (Urtica di
vides Linn.) may be employed in fever instead of cinchona.
This substitute was attended with a success beyond all ex
pectation, in tertian and quartan malignant fevers.    The
nettle often produces               a speedier effect          than bark, for it heats
jn   a great degree,              and, when the           dose is pretty      strong, occa
sions a lethargic sleep.                 The      dose must never exceed a               dram,
and  is given in wine two or three times in the course of
24 hours.    Zannetini found this medicine of great service to
guard against that total exhaustion which forms the principal
character of malignant fevers ; and he recommends a slight
infusion of it in wine as an excellent preservative for those who
reside in marsliy and insalubrious districts.    In employing
the nettle in fever, Zannetini gives the fame caution as ought
to be observed in regard to cinchona, that     that must not         is,         it
be employed where there      an inclination to inflammation,
                                             is
or where    continued fever, arising from obstructions, exists.
               a
This discovery    not unworthy the attention of physicians,
                        is
and deserves at least to be farther investigated,                           as   a   great deal
would be        saved   if   cinchona could be entirely dispensed with.
               CURE FOR DISEASF.D ELMS.
     C. Boucher, secretary to the Society of Emulation   Ab                            at
beville, has lately publislicd memoir on the diseases which
                                                  a
attack elms,  and  the  method of curing them, from which
the following    an extract — " Elms are frequently attacked
                    is                       :
by  ulcers, which at length destroy   great number of thesea
valuable trees.          Duhamel             supposed       that    this malady might
be ascribed  to   plethora of the sap
                        a                                    ;     and  C. Boucher,          by
numerous experiments, has establislied this fact, and disco
vered    remedy.
         a        He observed, that local ulcers never attack
the tree on the north side, but almost always on that exposed
to the south.       The elms chiefly                  subject to    it   are those planted
jn   marsliy ground, and                in   the neighbourhood             of rivers.       The
ulcer    is   generally at         a    little distance from the earth, seldom

more than five or         six feet above         it.       This   disease, arising from
a superabundance        of sap, differs from another disease ot the
                                                          *
elm described        in the Journal d'Hijlnire Naturclle    for the
year 1789,         in this circumstance, that the liquor, when
exposed to the atmosphere,                 soon acquires           the consistence          of
a gum,      and has a very saccharine                   taste.
  To    cure the         trees attacked,             C. Boucher       pierced       each    of
them with          an    auger,     which he inserted in the ulcer itself,
and    then fitted to the hole                  which penetrated to the
                                             a tube
depth of     i*io inches.           Sound trees pierced in this manner
yield noliquor; but those which are diseased give a                                      more
abundant quantity, in proportion to the serenity of the                                  wea
ther, and     as                                          This
                       the wound is more exposed to the south.
effect is suspended by stormy weather and high wind.        He
observed that at the end of two or three days the efflux of the
sap ceased, and that the wound dried up and was healed.
  This, therefore, is a simple and easy method of radically
curing elms attacked with this disease.    It is probable that
the fame process applied to other vegetables, and particularly
to some fruit-trees,          would produce a like effect. Pliny, Co-
lumella,     and Palladius,       mention the fame means as having
been    employed by the ancients, but it has not been before
practised for many years.
   C. Boucher has completed his observations on the elm,
and proved that this tree is not an exotic, as some authors
have advanced.             The     study   of    the ancients has proved to                him
that it existed in Europe in the remotest periods, and very
evident remains of it have been found in old mosses.
      The   analysis which         C. Boucher            made     of the   sap    of the elm
 shewed that it contains a pretty                      large quantity      of     the acetite
 of pot-ash,       a   little of   the acetite         of lime,
                                                              a certain quantity of
 vegetable     matter or saccharine                    mucus, and a pretty large
 quantity of the muriat of lime.                       There exist in       it,

                                       DEATHS.
      On        of December, C.Monuicla, author of an ex
           the 19th

the new edition of this work were published before the au

mainder were finistied.
   At Paris, on       the 1st    of January,        the celebrated              naturalist
Daubenton,          the friend and          fellow-labourer of Buffon.                 He
was born at Montbard    in Burgundy in the month of May
1716. He studied medicine, and intended to follow that
profession in his own country  but Buffon, being appointed
                                            ;
intendant of the king's garden in 1735, proposed to Dau
benton to reside with him, to apply to natural history, and
to assist him in the grand labours which he was then about
to undertake.         In 1740               of Daubenton were
                                    the fate and taste
determined for his whole life.   More than half century de                a
voted to the formation of the cabinet of natural history, which
in 1750 was only plain drug-shop belonging to Geoffroy,
                         a
which he arranged methodically and enriched with produc
tions of every kind, has given him          distinguisheda rank
among naturalists. Being admitted into the Academy of
Sciences in 1744, he never ceased to enrich the collection of
its memoirs with various papers for nearly fifty years.  The
greater part of them  contain  new facts and ideas respecting
the classification     of   stiells,   on the hippopotamus, the shrew-
mouse,      bats,    fossil bones and           teeth,   the     situation        of   the
great occipital       foramen in man and                 animals,             rumination
and the temperament            of   slieep,   a   descripti     >n   os several kinds
of new animals, or animals little known.    He was interred
with great pomp on  the  of       3d

His funeral was attended               by
                           more than 500 persons, and two

     malleable.     By Mr.          Richard Knight,             Member of

     Author.
 TA      HE many peculiar advantages which platina in a mal
leable state possesses over every other metal for the fabrica
tion of a variety of instruments and utensils particularly useful
for the purposes of chemistry, together with the extreme
difficulty of procuring       it,
                             being hitherto only to be obtained
from Paris, of      a   very indifferent quality, and at
                                                   price equal  a
to that of gold, first induced me to turn my attention to the
subject.   After having repeated      variety of experiments,
                                               a
from the different writers on this substance, without effect,
I   at length completed       a     process,   the    success   of which      ha3
fully    answered
                my expectations.     By the process which                     I
follow  I   am ableto reduce any quantity of crude platina to
a perfectly malleable state, entirely free from impurity, and
capable of being wrought into any form whatever.       As this
is
a    circumstance of considerable importance to the chemical
world, and the advantages which may result from        to           it        so
ciety in general are perhaps incalculable,   would consider
                                                       I
myself deserving of censure, could allow any motive whatever
                                          I
to induce me to withhold      from the public.

                 Process   for rendering Platina malleahlt.
Philosophical Magazine, it will meet the eyes of those fof
whom it is intended. If any benefit result from it to science,
or the arts, my end is gained, and *I (hall feel amply repaid
for my trouble. The method I pursue is as follows : —
     To     a given quantity      of    crude       platina I add        15   times its
weight of nitro-muriatie acid (composed of equal parts of
nitric and muriatic acids) in a tubulated glass retort, with a
tubulated receiver adapted to it.                   It   is then boiled, by means
of an Argand's lamp, till the                  acid has assumed a deep saffron
colour: it       is then poured off; and             if any platina remains nn-
dissolved, more acid is added,              and it is again boiled until the
whole is taken up. The                  liquor, being suffered to rest till
quite clear, is again decanted                  :   a solution      of sil-ammoniac
is then added, by little and little, till it no longer gives a
cloudiness. By this means the platina is thrown down in
the form of a lemon-coloured precipitate, which having sub
sided, the liquor is poured             off,    and the precipitate repeatedly
washed with distilled water              till it    ceases      to give an acid taste:
(too much water is injurious, the precipitate being in a cer
tain degree soluble in that liquid :) the water is then poured
off, and the precipitate evaporated to dryness.
   So far my process is in a great measure similar to that
which some others have also followed ; but my method of
managing the subsequent, and which are indeed the principal
manipulations, will be found to possess many advantages
over any that has yet been made public.    The best process
hitherto followed  has been, to give the precipitate a white
heat in a crucible, which in some measure agglutinates   the
particles ; and then to throw the mass into a red hoi mortar,
or any similar implement, and endeavour to unite them by
using a pestle or stamper.   But the mass is so spongy that it
    13   hardly poflible to get       a single stroke applied          to it before the
    welding heat is gone;         and though bv peculiar dexteritv and
    address some have        in this     way succeeded,             it has been fount!
    to require such innumerable heatings and hammerings, that
    most    of   those who have         attempted         it,   have either sailed en
    tirely, or given   it   up   as    being too laborious             and expensive.
T        have succeeded in obviating all these difficulties,                  by   adopt
    ing the following simple, easy, and expeditious method                         :—
                                                                              A    strong,

      Astrong,           hollow,        of crucible earth being
                                         inverted          cone
 procured, with a corresponding stopper to sit       made of the                    it,
 same materials, the point of the latter    cut off about three-         is
 fourths from the base. The platina, now in the state of                                                   X
 light yellow powder,      pressed tight into the cone, and,
                                           is                                                              a
 cover being fixed slightly on,      placed in ah air-furnace*,
                                                         it   is
 and      the fire raised gradually to                        a    strong white heat.               In the
 mean time the conical stopper,                               fixed   in   a   pair of iron tongs
 suitable      for the purpose,                   is   brought to          a   red, or to       a   bright
 red heat.           The      cover being then removed from the cone, the
 tongs with the heated stopper                                is   introduced through               a   hole
 in the cover of the furnace, and                              pressed     at first gently on the
 platina, at this time in                     a   state    nearly     as soft as      dough, till         it
 at length acquires                 a    more solid consistence.                     It   then re
                                                                                           is
peatedly       struck with the stopper, as hard as the nature                                       of   the
materials will admit, till                      it   appears to receive no farther im
pression.           The      cone     is   then removed               from the furnace, and
being struck lightly with    hammer, the platina falls out in
                                                a
a  metallic button, from which state     may be drawn,     re       it                              by
peatedly heating and gently hammering, into        bar fit for                        a
flatting, drawing into wire, planishing, 8cc.
   Besides the comparative facility of this process,      has the                         it
farther advantage of rendering the platina much purer than
when red-hot iron     obliged to be had recourse to; for pla

  X         O fix on       stuffs with success          the metallic prussiats, it was
 necessary to examine with care the results                             arising    from the
 mixture of metallic solutions with the prussiats of pot-ash or
 of lime. The most interesting information which I procured
 by my experiments is                  as   follows     :   —
      The     red oxyd         of mercury subjected                to the action       of   the
 liquor of prussiat            of pot-ash or of lime,
                                          acidulated by the suU
 phuric acid,  did  not produce blue, but was transformed gra
 dually into yellowish sulphat of mercury : next morning, after
 an addition of the muriatic acid, the change took place in
 an instant, and I obtained a blue exceedingly brilliant. Hav
 ing,       instead   of   the sulphuric acid, employed                 the muriatic, the
 red oxyd was dissolved, and the liquor became transparent,                                   of
 a bad blue colour, which             gradually brighter
                                                 became       it                         as
 was precipitated. The red oxyd of mercury, dissolved first by
 the nitric acid in excess, to which was added prussiat of pot
 ash orof lime, furnished also a blue. The operation is flow
 when the red oxyd is used without dissolving          and when              it,
 you confine yourself to acidulating the prussiat with the nitric
 acid.        An   aqueous solution        of the oxygenated muriat of mer
 cury, mixed with              a   solution of prussiat of pot-dfh or of lime,
 acidulated           by
               the muriatic or nitric                             acid, gives also     a    very
 beautiful blue.
        In all   these processes        of mercury,             and particularly the last,
 a    part of this oxygenated substance remains in solution, and
 resembles     the liquor obtained                     by
                                      destroying the colour of the
 prussiat of iron            by
                     means of the red oxyd of mercury and of
 water.    The oxyd of silver     changed with more difficulty,

     A    solution of cobalt furnishes               a   greyish     violet, and, with
the addition of muriat of ammonia,                         a   beautiful violet blue ;
while, in treating solutions of the sulphat of zinc, the nitrat
of bismuth, the muriat of tin, and the acetite of lead, with
liquor of the prussiat of pot-ash or of lime, acidulated as be
fore, you obtain only whites.     Copper is precipitated under
a brown shade.       The muriat of antimony, precipitated by
aqueous dilution,            and exposed,     like the oxyd of silver, to the
action of the acidulated                prussiat of pot-ash, indicates some
disposition           to become blue.       Adding to the muriatic solution
of       the black oxyd        of   manganese,           muriat of ammonia,        and
mixing this solution with liquor of the prussiat of pot-ash,
acidulated by the sulphuric acid, there is formed a very beau
tiful blue.
     I    must             not to be discouraged when the
                      inform chemists
production of blue does not immediately take place; if it
should happen that they do not obtain    they must vary the    it,
proportions until they have accomplished their end. The
blue of silver often docs not succeed till after long time,               a
and does not acquire its utmost degree of intensity till the
end   of eight, ten, or fifteen days.

   orange colour.     This process might furnish another means
  of purifying platina.
     A piece of cotton doth impregnated with a solution of
  gold, containing a sixth part of that metal without excess of
  acid, being plunged in a solution of ammonia, furnished me
  with an ochre yellow. This yellow at length became blackish
  after being kept in a sheet of paper.      As alkaline liquors, and
  particularly  that of the  carbonat  of pot-ash or of soda, have a
  great tendency to dissolve the oxyd of gold, it cannot be used
  for its precipitation on cloth.     Cloth coloured yellow by gold
  dipped in muriat of tin diluted with water, undergoes a change
 into dark blackish grey, which becomes brighter in propor
 tion as the solution is diluted.      I have often obtained violets
 and lilacs by dipping, without precipitation, the cloth merely
 imbibed with a solution of gold, in nitro-muriatic solutions
 of tin prepared with different proportions of the acid. Se
 veral shades of gold colour will be obtained by precipitating
 oxyd of tin from its nitro-muriatic solution by dilution with
 water, to which a solution of gold has been added, drop by
 drop, at different times, with intervals of several hours. This
 mode of operation will furnish orange colours, while, if you
 substitute oxyd of gold for the solution, you will obtain lilacs,
 which, approaching more and more to shades of crimson,
will at last become orange, if you continue to add to them,
 from time to time, oxyd of gold. These shades depend a great
deal on the proportion of muriatic acid present in the nitro-
 muriatic solution of tin.      If it contains too great a quantity,
the dose of water must be augmented to make the oxyd of
tin precipitate itself, and the gold in that case gives a grey
colour more or less reddisli. The solution of tin, which I
employed for these experiments, was composed of four parts
of nitric acid, one of muriatic acid, and one and a quarter
of granulated tin, slowly dissolved, to prevent, as much as
possible, the nitrous gas from being disengaged in too great
quantity.      These oxyds of tin, coloured by the oxyd of gold
more or    less de-oxygenated, do not require much metal, and
consequently are not dear.         They all present, when dry, dif
ferent   shades  of  grey and   lilac  more or less intense, and in
all probability might be employed for painting porcelain.

     Stuff coloured by the oxyd of gold                seems   to attract
the colouring particles of madder, and assumes a reddisli-
brown tint, or a fort of carmelite, which is more and more
blackened by a continuation            or increase of the heat.      The
other ingredients proper for dyeing also blacken gold by the
help of heat.         Galls, by ebullition, have an analogous effect,
and produce almoll the fame greyifli-black colour as that
obtained by dipping in a muriatic solution of tin, probably
 because all these means de-oxygenate the oxyd of gold. The
 change into blue, of stuff coloured yellow by the oxyd of gold
 exposed to the       action of dissolved pmsfiat of pot-a(h or of
 lime, acidulated by the sulphuric or any other acid, takes
 place only slowly.         Three, four, and even five hours immer
 sion are necessary to obtain a beautiful blue          of equal intensity
 with the yellow produced by gold. By acidulating too strongly
 the liquor of the prufliat, the oxyd of gold dissolves without
  giving    a  blue.
      It is not uncommon to fee the experiment fail when the
  solution of gold is directly mixed with a solution of an alka
  line prufliat or a prufliat of lime.        Every thing here depends
  on the degree of acidulation ; but the experiment will gene
  rally succeed when the oxyd of gold has been previously pre
  cipitated by ammonia or some other alkali.
       I for a long time imagined that these blues arose from the
  metal employed, and formed pruffiats. I was so full of this
  idea, that, when I made the discovery in 1 781, I communi
   cated it to the celebrated      professor Spielmann,      who returned
   me the following answer        :—
                                      " Weftenberg,      in a dissertation
   maintained at Gottingen in 1772, and Martin more amply
   in a thesis printed here in 1775, remarked, that ley of blood
   precipitated      gold  under a blue colour     ;  but that, to obtain
   this colour, it was necessary to make use of an acid. The
   latter observed chiefly, that alkali, saturated with prussian
   blue, precipitated gold immediately of a blue colour; and
   that, if ley of blood was deprived of all volatile alkali by
    distillation, the residuum, more concentrated, dyed still more
    easily   the metals    it precipitated   from their menstrua."       At
    the time when       I was employed in repeating      my experiments,
    my friend Charles Bartholdi           objected   to me, that all my
                                                                      blues

 blues arose only from iron, which the solutions of pruffiats of
 pot-ash and of lime hold more or less in solution.   I learned
 also, from a passage   in Busson in his observations on the na
 ture  of platina, that Morveau had doubted the experiment of
 Fourci, who precipitated gold of a blue colour by the prussian
 alkali. Though we cannot deny the existence of iron in pruf
 fiats of alkalies and of lime, I could, however, with difficulty
 believe       that  metallic substance fixed on stuff, could be re
                      a
 placed        by any other which would at the same time remain
 fixed.
    If, in my experiment on cloth coloured by the oxyd of
 gold, that oxyd had disappeared ; if the pruffiat of iron had
 been precipitated in the liquor, instead of being fixed on the
 stuff; if the ashes of some specimens had not gilded silver;
 and, in the last place, if the intensity of blues had not been so
 considerable         and so general, and the shades         of   each different,
 I shouldcertainly have been sooner freed from my error ; but
I now am, and the following is the method in which I pro
ceeded to convince myself of my mistake : — I deprived of its
colour, by means of a solution of pot-ash, a piece of cotton
cloth coloured yellow by gold, and then rendered blue : I
                                                                                       "

solution of tin, and produced the same effect as \vi*h the oxyd
of iron.  This cloth, deprived of its colour, and become of                       a
yellow similar to that produced                  by
                                       the oxyd of iron, was
changed  into blue           by
                        alkaline pruffiats as speedily as the
latter. This blue cloth, as well as that deprived of its co
lour      by   pot-ash when reduced to ashes, scarcely gilded silver;
and these ashes, treated with mercury, furnished only                     a   flight
gilding, arising no doubt from    small portion of the oxyd
                                            a
of gold which had remained untouched in the liquor of the
acidulated pruffiats, which,           by
                               longer immersion of the stuff,
could not have failed to have been taken up.
  These proofs were too striking not to induce me to con
tinue my experiments.          soaked, therefore, the cotton cloth

phuric acids, and assumed a pretty equal blue colour, of great
beauty and splendour; but, when deprived of its colour by
caustic pot-ash, it could not be brought back to its first shades.
The yellow   preserving a decided superiority seemed to obscure
the   rest ;      which shews that the prussiat of iron had displaced
a great part        of the oxyd of filver.
     The nitric folution of           the red oxyd        of mercury, with which
1    impregnated the cotton                in order      to dip it in a folution                of
caustic pot-ash, gave a very beautisul yellow, while the                                    nitric
folution of mercury, newly made, produced a grey; but these
two shades, having been lest fome days in the folution of the
prussiat     of     acidulated by the nitric, muriatic, or sul
                  pot-ash
phuric acids, were changed into blue.          The colour being
asterwards discharged by   caustic alkali, the  grey and yellow
shades re-appeared — with this disserence, that the latter had a
greater resemblance               to the rust    of iron.      What           is fingular       is,
that the grey dissered very little from its first shade       how               :     is,

an ochre yellow.
     All    these experiments present phenomena                          fo   fingular that
they deserve to be repeated                ;    which   I    shall perhaps         do   but

of these blues are only prussiat of iron the changes      affi

nity, however, are extraordinary.                       It   is,   above all,          on the
grey oxyd of mercury changed blue, that                            it   is   of importance
to fix attention.
     As    the precipitates        which     are formed        in mixtures of                me
tallic folutions with folutions                 of   prussiats,     of alkalies, or of
lime, acidulated, though not blue, are still prussiats under
disserent colours,      very probable that the metallic oxyds,

III.    Account of a sample and effectual Preparation of Seed-
       Corn.      By Mr. John Wagstaffe, o/Nor-wub*.
   A HERE            has    been long fought for, and, in the opinion
of   some, long since obtained, a perfect cure of the dHease in
wheat and other grain, provincially known by various names,
as smut, soot-brand, &c. which are but one and the same
disease.
     From      the    partial judgment of manv individuals, it has
been asserted,        that such and such caustics, salts, and washes,
have been completely destructive of this bane ; yet, however
such individuals may have escaped its malignity, the repeated
use of their recipes has not succeeded with others to w hom
their process has been communicated : but I am convinced,
bv a series of repeated experiments, that every person, who
duly practises the simple means I now lav before you, will
be exempted          from its immediate bane; and         a district of cotin-
trv, bv pursuing the same means, mav perhaps                    escape  suture
 contagion.
     The     means are simple;        and arc no other than immersing
 the feed       in pure water, and repeatcdlv         scouring it therein,
just before it is sown or dibbled in the soil.               Whether well,
 spring, or river water be used, is indifferent ; but repeated
 stirring and change of water is essential to remove the par
 ticles of infection that may have irnperccptiblv adhered lo
 the feeds thus purified         : the subsequent    crop will be perfect
 in   itself,   and    its feeds (I am persuaded) sueceflively so like
 wise,     if there    are no adjacent fields from whence this conta
 mination        may be wafted. Before I give von a series of ex
 periments, which have confirmed to me the complete cure
 of the disease in question, permit me to observe, that many
 years     since,    believing that this corrupt substance of smut
 occasioned       its perpetuation, I took some grains of wheat from
  a stock     that had been known         not to be affected with smut ;
  these grains        I   blackened    with its dust, and the succeeding
  summer confirmed my opinion,               as near  half  the produce was

                                                          ;     and in my own small
 used some of the strongly recommended nostrums that were
 said always to effect a cure, and which apparently they did,
 as I uniformly steeped the grain in rain water before                                              I   made
 the addition of a disgustful fluid, or commixture of                                               I   know
 not what strange substances.
         About two             years since,          I   was called upon by an intelligent
 farmer (Roger Trcsscy)                           of Devonshire,                   who      confidentially
 (because he had a subscription in view) laid this simple pro
 cess before me. I was immediately convinced, by comparing
 what          I    had practised with the principle he advanced.
         I   then repeated my former experiments. I took                                        a   handful
of pure wheat,            and blackened       rubbing in            it,   by                     as     much
smut-brand   as  was able   after which,
                               I             divided this cor
                                                ;                              I
rupted handful into two equal parts    retained one part with             ;
all its corrupt impregnation*, and the other part          well                                     I
cleansed in water from its baneful particles    these two parts                     :
I     again subdivided            into three portions each, two of which                                     I
dibbled             in   different situations, viz.  portion of the pure and

impure, near to, but distinctly separated from, each other;
two other portions some miles from the former two: and the
remaining two (the corrupted and the cleansed)     committed                              I
to the care of an accurate neighbour for his putting into the
ground, at which     was present, and witnessed the exactness
                                   I
of     the separation.                 The products of                    these     several trials were

convinced of its certainty,                           without     waiting the           issue     of   a
harvest.            The      consequence             of which        has been,         that   I   have
neither         seen      nor heard of
                         a smutty ear in this district ; which,
I believe, hath  in no preceding year been free from them.
In fine, not only from the experiments already adverted to,
but from others which   might be adduced, I am fully per
suaded that the confirmation of this discovery (and it has
been many years back suggested) will lead to an incalculable
advantage; for it is not alone a preservation of the most in
dispensable article of human food from an appearance and
flavour truly disgustful ; but, while it renders it more nutri
tious, it also augments its quantity                               ;     for every       fmut-ball
might        have been a perfect grain, by using the simple process
referred to.       To this let me add, that other kinds of bread,
as well as that more generally used,                              may be augmented and
improved            ;    since barley and oats                 equally escape this conta
mination and diminution,                            if their   feeds are equally purified.
IV.        On the Distillation                 of    ardent     Spirit from Carrots.                   By
                Dr. Hunter and Mr. Hornby, of York*.
o,NE      ton and eight stone of carrots, which, after being
exposed to the air a few days to dry, weighed one hundred
and sixty stone, and measured forty- two bushels, were washed,
topped,        and tailed, by which they loll in weight eleven stone,
and         in measure seven bushels : being then cut, they were
boiled, with the proportion of twenty-four gallons of water
to one-third of the above quantity of carrots, until the whole
was reduced to a tender pulp, which was done in three h6urs
    wheat to the pump,          and      has   had (he fays) any brand since.
                                               not                                And,
    what    is still mere confirming,                   farmer in this vicinity applied

    to me    for        Roger Treffey s process, in consequence of his whole crop of
    wheat being so excessively             infected with smut,          that his threshers daily,        at
    the close of their labour, cleansed         thcTnsehes in water, they being, as he
    expressed

    wheat from ibis seed, scoured in repeated washings,                          escaped      the taint,
except      a   piece     of land   in           with the homestead which this gen

boiling.        From this pulp the juice was easily extracted, by
means of a press, and two hundred gallons of juice were pro
duced from the whole. This juice was boiled again, with one
pound of hops, five hours, and then cooled to 66° of Fah
renheit ; and, six quarts of yeast being added, it was set to
ferment. The strong fermentation lasted forty-eight hours,
during which time the heat abated to 580 of Fahrenheit.
Twelve       gallons of unfermented juice, which had been re
served, were then heated,              and added to the liquor, the heat
of    which was thus raised again to 66°, and the fermentation
was renewed for twenty-four hours more, the air of the brew-
house being all this time at 460 and 440.                     The liquor was
 now tunned,           and   continued     to  work    three   days from the
 bung.       Lastly, it was distilled ; and the first distillation was
 rectified the next day, without any addition.                   The produce
 was twelve gallons of spirit*.
      The   refuse    of the carrots weighed forty-eight stone,          which,
 added to the tops and tails, made               provision for hogs, besides
 the wash         from    the still,   which   measured     one hundred and
 fourteen gallons.
      From this experiment, which was made by Mr. Hornby,
 Dr. Hunter draws the following comparison between the
 distillation of carrots and that of grain :
      Twenty tons of carrots, which will make two hundred
  gallons of proof-spirit, may be bought for 16 /.
      Eight quarters of malt, or rather of materials for distilla
  tion, consisting of malt, wheat, and rye, may be bought for
  16 /. and will also yield two hundred gallons of proof-spirit.
       The refuse from the carrots will be nine hundred and
  sixty stone,      which,    at one penny per stone,        will fell for 4 /.
       The   refuse, or grains, from the         malt, &c. will be sixty-four
  bushels,       each    bufliel about three     stone, which, at one penny
  per stone, will fell for 16 s.
       Dr. Hunter, however, supposes that the manufacturing of
   the spirit from carrots may be attended with more expence
      *  A  sample of this spirit,  which was     sent along with the piper, was
   examined     by Dr. Black, Dr. Hutton, and        Mr.RuflcIl : they found   that
   it resembled    a corn spirit in flavour,  but that it was equal to a corn spirit
   of  the Ixst  kind, and that it was proof.
                                                                             than

o,UR              first knowledge       of   the   plant being          a   native of our
island arose from the following                  accident      :   — In our excursions
into the forests it was found necelVary to carry cutlasses for
the purpose of clearing our way through the underwood. In
one of those an elastic-gum vine had been divided, the milk
of which drying upon the blade, we were much surprised in
finding it possess all the properties of the American Caout
chouc.      The vine which            produces     this milk is generally about
the thickness of the arm, and almost                     round, with a strong
ash-coloured bark, much cracked, and divided longitudinally j
has joints at a small distance from each other, which often
fend      out roots, but seldom branches              ;       runs upon the ground
to        length
      a great              ;   at last rises upon the highest trees into the
open air.  It is found in the greatest plenty at the foot of the
mountains, upon a red clay mixed with land, in situations
completely shaded, and where the mercury in the thermo
meter      will   seldom exceed summer heat.
      In my numerous    attempts to trace this vine to its top, I
never succeeded  ; for,  after following it in its different wind
ings, sometimes to a distance of two hundred paces, I lost                               it,
from its ascending among the branches of trees that were
inaccessible either from their size or height.         On the west

     With    us the Malays      have found tasting    of the milk the
Ircst mode of discriminating between the elastic-gum vine
 and those which resemble it in giving out a milky juice, of
 which     we have a great variety ; the liquid from the formes
 being much      less pungent or corrosive than that obtained from
 the latter.
     The   usual method      of drawing off the milk is by wounding
 the bark deeply in different place?, from which it runs but
 slowly, it being full employment for one person to collect a
 quart in the course of two days.           A much more expeditious-
 mode, but ruinous to the vine, is cutting it in lengths of two
 feet, and placing under both ends vessels to receive the milk.
 The     best  is always procured from the oldest vines.         From
 them it is often obtained in a consistence equal to thick
 cream,     amd   which will yield two-thirds of its own weight in
 gum.
     The chemical       properties   of this vegetable milk, so far as
  I have had an opportunity of examining, surprisingly resem
  ble those of animal milk. From its decomposition in con
  sequence of spontaneous fermentation, or by the addition of
  acids,   a separation    takes place between its caseous and serous
  parts,   both of which are very similar to those produced by
  the fame processes from animal         milk. Au oily or butyrous
  matter is also one of its component parts, which appears
  upon the surface of the gum so soon as the latter has attained
  its solid form.      The presence of this considerably impeded
   the progress    of my experiments, as will be seen hereafter.
      I was at some trouble in endeavouring to form an extract
   of this milk so as to approach to the consistence of new but
  ter, by which I hoped to retard its fermentative stage with
  out depriving it of its useful qualities ; but, as I had no ap
   paratus for distilling, the surface of the milk, that was ex
   posed to the air, instantly formed into a solid coat, by which
   the evaporation was in a great degree prevented.          I however
   learned, by collecting the thickened milk from the inside of
   the coats, and depositing it in a jelly-pot, that, if excluded
   from the air, it might be preserved in this state for a con
   siderable length of time.

  good, upwards of one year;         for, notwithstanding the feT-
 mentation soon takes place,         the  decomposition in conse
  quence is only partial, and what remains fluid still retains
 its original properties, although considerably diminished.
     Not having     seen M. Fourcroy's memoir on Caout-cbouCi
 I could    not make trials of the methods proposed by him for
 preserving the milk unaltered.
     In making boots, gloves, and bottles, of the clastic gum,
 I  found the following method the best : — I first made moulds
 of   wax, as nearly of the size and shape of what they repre
 sented as possible '; these I hung separately upon pins, about
 a foot from the ground, by pieces of cord wrought into the
 wax   : I  then placed under each a soup-plate, into which I
 poured    as much of the milk as I thought would be sufficient
 for one coat. Having dipped my fingers in this, I completely
 covered the moulds one after another, and what dropped into
 the plates was used as part of the next coat: the first         I
 generally found sufficiently dry in the space of ten minutes^
 when exposed to the sun, to admit of a second being applied :
however, after every second coal, the oily matter before men
tioned was in such quantity upon the surface, that, until
washed     off with soap and water, I found it impossible to ap
ply any more milk with effect; for, if laid on, it kept run
ning and dividing like water upon wax.
    Thirty coats I in common found sufficient to give a cover
ing of the thickness of the bottles which come from America.
This circumstance may, however, at any time be ascertained
by introducing the finger between the mould and gum, the
one very readily separating from the other.
    I found the fingers preferable to a brush, or any instrument
whatever, for laying on the milk ; for, the moment a brufli
was wet with that fluid, the hair became united as one mass.
A mode which at first view would appear to have the advan
tage   of all others for ease and expedition in covering clay and
wax moulds with the gum, viz. immersing them in the milk,
did not at all answer upon trial ; that fluid running almost
entirely off, although none of the oily matter was present ;
a certain degree of force seeming necessary to incorporate,
by friction, the milk with the new-formed gum.

     When,          upon examination, I found that the boots and
gloves were          of the thickness wanted, I turned them over at
the top,        and drew them off,                        if
                                            from the leg or hand, by

Which      I    saved   the trouble of forming new moulds.     Thoso
of   the bottles being smallest                 at the            neck,      I    was     under the
necessity       of   dissolving; in hot water.
.    The       inside   of   the. boots         and        gloves which             had been       in
contact with the wax being by far the smoothest, I made the
outside.  The gloves were now finished, unless cutting their
tops even,           which       was    best    done           with scissars.           The   boots,
however, in their present state, more resembled stockings,
having as yet no soles. To supply them with these, I poured
upon a piece of gunny a proper quantity of milk, to give it a
thick coat of gum.     From this, when dry, I cut pieces suffi
ciently large to cover the sole of the foot, which, having wet
with the milk, I applied ; first replacing the boot upon Hie
mould to keep it properly extended.    By this mode the soles
were so firmly joined, that no force could afterwards separate
them.          In    the same manner            I    added           heels and straps, when
the boots had a very neat appearance.                                   To       satisfy myself as
to their impermeability to water, I stood in a pond up to
their tops for the space of fifteen minutes, when, upon pull
ing them oss, I did not find my stockings in the least damp.
Indeed, from the nature of the gum, had it been for a period
of as many months,                 the      fame         result      was to have been ex
pected.
   After being thus far successful, I was greatly disappointed
in my expectations with regard to their retaining their ori
ginal shape; for, on wearing them but a few times, they lost
much of their first neatness,                        the contractions                of    the gum
being only equal to about                    seven        eighths of its extension.
     A   second disadvantage                argse        from  a circumstance difficult
 to guard against, which was, that           any accident, the    if,   by
gum should be       the smallest degree weaker in one place
                            in
than another, the effect of extension fell almost entirely on
.that part, and the consequence was that     soon gave way.             it

cloth,     in fome degree correspondent to the elasticity of th*
gum,      were used for boots, stockings, gloves, and other arti
cles     where
            that property was necessary, that the desect*
above-mentioned might in a great measure be remedied.                            I
accordingly        made    my first experiment             with Cossimbaza*
stockings    and gloves.
     Having drawn them upon                  the   wax moulds,        I   plunged
them into     vessels containing the milk, which                      the    cloth
greedily abforbed. When taken out, they were fo com
pletely distended with the gum in folution, that, upon be
coming dry by exposure to the air, not only every thread,
but every fibre of the cotton had its own distinct envelope,
and, in consequence, was equally capable of refisting the ac
tion of foreign bodies as is of folid gum.
   The firft coat by this method was of such thickness, that,
for Stockings or gloves, nothing farther was necessary. What
were intended for boots required a sew more applications of
milk     wit!> the   lingers, and were finished            as those   made with
the gum onlv.
-    This   mode     of giving cloth    as a bafis     Ifound to be a very
great improvement;           for, befides      the addition of strength re
ceived bv the gum, the operation Mas much shortened.
   Woven substances, that are to be covered with the gum,
9' alfo the moulds on which they are to be placed, ought to
he confiderably larger than the bodies they are asterwards in
tended to fit j for, being much contracted from the abforp
tion of the milk, little alteration takes place in this diminu
tion in fize even when dry, as about one-third only of the
fluid evaporates besore the gum acquires its folid form.
    Great attention must be paid to prevent one part of the
gum coming in contact with another while wet with the
milk, or     its   whey; for,   the instant        that takes place, they be
come inseparab.y           united.   But should            we ever succeed      in
h:i\ ing large plantations of our own vine, or in transserring

our possessions,    that milk could be procured in sufficient

 would for ever balance its disadvantages : cloths, and cover
 ings of different descriptions, might then be made from this
 gum-cloth with an expedition so much greater than by the
 needle       that    would at         first   appear very surprising;                       the edges
 of the separate pieces onlv requiring to be wet with the milk,
 or its whey, and brought into contact, when the article
 would be finished and fit for use.      Should both milk and
 whey be wanting, a solution of the gum in ether can always
 be obtained, by which the fame end would be accomplisticd.
   Of all the cloths upon which I made experiments, nan
 keen, from the strength and quality of its fabric, appeared
the best calculated for coating with the gum.   The method
I followed in performing this, was, to lay the cloth smooth
upon a table, pour the milk upon        and, with   ruler, to     it,                    a
spread     equally.

larger scale,    would recommend the following plan — To
                     I                                                                         :

cloth, to be covered with                  a   cross bar            in    the centre,          which
must reach under the surface                    of     the milk,           and two rollers at
one end.         Having filled           the cistern,             one end      of    the piece      of
cloth    is   to be pasted under the bar, and through between the
rollers   ;   the former keeping the cloth immersed                                 in the milk,
the latter inresting out what
                     p            superfluous,    that none
                                                       is                           so
may be lost.  The cloth can be hung up at full length to
dry, and the operation repented until of whatever thickness
wanted. For the reasons above-mentioned, care must be
taken that one fold does not come                            in contact with another
while wet.
     Having      observed         that    most of           the       patent   catheters           and
bougies made with                 a   solution of           the    clastic     gum, whether
in ether or in the essential                       oils, had either            a    disagreeable
stickiness,     or were too hard to admit                     of        any advantage          being
derived from the elasticity of the gum; was induced to make,      [
some    experiments with the milk towards removing these ob
jections.
   From that             fluid,   by     evaporation,         I         made   several         large-
sized bougies         of   pure gum, which, from their over-flexibilitv,
were totally useless.             I   then took some llips                 of fine cloth co
vered with the gum, which                  I   rolled up until             of proper size.

and which         I rendered       solid,   by soaking them in the mill?,
and then drying them.                 These possessed more firmness than
the former, but in no degree sufficient for the purpose in-
fended. Pieces of strong catgut, coated with the gum, I
found to answer better than either.
      Besides an effectual         cloathing for manufacturers employed
with     the mineral acids,          which had been long a desideratum,
this substance,         under different modifications,              might    be ap
plied to a number             of other        useful purposes in      life;  such as
 making       hats,     great c.oats, boots, &c. for sailors, soldiers,
 fistiermen,     and every other description of persons who, from
their pursuits, are exposed to wet stockings ; for invalids, who
 suffer from damps ; bathing caps, tents, coverings for carri
 ages of all kinds, for roofs of houses, trunks, buoys, &c.
      This extraordinary          vegetable production, in place of being
 injured by water          at   its usual temperature *, is preserved by
 it.     For   a   knowledge of this circumstance I am indebted
 to the Chinese.           Having, some years ago, commissioned ar
  ticles made of the elastic-gum, from China, I received them
  in a small jar silled up with water; in which state I have
  since kept them without observing any signs of decay.
       Should it ever be deemed an object to attempt plantations
  pf   the elastic-gum vine in Bengal,                  I  would recommend the
   foot of the Chittagong, Rajmahal, and Bauglipnre hills, as
   situations where there is every probability of succeeding,
   being very similar in soil and climate to the places of its
   growth on Prince of Wales* Island.                         It would, however,
   be advisable      tq  make     the   first  trial  at this settlement, to lcari\
   jn what way         the propagation           of the plant might be most
   successfully conducted.              A    further     experienpe may also be
    necessary to ascertain the season when the milk can be pro
    cured   of  the best quality,         and    in   the greatest quantity,     with,
    the least detriment to the vine.

    M.   Grossart,  inserted in the Aimalr<      Jt  Cbimif for 1792, it appears, that

             Charles Hatchett,                            Esq.     F.R.S.*
OOME          experiments which I lately made at the request of
Mr. Home,        and which he has done me the honour to men
tion in his ingenious paper on the teeth of granivorous qua
drupeds, induced me to turn my attention more particularly*
to the chemical examination of fliell and bone, especially as
the former appeared to have been hitherto much neglected.
   The time since these experiments were begun, has not been
sufficient to enable me to enter                     into all the minutiae of the
chemical analysis of these substances;                           but, as some remark
able    facts       were    ascertained,         I   have now ventured to bring
them forward, with the addition of some observations, al
though as yet the whole is little more than a very imperfect
outline.
   The      first    of    these experiments were made on the shells                        of
marine animals             ;     and   to avoid       repetition and prolixity,                 I
(hall, in    a great measure,            once for         all,   describe the menstrua,
the precipitants,              and the mode          of operation.
      When      stiells were examined, they were immersed                      in   acetous
 acid, or nitric acid, diluted, according to circumstances, with
 four, five, six, or more parts of distilled water; and the solu
 tion was always made without heat.
      The         of lime was precipitated by the carbonate
            carbonate
 of ammoniac, or of pot-ash ; and phosphate of lime    pre                           (if
 sent) was previously precipitated                        by   pure   or caustic     ammo*
 mac.
      If any
           other phosphate like that of soda was suspected,                                 it
 was discovered     solution of acetite of lead.
                            by
   Bones and teeth were also subjected to the action of the
 acetous, or diluted nitric and muriatic acids.
      The          portion was examined
             dissolved                      the abovc-mcnT            by
 tioned precipitants; and,                  in
                              experiments where the quantity
 of the substance would permit, the phosphoric acid was also
 separated           by   nitric or sulphuric acid.  The phosphoric acid
  thus obtained, was               proved  after concentration   experi-       by

    Sa                  Experiments and Observations
   ments, which being usually employed for such purposes, are
   too well known to require description.
       It is necessary moreover to observe,         that as  the substances
   examined were very numerous, and my principal object: was
   to discover the most prominent characters in them, I did not
   for the present attempt in general to ascertain minutely the
   proportions     so  much as the number and quality of their re
   spective ingredients.
       The   greater part,     if not all, of marine shells, appear to be
   of two    descriptions    in respect to the substance of which they
   are composed.        Those which will be first noticed have a por
   cellaneous aspect with an enamelled surface, and when broken
   are often, in a flight degree, of a fibrous texture.
      The shells of the other division have generally, if not al
   ways, a strong epidermis, under which is the shell, princi
  pally or entirely composed of the substance called nacre, or

      Of   the porcellaneous shells, various species         of voluta, cy-

 selected     the  oyster,    the   river muscle, the baliotis iris} and
  the turbo olearius.
                  Experiments      on Porcellaneous    Shells.
      Shells of this description, when exposed to a red heat in a
 crucible during about a quarter of an hour, crackled and lost
 the colours of their enamelled              surface ; they did not emit
 any apparent smoke, nor any smell like that of burnt horn
 or cartilage. Their figure remained unchanged, excepting a
 few flaws ; and they became of an opaque white, tinged par
 tially with pale grey, but retained part of their original gloss.          -
     The    shells which      had   not been exposed to fire (whether
 entire or in powder) dissolved with great effervescence in the
various acids ; and the solution afterwards remained colour
less and transparent.           But the shells which had been burned,
upon being dissolved, deposited a very small quantity of ani
mal coal; and thereby the presence of some gluten was de
noted, although the proportion was too small to be discovered
jn   the solution    of  the shells which had not been burned.

quent solution was more considerable than that of the shells
above mentioned, and the proportion of carbonate of lime
relative to their weight was less.
     When     the recent shells were immersed                 in very dilute nitric
acid, the epidermis was separated, the whole of the carbo
nate of lime was dissolved, and   gelatinous substance, nearly
                                                  a
liquid, remained,   but  without retaining the figure of the
shell, and without any fibrous appearance.
     These shells evidently, therefore,                contain   a    larger portion
of   a   more viscid gelatinous substance than those before men
tioned;  but the solution separated from the gelatinous sub
stance afforded nothing but carbonate of lime.

     Upon- immersing an unburned shell in dilute -nitric .acid%
 a. rapid solution and effervescence at first took place, but gra-*
 dually became less, so that the disengagement of the carbonic
 actd gas was to be perceived only at intervals.
     At  the   end   of two    days  I  sound   nearly the whole of the
 carbonate    of lime   dissolved,   but a series of membranes re
 taining the figure of the (hell remained, of which the epi
 dermis constituted the first.
     In the beginning      the   carbonate of lime was readily dis
 solved, because the acid menstruum had an easy access ; but
 after this it had more difficulty to insinuate         itself between the
 different membranes, and of course the solution of the car
 bonate os lime was flower.
    During    the solution the carbonic         acid gas was entangled,
 aud retained    in many     places between      the membranes,       so as
 to give to the whole a cellular appearance.
    The baliotis iris      and   the   turbo   olearius    resembled   this
muscle, excepting that their membranaceous parts were
more compact and dense.
    These shells, when deprived, by an acid menstruum, of
their hardening substance, or carbonate of lime, appear to be
formed of various membranes applied stratum super stratum.
    Each membrane has          a corresponding coat or crust of car
bonate of lime     ; which    is so situated  that it is always between
every    two membranes, beginning with the epidermis, and
ending with the last formed internal membrane.
    The animals which inhabit           these stratified shells, increase
their habitation by the addition of a stratum of carbonate of
lime, secured by a new membrane ; and as every additional
stratum exceeds in extent that which was previously formed,
the fliell becomes stronger in proportion as it is enlarged, and
the growth and age of the animal becomes denoted by the
number of the strata which concur to form the fliell.
    Although the baliotis iris and the turbo olearius are com
posed    of the true mother-of-pearl, I was induced to repeal
the foregoing experiments on some detached pieces of mother-'
of- pearl, such as are brought from China.
    These experiments I need not describe, as the results were
precisely   the fame.
                                                                   I must,

      I must, however, observe, that the membranaceous or car
  tilaginous parts of these shells,        as  of the pieces    of mother-ofr
  pearl, retained     the exact figure of the (hell or piece              which
  had been immersed in the acid menstruum;                 and these mem
  branaceous    parts distinctly appeared to be composed               of fibres
  placed   in a parallel direction, corresponding to the configura
  tion of the shell.
      The  same experiments were made on pearls              ;  which    proved
  to be similar   in composition        to the mother-of-pearl;          and so
  far as their size would enable          me   to discern,     they   appeared
  to be formed by concentric           coats   of membrane        and    carbo
  nate   of lime   :   by this uru6ture they much resemble the
  globular   calcareous     concretions found at Carlsbad, and other
 places, called pisolllbes.
     The wavy appearance           and   irradiancy of mother-of-pearl,
  and of pearl, are evidently the effect of their lamellated struc
  ture and semi-transparency; in which, in some degree, they
  are resembled    bv the lamellated        stone, called  adularia.
      When    the experiments on the porcellaneous shells, and on
  those formed of mother-of-pearl,              are compared, it appears
  that the porcellaneous fliells are composed of carbonate of
 lime, cemented by a very small portion of gluten ; and that
 mother-of-pearl, and pearl, do not differ from these, except
  by a smaller proportion of carbonate of lime ; which, instead
 of being simply       cemented      by animal gluten, is intermixed
 with,   and serves to harden a membranaceous or cartilagi
 nous substance      ; and   this substance,      even when deprived           of
•the carbonate     of lime,    still retains the figure    of the    shell.
,    But   between      these extremes      there  will probably     be found
 many gradations ; and these we have the greater reason to
 expect, from the example affurded by the pa tell æ, which
 have been lately mentioned.
     Some few experiments were made on certain land-shells;
 and in the common garden-snail I thought that I discovered
 some traces    of  phosphate     of lime;     but as  I did not find any
 in the helix memortilis,        it may he doubted whether the pre
 sence of phosphate of lime fliould be-confidered as a chemical
 character of land-shells*.

                                       Animals *.
     As I    was not acquainted with               aay experiments by which
the chemical nature              of the      substance which covers crusta-
ceous marine animals had been                     determined, I was defirous
to ascertain        in  what respect it was disserent from shells and
I began these experiments on three species of the echinus,
with which I had been savoured by the Right Hon. Prefident.
      I was the more inclined to begin                with   the echini, because
naturalifts do not appear to be persectly agreed whether to
call them testaceous or crustaceous animals.
      Klein, who has written a work upon echini, aster having
noticed the various opinions of Rondelet, Rumphius, and
Others, determines that they are to be regarded as testaceous
animals.          Mis words       are   :
                                           "  Sic plurimas testas marinas, in
*' statu naturali confideratas,              cum echinodermatis potiusquam

"must."
      But Linnæus was of the contrary opinion, as appears srom
 his desinition of the echinus : " Corpus subrotundum crujla

      Now,      as the     experiments above related had proved tha\
 the    shells    of   marine     animals were composed of carbonate of
 lime, without any phosphate, I thought it very posfible that.
 the covering of the crustaceous animals might, in fome re
 spect, be disserent ; and is fo, I should thu?, by chemical

 echinus was to be referred.
    Of the three echini which were examined, one bad small
 spines;    the   second   had large cflituCe spires; and the third
 was of a very flat form.                                                    ,
    Portions of these echini were separately immersed in acc,tpus,
 muriatic, and diluted nitric acid, by each of which they were
 completely dissolved with much effervescence ; depositing at
 the same time a thin outer skin, or epidermis. The transpa
 rency of the solutions was also disturbed by a portion os gluten
 which     remained suspended, and communicated a brownish
 colour to the liquors.
    The solutions in acetous and diluted nitric acid were fil-
irated; after which, from the acetous solution of each echi
nus,   I obtained a precipitate of phosphate of lead by the ad
dition of acetite of lead ; and having thus proved the presence
of phosphoric acid, I saturated the nitric solutions with pure
ammoniac,        by which a quantity of phosphate of lime was
obtained, much inferior, however, in quantity to the carbo
nate   of .lime, which     was afterwards    precipitated    by carbonate
 of ammoniac.
    The composition of the crust of the echinus is therefore
different from that of marine (hells ; and by the relative pro
portions and nature of the ingredients, it approaches molt
nearly to the shells of the eggs of birds; which in like man
ner consist of carbonate, with a small proportion os phosphate
of lime cemented by gluten.
    It remained now to examine the composition of those sub
stances which are decidedly called cruftaceous ; but previous
to this, some experiments were made on the atferias or star
fish, of which I took the species commonly found on our
coasts, and known by the popular name of live singers {ajlc~
rlas rubens.)

ceous state, and complete        in  respect to the original figure.
     The  dissolved portion,    being examined by the usual precw
pitants, proved to be carbonate         of lime, without any njixture
of phosphate ; but in another species of the asterias, which
had twelve rays (ajlerias pappofa), I discovered a small quan
tity of phosphate of lime. I am therefore induced               to suspect
that, in the different species of the asterias, nature          makes an
imperfect attempt to form (hell on some, and a crustaceous
coating on others ; and that a series of gradations is thus
formed between the testaceous, the crustaceous,                   and the
 coriaceous marine animals.
     It was now requisite to ascertain        if phosphate of lime is a
 component part      of the substance which covers the crustaceous
 marine or aquatic animals, such          as the  crab, lobster,    prawn,
 and crayfish.
     Pieces  of this  substance,    taken from various parts       of those
 animals, was at different times immersed             in acetous and in
 diluted nitric acid; those which had been placed in the di
 luted nitric acid produced a moderate effervescence, and in
 a short time were found to be soft and elastic,          of a yellowilli-
 white colour, and like a cartilage, which retained the original
 figure.
      The  same effects were produced by acetous acid, but in a
 less degree ; in the latter cafe, also, a colouring matter re
 mained, and was soluble in alcohol.
      AU the solutions, both acetous and nitric, afforded carbo
  nate and phosphate      of lime, although      the former was      in the
  largest proportion.
      There   is reason to conclude, therefore,         that phosphate of
  lime, mingled with the carbonate, is a         chemical characteristic
  which distinguishes the crustaceous from the testaceous sub
  stances; and that the principal difference in the qualities of
  each, when complete, is caused by the proportion             of the har
  dening substances relative to the gluten by which thev are
   cemented, or by the abundance and consistency of the gela
  tinous,   membranaceous, or cartilaginous substance, in and
   on  which   the carbonate of lime, or the mixture of carbonate
   And   phosphate   of lime,     has   been    secreted   and   deposited.

.MareQver,        as the presence of phosphate of lime, mingled with
carbonate, appears to be a chemical character of crustaceous
marine animals, there is every reason to conclude that Lin
næus did right not to place the echini                among the testaceous
ones.
    The    presence     of  phosphate    of lime in     the substance   which
covers the crutlaceous marine              animals appears to denote an
approximation          to  the nature  of   bone, which, not only by the
experiments of Mr. Gahn, but by the united testimony of all
chemists, has been proved principally to consist (as far as the
oflifying substance is concerned) of phosphate of lime.
    This consideration, therefore, induced me to repeat the
 above experiments on the bones of various animals.
     It is   scarcely necessary for me to mention            the usual effects
 of  acids on bones steeped in them, as they are known to every
 physiologist and anatomist.
     In every operation of this nature              the   ossifying  substance,
 which       is principally phosphate of lime, is dissolved, and a
 cartilage or membrane of the figure of the original bone re
 mains     ;   so  that the first origin of bones appears to be bv the
 formation of a membrane or cartilage of the requisite sioure,
 which, when the subsequent secretion of the otfifyino- sub
 stance takes place, is penetrated by, and thus becomes more
 pr   less converted into the state of bone.
      It is also known that the nature           of  the bone is more influ
 enced by the greater or less predominance of the membrana-
  ceous or cartilaginous part than by any other cause.                      It is
  not, therefore,        for me to add any thing to this part: and in
 jespect to the substance which is the Cause of ossification, little
  also requires to be mentioned ; for this (as has been already
  observed)        is known     principally     to consist    of  phosphate    of
  Jime.       I  shall  only, therefore,      briefly mention the result ot

VII. Hijloty of Astronomy for the Year                             1799.      By   Jerome
  Lalande. Read at the Lyceum on                                   the 26th   of December.
T»HIS year will                     be memorable            on account of the total
completion of that immense operation respecting the size of
the earth, which lasted seven years. Those able astronomers,
Delambre and Mechain, who finished                              it,   arrived in the month
of November             1798,       and   by   the month         of January were          able
to give us the value of the degrees                      and    between Dunkirk
Barcelona.  But, as these degrees did not follow an uniform
progress,   was soon found, that, to deduce from them the
               it
value     of   the metre, or the new French measure,                          a    discussion
was necessary, on the oblate form of the earth, to be adopted.
Had they adhered to the arc measured between Dunkirk and
Barcelona,   they would have had                          -,-4<,  or nineteen leagues,
for the flatness at the poles but,            ;            by   comparing    with the
                                                                               it
degree     measured         under the Equator,                  they found only nine
leagues and         a   half.
   On the 8th of April, after   long discussion, they adopted
                                                  a
the latter quantity, and the new metre was determined (• be
36 inches 11*296 lines, and the flatness of the earth T-fr.
     Onthe 5th of May C. Van Swinden,      celebrated                 a                Dutch
philosopher, made    definitive report on the grand
                                a                                                      labour
of the meridian             and      the metre, which was afterwards read
in   public sitting of the Institute.
     a
     On the 22d of June the Institute presented to the tw«
councils the original standards of the metre and kilogramme
of platina, which were placed in the magnificent depot of the
national archives in the national palace,                             formerly the Thuil-
leries.
     On the    17 th     of November the              consuls          proposed    a   law to
declare    that the metre and the kilogramme arc the definitive
standards    of France, and to cause     medal to be struck in
                                                      a
conimemoration             of this grand undertaking.                      On one      side   is
to be represented the Republic holding the metre and the                                kilo
gramme, with this inscription,
                                                  " To

lionth part of a     quarter of the meridian." The diameter of
the medal will be two inches,              and   will  be executed by    C.
Joussroy.      It was proposed in a report presented to the In
 stitute on the 20th of October, by C.David, Moitte, Leblond
Monger, Laplace, Delambre, Leveque and Gosselin, and was
 adopted by a law       of December to.
     By reducing these measures to the temperature of ten de
 grees, which is the mean degree of the heat at Paris, and
 that in the caverns below the observatory, I find the 45th
 degree to be 57012 toises, instead of 57031 which I had
 adopted in my astronomy.            This is 19 toises less; the mean
 radius    of the   earth  3268159 toises, less by 1323 toises than
 my table, which hitherto has served as a rule in books of
 natural philosophy.         This, without doubt, is very little in
  regard to the extent of the earth : we are therefore pretty
  well acquainted with its size, but we are not sufficiently ac
  quainted with its irregularities; and this, at any rate, is one
  important result from this new labour.
      This year has furnished three new comets.                 On   the 6th
  of December 1798, C. Bouvafd discovered, at the observa.
  tory, a small one in the constellation of Hercules ; it was
  seen only during six days, and disappeared on the nth of
  December in Aquarius, but C. Burckhardt calculated its
   orbit with all the precision possible*.
      C. Mechain, to whom we are already                 indebted for the
   discovery  of so many comets, found one on the morning of
   the 7th  of August, which is the 90th according to the general
   catalogue in the third edition of my Astronomy.               It was very
   small and without any tail, but exceedingly clear; it was
   above the Lynx, in the constellation which Hell formed in
   1790, under the name of the Grand Telescope of Herschel.
   At three o'clock in the morning it had 1070 47' of right
   iscension,   and 430 54' of north declination.             It was among
   the stars which C. Lefrancais observed on the 9th of March
   1794, so that very exact positions were immediately obtained.

    $Z           Histery of Astronomy       for  the Year 1799.
       C Mechain and C. Burckhardt each calculated the orbit
   wiih that ardour and readiness which are natural to these able
    astronomers : C. Messier followed its progress, according to
   his usual custom, with indefatigable afliduity, for more than
   two months, till the 25th of October, when it disappeared
   on the eastern knee of Ophiuchus. During this long appear
   ance our collection         of 50,000 stars has often furnished im
   portant points       for  the   reduction of these observations.        On
   the last day it was near a sler of the sixth magnitude, the
   position of which I have given in the ConnoiJJance des Terns
   for the year jo. All the observations of C. Mechain and
   Messier will be published in detail : some of them have a
   wonderful degree of perfection, because they were made by
   means of an excellent meridian telescope,            at the   Maifon du
   Champ de Mars            (Military School)      by C. Lefrancais       and
   Burckhardt.
      This  day also, December 26, 1799, at           half after five in the
   morning,    C.  Mechain      discovered   a new  comet   in Ophiuchus,
  which will be the 91st.           It had about 469° of right ascension
  and 50 of northern declination.           It appeared to the naked eye
  as a star ol 5th and 6th magnitude in the telescope.               Its nu
  cleus was exceedingly luminous, and almost bounded : it
 had a very narrow tail, of a pretty intense light, and about
  70 in length.       It advanced towards the south so rapidly that
  it was apprehended it could not long be observed, unless it
  should appear      in  the west after having traversed a part        of the
 southern hemisphere.
      As  the most defective part       of astronomy   at present is what
 relates to comets,        I  must recommend them to all our corre
 spondents.      The Bureau des Longitudes has sent a night               te
 lescope to C. Flaugergues at Viviers, who has promised                    to
 make     use of it.
     C. Mougin, in        the department     of Doubs,  has promised the
fume     thing; but, being        a priest,  he was obliged to quit       La
 Grand 'Combc-des-Bois,             where he was curd, and where, since
 1766, he had made many observations and calculations, and
had been banistied to a hollow valley where he could no
longer have a proper view of the heavens.               The government
has thought proper to suffer him to reitimo his labours, and
                                                                           to

to return to his ancient habitation, which is more convenient
for searching out comets.
   To render this search more successful, I have proposed to
mount a Newtonian telescope in such a manner as to be
moveable   around the eye-glass,     by means of a handle,
without changing the place of the eye.      M. Von Zach has
caused this machine to be engraved, and I hope that, at a
more favourable period, it will be executed, and be the means
of discovering new          comets.      If,   in   the course   of forty-three
years, the fame number has been discovered                    by    searching   for
them with plain telescopes without any support, how many
ought we not to find            by
                           the method     propose, which will
                                                    I
not suffer the least portion of the heavens to escape observa
tion   ?
   C. Pictet, the celebrated professor of natural philosophy at
Geneva, and director of the observatory, has sent us the draw
ing of an English telescope, which, with hinge and small arch
                                                        a
of copper, becomes parallactic, and proper for following the
stars, and for making the greater part of astronomical observ
ations.     I   hope opticians, who make stands for telescopes,
will               of this hint,
        take advantage                         since mere amateurs, with an
achromatic telescope, will thus                be enabled,    without farther
expence,       to find out and        to follow stars in the open day,
and to search for comets,             of which         we at present    stand   in
need.
  The       great work on the stars, which   began in 1789, has
                                                     I
been       carried  byC. Lefrancais  to nearly 50,000, notwith
standing the unfavourableness of the seasons, which has ren
dered this year one of the most disagreeable and unfruitful
seen at Paris.  These stars have been already printed in my
thjloire     Cclejle,    the first volume       of which, my   as   well   as
Bibliograpbie Astronomique,   will appear as soon as the state
of the finances will admit of funds being applied to the
printing-house of the Republic. C. Burckhardt has continued
to make, with           C. Lefrancais,   a         number of important
                                               great
observations       on the planets        and stars; for, as there are two
excellent instruments at the     Maison du Champ de Mars,
these are sufficient to employ those two able astronomers.

Terns of the year 10, which has just appeared, and that of
the year 11, now printing, catalogues of 3000 stars reduced
and calculated : (he has therefore given us in the whole
 10,000. But C. Burckhardt has made table* of a new form,
which will      enable   him     to calculate     with   ease   the whole
of the 50,000     stars which have been observed.
   The obliquity of the ecliptic being one of the fundamental
objects of astronomy, we have continued to observe it at the
two solstices of this year. We found it in the month of June
5 "more than what is given in mv table; but C. Mechain,
in the month of December, found it 8" less than in my table.
This difference arises probablv from the refraction in winter,
which is not yet sufficiently known. This question we hope
to resolve in the present year by comparing better the two
solstices.
   The    observatory   was in want      of good instruments, but we
have at length been able         to obtain some.         The   large mural
quadrant of C. Lemonnier, which General Bonaparte pro -
cured for us, has been erected, as well as that of five feet,
which C. Lemonnier           lent me in 1751 to observe the moon
with at Berlin,     and an excellent      meridian telescope executed
by    C. Lenoir, with      an object-glass       bv   C. Carochc.        The
latter   made   also the large      speculum     of  the twenty-two feet
telescope which was at         La Muttte.      and which was equal to
that of Herfchel of the fame length.             The telescope of pla-
tina, which they wished to take from us, has been secured
to the observatory     by a decision     of  the minister     of   the inte
rior.    Thus nothing      is wanting to the molt beautiful observ
atory   in  the world,    to render    it  at the fame      time the most
useful.
    We     hope  at the Peace      to have     a  telescope   of  forty- feet,
with   specula of platina.        On the 7th of August, 7th year,
a decree was made bv the- Institute that the platina we have
should be reserved for the large telescope until we obtain
from Spain a greater quantity. We have already 200 pounds,
but we must procure at least 2000 for the speculum, which
 the intimate connection between France and Spain gives us
 reason to hope    will  be the case.
    Mr. Brown,      an ingenious optician        of London,       has made
                                                                 telescopes,

tories of C. Darquier at Toulouse, Duc-la-Chapelle at Mon-

many useful observations.
   The grand        important work of C. Laplace, entitled
                   and
La  Mecaniquc Celejie, expected with so much impatience,
appeared on the 6th of September.    In that work will be
found the methods and noble analysis which led the author
to the important discoveries which I have several times an
nounced and extolled in this history.
   C. Burckhardt         translated   it into German with explanatory
notes, at the fame time that he read the proofs         of the French
edition, and went over all the calculations. No author ever
had, or was more worthy of having, a translator of so great
merit.   The Bureau des Longitudes, who had long known
the   zeal and     ability      of C. Burckhardt,       have unanimously
elected   him to a place vacant three years, though it had
been solicitedfor by several men of letters, of approved ta
lents, and natives of France.   But C. Burckhardt has got
himself adopted by France ; he has preferred it to his own
country, which he will no less honour by labouring with us.
In the last century, Caflini, Huyghens, Romer, and Maraldi,
came in like manner to reinforce astronomy in France ; but
at that periodit had more need of such assistance. There
were then only two or three French astronomers; at present
we have seven or eight,

    The Institute decreed, on the ad of December, that the
Minister for Foreign Affairs should be requested to borrow
at Leyden the manuscript of Ibn Iunis, in order that the
Arabic text might be printed ; and we have reason to believe
that this request will be granted.
     C. Bouvard has calculated the Greek and Arabic eclipses,
and found that 3' 13" must be added to the anomaly, 8' 30"
to the secular movement of the anomaly of the moon, and a
minute to the supplement of the node for 1790, and that its
secular movement must be diminished a' 48".
     C. Laplace has determined by theory two equations of the
moon.       Two long memoirs,       transmitted    to the Institute     in
consequence of the prize we         proposed, contain many observ
ations and calculations on the fame subject.           This part of our
 tables, therefore, so interesting to navigation, has acquired
 this year a new degree of perfection.
     On the 8th of May we observed, for the 17th time, the
 transit of Mercury over the Sun's disk.              It is the first ever
 completely observed at the descending node, and there will
 not be another of the same kind till the expiration of thirty-
 two years.      It was impatiently expected       by all the astrono
 mers.     It  was observed throughout       all Europe ; and C. De-
 lambre has drawn up a work, with new formulae, in order to
 deduce from the transits of Mercury all the consequences
  thence resulting.
      C. Vidal, our real Hermophilus, has made at Mirepoix a
  new series of observations of Mercury in all parts of his
  orbit ; so that we want nothing more in regard to .this pla
  net,  so difficult to be seen  in our climates. This astonishing
  observer has sent us observations      also of more than a thousand
  austral stars, which     can scarcely be    seen at  Paris on account
  of their  small elevation.
      The Ephemerides of Milan for 1799 nave furnished us
  with a new series of observations of Mercury by C. Cesaris.
   In these I have the pleasure of finding that the errors of my
   tables are almost insensible.      I have had the same satisfac
   tion in regard to the digression of Mercury in his aphelion

     The inferior conjunction of Venus, on the 16th of Octo
ber 1799,      was a phenomenon also of importance for the
theory of this planet.        It takes place only every eight years
in that part of her orbit. It was observed with as much
assiduity as success by C. Lefrancais and Burckhardt, in my
observatory at the Maison du Champ de Mars.                 I have com
 pared it with that of 1751, which was in the fame position,
 and for which I had made a great number of calculations,
 and I have found scarcely any thing to be changed in the
 elements which served for the construction of my tables of
 Venus, published in the third edition of my Astronomy in
 1793. This labour will be inserted in the Memoirs of the
 Institute,
      On  the 23d   of November this beautiful planet was eclipsed
 by the moon. This phenomenon would have attracted a
 number of eyes, had it not been at four o'clock in the morn
 ing.     Jupiter, which is not so brilliant, drew together &
  great crowd at the Palais Royal, on the 14th of March 1788,
  to fee him on the point of being eclipsed.
      Observations of Jupiter have proved that about 30 "are to
  be added to the tables, which (hews that we ought to make
  a little addition to the mean motion       :  this  I before proved   in
  discussing    the  ancient observations    in  the Almagest of Pto
  lemy.      The opposition of the 16th December 1799 gave
  me 30 seconds.        C. Quenot, an able navigator, who has re
   turned from Egypt, observed it with an astronomical circle,
   and obtained the same result.         The latitude    also was found
   too small by 15" ; from which 1 conclude, that the longitude
   of the node of Jupiter, which is in the tables of C. Delam-
   bre, in the third edition of my Astronomy, ought to be dimi
   nished   10'.
       The  tables   of Mars     are those most deficient.     C. Lefran
    cais, therefore,  has been employed on them for some months.
    He  has calculated   all the oppositions   and quadratures    hitherto
    observed with accuracy, and the result       will  be tables more ac
    curate than any ever yet given, in which there          will be only a
    few seconds of uncertainty.       C. Burckhardt     has calculated  the

     The Academy of Stockholm            has  sent   M.   Swanberg to
 Lapland to find out the stations which served in 1736 for
 measuring a degree under the polar circle.               He employed
 himself only in discovering their local situation; but he says
 he found two minutes error in the reduction of the stations
 to the horizon,     which might have arisen from some defect
in    the instruments, or from terrestrial refraction.             I have
 been    informed in a letter from Sweden, that Maupertuis
 proposed to recommence the measurement at his own ex-
pence.      This   proves  that he was not entirely satisfied with
the result, which differs considerably from many other de
grees that have been measured.            The local inequalities of
the ground,      however,    may have been the cause of this di
versity.

an idea which,         in my opinion,      surpasses   all those ever enter
tained by the greatest astronomers.              I  gave some account    of it
in   the Journal des Savans for 1797 *,              of which     only twelve

    The Nautical Almanack for 1803 has been transmitted to
us by the care of Sir Joseph Banks, President of the Royal
Society, to whom we owe this public testimony, that since
the commencement             of the war he has maintained the inter
course    of  the sciences.      His name, his credit,       and his fortune,
enabled       him   to overcome      all obstacles,    and to remove every
political impediment ; for we have asked nothing from him
which he has not taken the earliest opportunity of granting.

great number of stars with which I furnished him, gave me
a right to new constellations.        To fill up the vacant spaces
he had put thirty-three animals in the heavens ; and I have
added a thirty-fourth, viz. the Cat, on account of that charm
ing poem, of which Deslierbiers has published some frag
ments.     This new constellation of     the Cat is between   Hydra
and the Ship.      It  has been already engraved in Germany, and

  VIII.    Description       of  a Jingular     Phenomenon       in a Thunder-
                  Cloud.       By L. C. LlCHTENBERG *.
  Or"N       a  summer's day, exceedingly hot and sultry, the ba
  rometer being at 27 inches seven lines, and Reaumur's ther
  mometer at 22        J,  there was formed, about three in the after
  noon, to the north of Gotha, a dark thunder-cloud, having
  the appearance of rocks piled upon each other, and in sliape
 almost like a mushroom. (Plate 1. Fig. 1.) The magnificent
 spectacle exhibited by this immense mass floating in the blue
 expanse of the atmosphere excited my attention ; and                      I soon
 observed, that, from the small part            which   represented the stem
 of    the mushroom, there arose a fine bright vapour, which                   in
 a   few moments formed a perfect ring around this part of the
 cloud.      The ring seemed to be in violent agitation, by which
 it   became always more enlarged, so that in the course of a
 minute it exceeded the greatest breadth of the upper part of
 the cloud.       It then    began to extend itself upwards and down
wards, and in         less  than thirty, seconds the whole cloud was
enveloped       in a transparent covering, (Fig. 2.) This pheno
menon        had    scarcely continued a minute when the cloud
began to extend itself, as if by a current of air forced from
its interior, and to assume the form of a fan.                      It now lost
its smooth rim, which               terminated, as it were,          in fringes,

and the whole acquired the form os a thunder-cloud.                    Some
minutes after, black rainv clouds, formed of the vapour driven
downwards, and of the remains of the covering, were col
lected below ; and        I expected every moment to fee the first
flash  of lightning, which soon followed. A little rain fell at
some distance, but within a quarter of an hour the cloud was
so distended that it was soon lost in a thin mist.                 The fame
phenomenon, though not so striking, I have since seen in a
great many other thunder-clouds, but inverted. Instead or
a sine vapour being thrown            out, and forming a covering,          I
saw    white    clouds sink down,          spread themselves out like
a veil over the arched         part of the cloud, and disperse them
selves  in it.    The    reason    why the vapour thrown out from
the cloud here described formed           a  ring, was its singular form.
The vapour, by being forced out on all sides, was so com
pressed that it could extend itself only edgeways,                and after
wards diffuse itself round the cloud.
    If this phenomenon be compared with the electric experi
ment where a ball of cotton, suspended hv a silk thread, is in
troduced into a metal         vessel of a cylindric form and sufficient
width, and where         the   vessel  is sometimes       rendered electric
and sometimes deprived of its electricity, the idea I mean to
convey by this description will be readily conceived. I am
of opinion that I can thereby          prove    that we might examine
the electric    state of  tlrc upper regions      of the   atmosphere,   and
even   of the clouds,     with accuracy, if       the latter were observed
more frequently than has hitherto been done, and were thev
employed as natural electrometers for this purpose.

 eerning them have been increased by the writers of zoology
 having confounded one species with the other.                      Another
 source of error probably exists in some real dissimilarity be
 tween the elk or moose os Europe, aud the elk and moose of
 North America.
     The description of the moose-deer by Mr. Dudley, (Phi-
 losoph. Trans. No. 368, p. 165.) I have every reason to be
 lieve, is correct as far as it goes; but it applies strictly to the
 moose, and not to the elk, which is a different animal.
     M. De      Buffon (Histoire Naturelle, L'Elan et Le Renne,)
 appears,    in  several places, to have mingled the descriptions
 of both animals, and certainly -considered elk and moose ss
 two names for the fame creature.             And this is the more re
 markable, as the several quotations which he has made from
 different authors contain manifest contradictions; as will be
 evident   to any person      who has     seen   either the moose or the
 elk *.    The    reader  of M. De Buffon, therefore, will not be
 surprised   if he  obtain no clear notion of the Elan ; as it is not
probable      that the illustrious      author himself had        a  distinct
 conception of the subject of his description.
     In Mr. Smellie's translation of Buffon, Vol.          VI. p.  ^^t>,  &c.
 there are several additions to the original article.             The ani
 mal and head of an animal, mentioned by Mr. Allomond,
were probably of the moose kind.
    Dr. Goldsmith        (Mist, of the Earth and Anim. Nature,
art. Elk,) acknowledges the discordancy of the various his
tories of the elk, which he also supposes to be the fame with
the moose      ; and he labours, very ineffectually, to reconcile
 the descriptions of authors.           The figure given by him re
sembles neither the elk nor the moose; and the reader will
conclude the Doctor's         account with as little satisfaction as
he appears himself to have clone, when he says, " After all,
this animal is but indilsereully and confusedly described by
authors,"      &c.

44                    Observations    on the   Eli.
     The confusion   and contradictions     of preceding writers    have
been     supposed to be avoided      or removed      by the celebrated
Mr. Pennant in his Arctic Zoology            ;  a work to which those
who are better able to judge on such subjects than I am,
ascribe transcendant      merit.     In this work (Vol. I. p. 19.
art. Moose,) the author pronounces " the elk and the moose
 (to be) the same species ; the last derived from Musu, which,
 in the Algonkin language, signifies that animal." And this
 opinion seems to have been quietly acquiesced in ; and the
 substance of Mr. Pennant's account has been copied into the
 Encyclopædia Britannica, and perhaps into other works of
 equal credit and circulation.
     An opportunity having       been presented to me,      of satisfying
 myself that Mr. Pennant         has erred     in describing the moose
 and elk as a single animal,      I  think it my duty to correct this
 mistake of that learned and amiable naturalist ; and I am too
 well convinced of his love of truth and ardour for the ad
 vancement of natural knowledge, to doubt of his receiving
 my correction with candour and delight.              It may be proper
 for me to premise, that, from the best information that I can
  obtain, (and I have had occasion to converse with several per
  sons who professed to be well acquainted           with both the elk
  and the moose,) the history which has been given of the
  moose by that gentleman is essentially just in every other
  respect than what relates to its identity with the elk.
      IN   August and September 1797 I visited repeatedly, in
  company with Dr. Mitchill, Dr. Miller, Mr. Dunlap, and
  other gentlemen of my acquaintance, four elks, then exhi
  bited in this city for gain.      Two of them were males, which
  the keeper assured us were but two years and a few days old ;
  one    a female,  somewhat     more than three years of age ; the
  fourth    a male fawn,  a year old. They were taken separately,
  a few days after their birth,     and had been reared by men for
  the purpose above mentioned.          They     were  very docile,   and
  might be handled and examined with perfect safety.
       Colour. — In this they all exactly resemble each other.          In
   the spring the colour   of the    hair is reddisti ; it then changes
   to  a greyish duo (which was its appearance           when observed

                         Observations      on the  Elk.                     45

the winter.         The rump         is of a pale yellowish white, the co
lour extending about six or seven inches from the tail, on all
fides, and very distinct from the general colour of the body.
A    black semicircular           line,   of unequal width, (from        a to |
inches,) separates the white of the rump, on either side, from
the dun or grey of the body. The forepart or shin of the
legs,     and the nose, are black.            The under-lip is fleshy, and
marked,        in  all  four,    in    an  uniform    and peculiar manner.
Near      the cheek, on each fide, it is black ; and a black stripe
 divides it equally underneath : the rest is white. — The male
 has a short mane, about two inches longer than the rest of
 the hair on the body.               At this time the hair was very short;
 but in winter it is said to be four inches in length, and the
 mane six, and of the colour of the body. The male also has
 a beard, or covering           of hair, under his throat and upon his
 breast, which, though short in summer, grows out, in the
 course of the autumn, six or more inches beyond the hair of

 beard is wanting in the female. The male sheds it every
  spring.
     Head.     —The      head      (as will   be seen     Plate II.)  resembles
 that of     the common deer, and            of  the horse, much more than
 that of the moose, and is pointed and handsome.                       The  neck
  is rather long and handsome.
     The elk has        an    oblique flit or opening under the inner
  angle     of  each    eye, externally, of near an inch in length ;
  which      is said to communicate            with   the nostril  *.   But this
  we could not correctly ascertain by examination, though
  there seems no reason to doubt the fact.                   Something of the
  same kind obtains           in    the fallow-deer,     supposed to be analo
   gous    to the punEla lachrymalia             in the human head.         (See
   Mr. White's Nat. Hist, of Selborn                :  fee also Encyclopædia,
   art. Cervus.)        A  like opening is noticed by Sparman, and
     * Mr. Campbell, of Richmond, Virginia, informed me, that in the
   skeleton heml of an elk, which he had seen, the opening under the eye,
   communicating with the nostril, was so large that the thumb might br.
   easily intioduced   into it.

  The use of this opening is differently explained by the pro-
prietor of the animals here described.     He assures us that the
elk possesses the power, by strictly closing his nostrils, of for
cing the air through these apertures in such a manner as lo
make        a noise    which        may be heard at          a great distance ;       that
be has seen the wild animals do this frequency ; and that the
design       of it    is to alarm each             other when they suspect any
danger near.            He has taught those in his possession to make
a  similar noise       ; but it was too feeble to came any observable
dilatation of the slit.
      If the   above explanation            of the    keeper   of   these   dks be just,
it will     probably lead us to a more accurate notion                        of a cir
cumstance        related      concerning the Rupri Capra, or Chamois
of    the    Alps, of        whom it is said, that " when he smells or
hears any thing           which      he cannot sec,          he wbijlles,     or   blozvSy
with such force that the forests and rocks re-echo with the
found." — See Encyclopædia, art. Capra.
   Horns. — The female has no horns.      The appearance of
the horns of the fawn exactly resembles those on the head
ef the principal figure (opposite p. 18.) given by Mr. Pen
nant. — rThe males             (a; the keeper informed us) drop their
horns annually,              in May, then leaving a pith about four
inches in length, which                is soon covered              and protected      by
velvet.        In eight      weeks the homs began to grow again.                       In
the    animals       we      saw,   thev     had      been   growing        about eight
weeks.         On our        first visit, the horns were        uniformly covered
with    a smooth       velvet.       About      ten davs after, the velvet was
coining ossin narrow strips, leaving the horns bare.      By the
middle of September they    were   entirely free from  it. The
keeper informed us, that  the  animals  freed  their horns from
it, when wild,     rubbingby  them  againll trees.    Now they
derived      the fame aid from the posts, £cc.                 of their stable; and
the proprietor occasionally                assisted   them.     It    was observable
that   a    small oozing       of bloody lymph           sometimes succeeded the
removal of      a    strip   of the covering.
                                                                                     The

   The horns of the elk, instead of being palmatcd, as are
those   of the moose, consist of three principal divisions: —
T. The brow antlers, which the hunters call the altars;
2. The two middle prongs, called the figh ling-horns; and
3. The boms, properly so called.            The two first retain their
simplicity, the last increases in complexity every year. They
do not, as those of the moose are said to do, acquire a new
branch every year ; though something analogous actually
occurs.     When the animal enters his third year, a single
prong    or point comes out on the inside of the left horn ; the
next year, a similar point on the inside of the right horn ;
and so alternately.        Four short points, called pikes, were
now apparent, one on each brow-antler, and one on each
sighting-horn.       They    seldom exceed an inch in length.
    The following measurements were             made  of the horns of
one    of the male elks. They were             somewhat   longer than
those of the other, notwithstanding            an inch or two had ac
cidentally broken off from the end of          one of them.

    I recollect to have seen, in the Museum of Yale College,
 New-Haven, Connecticut, some years ago, a remarkable pair
of horns, supposed to have belonged to a moose or elk. They
 were not palmatcd ; and though I had not at that time de-
Voted any attention to subjects of natoraf history, yet, front
 the general idea which I retain of their figure and composi
tion, I am persuaded that they must, at some period, have
ornamented the head of an elk.             If I am right in this par
ticular, it will afford us some notion of the size to which the
 horns of this animal attain.            The horns in the Museum of
 Yale College, if 1 do not misremember, were said to weigh
 55 or 56 pounds.

    Place and Food. — The elks which were exhibited                     here
were brought from Upper Canada.                      They are said to be
found in almost all the back country of the United States,
as low down as Virginia.            In respect, to food, as these had
been domesticated from infancy, nothing particular could be
learnt from them concerning what they most affected in the
wild state. What appeared remarkable to us was, that they
all ate tobacco, as variously prepared by the tobacconist,
with    greediness.     This, the proprietor assured us, was a na
tural appetite ; and that the wild elks ate the wild plant. We
thought that this required further evidence; notwithstanding,
we are informed by Hasselquist, that the Cervi Capra of Bar-
bary
       " loves the smoke of tobacco, and, when caught alive,
will approach the       pipe  of the huntsman, though otherwise
more timid than any animal."                 Encyclopædia, art. Capra.
    Young.   — The    rutting-lime     is  from   about the aoth of Sep
tember to the 1 st of October.            The female goes about nine
months ; generally brings forth twins ; and it seldom hap
pens but that one is male and the other female.
    Gait, &C. —The hoofs of            the elk are very much cloven,
and, like the moose and rein-deer, he makes a great clatter
ing with them in travelling.              He is very fleet. A stranger,
who was viewing these elks at the fame time with us, told
                                                                         us,

 us, that he had     seen elks used       in sleighs the last winter;   and
that they were easily managed,             very strong, and very service
able.    He   represented them as travelling at the           rate of j8 or
 20 miles an hour.         It is possible      that it was the rein-deer
that he saw    used   in this manner in Canada.
    FUjb and Skin. — The          flessi is said to be  excellent, and the
skin employed for various useful purposes.
    Oil-Spring. — On       the outside     of  each   hind leg the elk has
a small vesicle or bag, which            contains a thin unctuous sub
stance that the hunters call oil, and              the bag the oil-spring.
The male is said to open this, by means of his horn, as the
horns begin to grow; when the oil spreads over the young
horn, and is supposed to nourish and protect it. This he
does regularly,      the    keeper     informed us, at 10 P.     M.  and at
4 A. M. The         female     has not been observed to make any
use of this oil,   except     when      wounded.      She then, it is laid,
opens the bag with her tooth, and applies the oil, by means
of her tongue, to the wound.
    In rutting-time the elk is represi nted as contriving to
throw his urine upon this vesicle ; which inflames in conse
quence, and emits a strong scent, whereby the animals dis
cover each other in the woods. With regard to the super
stitious notion concerning             the elk's curing himself of the
epilepsy   by means       of  It is   hind hoof, Sec. (See Pennant's
Arctic Zoology,       art. Moose,) may it not be probable that
the belief originated from the use he makes of the oil-spring,
os which the earliest European writers might be ignorant?

I AM      informed by our dairy-people, that the cow-pock is

\o              Vacant Inoculation among Country -People.
Perhaps you would like to know how we carry on the vac»
cine inoculation : almost every cobler, shepherd, and cow-,
boy,       are consummate and              experienced     adepts    in this new
specific art.
    I will, with your leave, intersperse this with a remark to
substantiate what I mean to advance. — At Steeple Claydon,
a village five miles from Window, great numbers have been
inoculated for the vaccine disease by the most illiterate of
all beings in human shape — the cow-boys and shepherd's
hov?, without any prior or subsequent medicine whatever.
At Westbury, Shenley, Fattenhoe,                     and a number        of villages
round our neighbourhood,                    the   fame.      At Finmere,         Mr.
Holt,       the clergyman, (a neighbour of ours,) does administer
some little medicine, such as salts, &c. — People are inoculated,
and inoculate themselves, indiscriminately                   ;   such as farmers,
dairy-people,           &c. with impunity,           without any preparation,
subsequent          purification,       or making application to any me
dical person           whatever.        Yesterday I saw a man inoculate a
family with           a  cobler's awl dipped in another's arm              :  others
do      it with     a    penknife ground like a lancet point               :  others
with needles infected with the vaccine matter. I am a great
advocate for the vaccine inoculation : I acknowledge it to
be a great acquisition and discovery,                    and consequently         ul
timately a great blesling to the community at large, and do
pot doubt of its success.
    The       well-attested       facts that you and others assert, prove it
 indubitably        ;   but greatly do I lament that some delusion, or
 some secret mysterious              means have not been put in force to
 prevent its being in other hands than medical men. The
small-pox inoculation is now rapidly declining, and probably
 in   a   few years may he known               no more.        I am   sorry to say,

XI. Extrail of a Memoir             on Elasticity.     By C. BARRUELf.
   JL HE      author    of this memoir         endeavours     to explain the
cause    of the elasticity of bodies by the help of caloric. After
laying it down as a principle, that this fluid is eminently
elastic ; that it is interposed        between the integrant moleculte
of   bodies,   which     is proved by their porosity ; he hopes, from
these two principles, to deduce consequences leading to this
result.      But whatever may be assigned as the cause of elasti
city, caloric, at any rate, has a great sliare in the phenomena
which it exhibits.
     The different systems adopted by philosophers respecting
the cause of elasticity, are, in the author's opinion, either
vague or evidently erroneous.                 It cannot, he thinks, be
ascribed to a repulsive         force, with which        the   moleculæ are
endowed, and which              increases   as   they   approach ;     for the
    * It
         appears, by the vaccine inoculntion      in the country,  that medical
assistance  was scarcely necessary

    existence      of this     force       is merely hypothetical.                 Nor        can   if
    be laid that the elasticity is owing to air interposed between
    the moleculæ, since the phenomena of elasticity manifest
    themselves in vacuo.
       C. Barruel is of opinion, that if we should ascribe the
    cause of elasticity to caloric, this question would remain to be
    answered,          Why    is caloric so eminently elastic                 ?    We know,
    indeed,          that the affinity, of moleculæ of water to
                 savs he,
    those of sponge, into the pores of which they introduce
    themselves, produces an increase of the volume of that.,
    sponsrC ;     but the cause os the         reciprocal attraction of these
    different moleculæ              remains unknown.    Besides, we could not
    refuse to admit that the elasticity            of caloric would arise from
    the property which the                 moleculæ of this fluid might have of
    repelling;    each other: property the more probable,

    observed in the electric fkiid, with which caloric has                               so great
    sni a'rialogv.       In    a word, we mav be satisfied with admitting
    its elasticity       as   a     fact   from which we            set     out,   as    from an
    incontestiblc principle.
       The author then proceeds immediately to his object, and
    examines in what manner caloric acts upon bodies.     It di
    lates them by means of a reciprocal affinity between it and
    their moleculæ. These affinities are variable ; but it is cer
    tain that, in regard to the fame substance, they decrease                                       in,
    proportion as the distances increase, and that their action                                     i>
    at length reduced to zero.
         Now, if       we suppose a given quantity                 of caloric inclosed in
    a receiver incapable os acting on this fluid, it                   will e\efy-where
    diffuse itself in an uniform manner.  If we then introduce a
    molecule of matter, the caloric will be unequally condensed

                 it,                                    exercise3                  it

    be introduced,            the    same effects      will     take place,             and every
    thing will remain in the fame state as long as the molecules
    are at    distance from each other equal to the diameter of
              a
    their atmospheres; nothing   changed but the temperature.

their distance      is less than that diameter, their atmospheres
will     be compressed,      and   the  parts   in contact will assume
more denfity and a higher temperature, and which is not
in equilibrium with that in the rest of the receiver.              These
parts deprive themselves of a portion of their caloric, which
is distributed among the other strata of these atmospheres
until the equilibrium is restored.
       When the moleculæ are made              to approach    each  other
gently, the compression            of the   atmospheres    and  their re-
establishment       take place peaceably;       but is the moleculæ are
 brought into contact abruptly, the caloric is disengaged with
 the greatest violence. It is to this rapid disengagement of
 caloric,    strongly compressed, that we ought to ascribe the
 detonations of the super-oxygenated             muriat of pot-ash and
 of gun-powder.
       The moleculæ       assumed, for example,      retain a portion of
 the compressed caloric as long as they obey the force which
  makes them approach each other.                 When they arrive at
  that distance at which they exercise an action on each other,
  their attractive force is greater or less than that with which
  their atmospheres tend to recover their former state.              If the
  moleculæ, then, be lest to themselves, in the first case the
  system retains its present state; in the other case it will re
  sume its primitive       state ;  and   it is in this that the greater
  part of the phenomena of elasticity seem to confist.                This
   reafoning may be applied to every body, the moleculæ of
   which are separated from each other by            a certain quantity   of
   caloric.
     '
        C. Barruel    pays attention alfo to the circumstances under
   which the elasticity of a body may be manisested, and to the
   means proper for increafing or producing this property.
   These circumstances are, compression, a sudden shock, and
   flexion.     In either of these circumstances it happens that
    the adherence of the moleculæ either is or is not overcome.
    In the first case the moleculæ are put out of their sphere of
    activity, and the body is faid to be brittle.            In the second
    case the body is flexible, but        the  caloric interposed between
    its moleculæ withdraws,           or does not withdraw itself, from
    compression.        If it withdraws itself, there is only one dis-

  placement      of the particles of the body, which is tnen fail          19
  be ductile.      If  it cannot withdraw     itself, it yields or   resists.
  When it yields, the body is soft; when it resists compres
  sion, it experiences the effects of it as long as the moleculæ
  are compressed ; it then tends to recover its former state          j and
  this is what renders bodies elastic.
      There is no body perfectly soft, ductile, or elastic. Nature
  presents none which under compression does not suffer a
  portion of caloric to escape.        Thus a body is never perfectly
  elastic,  because the quantity     of caloric compressed, being less
  than the total quantity, cannot restore itself with the same
  force as if this fluid had remained in its entire state, and
  cannot keep the moleculæ of the bodv separated at the same
  distance    as before   compression.     Besides,   the velocity     with
  which it    restores itself is also less than that    which    produced
 the compression, for a part of this velocity has been destroyed
 by the entire mass of the compressed body.
     A   body is more flexible according as it contains more ca
 loric between its moleculæ. This very compressible fluid
 permits concave moleculæ to approach each other without
 the convex moleculæ being; obliged to separate from each
 other, as    if there  were not caloric interposed     between them.
     The preceding observations may serve to throw some light
 on various phenomena of elasticity.           A blade of copper not
 hammered evidently remains in that state into which it is put
 by bending, because the moleculæ of the concave part ex
 press, by approaching each other, that portion of caloric
 which adheres least to them. The other portion, which,
 does not escape, is indeed compressed ; but the excess            of the
 spring is compensated       by the excess   of  the adherence      of the.
 moleculæ brought together: the body remains in that state-
in which it is placed.
     If the  blade has been hammered, it loses by that operation.
a portion     of caloric ; the oilier portion remains compressed ;.
 and, when this blade is bent, the compression of the fluid is"
increased.        The   excess  of spring  which it     acquires   is not
counterbalanced by the excess ot the adherence of the mo
leculæ : it tends to restore itself: and the body passes to that
state which is called elu/.iz,
                                                                      Th«

     The   compression and re-establishment             of caloric may serve to
explain also the oscillations of the               moleculæ of a tube of glass
terminated by a ball of the fame nature, when rubbed with
a moistened sponge in order to obtain from it acute tones.
The moleculæ of                      by the extension which it
                           the tube having,
experiences, quitted the position proper for their equilibrium,
tend to return to it; and as by the velocity acquired they go
beyond the term from which they set out, the interposed ca
loric is compressed, it re-establiflics itself with a force equal
to the compression, and repels the two parts of the tube to
the distance at which they were at first, which occasions arj
oscillatory motion until it has been destroyed by the resist
ance of the air.
   We might, strictly speaking, explain, without the inter
vention of caloric, the elasticity of the string of a violin, or
of a bell, put into vibration : but from what has been said,
it   seems to act the most conspicuous                 part.
     Elasticity manifests           itself with   energy in liquids than,
                                                   less
in    solids,   and   yet the       former contain more caloric.     The
reason is plain ;          it is because their moleculæ, being exceed
ingly moveable, they can easily withdraw themselves from
the compressing forces ; but they are elastic, since thev have
the property of transmitting sounds, and of recoiling back on
themselves.
     It   must have been remarked, that the accumulation                          of   ca
loric diminiflies the spring of solid or fluid bodies: in gaseous
bodies, on the other hand, this elasticity is increased by the
accumulation,          because these        bodies, being held in solution
in   the caloric, participate            in its mechanical properties, and
chiefly its elasticity.
  To increase or produce elasticity in certain bodies, we
must employ pieans proper for bringing together their mo
leculæ, and keeping the caloric in a state of great compres
sion.  The harder, therefore, that a body       provided            is,             it
                                                                                    is
not    in the extreme degree, the more
          so                              will be clastic. it                            It

                             less
be remedied           by
                rendering the body thin, since its moleculæ
will then be less displaced during flexion. There are two
(things, then, to be considered                   in   elasticity   ;     the rapidity   of
                                                                                       the

  Allaying  and tempering favour the increase of elasticity ;
because, these operations, by bringing the moleculæ nearer
to each other, compress the caloric, which tends afterwards
to re-establish itself. All these facts have induced the author
to conclude, that caloric has at least a great share in all the
phenomena exhibited by elasticity.

                  known             by tbe    Name of Putrid *.
A     Remedy, which contains much fixed air, has been lately
started by the Rev. Mr. Cartwright, which merits the highest
attention.        Seventeen years ago, fays this gentleman,                           I went     to
reside at Brampton,               a very    populous village near Chesterfield.
I    had not been there many months before a putrid fever broke
out among us : finding by far the greater number of my new
parishioners much too poor to afford themselves medical assiftr
ance,     I
        undertook, by the help of such books on the subject of
medicine as were in my possession, to prescribe for them.    I
early attended a boy about fourteen years of age, who was
attacked by this fever ; he had not been    many days before
the symptoms were unequivocally putrid. then administered
                                                                  I ill
bark, wine, and such other remedies as my book directed.
My exertions, however, were of no avail his disorder grew          ;
every day more untractable and malignant,                                 so   that   I    was in
hourly expectation of his dissolution.      Being under the ab
solute necessity of taking    journev, before
                                       a          set off  went to    I             I

                  I        for  the last time, and    prepared his        I
parents for the event of his death, which        considered as    I                            in
evitable, and reconciled them                       in    the belt manner           I   was able
to   a   loss which     I  knew they would feel severely.    While                              I
was      in   conversation  on this distressing subject with his mo

                    in  the Cure of Putrid  Diseases.                $
  ther,  I observed in a corner    of  the room a small tub     of wort
  working;     the sight brought to my recollection an experiment
  I  had somewhere met with, of a piece of putrid meat being
  made sweet by being suspended over a tub of wort in the act
  of fermentation.      The  idea instantly flashed   into  my mind>
  that the yest might correct the putrid riature        of this disease,
  and I instantly gave him two large spoonfuls.        I  then told the
  mother,   if she found her son better, to repeat this dose every
  three hours.     I  then set out on my journey : upon my re
  turn, after a few days, I anxiously inquired about the boy,
 and was informed he was recovered.            I could not repress my
 curiosity : though I was greatly fatigued with my journey,
 and night was come on, t went directly to where he lived>
 which was three miles off, in a wild part of the moors ; the
 boy himself opened the door, looked surprisingly well, and
  told me he felt better from the instant he took the yest.
     After I left Brampton, I lived in Leicestershire: my pa
 rishioners being then few and opulent, I dropped my medical
 character entirely, and would not even prescribe for any of
 my own family.          One of my domestics falling ill, accord
 ingly the apothecary was sent for; his. complaint was a vio
 lent fever, which in its progress became putrid : having great
 reliance, and deservedly, on the apothecary's penetration and
judgment, the man was left solely to his management.                His
 disorder, however, kept daily gaining ground, till at length
 the apothecary considered him in very great danger ; at last,
 finding every effort to be of service to him baffled, he told me
 he considered it as a lost cafe, and that, in his opinion, the
 man could not survive four-and -twenty hours. On the apo
 thecary thus giving him up, I determined to try the effects
 of yest. I gave him two large table spoonfuls; in fifteen
 minutes from taking the yest, his pulse,         though still feeble^
began to get composed and full.          He in Hhirty-two minutes
from his taking the yest was able to get up from his bed,
and walk in his room.          At the expiration of the second hour
 I gave him a bason of sago, with a good deal of lemon,
wine, and ginger in it ; he eat it with an appetite : in an
other hour I repeated the yest ; an hour afterwards I gave
the bark as before; at the next hour he had food; next he

however, repeated the medicine, and he was able to go about
his bufiness as usual.
    About     a year aster       this, as I was riding past a detached
farm-house        ; t the outskirts of the village, I observed a far-
nter's daughter standing at the door, apparently in great af
fliction ; on inquiring into the cause of her distress,, she toltl
me her father was dving.                   I dismounted, and went into the
house to see him.             I found him in the last stage of a putrid
tever; his tongue was blaek, his pulse was. scarcely percepti
ble, and he lav stretched out, like              a corpse,  in a  state  of drowsy
insenfibility.         I immediately         procured  fome yest, which        I di
luted with water, and poured it down his throat.                            I then
lest him, with little hopes of recoverv.                      I returned to him
>n  about two hours, and found him senfible, and able to con
verse.     I  then gave him a dose              of bark  ;  he asterwards     took,
at a proper interval, fome resrefhment: I staid with him till
he repeated the yest, and then lest him,. witli directions how
to proceed.          I called upon him thu next morning at nine
o'clock,     and     fiund him apparently well Walking in his gar
den   :  he was      an old man, upwards of seventv.
    I  have    fince administered the vest to above fifty perfon*
labouring under putrid severs, and, what is fingular, conti
nues this benevolent clergvman, " I have lost not one pa
 tient."
    Dr. Thornton,            whose opportunities have been great in
 putrid severs, having the superintendance of a dispensary*
 which includes the poor of nine parifhes, and is fituated in
 the vicinity of St. Giles's, has made frequent trials of yest,
 and speaks highly in its praise.
    One dav, fays the Rev. Mr. Townsend, by accident, as
Dr. Thornton went pall a fhopf in Tottenham-Court Road,
 he heard the screams            of    a  mother who was agonised on see
 ing her child,          as   Ihe thought, expire.           These screams re-
 Hewed the struggles           of  the child, and the nurse who attended
 threatened      lo   tarke away       at this moment        the   child,   that it

some tartar        emetic, which quickly acted as a vomit ; and
after the operation was over he gave rhubarb, which cleared
the intestines; he then ordered the child, every two hours,
yest and       water, with wine and bark, and in three days the
dying    child    was up and well.
    The infection had spread to two others in the fame house ;
in this child, and in another, the putrid fever was attended

putrid sore throat      ;  slie had an emetic, and        afterwards  some
rhubarb, then yest and water every two hours. The first
effects of this newly discovered remedy was that of rendering
the pulse fuller and fifteen beats less in a minute, and her
black     tongue     soon   assumed    a  clean and      red   appearance   :
without bark or wine (he was speedily recovered.
    In Dr. Bcddoes' Considerations there are the following
cures : — Mr. Caldwall, engraver, (as Dr. Thornton reports,)
requested him        to go into    Green-   It reet,  Leicester- Fields, to
attend    Mr. Hadril, who, he said, it was supposed would not
outlive the day.          I found him labouring under a dreadful
putrid sore throat, the tongue was black and thick coated,
and   the     pulse quick      and fluttering; evacuations being first
premised, yest and bark in porter were exhibited every two
 hours: his sister, who nursed him, was soon after attacked
by the same fever, but the throat was not affected.                She was
pot like her brother confined to her bed, but her weakness
 was so great that stie could not walk across the room, nor
even stand up half a minute without support.                  In both these
 rases the relief from the yest was very striking, and thev were
soon cured       : the wife was also infected, who received a simi
lar benefit from the yest.

most minute and thorough investigation.            In order to take a
comprehensive view of this subject, the following division will
be requisite    : —
    ist, The intimate connection which the quantity of blast
bears to the area of the internal cavity of the furnace, and to
the nature of the pit-coal.
   ad, The various modes by which air is procured, and
how these respectively affect the quality of the air.
   3d, The various changes to which air is subjected by a
change of temperature in the atmosphere, with the consequent
effects.
   4th, How far increased or diminished velocity and com
pression alter the results of the furnace.
   5th, The form and diameter of the discharging-pipe.
    ist, Then, in the construction of a blast-furnace             and
blowing-machine,         the quantity   of air  to be used ought    to
depend     upon the   internal dimensions of     the former 5 which,
again, ought to be formed according to the quality of the
pit-coal.       Upon the softness or hardness of the coal, ought
jnore immediately to depend the height of the blast-furnace.
This    necessary precaution has given rife to a vast variety of
furnaces, of different capacities, from 30 to 50 feet in height,
 and from 9 to 16 feet diameter at the boshes.              Furnaces
from 30 to 36 feet are used for the softer qualities of coal,
such as a mixture of free-coal and splint.             Furnaces from
36 to 45 are appropriated to the binning of splint-coal cokes;
 and in Wales, such is the superior strength and quality of the
pit-coal, that the furnaces admit of being reared to the height
 of 50   feet.
    1 hese   various qualities of coal, it has been formerly shewn,
 have appropriate weights of iron-stone, and, to use the lan
 guage     of  the manufactory,     are capable *'    of supporting  a
greater     or lesser burden of mine."         The former qualities
 admit not of having the air discharged in great quantity, un
less it is impelled under an uncommon degree of compreflion
 and consequent      velocity incompatible with the operations of
 a steam-engine.        The reason is obvious : when air, loosely
 compressed,      or comparatively so, is thrown into a body of
 ignited fuel, the mechanical structure and continuity of whose
                                                             particles

   6z                   On the various Effects produced          by
  -particles are foft, the air is much more eafily decomposed                    ;
  the ignition, of course, is more rapid : the descent of the ma
  terials is promoted beyond their proper ratio, and long be
  fore the carbonaceous matter has penetrated                       the ore, or
  united to the metal, to constitute sufibility.                  I mall adduce
/ an example, as being most illustrative of this doctrine.
       Suppose a blast-surnace, 35 seet high, 1 1 seet wide at the
  boshes, properly burdened, and producing No. 1, pig-iron.
  Let the         discharge     of air be supposed equal to a pressure 2\
  pounds upon the square inch, or equivalent to i-6thofthe
   atmosphere, or 5 inches of mercury : under these circum
  stances       let it farther be supposed, that 1500 cubical seet              of
  air are discharged in one minute ; and that the diameter                      of
   the diseharging-pipe is 2-625, tne area 0f which is equal to
  6'89o625 circular inches.                 Let the diseharging-pipe be in
   creased to 3 inches diameter, and let the fame quantity of
   air be passed into the surnace ; it is evident that as the area
   of   the    diseharging-pipe is increased to 9 circular inches, or
   nearly i-3d more than formerly, the compression of air must
   be proportionally diminished.                This alteration is foon per
   ceived      by its    essects ; the quantity of scoria increases from
   the surnace,        whilst   the consumption of. the materials above
   is alfo confiderably augmented.                In a sew hours the scoria
   will    have undergone a complete change,                 from pure white,
   enamelled with various blue shades, to a green, brown, or
   black colour, confiderably charged with the oxyd of iron *.
   The     fame essects     will continue, in      greater or lesser degree,   till
   all the materials arc reduced which were existing in the sur
   nace at the period of diminished compresfion.                     The philo
   fophy of this fact may be accounted for in the following
   manner: —
        While      the just association      of proportions remained, the air
   was      discharged      under such        a degree of compression       as to
   excite      proper combustion         :  the decompofition of the air by
    means      of  the ignited suel, was not essected in immediate con
    tact    with     the  separating       metal, but had, by its uncommon
    degree      of denfity,      refisted decompofition in the ignited pas-s
       :*  The   metal will have lost nearly all its carbon,   and have hecome ii\-

sage, and had been decomposed             upon the cokes at a greater
elevation in the furnace.        As   a  proof of this, we frequently
fee a tube formed throughout           the whole breadth of the fur
nace,    quite black and apparently cold, formed of the fused
materials : when this is removed, a considerable descent mo
mently takes place of cokes heated visibly beyond the com
mon pitch : these inflame rapidly, but are soon again cooled
to blackness      by the incessant discharge of air upon them.
The descending mixture of iron and lava are in like manner
cooled around the line       of blast; the tube is again formed,and,
if not   removed, will remain for days together, while the fur
nace     will be otherways working in the best manner.
     When by accident or design the compression and velocity
 of   the blast are diminished,        the tube begins to burn, and
 throws off a great many red fiery-coloured sparks, the sides
 and roof fail, and are carried before the blast in all direc
 tions.     Sometimes considerable        cloats   of imperfect iron   are
 recoiled with such violence as to escape the vortex of blast,
 and issue from the tuyre-hole with such velocity as to inflame
 in   the air, and fall down     in the    state  of oxyd.     In the end
 the tuyre    will   appear to flame, and all the passage         inwards
 shews     an astonishing degree       of  whiteness.     The   decompo
 sition of the air is instantaneously effected upon its entering
 the ignited passage ; the iron by this means is exposed to the
 oxygen that is disengaged         ;  and the vast quantity     of caloric
  set free, in consequence    of its union with the iron and carbon,
 produces the astonishing heat now visible, but which formerly
  took place at a more proper height in the furnace.
      From this it will appear,      that although     a greater apparent
  degree of heat is visibly produced by the sudden decompo
  sition of the air, and a more rapid descent of materials for
  some time is the consequence,          yet, as the quality of the iron
  is impaired, and as in the end the furnace will return to its
  old consumption of materials as to quantity, the effects of a
  loose soft blast are conclusively .pernicious.
      It sometimes happens, that when a loose blast is surcharged
  with   a considerable portion of moisture, or comes in contact
  with    cokes  which     had  been    wet when introduced into the
  furnaoe, the inflammation which             takes place at the tuyre ia

now described will be felt when blast      improperly propor      is
tioned to coal of stronger continuity of fracture and superior
                          a
quality.        Besides the effects produced                      by    the sudden decom
position of iron, others                 of like nature            are produced where              a
soft coal   is   used,   a    small furnace, and           a   great discharge             of blast.
   Ithas been found that crude iron, to be properly matured,
ought to remain in the blast-furnace, according to circum
stances, 48 to 60 hours              ;    that     is,   from          the  period that the
iron-stone       is   introduced till such time                   as    the metal begins to
occupy its place in the hearth in                     a   state    of    perfect separation.
When        the contrary            is   the cafe, the mixtures arrive at the
hottest  parts of the furnace before the metal has taken up                                        a
sufficient quantity of carbon from the fuel     the action of                ;
the blast,        and    the immediate heat by which the ore                                is   sur
rounded, forces the iron from its connections to the bottom
of the furnace. The quality    dc- carbonated, and reduced
                                                 is
in its value to restore this again, the local portion of fuel

increased; this adds to the expence of manufacturing, and
diminishes, in some measure, the smelting of the furnace.
   When splint-coal cokes are used in the blast-sornacc, the
blast admits of being thrown in under the highest possible
pitch of compression   the uncommon density of the charcoal
                                ;

  This quality of coal    used in all the Curson blast-furnaces,

where, to ensure    respectable produce, the air

under   a pressure equal to 3^ pounds upon the square inch, or
6[-  inches of mercury.
    The fame quality of coal was used at the Devon iron
works, where, at one time, having all the blast of    48 inch                         a

   mercury supported was upwards of 7 inches ; the quantity of
   air discharged under such an impelling power, I found to
   exceed 2600 cubical feet per minute.
      The   coals used at the Cleugh, Cleland, and Clyde iron
   works, are nearly of the fame quality at each —a mixture of
   splint and soft coal. The Muirkirk and Glenbuck iron-works
   have a coal different from any of the former, and in some
   particular spots it considerably      resembles  the English   clod-
   coaJ.
      ad, The various methods        of procuring air for the blast
   furnace may be reduced to         the following: — 1st, That pro
  cured by cylinders, and discharged into the furnace by means
  of a floating piston heavily loaded, and working in a large
  receiver   or regulating cylinder    :   2d, That wherein pumping
  cylinders only are used, and the air thrown into chests in
  verted   in water, called the water-vault : 3d, That mode
  wherein the air is discharged from the pumping or forcing
 cylinder into an air-tight house, called the air-vault.
      The first method is the original mode of blowing, and is
  full much used at those iron-works whose erection has been
  prior to the last fifteen years.     By this mode the quality of
  the air is less subject to alteration by a change of atmosphere.
 The principal objection to this manner of blowing, is the
 want of capacity in the receiving cylinder; which cannot be
 increased so much as to take away the considerable intervals
 which     occur at different parts of the engine-stroke.         This
 effect is sensibly seen by the speedy and irregular ascent and
descent    of  the column     of mercury.      In water blowing-ma
chines, where the air is raised by three or four cylinders
worked by means of a crank, where the air is received into
an air-chest, and forced       into the furnace by the continual
action of    the blast  of  each successive cylinder,  the current of
air is steady, and supports the column of mercury with great
uniformity.
     The use of the water-vault has of late years become very
general among new erected works. Its properties are, a steady
and very cold blast : the largeness of the receiving cisterns
gives them a sufficient capacity to retain ever}- pound of air

tage.        This   is not the cafe with               the floating pistons,          where
a   certain quantity of              spare    wind is thrown out at every return
of the engine, left the great piston and weight should be
blown out of the cylinder altogether; which, indeed, some
times happens.              The only objection which remains in force
against the use            of the water-vault, is the tendency which it
has to take up            a considerable portion of the water in solu
tion, and introducing                  it into the furnace.            A     judicious ar
rangement of the conducting-pipes would in some measure
obviate this, as well as the more dangerous tendency which
water has to rife in a pipe speedily emptied of its air by the
stopping of the engine : a stream of water thus conveyed to
the furnace, would be productive of the most awful conse
quences.                    .
  The air afforded by the air-vault is much inferior to that
obtained in the former methods. This immense magazine
of compressed air generates a considerable portion of heat,
•which greedily seizes the damps, which are unavoidable in
underground excavations, and conveys them to the furnace.
The blast           is,
             however, steady and uniform   and when the                ;

                    it    is
nace.         In    the summer months, however, the air becomes so
far debased          as    to affect the quality           of   the    iron, and change
it     from grev to white.                   Every change in the temperature of
    the atmosphere during                    this period,  indicated
                                                             is         various  by
changes        in   the furnace.
      The    largest air-vault hitherto .in use was excavated out                           of
solid rock at the Devon iron-works                         :    the fissures   of   the rock
    admitted considerable              quantities of water         ;   and the fame de
    greeof damp would always prevent the possibility of making
    the side-walls and roof air-tight    means of pitch andby

  sufficiently known by the effects which it produces in the
 blast-furnace, and ought to be subject to scrupulous examin
  ation.
     In this,  as  in other countries, larger produces of cast iron
  are obtained    in the winter months than during the summer
 and    autumn     seasons  : the quality  of  the metal is also much
 more carbonated, and with a less proportion of fuel. In
 many parts of Sweden, where the summer heats are intense,
 the manufacturer is obliged to blow out or stop his furnace
 for two or three months;          not only is he unable to make
 carbonated    metal, but is frequently incapable of keeping the
 furnace in such trim as to make a produce of any quality
 whatever.       In Britain, during the months of June, July, and
 August, more especially in dry seasons, the quality of the iron,
 with the local proportion of fuel, will be depreciated 30 per
 cent., and the quantity reduced to 2-3ds or 3-4ths.
     In seeking for a solution of this universally acknowledged
 fact, our attention is naturally directed to an examination of
 the various states of air. That the quality of the air in winter
 is more fit for combustion than in summer, is a truth which
 requires   no farther demonstration.       Greater coolness, whereby
 an almost complete refrieeration        of moisture  takes place, and
 the presence     of perhaps a greater relative proportion of oxy
 gen, may     account    for this phenomenon.         On the contrary,
 the quality of air during the summer months becomes much
'contaminated for combustion, by holding in solution a much
greater quantity of moisture : the abundance of nitrous par
ticles may also diminifli      the usual proportion    of oxygen.
    This will account for the inferior effects of combustion
both in common sires and in the blast-furnace ; it will also
in a great measure tend to solve the curious phenomenon of
pig-iron taking       up less carbon   in summer, although reduced
with a superior quantity of fuel. The air discharged most
probably contains less oxvgcn ; yet the metal is much less
carbonated      than at other times, when contrary proportions
of   these exist.    Most probably the deficient carbon is carried
off by dissolving      in hydrogen, forming       a constant stream of
hydro-carbonic gas, while the oxygen that is set free unites
to the iron j and while it reduces its quality, at the fame time
                                   Ka                              the

68                 On the various Effects produced by
the quantity is reduced by           a  portion of the metal being lost
in the scoria*.
   To correct       these occafional impersections in the quality             of
the air, and to devise methods to procure                   air always fit for
proper combustion, ought to be an object of much confider
ation to the manufacturer of cast iron.                      Whether such a
confideration has given rise to the disserent modes of receiv
ing and discharging the air now in use, I cannot fay; I ra
ther think not: a great quantity of air has hitherto been a
greater     object than a certain and unisorm quality ; and in
a  country where there is more temperate and cold weather
than hot, it is by far the most important object : to unite
both, however, would be an attainment of the greatest uti
lity,   and would rank the discoverer             amongst     the well-deserv-
insr, of his country.       How far        the mechanism         of our  present
machinery        has   been adapted to the exigencies             of our atmo
sphere,     will  appear upon examining the nature and properties
of   the air, judged by its essects upon the blast-surnace.
    The air      produced    by ihe blowing           and   receiving-evlinder
is  less changed, and less subject to change, than that produced
and lodged in contact with a vast body of air or water.                        If
the blowing-cylinder is fixed in a dry cool spot, the only
disserence which the air undergoes is an increase of tempe
rature    ;  this is fo very confiderable, that upon entering the
blowing-cylinder immediately aster stopping the engine, I
have found the thermometer rise 15 to 17^ degrees higher
than the surrounding air.              That this     heat is generated    in the
cylinder is unquestionable ; but whether it is occafioned by
the friction of the piston leather upon the fides of the cylin
der, or expressed from the air by its severe compression,                       I
have     not yet been able to decide.                 It very probably arises
from both causes, although the latter is sufficient to produce
a much greater         degree     of   heat.     What      essect  this increase
of temperature         has  upon combustion we are unable to fay,
as the      degree    of  heat accumulated          will at all times bear a
reserence      to the temperature          of  the surrounding air, and as
   •                                         of tlic summer atmosphere produce

                                                                           there

                   Air    used in the   Blajl- Furnace.                    69
there is no method likely to be devised where heat would not
be generated by the action           of the particles of air upon each
other.     When the bulb of a thermometer is held in the
middle of the current of blast, as it issues from the discharg-
ing-pipe,    a temperature      is indicated as much         lower than the
temperature     of  the surrounding air, as the temperature            of the
cylinder was higher ; and it is most              probable that a much
lower degree would be obtained, were it not for the previous
expression of some heat in the blowing-cylinder.                   Upon the
whole,    1 think, the quality of the air obtained in this way
of blowing uniformly         most fit for combustion, provided the
numerous pauses and irregularities of the current of air were
done away.
    Air  forced   into the furnace under water pressure always
contains a considerable           portion of moisture ; the blast of
course is colder, as it issues from the discharging-pipe.                 The
temperature     differs so much from that          of the external air   as to
sink the thermometer from 540 down to 280 and 300.                      Such
effects are produced by air coming into contact with water,
that, although the temperature of the atmosphere is 60, 65,
to 70, yet the blast at the orifice seldom rises above 38 : the
cold produced        in this manner        is much increased       if the    air
is surcharged    with     so much water       as to be visible  in the    state
of  a fine spray.      The leading     feature,   therefore,   of the water-
vault,  as to its effects    upon the quality of the air, seems to in
dicate an almost uniform degree of temperature in the blast :
this can only be occasioned              by the warm air in summer
 taking up a greater portion of the water in solution, the
 escape of which at a small orifice, and under a great degree
 of  compression,       produces    the   very    great  depression    of   the
 thermometer.         I  have already hinted at the bad effects pro
 duced by moist blasts, and shall,          in  a proper place, more mi
 nutely attend to them.
    The most inferior quality of air used in the blast-furnace
 is that thrown        into the air-vault, and afterwards expressed
 from thence by its own elasticity and the successive strokes of
 the engine. The capacity of such a building is from 60 to
 70,000 cubical feet ; this, when filled, generates a much su
 perior degree of heat to that sensible in the blowing-cylinder.
                                                                             As

   •o                  Remarks  on the Scotch "Distillery,
  As this     heat is produced many feet distant from any mecha
  nical motion, it is most evident        that it is extricated from the
  air, and will readily unite with the moisture which penetrates
  the building: the quality of the air introduced into the fuK-
  nace    will  therefore  be in proportion    to the quantity    of mois
  ture taken up ; this will be much more in summer than in
  winter, as the temperature of the former exceeds that of the
  latter. The sensation, on entering the air-vault in the coldest
  months,      immediately after stopping the engine, is exactly
  similar to that experienced upon entering a crowded room in
  the hottest summer day ; the walls are covered with damp,
 and the superior regions        of the vault readily obscure the flame
 of   a candle.       The feeling, upon remaining in the air-vault
 when the engine is at work, is less marked than would be
  expected where so great a compression of air existed; the
  sense of hearing, owing to the moisture in the conducting me
  dium, is considerably impaired, and respiration is performed
  with some difficulty ; the light of a candle         is <faint, and not
 visible at the distance of a few feet.

 mon distillery business in Scotland within these few years
 are such as cannot fail to excite the wonder of men of sci
 ence, while they serve to prove, at the same time, that, to in
 sure progressive improvement in any branch, the most effec
 tual mean is that stimulus which results from interest.
     It  is not necessary, and it would be tedious, to describe
 the progress      of the distillery in Scotland, since it first began,
 to assume a form         of some consequence, about twenty years
 ago.      It  may,    however,  not be thought improper to mention

                and Description     of an improved Still.        7X
the Lowlands of Scotland, by which the manufacture and
duties levied on spirits in Scotland and in England became
regulated by distinct and separate laws.
     The Scotch distillers, previous to the year 1786, had sent
large quantities of spirits to the London market, which had
occasioned a reduction of the price ; and it was found also
that the revenue of the distillery had diminished.        From this
circumstance it was suspected that frauds were committed
 against the revenue to a great extent ; and the London dis
 tillers having received certain information of the manner in
 which the duties were evaded in Scotland, this suggested the
 necessity of making separate and distinct laws for raising the
 duties in the different kingdoms.
     Therefore, in July 1786 the licence act for the Lowlands
 of Scotland commenced, and was to continue for two years.
 The principle on which this act was framed, between the
  contending and rival distillers of the two kingdoms, with
  consent of the minister, was in this manner : —
      The duty then paid by the English distillers was sixpence
 per gallon on the wash 5 and supposing that 18 gallons of spi
  rits,   1 to ac over hydrometer proof, were        taken from  100
  gallons of wash, the duty on the spirits of that strength
  amounted to 2s. g'Td. per gallon.' The distillers in the Low
  lands of Scotland were allowed to work stills of any capacity
  or extent, on paying an annual licence duty of thirty shillings
  per gallon on the content of their stills; and the spirits thus
  made were to be consumed in Scotland.            They were also al
  lowed to send their spirits into England on paying an addi
   tional duty of two shillings per gallon, of the strength of       1
   to 10 over hydrometer proof,         when landed there.    Thus it
   was computed,        that the annual licence duty of the Scotch
   distillers would be equivalent to the remaining <)\d. per gal-
  Jon    paid by the English distillers, on this ground, that the
   Scotch distillers could run off their stills only once in the 24
   .hours.
       The licence     act being settled in this manner, and as the
   English    distillers  considered they had been thus far successful
   in fixing the Scotch to pay a certain duty of 2 s. per gallon,
   not    to be evaded,     they expected    to have had the  London
                                                               market

  ya               Remarks on the Scotch     Dijiiflerjr,
  market to themselves      : but they soon found they were mis
  taken, and that the Scotch continued to send increased quan
 tities, and the price of spirits fell very low in the London
  market.
     In the beginning of 1788 an investigation took place in a
 Committee of the House of Commons, respecting the number
 of  times in   which the Scotch distillers     had   worked off their
 stills in a given time, and it was found that they were in the
 practice of running off their stills five or fix times in the space
 of  24 hours.     It was therefore inferred, that by misrepresent
 ation they had obtained an undue advantage over the English
 distillers;   and in February 1788, before the two years of the
 licence act had expired, an additional duty of sixpence pet
 gallon was laid on all spirits sent from Scotland to England ;
 the remaining $\d. per gallon being reckoned 2. sufficient
 equivalent for the licence duty.          It must well be remem
 bered,    thr.t at this time the Scotch distillers, who had long
 contended with the English, became bankrupts, and resigned
 that market to their rivals. Since that time new regulations
 have been      made,  by which the whole of the English duty is
 paid on the Scotch spirits when landed in England ; and the
 revenue arising from the distillery has very much increased.
    Having endeavoured briefly to mention the causes which
originally occasioned the licence act to be introduced into the
Lowlands of Scotland, it may now be proper to observe, that
the ingenuity of the distillers, working by the licence act,
has constantly been excited, and always successful in lessen
ing the duties, their success having kept pace almost in the
degree in which the duties have been increased.            For, when
the licence act commenced in 1786, the distillers continued
for some time to use stills of a large size, and the duty being
only 30s. per gallon on the content of the stills, they did
then work them off five or fix times in the 24 hours ; by
which the duty      cost from  id.   to $d. per gallon on the spirits.
In 1788 the duty was increased          to 3/., and it continued at
that rate for about five years : during this space they im
proved in running off their stills to about 20 times in the
24 hours. They attained to this degree of dispatch by greatly
reducing the size     of their stills, and enlarging their furnaces.
                                                                   At

                  and Description           of an     improved   Still.              73
At this time the duty on the spirits did not cost them above
one penny per gallon, which being very small they did not
think any farther improvement necessary.
   Since the commencement of the present war, the minister
has thought that to lay an additional duty on spirits made in
Scotland would be a proper measure; and in 1793 the an
nual licence  duty on the stills was increased to 9/., and in
1797 to 54/. per gallon, which is the present duty.   He had
reason to expect that a large increase of revenue would arise
from this high duty ; and yet it must appear very surprising
that the revenue from the Scotch distillery has not increased
in any considerable degree. This is not owing to a diminu
tion irvthe consumption of spirits; for, the price of that article
being so low in December last as 3$. per gallon, there can
be no just reason to think that a less quantity has been used.
     When  the distillers found the duty raised on them so high
as 54/.  per  gallon, they tried every expedient in order to ac
celerate the process.     From repeated experiments they have
found, that the more shallow the stills are made, and the
bottoms enlarged, the more they can increase the size of the
furnace, and apply a larger quantity of fuel, and consequently
biing-the wash in the still to boil in a sliorter space of time.
The liquor in the still being likewise on a more extended sur
face, the evaporation or process of distillation is performed in
a more expeditious               manner.    It is principally by the fhaU
lownefs of       the stills        that the Lowland distillers are now en
abled to run off their stills three times in the hour, or seventy-
two times in the 24 hours ; a degree of dispatch which a few
years ago was thought to have been impracticable.

tom, by which means the wash is prevented from burning
to the bottom, and thereby generating any new compound
injurious to the flavour or quality of the spirit. These stills
are usually of from 40 to 50 gallons contents.
   The principle of the improvement seems to centre in this
simple point — The greater the quantity of heat that can be
made    to pass      through the body of the still in        a given time,
the greater    will   be the quantity    of  vapour,   and    consequently
of spirits,  produced     in that time   :  and certainly it is not easy
to conceive    how this can be attained in anv way so effectually
as by making the still all bottom, as it were, and applying the
Beat to every part of that bottom.

Dr. Lister, who made observations of the fame kind in Eng

Sweden, have given a more complete history of them. Sco-

to each the name of some illustrious person who has pro
moted        the science      of entomology.           This mark of honour is
of little     consequence       to such great         Mæcenases,         and the in
convenience         of increasing and confusing the received nomen
 clature is very great.
    The public        care little also for the exact descriptions                of na
turalists,      and their methodic classifications.                   They require
 facts; something wonderful and                    extraordinary.          They. wife
 that every natural being should present some new phenome
non ; an object of immediate utility, or a subject of repro
bation     :   and when their prejudices are once established,                      no
 thing can destroy them.                Sometimes, for she truth must be
confessed,       naturalists     in their writings have been the source
of errors       and prejudices.          Were we to correct the assertions
of Pliny, Johnston,             Mouffet,       and Aldrovandi,            authors still
quoted, and which one cannot read with patience, respecting
 insects only, we ssioukl make a large book of controversies,
 which would serve neither to instruct the learned, nor to un
 deceive .the people, always wedded lo their ignorance.
    The history of spiders, and that of the effects of their
 venom, were it properly treated, would alone furnish matter
for an ample chapter.                 What variety in the sensations of
 man    !     Some have an invincible                aversion      to spiders ; and
 there    are women who faint at the bare                       mention of their
 name*:        others treat them with             familiarity,      and think      it ah
                                                                                      act
    * This                 is  no  less                      often   more reasonable,
               antipathy                  strong,  though
 among the men.         M.  Zimmerman relates the following singular instance           of
it, to which he was a witness : —        " Being one day in an English        company,"
 lavs he,    " consisting of persons    of distinction, the conversation happened
to fall upon antipathies         The greater pan of the company denied the re
ality of them, and treated them as old women's tales ; but             I  told them that
 antipathy was a real disease.        Mr. William Matthew,         son  of  the governor
of Carbadocs, was of my opinion; and,               as he added that he had       himself
an extreme antipathy to spiders, he was laughed, at bv the whole               company.
 I (hewed them, however, that this was            a real  impression   in his mind, re
sulting from a mechanical effect. Mr. John Murray, afterwards Duke of
Athol, took it into his head to make, in Mr. Matthew's presence, a spider
of black wax, to try whether this antipathy would appear merely on a
fight of  the infect.   He went out of      the room, therefore, and returned       with

lated for and against the assertion of spiders being venomous,
that we cannot but be cautious in regard to what has been
said on the subject by different authors 5 we must therefore
request        those who               relate     such    stories       in future, to give            a
correct description of the kind of spider or other insect which
they believe to be poisonous, together with their common
and scientific names, which will remove all doubt and con
fusion.
     Our      spiders in France are                in
                                         rather ugly than for
                                                         general
 midable.    If there are any suspected of being poisonous, it
ought   not to be the domestic spider with long claws, aranea
                                     Linn, nor the mower of
farientina and aranea pbalangiodes
the fields, pbalangium opilio Linn, the only kinds of the pha-
langia mentioned by Geoffrey ; nor the mason spider, with
which perhaps this author was unacquainted, because it in
habits the southern provinces ; nor the orange-coloured                                            spi
der, and that entirely white aranea viatica, and the aranea
citrina       Linn, found commonly among                                 vegetables and fruit,
and chiefly grapes               ;     nor   so   many others which               fie     see   daily,
a bit of black wax     his hand, which he kept fliut. -Mr. Matthew, who
                            in
in other respects was sedate and amiable man, .irnagining that his friend
                                 a
really held spider, immediately drew his s*ord in
               a                                         great fury, retireda
with precipitation to the wall, leaned against   as   to run him through,
                                                                 it      if
and sent forth horrible cries.  All the muscles of his, face were swelled,
his eye-balls      rolled    in their        sockets, and his whole body was as stiff as              a
post.    We immediately ran              to him in great       aUrm,and took his sword from
him, assuring him at the sutic time that Mr. Muruy had nothing   hit                             in
hand but    little wax, and that he might himself see
              a                                        on the table,              It
where    it   was placed.
     He remained      some time in this            spasmodic    state,
                                                                 and   was really afraid
                                                                              I
of the      consequences.            He however gradually   recovered, and deplored the
dreadful passion into which                he had been thrown,  and from which he stihV
suffeicd. His pulse was exceedingly                     quick and full, and his whole body
was covered with         a   cold sweat.           After taking   sedative

to his former tranquillity, and                 his fear was attended with no other bad
consequences.        We      must       not be surprised at this antipathy        :    the largest and
most hideous spiders             are found in Barhadocs,           and   Mr. Matthew        was born
in that isiand.      Srmc one of the company having formed of the fame wax,
in his presence,     a   small spider, he looked atmaking with the ut

in houses which are not kept clean, and to those people who
labour in the fields In that cafe?   would be highly proper it
to destroy them.

those carried thither immediately die.
   Spiders have often attracted the attention of the curious
 by their manœuvres,    their amours, and singular mode of
copulation, as well as                         by

webs, and forming cods, in which they inclose their eggs;

tcmaia, and which must astonish those who view them who.
the eye of a philosopher.
     Aworthy magistrate, M. Bon, who was food of natural
history, at a time when it was necessary to surmount many
prejudices, found means to breed spiders, and to extract silk
from their cods, which he opened. All spiders are not weav
ers, but they are spinners, and all live by hunting.    This
hunting, for the most part, is only stationary, like that by
decoy.          hunters display considerable cunning and ad
            These
dress to make their prey fall into the snares which they have
laid.   One kind, the aranea domejlka, extends its net hori
zontally in a comer, hooks itself to                it,
                                          and in that manner
lies in wait for its prey    another, the aranea dumetonun,
                                 ;
places its n«t in a vertical position across an alley in   gar                 a
den, to intercept the palling infects     one conceals itself in
                                                    ;
its cavern, and darts forth on the smallest noise and another       ;
suspends itself from the branch of a tree                    by
                                                 a long thread,
and acts the tumbler, to attract stupid spectators.   There are
some which cover their cave on the outside with         kind of         a
white silk, as  to announce,
                   if                      by
                                    beautiful entrance, that

there will be no danger to proceed farther    this  merely   :          is              a
decoy. Such      their occupation, their resources, and their
                    is
industry.     As in      every numerous race              there    are vagabond?,
some spiders employ themselves only in running about, and
in jumping. Such are the habits of the wolf spider. There
are some also exceedingly cruel,                which employ their anus
with great force         and activity.
  The structure          of   spiders is-no less remarkable than their
habits.   They                            but differently dis
                     have always eight eyes,
posed; and this has enabled naturalists to divide them into
different classes, in order that they may be better distin
guished.      M.    Fabrieius, however, has made known five                        spe
cies     with only    fix eyes.      This    is     denied        by   M.   Geoffrey,
who apparently had not seen these species.    But the most
interesting organ in these insects their mouth,
                                             is  since                          it      is
with this alone that they are able to hurt us. The mouth
of   the spider consists       of twa    strong forceps,          terminated       by    a
kind of very         sharp    claws, the points of which                     are bent
                                                                               down

                           and their supposed Poison,                               79-
downwards *.              These     forceps     or claws are moveable,            and
can easily be turned upwards or downwards, and even from-
right to left. It is with these instruments that the spider
seizes, pinches, and           kills   its prey.     The points     also serve    it as
a mouth        :    though their extremity is very (harp, it is pierced
towards       the end ; and the inside            of the forceps is hollow ; so
that the spider by these means fucks up the moisture of flies,
or of other insects which it seizes.
     Swammcrdam fays, that what might be taken for teeth in
the spider arc real stings or darts with which it pierces those
animals the blood of which it fucks : but this observer did-
not believe that the spider emitted from these darts a venom
ous liquor.           Lister, who fays he had certain proofs of spiders
being venomous, expressed the poison from these instru
ments.           Leuwenhoek also advances, that the venom of the
spiders is contained            in   the cavity of the (harp pincers which
proceed from the mouth of the insect.                      Others have said that
 these forceps          are not hollow,          but that the venom proceeds
 from a small trunk which                 issues  from the mouth at the mo
 ment when the insect seizes its prey.                   It is possible, and even,
 probable,         that  different    kinds     of  spiders have a different or
ganisation ; and it is a certain fact, that many spiders, and
perhaps all of them, throw out from their mouth a certain
 liquor,      with which they moisten their prey. We may reft
 assured, however, that our spiders have nothing in them of a
 venomous nature; and this is proved by our so often touch
 ing them without danger1.                  They are often between our teeth
 when we eat fruit and certain kinds of vegetables, yet we
 perceive        no other bad consequences              from them than those
 which may arise from fear and the idea of dirtiness.                           There
 are even spider-eaters,            who make a sport of swallowing them i
 some do          it through whim,           others   through     a depraved     tate,
 and some to sliew their courage, or to gain a wager                       f .    Redi

  he made, he does not believe        them to be poisonous.      Dr.
 Fairfax is of the fame opinion.       Clerk and Roefel maintain,
 that spiders are not so venomous as is supposed, since many
 persons swallow them.         It is related by the Peintre Natu-
 raliste, that a man pretty far advanced in life ate all the
 spiders which he found, and that they served him as a pur
 gative. He spread them on a flice of bread, as if they had-
 been excellent marmalade.        The  fame naturalist  confutes the
 popular error, that the spider is able, by its pricking, to kill
 the toad.   He saw nothing of the kind, though he made
 various experiments on that subject.

 XVI.    Some Account   of  the late  Mark Eleazar Bloch,
                              of Berlin.
 ]VLLARK      ELEAZAR BLOCH,              a Jewish physician esta
 blished at Berlin, and well known by his Natural History of
Fishes, was born at Anspach, in Franconia, of very poor pa
 rents. His father, who was exceedingly devout, spent his
 whole time in reading the Bible and the Talmud ; while his
mother, by felling old clothes, and other things of the like
kind, gained enough to maintain her husband and children.
M. Bloch,    at the age of nineteen, could not read German,
and did not know a single word of Latin. He had read only
a few Rabbinical books, and spoke a kind of Franconian
gibberish mixed with the Judaic jargon.         A Jewish surgeon,
settled at Hamburgh, having taken him into his house to in
struct his children, he learned good German by hearing the
gazettes read, and afterwards by studying the language.          He
lived so economically that he saved from his scanty salary as
much as enabled      him' to    pay  for instruction in the Latin,
which    he was taught by a student       as poor  as himself.   He
acquired, at the same time, some knowledge of surgery ; and,
as he had relations at Berlin, he repaired to that city to study
anatomy.     Having surmounted various difficulties, and got
himself admitted as Doctor in the University of Francfort,
                      6                                          he

                  Mark Ehazar Bloch, of Berlin.                      8j
he returned to Berlin and made himself known to              M. Mar
tini, by  whose means he was elected a member           of th<j Society
of the Friends of Nature.
    M.  Bloch,   in order that he might promote the objects of
that institution, undertook a natural history of the Muræna,
a fish caught only in the lakes of Pomerania.            He began to
form a cabinet     of natural history ;     and having made a con
siderable collection of aquatic animals from all parts of the
globe, he resolved to write        a  natural history of fishes.    He
caused drawings to be made          and   engravings   to be executed
from them with great correctness.            By a fortunate accident
he procured the original manuscripts of Father Plumier, at
the sale of one of those Frenchmen who came to Branden-
bourg at the time when Frederic II. establistied the admi
nistration of excise.      Father Plumier, of the order of the
Minims,     had   made   three voyages     to America,     and always
brought back many interesting objects. Though he pub
lished nothing but on botany, if we except the art of turning,
it is well known that he wrote a great deal on birds and si flies;
but no one could tell what had become of these manuscripts :
and it is still unknown in what manner they came into the
hands of the above Frenchman, from whom they passed intq
those  of M. Bloch.
    This naturalist first publislicd, in German, four numbers
of an Economical Natural History of Fishes, particularly
those in the States of Prussia, with figures from original,
drawings: Berlin, t;8i and 1782; large quarto.                  In the
following years he gave an Economical Natural History of
the Fishes of Germany, in three volumes, consisting of 108
plates, and in which the three numbers above mentioned
were inserted.     He   published    afterwards,   in nine volumes,
the Natural     History of Foreign Fistiesj so that hi3r whole
work, consisting of twelve volumes, contains 432 plates.
The last appeared in 1795.        He caused also to be made, 'at
his own expence, by       C    Laveaux, then at Berlin, a Frencli
translation of his work, which he publisticd under the title of
Hi/foire generate el particuliere des PoiJJoris, Berlin 1 785 — •
1788 ; six volumes folio, with 216" plates.         It may be readily
conceived    that the expence      of  such a work must have been

considerable; unfortunately the number of the                          subscribers
and purchasers was not sufficient to defray it.                         M. Bloch
.had the misfortune also to lose his only son, already distin
 guished by his talents, who died at Paris In 1787, when on
*a tour to France and England to procure subscribers to the
French edition of his father's History of FTfhes. This loss
plunged M. Bloch, already oppressed with labour and ex-
pence, into the deepest affliction.  He however still conti
nued to employ himself on his History of Fishes, and, having
concluded        it,
              undertook    journey to' Paris.

naturalist, who has rendered  great service                      to   ichthyology,
died at Carlsbad, in Bohemia, on the 6thof August 1799.
Besides the above voluminous works, M. Bloch published a
great many memoirs on Natural History   the Transactions  in
of different Societies.           His Dissertation      on the'Muneria,       pub
lished    in the Memoirs of the Friends of Nature at Berlin,
has been mentioned already.               In     the fame work he published
also the   following: — Observations             on the regular Depressions
in Vitriform       Stones   ;     on the Worms in the Intestines and

        DEAR SIR,                          Warwick-street, Golden-square,  No. 7.
    I  am just going into Sussex to breathe there some of the
 pure atmospherical air; but I cannot leave this metropolis
 without reiterating to you and Dr. Thornton, with the ten-
 derest feelings    of gratitude,     the warmest acknowledgments for
 the great benefit you have conferred           on me by administering
 to me the vital      air:   indeed, when     I compare the situation in
which     I was at the end          of September, when I,           as a  dying
man, came under both your care, to what, thank God, you
have brought me now, it seems to me quite miraculous, and
 T shall always look with astonishment               at the wonderful dis
 covery which has been made so lately              of the oxygen air.

Lord Romney,          Count Bruhl, &c. congratulated him on his
 recovery; but his asthma soon after made him a second visit,
and the vital air was again resumed, when in a few days it
 brought on another attack of the gout in botli feet, which
 went off kindly,       leaving the patient in excellent health and
 extraordinary spirits.
    It may    be proper     lo mention, the average dose of vital air
 daily given was six      quarts, mixed with twelve of atmospheric
 air, and this was conjoined with the medicines most com
 monly exhibited upon such cases.

              FRENCH NATIONAL INSTITUTE.
   In  the sitting    of the   French      National      Institute, Yende-
rniairc 15, year 8, October 7, 1799, C. Cuvier read the fol
lowing   account of the labours of the Mathematical arul
Physical Class during the last quarter of the year 7 : —
   The diamond, so valuable on account of its rarity and
splendour, and so flattering to the vanity of man, had lung
ago attracted the attention of philosophers by other qualities.
The ancients     considered   it  as the    most unalterable       of bodies,
and made it the emblem         of   the immutability         of  the decrees
of Fate :—

                Clavos.
   Mankind      were    much surprised when experiments proved
what the genius of Newton had divined — that the hardest
                                                                         and

and most untractable         of stones is converted     into a little smoke
and soot.       But   the question was,      What    is the nature    of this
combustible body ? Is it a particular species, like sulphur, or
phosphorus? or is it a compound of different combustible
bodies,      as  oils and bitumens? There was only one way of
answering these questions — to collect the product of its com
bustion. This has been done, and the product was found to
be absolutely       the same as that   of   the combustion     of charcoal   5
that is to fay, that deleterious vapour to which chemists have
given the name of carbonic acid gas.                Are the diamond and
charcoal then the fame thing          ?   or,   if not, in what      do they
differ   ?   This   is the problem which        C. Guyton    proposed,   and
which he has resolved.           He first saw the diamond change it
self into carbonic acid without leaving a residuum : if it differs
then from charcoal, it is only because it contains something
more.        It produces much more of that acid, because it ab
sorbs more oxygen during combustion than charcoal does ;
.Tnd   if the combustion      be suspended at a certain point,         which
C. Guyton did,           by burning the diamond by means               of the
solar     rays, you     obtain  real carbon.        Thus common char
coal, making allowance for the earthy and saline matters
which form the ashes, is not a simple substance, as hitherto
believed.       The diamond, by        its first combination with oxy
gen, is converted         into that substance of which the English
make pencils, and which is called plumbago ; by a second
degree, into common black charcoal'; and by complete satu
ration, into carbonic acid.          The diamond, then, is really that
 ideal    and   simple being     which     chemists called carbon, and
 common charcoal is only carbon more oxygenated; that is
to fay, the two substances, which in their usual state appear to
us the most transparent,          form, by their union, the blackest
 and most opaque of substances, and one of the commonest
 of substances contains a great part of its weight of that which
 we consider      as the most    valuable.
    But C. Guyton has done more. It is well known that
 iron is converted into steel by combining itself with a certain
 quantity of carbon.          C. Guyton was desirous of ascertaining
  in what state carbon entered into this combination, and,
 above all, whether it abandons               its oxygen to form steel:

 C    Gaytoa has. declared in the. affirmative- Agreeably. Ufc

 diamond alone in a clofeve&el; and common charcoal did
 not produce steel hut when treated with (we agent C4pabis.
 of depriving it of its oxygen. Many poets have compared-
 the hardness of the armour of their heroes to that of the dia
 mond, without knowing that their comparison was founded
 on so real an intimacy.          (See Phil. Mag. Vol. V.)
    The fame chemist has directed his attention to two me
 tallic substances little known, though sufficiently abundant.
 Qae    of them, named        nickel,    is not yet generally considered
as a particular metal : some chemists think that it is only
 an alloy of several metals. C. Guy ton is of a different opi
 nion : he thinks that it may he poflible to take from nickel
 all the iron ui(h which it is mixed, and that it will even
then retain properties hitherto found only in iron- — that of
attracting the magnetic needle, -and that of becoming mag
netic itself.
    The   second metallic substance he examined is             titugfon; a
word which signifies hcayy stone, because feme of its ores
have a stony appearance.            It is not long since it was known
to be a metal, and hitherto it hail been reduced and rncl^cj
only ia-an imperfect manner.               C. Guy ton, haying succeeded
better than hisfwedcojUor.s has found that the Jpecisic, gra
vity   of this  metal is much less than what had been supplied ;

    The public     has been informed          a year ago  of the success   of
live researches    of G. Fourcroy and Yauquelin on tht-stone of
the bladder. This concretion, which oœasions .the .most ex-

 without being, however, in the state of an acid. The union
 js more intimate than in the hydro-sulfures; and this com
 bination, which C. Chauffier calls uilphuraied hydro-sulfure,
 has not the smell of liver of sulphur. The sdphurated hydro-

    C. Latreille   has explained the habits and           industry of a
small bee, which does not live in society like our domestic bee.
It does not build edifices like the common bee, remarkable
for their matter and      the geometrical manner in which they
are constructed    ; but it knows, at any rate, how to render its
small habitation agreeable.          Bits of the petals of the corn-
poppy,    cut  round    and  rolled    up with art, forms a splendid,
tent with real purple curtains, in which it deposits an egg,
with   a portion of nourishment sufficient for the young one
about to be hatched. Another insect described by C. La
treille is remarkable for the havoc it occasions, as it feeds
only on the young of the domestic bees.                It even searches
for them when it is not destitute of other prey, and destroys
a great many of these insects.          It is of a genus which ap
proaches   near   to that of the   wasp.                       .
    C. Huzzard read to the Class the          observations    of the late
Flandrin on animals bit by a mad              dog.    It  appears    from
these observations that graminivorous animals, such as horses,
cows, &c. may become mad when bit, but that they cannot
communicate this horrid malady to others.

This memoir forms part of a voyage to India, which the
author travelled through,      and contains details respecting   the
population of Madagascar, its productions, and the industry
and manners of its inhabitants.       C. Lescalier has discovered,
that the manners, customs,        and, above all, language of the
inhabitants of Madagascar, have a striking resemblance, not
withstanding the distance, to those of the inhabitants of
Ot:iheite and the other islands of the South Sea.

    C. Buache read a memoir on the lands discovered by La
 Pey rouse on the coast of Tartary and to the north of Japan.
La   Peyrouse explored    the channel  of Tartary, and his labour
appears to be correct.      He examined some parts of the land
of Yesso, and confirms the truth of the discovery made of it
by the Dutch in 1643, and the exactness of the description
they have given of it. But the Dutch and Peyrouse only
saw some points of that land, the great part of which still
remains to be explored. The Ruffians had before made some
voyages to Yesso ; and it appears that it is not a large coun
try, as the Dutch and Peyrouse imagined, but a group of se
veral islands.
    C. Laccpede, of the Class of the Physical and Mathema
tical Sciences, read a memoir on a new zoological chart.
Naturalists, in treating of the different kinds of mammiferæ,
birds, reptiles, and fifties, have pointed out, with care, the
countries which they inhabit. But, to complete the history of
animals, it was necessary that the naturalist should determine
the influence which the different climates have in changing
or improving their faculties and form, and in regard 10 tha
preservation or degeneration of the species.       To obtain a so
lution to this important problem, the author traces out a zoo-

boundaries which have been admitted by geographers.                 He
takes his departure from the meridian of France, and di
vides the globe into twenty-six divisions, of sufficient extent
to obtain sensible differences.     By  means   of these comparable
degrees, the naturalist will be able to ascertain the differences
between    animals,    and even the variations in the fame forms
and   species.   This grand view of Lacepede, by leading to
more exact descriptions and more accurate observations, will
serve to give more extent to the science of the naturalist.

    C. Noel, in a memoir read in the Society, after taking a
view of the advantages which might result from naturalising
salt-water fish in rivers and ponds, and particularly the her
 ring, pointed out the means to be employed for that purpose.
 These means are, to construct an artificial pond between two
islands  of the Seine, and to deposit in it herrings full of roes
both hard and soft, which might be carried thither by one
or more boats.      To ensure the success of this first operation,
the fame     boats might repair to the fishing banks, when the
herrings have spawned,        and  take  up a lading   of  fecundated
ova to be carried to the artificial pond, with certain precau
tions which the author points out in his memoir.               C. Noel
mentions a great many instances which seem to prove that
the herring is fond of freffi water; and, among other facts,
he relates an experiment of Dr. Franklin, who stocked one
of  the rivers of New England with herrings by depositing in
the water leaves of plants covered with ova.            To   add some
force to the proofs adduced,      C. Noel   takes a view    of  the dif
ferent kinds of    si(h which, by the art of man, have been
transplanted   from one climate to another.
    C. Chantran read a memoir on the smut in wheat, and its
 acid. After remarking, that stalks which bear charred ears
differ in nothing from others, and that these ears often con
 tain good and bad grains, he thought himself authorised to ad
vance, that this     disease  does not exist, as generally believed,
in  the germ   of the feed from which they sprung.           However,
he does not consider       liming  the feed as useless;   he thinks it

reason     of    its not entirely extirpating                  the smut         is,   because     it
cannot act         on those small              insects         which      occasion         it,   and
which happen to be scattered                    in      the ground.
     Having      analysed forty-six            grains of smut, he found in this
substance an acid easy to be demonstrated    such an analysis            by
as could not possibly produce   in the course of the process.

Thus, boiling water infused over     gave  strong tinge of red

to tincture of turnsole,  while the remainder of this tincture
retained its former character.    Smut, deprived of its acid,
and calcined in the open air, emitted the odour of burnt
corn, and gave      residuum six times as large as the fame
                         a
quantity of the farina  of wheat treated in the fame manner.
This joined to microscopic observations, fays C. Chantran,
proves     the animal           nature of this substance, and                    a       difference
between      it    and    the farina          of wheat,         greater than could arise
merely from disease.
     The   acid    of    smut   is   not volatile, and may be concentrated
by   distillation.        With lime and with ammonia             forms an
insoluble salt.          This    last character distinguishes                    it it   from the
phosphoric acid.           Combined with pot-afli,                       it   gave   a   salt crys
tallised    in   small deliquescent            needles         of   a   bitter taste.       It   de
composes carbonat of lime.

  Many of our readers must recollect the particulars respect
ing Peter the wild boy, found in the woods in Hanover, who
was aiterwards maintained in this country at the expence of
Government, and who died some years ago : they will also be
able to recollect the wild cirl found in the woods of Cham
pagne in France : both of which instances were employed,
amoncr others,by Lord Mcnbocldo to support his whimsical
idea that mankind originally went on all-fours. Another
instance of a wild individual of the human species has re
cently occurred, as appears by the following extract of a letter
from the administrator of the hospital of Saint Afrique, which
we copv from a late French journal : —
     "
     The attention of the inhabitants of this commune has
been attractedthis morning bv a very singular phenomenon.
A child, caught in the woods of Lacaune by three huntsmen,
was brought to our hospital, of which I am one of the admi
nistrators.         On their approach, this child, which                           was quite
naked, betook itself to flight, and climbed up a tree. When
brought to Liicaune, it made its escape ; but it was again
caught in the woods in the neighbourhood of Saint Sernin,
and carried to the house of C. Constans, Saint Esteve, com
missioner        of government. The soldiers who attended it thi
ther     assured    me, that it was caught in the manner above re
lated.      It    is certain that it feeds only on potatoes and nuts.
If you     give it bread,           it   smells   it,   bites   it,   and then spits    it   out:
the cafe     is    the fame with other kinds                   of aliment.        From these
facts there         can    be no doubt that               it    has lived    a   long time in
the woods. But how was         able to withstand, while quite
                                             it

age at most.            It     is   well fliaped, and its eyes are black and

it a small dress of grey cloth, by which it seems to be much
embarrassed,        and which     it does not know how to get rid of.
We suffered it to go out into the garden, but it endeavoured
to escape, and attempted to break one of the bars of the gate,
which is of lattice-work.            It does not speak. When offered
potatoes,     it  takes  as many    as   its pretty little hands can con
tain.     If they are boiled (for it prefers them so) it peels
them, and eats them like an ape.                  It laughs in a very agree
 able manner,        and, when robbed of its potatoes, fends forth a
 shrill cry.       Constans imagined that it was deaf, but we have
 convinced ourselves of the contrary; at most, it is only dull
 of hearing."

     On    the oth     of December        a  curious phenomenon was ob
  served at    Aosta. At ten in          the morning, two parhelia, or
  mock suns, were seen, of the same size                 as the  real fun, but
 somewhat paler.          One of them had         a long white tail, in stiape
  resembling       a sword.     An hour afterwards,            the three funs
  formed a semicircle, the real one being in the middle. This
  semicircle soon changed into several others, and at length fix
                                                                              of

 of them     were seen one above the other.            These also vanished
again,    but   the two parhelia remained.            At sour in the after
noon, previously to the setting of the sun, the mock-sun in
the west disappeared,         and afterwards      that in the east.

    I  wrote you from Marseilles, that            I had been disappointed
in my     hopes   of undertaking a vovage round the world with
Captain      Baudin      (to which I had been invited bv the French
Government) just at the moment when I was going down to
the port to embark.           After this I proposed to go out to Bo
naparte with the second expedition from Toulon, and mv
friends were anxiously expecting me; but this expedition
was rendered impossible by the battle of Aboukir.                   Firm to
my purpose, I then wished to go by a Swedish frigate, ex
pected at Marseilles, to Algiers, in order that I might under
take,    with    the caravan       of Mecca,      that dangerous journey
through      the desart of Selima to Cairo.             The frigate, how
ever, did not arrive ; and, after waiting two months to no
purpose in Provence, as war had broken out between France
and Algiers,       I  proceeded     to Spain.     I had procured recom
mendations to the king, and received from him what no fo
reigner ever obtained — letters of recommendation to all the
viceroys, and permission to traverse all the Spanish settlements
with my instruments.
    You     must     acknowledge that        I have been exceedingly for
tunate.       I have     been provided with everv thing necessary,
and in    a few    hours shall sail, in the Spanish frigate Pizarro,
for the Havannah ; from which I intend to proceed to Peru,
Mexico,      and   Chili.     I  sliall be absent for several years,    but
I  flatter myself with the hopes           of accomplisliing something of
importance.

accident, at Lancerotta on the 16th, and St. Croix, in Tene-

               nourishment           by absorption.
     Dr. Van Mons, of      Brussels,  has lately announced the fol
 lowing circumstance: — Having         a patient under his care, who,
 on account of a wound in the throat, was incapable of swal
 lowing any kind of nourishment for several days, he kept him
 alive during that period by applying        to the skin,   in different
 parts   of the body, several times a-day, a        sponge dipped in
 wine or strong soup.       He concludes from this fact, that the
 absorbing vessels of the skin are capable of conveying the fluids
  communicated to them to the interior parts of the body, as
 the latter convey the assimilated nourishment to the blood.
  It  mould be remarked,     however, that from Dr. Rollo's expe
  riments on diabetic patients, it did not appear that water was
  absorbed by the skin   :  but this may have been owing to some
  thing peculiar in the absorbent system of such patients j for
  one of our own navigators (Captain Inglefield or Bligh, we
  do not recollect which,) kept their companions from perish
  ing of thirst, by applying sea- water to the skin.

     At Paris, on the 23d of October last year, at the age of 77,
 Louis James Gouffier, member of several learned societies.
 He was born in 1722, and applied at a very early period to
the study of the mathematics.        His first labours were, to ar
 range and superintend the publication of the memoirs, which
the celebrated Condamine gave to the public in 1751, on the
 measurement of the three first degrees of the meridian in the
 southern hemisphere.        In consequence of the ability which
he displayed by the part he took in this interesting work, he
was invited to co-operate in the Encyclopedic with Diderot
and D'Alembert.          Being charged with the part respecting
the mechanical arts, Gouflier exercised several of them him
self,  that he might be better able to give a description of
them; such as those of watch-making, lock-making, cabinet-
making, turning, &c. His articles display clearness, precision,
and method. About the year 1760, the Baron de Marivet in
vited Gouflier to reside with him, in order that he might im
prove himself in natural philosophy. In 1779 they distributed1
the prospectus of a New Philosophy of the World, which they
proposed to publish conjointly, and which was to make four
teen volumes in quarto ; but it was never carried farther than
the eighth.     Gouflier was fond of travelling on foot, and in
this manner went over all France.          He had a great attach
ment to hydraulics, and was acquainted with every river and
canal in the kingdom.          With the fame Baron Marivet he
published, in 1789, a work, in two volumes octavo, on the
Internal Navigation of France, with an Atlas adapted to the
subject. He invented several curious pieces of mechanism,
among which is a mill with portable arms for sawing planks.
This piece of mechanism was sent to Poland to serve is a
model for the mills destined to manufacture the timber of
the immense      forests  of that country.     He  invented also a
water level,   much used by land surveyors.

o,UR      knowledge respecting the nature and organisation,
mode of life, nourishment and propagation of these shell-fish,
is confined, defective, and uncertain.   They live in a me
dium   which  screens  them from  our  observation; they are
found on coasts which few naturalists frequent, and are so
different from all other animals, that, even from the observa
tions which have been made on them, very little can be con
cluded.         I
             (hall leave it to naturalists to collect, arrange, and
explain these observations, as the following, in my opinion,
v illbe sufficient for the object     have in view bv the present

paper    *.
     Oysters live on the sliores          of   the fca, and particularly such
as    are sandy   or stony; on the coasts of islands, on rocks
which      project into the fca, and on sand-banks; but they,
seem    to thrive best at the mouth                 of   streams,   where the water
of   the latter renders the water              of   the sea milder.     The animal,
slime which           the streams carry along with them, and which
is   accumulated on the sliores, may serve them as food.
     Oysters spawn chiefly in spring, when the sun again begins
to warm the water             of the   sea; and what they then throw out
consists   in       small oysters    completely formed, which              seem   to.

be innumerable.                Each of these young ones expands to a
complete oyster,           in   the fame manner as the seeds or fruits of
those plants which have hermaphrodite bloom.                                   I must here
observe,      that    those    are    mistaken      who     speak   of  male    and semale
oysters ; for how could procreation be posfible                              among ani
mals which             either do not change their place during their
whole lives, or can change it only perhaps for an inch, and
which are capable of no other movement than that of opening
a little their shells ?
     These shells are very often covered with productions of the
coral kind : they are frequently loaded alfo with small mus
cles and multitudes of worms, but only on the convex fide,
which appears to be the upper one, fo that the animal rests
on the flat fide.             It frequently happens that both shells are
quite pierced through, and gnawed by worms, in the fame
 manner        as   old wood.          All   these enemies endeavour               to destroy
 these harmless            animals, and the             case    is the fame         with the
 worms which              are found between                 the fleshy      parts    of their
 body, and in many places                       more abundant than in others*.
 A more formidable enemy for oysters, however, is that eel-
 formed (ish which at Heiligeland is called nugnogen, but
 which by fome has been called the five-fingered fish f. It
 is found fometimes in oyster-shells that are quite close, and
 in which no traces can be discovered of the first inhabitant.
 It lies in the shell bent like a ring, and the fishers unani
 mously assert that it eats the oyster.                          On that account the
     * Befides     these worms,       there are found, on shells which         have not been

English fishermen               strongly recommend destroying it where-
ever it is found.                But how comes thia murderer into the
 shell ? In all probability it creeps in when the animal opens
 its shell, and I thence conclude that the oysters open their
-shells much wider than Reimarus* and others have ima
 gined. Another question          How happens     is,
                                                   that the an                     it
cient ichthyologists,                 though they mention this fifli, do not
observe that          it   was found       in oyster-shells, which at present
is    not uncommon             ?
      Oysters are leanest when they spawn, or after that period,
and on this account fifliing for them at that time forbidden                                is
in England   and other countries where prudent regulations
prevail. In Spain this precaution      employed because            is                                     it
                                                                                                          is
imagined that at this period the use of them as food    inju                                      is
rious to the health.       appears that they ought at least to

be three years old in order to serve as food  and where care              f   ;
is taken for the preservation of the oyster-beds, the fishermen,
are ordered to scrape off all the small ones which adhere to
those that are full grown,                         and to throw them back into the
sea.        An     old oyster has often twenty small                              ones      attached        to
it.     Very        severe     winters injure the oyster-beds and destroy
the oysters,          as was every      where proved during that of the
year 1740.   Violent storms in the spring arc equally preju
dicial, and many beds have been exhausted     fishing up too                      by
many from them.                      We         are told      by     Paulus Jovius          J,     that he
remembered         time when oysters were brought from the
                        the
coast of Pesaro to Rome   but that these beds were afterwards
                                           ;
entirely exhausted, and that people were obliged to be satis
fied with oysters brought from Corsica, which, before they

  +    It   is   generally believed that the shells of muscles receive                      yearly   a    new-
coat, and from the number                  of   these   their age may be determined,                   as the

     It is             truth, that the nature of the shell and
             an undoubted
fish, as well as the goodness of these animals, are different
according to the bottom where they are found ; so that sisher-
iVfcn can tell by their external appearance, and connoisseurs
 by the taste, where any kind of oyster, and in general of
shell-fisli, have been found.                      Where      the bottom is calcare
ous, they arc tenderer and more friable ; where it consists of
rock, they are thicker, more solid, and heavier ; where it
consists of marl, or a mixture of chalk and clay, they are less
earthy, softer, and contain more animal gluten. On a slimy
bottom thev are more oily, and abound more with rich ani
mal particles. The taste is equally liable to change: for
example; on the eastern stony shore of the Adriatic Sea all
marine animals arc poorer and more insipid than those on
the western side, where the bottom is richer.                          On   calcareous
rocks the oysters arc larger, but have not so good a taste as
those which live in flimy bays or creeks.   In Norway those
arc least esteemed which are found on a muddy bottom, be
cause they have a muddy taste:                        those   of Denmark, found       on
a sandy      bottom near Tondern and Fladstrand, are much bet
ter.       The best are the so called rock-oysters, found on the
rocks where they arc alternately covered' and left dry by
the tide, though in England those found at the greatest depth
in     the   sea    are preferred.             The rock-oysters       are larger aud
plumper than others, but their shells much thinner, and
many of them so thin that thev are as transparent as horn.
For this reason, a cask such as those used at Bergen will
contain scarcely 4.C0, or even 300, sand-ovsters, but is ca
pable of containing from 700 to 800 rock-oysters.
    The oyster fishery is exceedingly simple, and requires very-
little apparatus; manv collect the oysters with their hand,
 that      is,    where      the    sea     retires   andbottom dry.

Olhers, instead of this boxj have      a  net made of strong leather
thongs, kept open by means           of  a heavy square  iron frame,
whichj by being       dragged on the bottom, rakes up the oysters
and suffers them to be received into the net.         Others have a
rake    with about twenty strong iron crooked and blunt spikes
eight or ten inches in length, which is fastened to a long
thin elastic pole. The fishermen, who are in a boat, draw
 this rake over the bottom in the fame manner as the befere-
jnentioned net, and thus raise the oysters, which are retained
 by   a board fastened over the rake, so that they can be drawn
 up with it.     The pole must be sufficiently pliable to yield
 when drawn with force over the inequalities of the bottom.
  In places where the fishermen employ more care in collect
 ing the oysters in order to spare the banks, they pull up, by
 means of wooden tongs, when the water is clear, only the
 largest oysters, and suffer the rest to remain undisturbed till
  they grow to the proper size.      There may, however, be other
  means employed for catching oysters with which I am not
  acquainted ; and it would be a useful labour if any person
  would give a complete treatise on the oyster fishery, with
  engravings of all the apparatus and instruments.           This, as
  far  as I know, no     one  has ever yet done.      Duhamel    pro
  mised to treat   of this subject in his large work on Fishing,
  but he died before it was completed.
     Those oysters which are distinguished        by a green colour,
  and which the Dutch on that account call groenbaardjes,
  are considered to be superior to others.      But, this distin6tion
  is not natural to them, and is produced by art. For this
   purpose pits are dug on the fea-sliore, and furnished with
   small sluices, through which the sea-water is suffered to enter
   at the time  of the spring-tides.    When   the water has risen to
   a certain height the oysters are thrown       into the pits, where
   they are left till they acquire the proper colour.       This stag
   nant water, in warm weather, soon becomes green, and in a
   few days the oysters assume the fame colour ; but they do not
   acquire their full quality, and become fit for sale, till the end
   of six or eight weeks.     I am inclined to think that this co
   lour is occasioned by certain plants which grow in the water,
   perhaps an uha, conferva, or trevnlla.         This was the opi
                                                                  nion

 a name which, according to Hudson's Flora Anglica, is a
 Conferva rivularis.              I must here remark also, that the Uha
 iatijjima of Linnæus, which by Gmelin in his Hijloriafu-
 corum is called Fucus tremella la£tuca, is by the English
 called the oyster-green. The objections which some English
 writers have made to this opinion seem to me to be of little
weight.          They assert, that when, in the neighbourhood of a
greening -pit, another is formed at the distance of about a foot,
the water never becomes green in the latter; and that pits
which have been a certain time green, and have communi
cated that colour to oysters, sometimes lose their colour. But
all this, even         if true, might, on more accurate observation,
be explained          from the vegetation of these plants.
    In Europe the English oysters are accounted the best; and
these, as the French believe, have been produced from oys
ters formerly fished up in Concalle Bay, near St.                  Malo,   and
transplanted          to the     English    coast :  but of this assertion we
have no        proofs.        Those, however, are most esteemed which
are found on the coast of Essex : from that coast the brood is
transplanted          to   the   sea  near Colchester, where the Coin,
which flows through               the city,   forms a great many arms and
small creeks exceedingly proper for breeding them.                   A great
many       of   these    oyster-pits    arc   found   at the village of   Kow
Hedge, in the parisli of East Doniland ; and the sale of oys
ters forms a considerable branch of trade to the whole neigh
bourhood         %.     Aster the month of May, however, no seed
mull      be taken        from the banks, because it is known, from
experience,         that in that cafe muscles and cockles would breed
there and destroy the oysters.                People   who infringe on this
regulation are severely punished by the Admiralty Court,
which has all the oyster banks under its inspection. All these
oysters are in high request, under the name of Colchester oys
ters.      The best come from lY.rflcet; they are exceedingly

plump,      and the sliells are thin and almost transparent.                 The
best kind, however, even at Colchester, are so dear that a peck
costs five or fix shillings ; and as the London fishmongers buy
almost all their oysters from the fishermen or dredgers imme
diately after they are caught, they all, of course, pass through
their hands. But they are accused of mixing fresh with stale oy s-
ters,andofsellingthose of the western coastforColchesteroysters.
    Many, however, prefer those oysters which are collected
on the coast of Dorsetshire, and particularly those found near
Pool. They are said also to contain sometimes pearls of larger
fize than those found in other places.                     The greater part of
the English oysters, which the Dutch carry away every year
with more than           a hundred vessels,        are fold by the fisliermen
at Feversham, a small town                  in Kent,     to the  north-west of
 Canterbury,        and    which, like       the neighbouring      small towns
of Milton       and Middleton,          is known on account       of this  trade.
There      are a great        many oyster banks also in the Isle of
 Wight : those, likewise, are well known which are found
 near Tenby on the coast of South Wales, and near Milford-
 Haven : but the largest, and perhaps the worst, are those of
 Blackrock, near Liverpool.
     It appears that the English have taken                 more trouble than
 other nations, not only to maintain their oyster banks, but to
 form new ones.            Since the year 171 2, a great many oysters
 have been found in the small channel of Mencu or Menai
 which separates Anglesey from Caernarvonsliire, and where
 about the year 1700 none were to be seen. It is known,
 however, that soon after that period some person threw into
 the above channel about a hundred oysters, which have now
 extended several miles, so that at preient a great many vessels
 are employed         in this fisliery *. It would appear that the waves
 carry the feed        along with them, as it is known that on the
  coast of Holstein         the banks        are destroyed by violent storms
  about the time the oysters spawn.

  X HE       Geographical Ephemerides of M. Von Zach, which
appear every month, have continued to establish a valuable
 correspondence     between the astronomers of Germany and.
those of the rest of Europe ; but this work seems to have
done more by procuring to astronomers new amateurs and
new assistants in regard to observations and calculations ; such
as Colonel    Le Coq, of Minden, in Prussia; M. Felgenhauer,
at Reichenback, near Schweidnitz, where he has established
an observatory furnished with excellent instruments; M.Ber-
hrnauer, at Budiffin or Bautzen, in Lusatia; M. Grillo, at
Wettin, in the duchy of Magdebourg; and M. Gauss, at
Brunswick,     a young man who stiews great taste and zeal for
astronomy, and who has made useful calculations.
   In Russia, two officers of the navy have been sent to de
termine the position of various points on the White and
Frozen Seas.        The President of the Academy, Baron de
Nicolay,    a German     from Strasburgh, and   a poet,   seems to
be interested  in this undertaking.
   The beautiful instruments of Megnic, among which arc
an azimuth quadrant, have been purchased by C. Lubbert,
of Hamburgh; and he has given me some hopes that he
will establish an observatory, where they may be rendered
useful.    The Senate of Hamburgh having resolved to cause
a correct map of its territory to be made, M. Homer has set
out from Gotha, where he laboured in the observatory,           and
has gone to Hamburgh.
   The Duke of Gotha         has purchased  new instruments for
his beautiful observatory, and M. Von Zach continues the
printing of a valuable work, in two volumes quarto, on the
Stars ; which will soon appear.
   In   the  Batavian Republic, C. Calkocn      has gone to take
possession  of  the  observatory of Leyden, and has left that of
Amsterdam to C. Keyscr; but we have received no observa
tions except from C. Dutenhove at Utrecht.         The  last  men-

Letters of Lambert, translated by C. Darquier.
    A  grand     telescope      of   25 feet has been constructed        by Dr.
Herschel for Spain; it cost 175,000 francs, (above 7000/.
sterling); but there is no observatory at Madrid; that of
Buen-retiro is not yet finished.             The minister Florida Blanca
had much at heart a museum and observatory,                         but the ar
chitect finislied neither of them.              When      the war broke out,
the minister was dismissed,              and astronomy       in Spain    has re
mained    in its former        state  of torpor.    There is   so little money
in that country, that it            is difficult   to find enough to defray
the smallest expences.             But the minister Durquijo seems to
be much disposed in favour             of astronomy, and, in the mean
time, has enabled          M.     Chaix to make useful observations.
1  have thanked him           in the name of Astronomy,              and he re
turned such an answer as increases my hopes.
    M. Chaix      has been charged           in Spain with a labour on
measures    ;  and we have sent him from Paris an account of
what was done by Borda, Mechain, and Caflini, in regard to
the measure of the pendulum, which in 1792 was found to
be 36 inches 8 lines 60 at io°, which is the mean heat at
Paris.    This    supposes the pendulum in vacuo reduced to very
small arcs.       We learn from           the Journal of Jena, that the
first volume     of the Memoirs of the Academy of Lisbon was
published     in  1797; it begins at 1780.              It contains observa
tions made at Lisbon by M. Custodio Gomes de Villas-
boas,   and    M. Ciera     ;    by   M. Ccruti     at Carthagena,       and   by
M. Dorta      and Barbosa        at  Rio-Janeiro; meteorological obser
vations made at        Rio-Janeiro; observations of the satellites,
made at Mafra        ;  an cloge of d'Alembcrt,             by M. Stockier;
but this eloge has excited persecution               against the author in a
country where        the anti-philosophic           tribunal still calls itself
the Holy Inquisition.
    An able artist at Florence, named Gori, has divided, with
great   ingenuity, a quadrant belonging to the observatory of
P. Ximcnez, occupied by the Scolopies, and which had ori
ginally been very ill divided. We may hope, therefore, for
some observations        from Tuscany.

 tention. M. Cassella sent me several observations of eclipses,
 which I have calculated ; and I have found the distance of
 Naples from the meridian of Paris, by the mean of seven
 results, to be 47' 49".
     The labours of M. Piazzi, of Palermo,           must  have   been
 interrupted this year by calamity and misfortunes;               for I
have received no letter from the beautiful observatory and
 the able astronomer of Palermo.
     A   Roman    citizen has come to reinforce astronomy in
 France.     C.  Ciccolini    requested leave to lodge in the Col
lege de France, in order to observe and make calculations
along with us. He has displayed in this situation as much
zeal as ability ; and we are indebted to him for the calcu
lation of eclipses of the fun observed in this century, of
 which there had before been no results.            He has assisted us
also to calculate a part      of our immense collection of stars.
     I announced last year that Caflini seemed disposed to tread
in the steps of his ancestors.          His father, who quitted the
observatory at the fatal period of 1793, has announced his
intention of residing at Paris ; and the Institute has elected
him a second time to a place in the department of astronomy,
vacant by the death of C. Lemonnier.
     C. Sorlin  has joined us,     and is calculating the longitudes,
latitudes, and angles of position of six hundred stars, which
form the fundamental catalogue of the principal stars which
C. Le Francais is publishing in the Connoijsance des Terns,
and    which he has for several years      been   bringing to perfec
tion.     C. Sorlin has calculated also     a  new table of the sphe
roidal degrees according to the dimensions we have adopted.
     C. Mougin has calculated the processions of the ijoo
stars   in the   Conn6ifsan.ee   des Terns for the year 7, in cen-
tiemes and seconds;        and he is calculating for 1800 and 1900
the processions of the 600 stars of the fundamental catalogue.
     C. Bernier of Montauban has sent us calculations of ob
servations   of Mercury     aud Venus     made   by C. Duc-la-Cha-

     Several dissertations   have appeared    in the public journals
on the question, whether the year 1800 begins the nineteenth

like every thing else, from one to a hundred, and therefore
it is 1 801 that must begin the new century. The only thing
that could occasion this error                           is,
                                    the transition from 17 to
18 hundreds.                It   has appeared            to many people          that this    is
changing the century.
  C. Taillardat has published small work entitled Horloge

which C. Leveque                   has made to the Institute on this subject
displays    great erudition, and contains important reflections.
   C.     Leveque has published also, in the Connoijsance det
Terns     for the year 10,  interesting memoir on the use
                                              an

illustrated    with figures.          All   the frictions, both    of the   escape
ments and the parts of the machine, are performed on rubies
either plain or pierced ; and this essential improvement,
which       renders     the use      of oil   unnecessary,    had never before
been carried         to the same degree         of perfection.
     These able artists improved themselves                   by   a residence      of
several years at Paris with Ferd. and Louis Berthoud : they
afterwards united their talents at Geneva, to the great ad
vantage       of   an art in which            they   have so eminently distin
guished themselves.  C. Magnin is now travelling through
Spain, to which he has carried a time-keeper like that above
described.  They make also portable chronometers, with an
escapement independent and a compensation balance, which
go exceedingly well.
   The art of piercing rubies, formerly carried from Geneva
to England by Fatio, was a secret lost to the country in which
it was invented.            These artists       have again naturalised        it,   for
they cut and pierced themselves all the rubies they employed.
   C. Louis Berthoud has also brought workman to Paris,   a
and he will do the fame thing in future in regard to the
chronometers with which he will enrich the navy.    The
minister has entrusted me with one,                    the exactness      of which
is   of   the utmost value for the             correspondence      of   the five ob
servatories        of Paris.
  I       hoped that my aerial voyage,               on the 25th   of July    1790,
would have procured me some knowledge respecting the scin
tillation of the (tars and the nature of the atmosphere    but                ;
I  was deceived          by
                     the person to whom   gave my contidence,

and for whom            I   braved the public opinion.           I      was not able
to ascend to        a   sufficient    height, but this atmospheric prome
nade       enabled      me to make         tome useful remarks 011 aerial
 currents.    On setting out from Tivoli the air appeared to me
 perfectly calm, and there did not seem to be the least wind,
 yet I perceived that the balloon advanced towards the east.                         I

rose to the height         of 250 toises, and advanced at the rate of
six leagues per hour.             The direction of the clouds, which I
bad     examined before I set out, was, on the contrary, towards
the weft      :   thus  I experienced,    that when a local cause impels
die lower part of the atmosphere towards the west, that above
takes its. place, and proceeds towards the east.                  Of the two
balloons which I sent off before me for the fake of trial, one
rpse to the height of
                                300 toises, and directed its course to
 wards Monfort ; the other rose to about the height of 600
 toises, and proceeded towards Rambouillet, which made fix
 degrees     of   difference.     Thus, in 300      toises the wind changed
 six degrees.         By  rising, therefore,   more or less, we shall one
 day be able to vary our direction.                   The inclined planes of
 C. Tetu Breffi, at Bellevue, afford us the means of varying
 these directions much more ; and               I hope that    a proof  of it
 will    be seen next summer.
      A   large balloon     of nine   feet, which was let off next morn
  ing, rose much higher,           and fell at Coucy,       23 leagues to the
  north-cast of Paris, having proceeded                 at the rate of eight
  leagues per hour.           It directed itself towards      Maestricht and
  Ruremonde,          while the clouds were proceeding in the direc
  tion     of Joinville      and Constance towards the south-west.
  Between the two directions one might have chosen for every
  part of Germany. Thus, the project which I had announced
  of going        to Gotha was not chimerical, as asserted ; nothing
  ivould have been necessary but to choose the height. The
   velocity of eight leagues per hour was indicated also by the
   excursion      of Garnerin on     the 28th of Thermidor, year 6, who
   went from         Rosnj    to Chalons in four hours.          Twenty-four
   hours, therefore, would have been sufficient to go to Gotha,
   which was the term of my desires and my hopes.
       My aerostatic globe turned six times, which shewed, that
   in a current of air of twenty feet in height, there is a sensible
   difference      of force and velocity; but probably by rising much
   higher,      I should have found more regularity.
       I  saw also, by the agitation        of my barometer, that the     sta
   bility of the       boat was not sufficiently constant to enable me
    to observe it with my glasses; but at a greater height I should,
   without doubt, have found more stability: besides, as on

 obviate the inconvenience of motion.
    There have been periods when an astronomer would have
 been glad to rife above the clouds.            Le Gentil went to India
in   1760 to observe the transit of Venus: by the war he was
deprived    of an opportunity of observing that of 1761 ; he was
obliged, therefore, to wait for that of 1769 ; but he was again
disappointed     by clouds.      He   had travelled then ten thousand
leagues,    and employed ten         years   for an observation     which
 he did not make.         If he   had  been    in possession  of  an aero
static   globe, this long voyage would not have been lost to
astronomy ; and, as astronomers, we have reason to congra
tulate ourselves on the noble discovery of Montgolfier.
    The frost, during winter, afforded an opportunity also for
meteorological experiments.            C. Fourcroy repeated that of
the congelation of mercury : at 30 degrees it began to lose
its fluidity, and at 33 became solid.
    It now remains for me to speak of the             losses which astro
nomy has sustained this year.         The first, and most remarkable,
is the death of John Charles de Borda, on the 19th of Fe
bruary 1799. He was born at Dax on the 4th of May 1733.
He was first in the light horse, and afterwards in the engi
neers.    In 1769 M. De Roquefeuil induced him to enter into
the navy, where his mathematical knowledge might render
him of more utility.         In  1754 he was received into the Aca
demy of Sciences, where           he was always considered as one of
the first geometers.          In 177 1 he undertook a voyage to
America, in the Flora, with Verdun and Pingre.                    The re
sults appeared in 1778 in two volumes quarto, the greater
part   of which     were due to his labours.         In 1774 he under
took a voyage        to the    Azores,    the  Cape Verd istands, and
the coast of Africa.          The manuscript exists, and contains
many observations,         which render the publication of it de
sirable.    I  do not speak     of his  learned    researches on the re
sistance   of fluids, which are in      the memoirs of the Academv
for 1763 and 1767, since I have nothing to recall here but
what he has done for astronomy and the marine.                         But

in the American        war with d'Estaing in 1777 and 1778, his
health was impaired, but he still employed himself in useful
labours.      In 1778 he introduced into astronomy and the
navy multiplying circles, invented by Tobias Mayer, of the
importance of which no one had before been sensible.             He
brought them to perfection, and by these means rendered an
essential service to astronomy and navigation.
     In  179a he invented instruments and methods for observ
ing    the length of the pendulum, with a precision before un
known ; and metallic rules for measuring bases, intended to
give the real length of the meridian.            These instruments
were of great utility for that great and important labour. As
refractions were necessary in this labour, he made experi
ments and theoretical researches worthy of a great geome
 trician.     They are preserved among his papers, and a large
 memoir by him is ready to be printed.
     He caused to be calculated at his house,       and at his own
 expence, the logarithms of the decimal parts of the circle,
 according to the new division into 400 parts ; and defrayed
 the expences also of printing.        The publication of it is im
 patiently expected.
     I have published in my Abridgement of Navigation his
 new method for gauging vessels, together with the tables.
 He was inspector of the dock-yards : in this situation he was
 useful,    and Government      had the greatest confidence in hi*
 talents.
      C. Lemonnier died at his feat at Herils, near Bayeux, on
 the 2d of April.      He had been lost to us ever since the 10th
 of November 1791 : three years ago I gave an account of his
 useful    labours, but the last epoch of this memorable life
 ought to be consecrated in the present history.         I wished to
  insert in the first volume of the Histoire Celeste, now printing,
  a part of the observations of my illustrious master : nothing
 would have been so desirable as to render this testimony to
  his memory, which would have been at the fame time a tes
  timony     of my gratitude; but    I  was not allowed, notwith
  standing my zeal and entreaties, to have any communication
  with his manuscripts : I do not know what will become of
  them in hands foreign to astronomy, and which seem as in
                                                            different

 different for the glory of a father as for the sciences,     which
 he cultivated for sixty vears with so much success.
    Joseph Liesganig, formerly a Jesuit at Vienna, died at
Lamberg,       in Austrian Poland or Galicia, on the 4th of
March 1799, at the age of 81. We are indebted to him
for the measurement of degrees in Hungary and Austria in
 1769.     He   came   to fee   me when  I  passed through Venice
in   1765,   and  I then admired his talents and zeal.
    On   the   24th of February we lost Professor Lichtenberg,
at Gottingen, to whom we were indebted for the posthumous
works of Mayer in 1775.
    M. Strnadt, (we pronounce Strenat,) the astronomer of
Prague, long known by many useful observations, died on
the 34th of September. Bernoulli, when he gave an account
in 1776, in the first volume of his Nouvelles Litteraires, of
the memoirs printed at Prague, announced that there were
among them memoirs of M. Stepling, who was director,
and, in some measure, founder of the observatorv, and of
M.    Strnadt, who was his assistant.    Since that time he never
ceased to observe,      as may be seen    in  the Ephcmerides     of
Berlin,    and in other works.     M. David, his   assistant in the
observatorv,     has succeeded him as director.
   We    have learned     also from Sweden,    the death   of I. H.
Lindquist, Professor of Mathematics at Abo in Finland,
who has published, in the Transactions of the Academy of
Stockholm, many interesting memoirs.
   On the 17th of November 1798, we lost a valuable ama
teur of astronomy, the bishop of Transylvania, Count de
Batthiani, who establissicd an observatory at Carlsbourg, to
which     he has bequeathed 30,000 florins and a beautiful li
brary.     He was born on the 30th of January 1741, and was
made bishop on the 25th of January 1781.
   The    bishop   of Erlang (Agria)  Count Charles Esierhazi,

    By Mr.     David Mush et, of               the   Clyde Iron-lVbrks.
    Communicated       by the   Author.
                          [Concluded from Page 70.]
I   HAVE      explained the necessity of just proportions existing
betwixt the area of the interior of the blast-furnace, the
quantity of air thrown in per minute, and the quality of
coal. The various modes of blowing, and their respective
effects, deduced from strict observation,         were also attended to.
We     have   now, 3d, to adduce examples            where the various
changes    of the atmosphere,       as to heat and pressure,    occasion
the most sensible difference       in the quantity of materials con
sumed, and in the quality and quantity            of metal produced.
   It  has been      already demonstrated,       that the air in winter,
by containing      less  moisture,   is  more   proper for combustion,
and more calculated to produce carbonated crude iron, than
the air existing at any other season. From this superior
quality the manufacturer obtains advantages, which induce
him    to wish for a continuance          of cool air throughout the
whole year.       These effects are not, however, uniform ; they
depend greatly upon a light or heavy atmosphere.                     The
keener and more still the air, the more rapid the combus
tion.    During     a severe frost, the descent     of  the  materials is
facilitated from     -rV to T'T more than in rainy or hazy wea
ther, and at the fame time the quality of the iron is rather
improved than impaired. When a change from frost to snow
or rain takes place, the effects frequently become almost im
mediately obvious        :  the colour  of  the flame    at the furnace-
head is changed;        the tuyre of the furnace inflames, and burns
with great violence ; the lava, as it flows from the notch of
the dam-stone, becomes lengthened and tenacious $ the form
of it is changed, and the colour undergoes the most visible
alterations;    the iron no longer retains its complete        saturation
of carbon, but flows out           sensibly   impaired of its fluidity,
and, when cold, the privation of carbon is most evident by
^ie examination of its fracture.

    When such consequences        arise from the     transition so fre
 quent in winter from frost        to thaw,    it will be easily con
 ceived   that the    change effected      during the milder and
 warmer months mud produce proportionally additional ef
 fects.   The increase of temperature by taking up, and hold
 ing in solution, a much greater portion of aqueous vapour,
 will account for the ordinary effects which arc annually ob
 servable in every work.      Where    these pernicious consequences
 approach to extremity, a solution of the phenomenon will
 likely be obtained by the examination of the blowing-appa
 ratus. If air is fitted for combustion in proportion as it is
 free from watery solutions,      we are not to expect similar re
 sults from these blast-furnaces in summer,        which    are blown
 by air from the regulating cylinder, and those blown by air
 from a water or air-vault.       I have for years seen this fact
 verified, and superior quantity and quality of iron during the
 hot weather, obtained from a furnace excited by means of
blast, from the simple regulating cylinder, with a leis pro
portion of fuel than from furnaces whose air was expressed
 by means of the water or air-vault. Observations thus made,
 where every day the effects of the different means could be
justly estimated and compared, have led me to the following
 conclusion: That the quality of the air, as furnished us by
 nature in our atmosphere, is uniformly more sit for the ma
 nufacture of crude iron to profitable account, when discharged
 simply by means of cylinders and pistons, than when brought
 into contact with moisture either in the water-vault or air-
 vault.
    So imperfect has the quality of the summer air been found
 in this country for combustion, where the water-vault was
 used, that    experiments have been made to repair the defi
 ciency of effect  by introducing steam into the furnace by means
 of an aperture   above the tuyre. The inducing motive lo this
 act, was   a belief, that combustion was diminished in conse
 quence of a diminution of oxygen gas dining the summer;
 that, by introducing water upon a surface of materials ignited
 to whiteness, decomposition would ensue, a larger quantity of
 oxygen would then        be presented     to the  fuel, and superior
 effects, as  to combustion, obtained in this manner than hi
                                                                therto

 therto wtnessed.         The idea was ingenious, and, in its appli
  cation to the manufacture of cast iron, original ; but the
  whole train of facts, laid down in this and former papers, as
  to the effects     of a superabundant quantity of oxygen, was
  overlooked. The event proved in the most complete manner,
  and on a great scale, the pernicious effects of moisture.              The
  furnace gradually became         cooled      where the steam entered ;
  the heat, set free by the decomposition            of the water and the
 disengagement        of oxygen, increased to an alarming ^.tch a
 considerable      way up the furnace; the quality of the iron be
 came brittle, and as white in the fracture as silver; the in
 troduction of the steam was still continued, the descending
 materials were instantly robbed of their heat to facilitate the
 decomposition of the water, and by-and-by the furnace closed
 tntirely over, and the experiment            ceased  *.
     This experiment, performed in            a furnace   18 feet  high, is a
 complete proof that heat is disengaged from bodies while they
 pass from the fluid to the aeriform state.              The first instant of
 the discharge of steam, a very considerable portion of heat
 would be withdrawn from the fusing materials and united to
 the water.       This, in its turn, would be ignited to whiteness,
 and decomposed         upon the metals and cokes,         in a superior   re
 gion of the furnace. The process continuing for several hour?,
 the materials at the tuyre were at last so completely deprived
 of the caloric by the continual torrent of steam, that they lost
 fluidity, cooled rapidly, and at last became black.                Had an
other aperture for steam and for air been opened above these,
now entirely stiut up by the consolidated materials, the fame
effects would have been produced ; the immense quantity ot
caloric, disengaged by the decomposition of the ignited water,
would now approach nearer to the top of the furnace, an
other stratum of fusing materials would again become con
solidated, till in the end the whole furnace would be set fast
from top to bottom.          From the introduction of steam into
the blast-furnace, either as such, or under a superior degree

1   16            On the various Ejsetfs produced     ly
of    expansive   force,   the following    important truths may he
learned   :   That   the quantity   of oxygen which   enters into our
atmospheric    compound is generally more fit for the manu
facture of the superior qualities of crude iron than any mix
ture which may be furnished by the addition of water: that,
although the decomposition of water, by furnishing a superior
quantity of oxygen, and by throwing off a relative proportion
of caloric, increases the effects of combustion immediately in
the vicinity of this chemical analysis ; yet, as the water had
previously abstracted the heat necessary to its decomposition
from the inferior strata, a greater quantity by no means exists
in    the furnace.     The water, in fact, only   serves   as a   medium
to convey the heat from one particular spot, but, by attempt
ing to    fly
          off with         it,
                       meets decomposition, and renders up
not only the abstracted heat, but that which was contained
in the oxygen of its decomposition.
   4th, The compression and velocity of the air discharged
into the furnace, considerably affect the results of the smelt
ing operations.   In the consideration of this subject, the va
rious qualities of coals will be found to have an intimate
connection with the area of the discharging-pipe and the
compression   of the blast.     has already been more than

susceptible   of combustion    than  either the splint or clod-coal     :
the consequence of this          is,
                                  that, unless the necessary com
pression   of  air    is
                      used,   decomposition      too early accom
                                                 is
plished, and the cokes become oxygenated bv combustion in
a greater ratio than      proper for the carbonation of the me
                            is
tal. To avoid this, the column of air ought to be discharged,
in the case of soft coals being unavoidably used, under such            a
degree of compression, as to resist entire decomposition in the
ignited passage.     In that caser the iron docs not        immedi
                                                             so
ately come into contact with oxygen, as the decomposition
is chiefly effected in the superior strata of the separating ma
terials. Under the former circumstance, of      loose uncon
                                                      a
nected stream of air being thrown upon cokes easily com
bustible, the quality of the metal, with the fame quantity of
    fuel, becomes oxygenated, the tuyre becomes fiery, and fre
    quently emits sparks of metallic oxyd. The separating iron
                                                                       may

may be viewed                 from the ore in small globular
                            as it oozes
masses, frequently on fire, changing its state to that of an
oxyd. The combination of oxygen, by altering its density,
makes it subject to the re-action of the blast, which at times
gives it a direction from the tuyre with considerable                          violence.
Those parts of the iron (by far the greatest) thus oxydated,
which escape not at the tuyre, mix along with the fused
earths of the ores and limestone, alter their colour, and flow'
from the furnace more unrevived than at their first intro
duction.    It        is,
                  however, very different, even with this in
ferior quality of coal, where the density of the blast   pro                     is
portioned to the inflammability of the fuel. Qualities and
quantities of crude iron may be produced from this, equal
to those from coals reckoned of    superior nature.  The

                             as
ciple    as     that made from clod or splint coal.    The tuyre
evinces        that decomposition    effected in its proper place.

The fluid        masses       of iron,      as they become   expressed from
the     ore,    are   shivered         into spray, before the dense column
of air, without exhibiting the least symptom of decompo
sition. They again unite under the level of the blast, in
crease in size, and sink through the fluid stratum of earths to
the bottom of the furnace.     This fact holds out one of the
strongest proofs  of the great  affinity which carbon and iron
mutually possess towards each other.     In the cafe of the iron
separating in an oxygenated state destitute of carbon,   imme                  it
diately falls  prey to its affinity for oxygen.

it further proves, that the affinity of oxygen       greater to          is
carbon than to iron                ;   and    that, before         iron becomes         oxy
dated, all the carbon              is   taken up.

   1 18    On the Effects     of Air  used in the Blajl-Furnace.
  effects are produced      with   the clod coal, but in a more emi
  nent degree.      Discharging- pipes are used four inches in the
  diameter, and the compression only equal to two pounds on
  the square inch ; yet the same fatal effects are not known as
  in the use of soft coal, which, with such a column of air,
 would require the pressure to be equal to 3 \ pounds upon the
 square inch at least.
      5th, Upon the form and construction of the discharging-
 pipc effects of more considerable importance depend than is
 either generally allowed or even conceived. At some iron
 works, no peculiar shape is adopted : if the tube is sufficient
 to convey the air, and the mouth of it nearly of the size
 wanted, the interior construction is entirely overlooked. This
 indifference, however, is by no means general : variously
 constructed pipes are used at different works, and at some
 places it is preferred to throw in the air from two pipes
 whose areas arc only equal to one         of the usual size.
     The various shapes may, in point of the principle of their
 construction, be reduced to three. (See Plate V. Fig. 1,2,3.)
     To  understand    properly the objectionable parts of the con
 struction of nose-pipes, it must be recollected, that much
 has been said lo depend upon the blast reaching the opposite
 extremity of the furnace, as little impaired of the compactness
 and velocity of its original discharge as possible.           When it
is otherwise, the results in the internal operations of the fur
nace must be consequently altered.              If the compression is
diministied    { or T when       it  reaches   the opposite   wall,   de
 composition     in  that  portion    must   be effected before the air
has attained     its elevated situation in the furnace.       It  is even
possible to disperse the whole column         of air in such a manner
that the ignited materials of the opposite fide may receive
little of its effects to promote combustion.
     The discharging-pipe Fig. 1. is frequently used : its length
is 12 inches or more; the discharging aperture 3 inches, the
other end 5 inches ; but this is arbitrary, depending upon
the size of the adjoining pipe. From a pipe thus constructed,
the air disperses or diverges too suddenly; and at a small dis
tance from the orifice, a considerable portion of it answers
but imperfectly       the  purposes    of combustion.      Part of it is
speedily decomposed,       and the oxygen brought into immediate
                            J                                    contact

contact with the iron.          The quantity of metal is      reduced by
the former, and the quality injured by the latter. Though
long custom, by a continued use of such shaped pipes, has
prevented    their pernicious effects from being observed, yet
they must prove in many cases detrimental to the œconomi-
cal distribution of air, and the manufacture of iron.
    Fig. 2. represents a nose-pipe,        of another construction,  even
more exceptionable       ;   because the air dispersing still more sud
denly, in   a degree somewhat         proportionate to the more sud
den   contraction     of   the pipe,     a considerable   quantity never
enters the furnace, but, striking on the exterior wall, is thence
repelled.
    A discharging-pipe       constructed    as in Fig. 3. would obviate,
in a great measure, the imperfections of the two former : the
length of the tapered piece is 12 inches, of the straight pipe,
6 inches ; extreme diameter as in the others, 5 inches ; dia
meter of straight pipe, 3 inches. From such a pipe it is con
 ceived that the blast will proceed to the greatest possible dis
 tance unimpaired in compression and velocity. So far, there
 fore, as the absolute force of the blast and breadth of the fur
nace will permit, decomposition will be prevented on the level
 of the pipe, and the manufacturer freed" from the evils which
 I have above detailed, as attendant upon decomposition in
that quarter.

  120                 On the Cure os Asseilions which
    IN   the year 1794 I published a small pamphlet* contain
 ing  an   account of the efficacy of mercury in removing the
 effects of the poison of lead on the constitution of those em
ployed in working with that metal. As the practice then re
commended seems to me to have engaged less attention than
its importance merits,        I wish here to recapitulate, as briefly
 as possible,    the facts then stated, and to add such further
observations      as my subsequent      experience   has suggested rela
tive to the subject.
    I hardly need state to you the great number of persons
who, in the course of their occupations, are employed about
this poisonous      mineral ; nor how large a proportion of these
suffer the agony of colic, followed, in many cases, by the loss
of  the use    of their limbs, disqualifying them, in a short time,
from earning their subsistence.           The white-lead manufacto
ries,   the   work-shops    of   the  plumber, the glazier, and the
painter, afford too many proofs of the truth of this. The
frequent inefficacy of the ordinary methods of treatment in
those cases is well known.            The suggestion, therefore, of a
mode of relief more powerful than these, and, in recent
cases, almost certain, must be allowed to be a thing of no
inconsiderable moment.            Such   a remedy, I venture to fay,
will   be found in mercury.          At   the time of publishing my
former remarks on the subject, I had tried its powers in eight
instances only, in all of which it afforded the most strik
ing relief. The truth of this, I sliould observe, did not then
rest on my own testimony alone, but was confirmed by that
of the Physicians of the Dispensary, my colleagues at the time.
The trials which I have since made and witnessed, though not
invariably attended with success, have afforded ample proof
ot' the powers of the remedy in question, which Dr. Bradley,
now Physician to the Westminster Hospital, did not hesitate,
in his letter to me on the subject, to call           & specific  in   those
disorders.

 arms       shoulders ; head-ach ; cramps of the legs, and
           and
 oftentimes severe fits of the gout in the extremities; palsied
 state    of   muscles       of the arms         and hands, taking away all power
 of grasping any thing,                   and even        of lifting      the tiand     to the
 mouth ; and, not unfrequently, epileptic convulsions.
  The remedies commonly employed for the relief of these
dreadful symptoms are, purgatives of different kinds, espe
cially cafior oil; volatile and stimulating medicines of various
forts ;  and the warm bath, particularly the Bath waters.
These often are of signal service ; but they are, likewise, often
inadequate to afford relief, and the unhappy sufferer drags on
a miserable          existence.           In a     large proportion         of   these cises,
I    think     I   am warranted             in     saying,     mercury      is an   effectual
remedy.
    Calomel (a mercurial preparation) has been long in use for
the relief of the colic and constipation produced by lead; but
it is as a purgative only that it has been employed, without
regard to its effects on the constitution generally.                              The object
I    have here in view              is,   to employ mercury in such                 a   way as
to produce  the ordinary effects of this mineral on the general
habit, characterised    soreness of the mouth, and tendency
                                    by
to salivation.     does not seem very material in what way,
                         It
or with   what particular preparation, of mercury, this                                      is
brought about; as     have employed
                               I        in the form of oint    it,
ment, externally to the affected parts, and inwardly in va
rious preparations, without observing any material difference
in the effects.              For    the relief      of colic      and obstruction       of the
bowels, calomel               is,   perhaps,       the best and most commodious
form; given             in   the quantity
                                  grain daily,   of
                                                 rarely fails,

ever, that the system, in the cases which have been described,
is  peculiarly susceptible of the irritation of mercury in all
its forms;       necessary, therefore,
                   it   is              to employ   with cau                 it
tion, and more sparingly than in some other cases. If the
disease      has been         of long standing,              it   is   requisite to keep up
the mercurial action for several weeks,                              and to renew   it,   from

.even a longer period,          will    be sometimes     required for the at
 tainment of the desired end.
     I  {hall not disguise,       that, in cases of long standing, where
 the muscles of the limbs are wasted and become rigid, and
 the joints stiff and unpliant, mercury, like all other means,
 will often be found ineffectual. A great obstacle to the cure,
 too, frequently arises from the poverty and wretchedness of
  the objects : ill fed, and without sufficient shelter against the
 inclemencies of season, the constitution is unable to sustain
 the debilitating action of the remedy. The effects of cold,
  as  I  have just hinted,        influence materially the cure.         In the
  winter season, the        use    of the limbs is much more slowly re
  covered     than in warm weather.                This leads one to expect
  advantage      from the warm bath in such              cases ;  and, in fact,
  this is one of the most powerful remedies we possess, and is
  calculated greatly to aid the good effects of mercurv.                    The
  Bath waters       are very successfully        employed for the purpose,
  and the hospital       there      much resorted to by patients of this
  description.
      If  the advantages        of   the plan    I have here recommended
  be more widely diffused,             through the medium of your useful
  Miscellany,      I  shall be highly gratified.
      I am happy to find my observations               on this subject lately
  confirmed by a respectable foreign writer.                M. Warburg, of
  Berlin, in a Tract on Palsy, strongly recommends the use of
  calomel and mercurial frictions in that species of the                 disease
  which is produced         by lead*.

tions of those who have seen disagreeable consequences from
the pricking of spiders.  Lister is among this number; and
Lister must be believed, because he made many observations
on these inse6ts.  This author fays positively, in a particular
treatise, that several spiders have a venomous liquor*. We
are assured, on the other hand, by Robert Boyle t, that he
never saw any venomous spiders in Ireland, notwithstanding
the prejudices of the people ; but, out of respect for an author
who had none for others, he durst not controvert what Sca-
liger had advanced                in     regard       to   the   spiders       of Gascony,
which,       he says, arc so venomous, that, when they are crustied
with the feet, the venom penetrates the soles of the slioes.
   The experiments of M. Bon, a member of the Chamber
of Accounts of Languedoc, 'seem, however, contrary to the
assertion of Scaliffer. This magistrate, who endeavoured to
apply to some useful purpose the threads of spiders, touched
a great number of these insects, and had been frequently bit
by them without experiencing any bad consequences.     Hoff
man,  without  doubt,  went too far when   he defied any one
to prove that spiders or any other insects, taken internally,
ever caused the least inconvenience to people                             in health.        In
this defiance there             is,   without doubt, some exaggeration.                     It
is well known that the injury done to us        the greater part   by
of insects arises only from their sting; but insects of caustic                    a
nature cannot certainly be swallowed with impunity. Though
there have been people who ate spiders, disagreeable conse
quences       have been seen to arise from the bite                       of   these insects.
This depends on the kind of spider, the time, and the place.
As there are poisons which have more action when intro
duced through the skin than when taken internally, such as
that of the viper, am inclined to think that the poison of the
                          I
spider may have    contrary effect

    the different constitution of the subjects.
        Tt   is   pretended        also,       that spiders         diffuse    a     noxious vapour
    when burnt, and that, when they hurst on being applied to
    a flame, thev spurt out noxious liquor.    ashall here relate             I

lold him, the sinell       which arose when        she  burnt spiders in
that manner had often affected her head              so  much, that she
thought the objects she saw turned round.                 She often even
experienced fainting     siti  with  cold  sweats,     and   sometimes a
IligUt vomiting.       But notwithstanding all this, flic found so
much pleasure in tormenting these poor infects, that nothing
eould cure her of her mania till she met with the accident
above mentioned.         This   lesion  may serve      as  a  warning to
those who have       the  same mania,     and who, besides exposing
themselves     to injury of  the like kind,   run the risk of burning
their apartment, or perhaps the whole house.
    The punctures     made by large spiders     (I  here allude to those
of France)     are almost insensible.   There is fjrmed around the
wound a livid swelling, sometimes with phlyctenes, which
seem to announce a septic poison.           The other symptoms, de
scribed by different authors, are so various, that,          if they were
 united in the fame subject, the poison of the spider would be the
 most violent of any known. It is surprising how the ancients
 have assigned particular symptoms         to characterise the punc
 ture   of each   kind of phalangium and spider. One might be
 induced to believe that they observed an analogy or relation
 between our humours and the colours of these insects : they
 have marked all the degrees         of pain, from itching       to stupor.
 On    this subject the reader may consult Paulus Ægineta,            Avi-
 cenna, Rhazes, Nicander, Grevin, &c.               Afterwards a whole
 cloud of authors repeated that the venom of spiders, intro
 duced into the body in any manner whatever, was followed
 by numbnefs of the part, cold of the extremities, shivering,
 swelling of the lower belly, paleness, involuntary shedding
 of tears, and an inclination to make water ; priapifm in
 young persons, relaxation of the fame member in old people,
 convulsions, &c.
     It is very uncommon to fee consequences so fatal, unless
 people have the misfortune to be bitten by the avicular spider
  of America, which destroy* birds' nests; or by the black spider
  of Madagascar, which, according to Flacourt, occasions flu -
  vering, and cools the blood ; or, in the last place, by the
  lunga, the wolf-spider, and nhamduguafu, which are fero
  cious spiders of Brasil, mentioned by Lecluse and Margraff.

  126                 A cursory    View of some of        the
 Merian      has given a figure     of  the   large     hairy spider of Gua-
java, which lives on the colibris.
    Brogiani assures us, that in Etruria there is a kind of pha-
 langium which resides in the earth, the puncture of which
 occasions     violent symptoms ; such as phrenitis, vomiting,
gangrene in the wounded part, or exanthemata. Sheep also
have died in consequence of being punctured by this insect.
Brosnani does not here allude to the tarantula, as he treats
 of that insect separately.          The Italian journals, some time
 ago, announced that a large kind of spider had occasioned
great     ravage   in  the  fields   of Volterra, in Tuscany.           It at
 tacked the reapers, and, by its puncture, occasioned violent
pain and convulsive movements in all the limbs.                      Nothing
of the like kind is to be apprehended in France, except in
some      cantons during the dog-days.               An enlightened natu
ralist, the Chevalier de Lamanon, fays, that in the month of
June 178a the drought and heat were so great in Provence,
that spiders, which in general are not venomous, occasioned
by their bite severe diseases, which had a great resemblance
 to those occasioned      bv the bite of the tarantula.           In ordinary
cases    of being bit or punctured by spiders, it will be suffi
cient to wash the wounded part with brine, to apply theriac,
 and to prescribe one or two doses internallv. The fresh leaves
of  sage,    or those of the plantain, have been recommended                as
topics, and washing with vinegar.               Recourse     also may be had
 to volatile alkali.

system of the world as a grand problem of mechanics, which
 he has endeavoured to resolve.            For this reason he treats in
 the   first  book on the general        principles of equilibrium and
 motion.       He   gives a  rigorous demonstration of the principle

tion of a solid body, whatever be its figure ; gives the con
ditions of the motion of fluids, and applies them to the mo
tion of the waters of the sea and to that of the atmosphere.
He then determines what ought to be the force acting on the
celestial    bodies    to render     their movements such          as they are
exhibited to our observation.             The laws of Kepler conduct
him directly to the          principle of universal gravity ; that is to
fay, that the action which              the   celestial  bodies    exercise on
each other is in the direct ratio            of their masses and the in
verse    of the square of their distances.            The new illustrations
 which he gives are highly worthy the attention of geome
 tricians.

 or their revolutions round their axes.               The   first turns round
  its axis in      i  day    18 hours 36' 6      '; the   second     in 3 days
  18   hours   17'   9";   the third in     7 days    3 hours 59'      6"; and
 the fourth in 16 days 18 hours 5' 1 '. He endeavours to
  determine the size of these bodies, but has not yet been able
  to attain to great accuracy. " We may only conclude," lays
  he, " that the first satellite is larger than the second j that
  the second is the smallest of all ; that the third is much larger
  than any of the        rest ; and   that the fourth is nearly as large       as
   the first."

       Bouvard has completed a grand labour on the movements

   the following proportion: i° i' 13" is to 58233 toises as
   1° o' o" is to a fourth term, found to be 57074 toises.             This
  is the length of a degree of the earth between Paris and
  Amiens, determined         by Picard.       The mean latitude of this
  degree is 490 23'.          This length supposes the toise of the
  north, and the temperature of Reaumur's thermometer, 10
  or 120. This degree is reduced to 57056 with the toise of the
  equator now adopted."
      It is to be observed,     that according to these new measures
  the difference     of the degree between       Evaux and Carcassonne
  is much greater than it ought to be according to theory ; for
  it differs 88 toises from that between Paris and Evaux, though
  there is only a difference of about three degrees of latitude,
  which makes nearly 32 toises per degree.                   That between
  Carcassonne and Mountjouy differs 34 toises, though there
 is only a difference of about two degrees of latitude, which
 makes 14 toises per degree; while thedegrees between Dun
 kirk and Paris differ but 10 toises, and there are two degrees
 of latitude, which         makes    only four toises of difference      bet
 degree.
     It  is generally supposed that the degree under the equator
 is 56753 toises, as it has been estimated by the French aca
 demicians, and that under the pelar circle, it is 57419 toises,
 which would         make    a  mean difference     of about    seven toises
 between each degree.           But it  appears that the difference is a
 little greater between the degrees towards the pole, than be
 tween those towards         the   equator.     The  difference   of 14 and
 32 toises, which has been          lately found, cannot be reconciled
 with general theory. This difference, therefore, must depend
 on some particular causes.             These facts indicate cither an
 irregularity    in   the  terrestrial   meridians, or an ellipticity in
 the equator and its parallels, or an irregularity in the inte
 rior of the earth, or an effect of the attraction of mountains,
 or a powerful action of these different causes united, or of
 some     of them on      each    other;    an action   which    has never
 been demonstrated         in  so  striking   a manner    as by the results
just given.       It must be left to the ablest mathematicians to
 direct their attention to these facts in order that they may
 endeavour to explain the principles on which they depend,

    fect theory than any yet given.     This confirms the opinion
    before entertained, that the figure   of the earth is not a re-
    gular curve.   It results from these calculations, that the flat
    ness of the earth is a 334th part ; that is to far, the axis is
    so a diameter at the equator as
                                     ^^ to 334.
       The length of the pendulum is another mean given by
    Nature for obtaining constant measures, because it is a con
    sequence           of gravity which cannot vary.                It   has been esti
    mated for    pendulum, vibrating

      The length of the metre being determined, serves to flx
    the weights and measures of capacity.  Distilled water was
    assumed as the body which could be most easilv procured in
    full purity; and Leferre Gincau endeavoured lo ascertain
    the weight of a kilogramme of this water taken at that tem-
.   peraturc at which it has most density. The real kilogramme,
    the weight of a cubic decimetre of distilled water, taken at
    its maximum of density, and weighed in vacuo, or the unity of
    the weights, is 18837, or 2 pounds 5 gros 35 0*15 grains;
    that     is,
              little more than the Paris pint, which was supposed
                   a
    to weigh two pounds. According to these experiments, the
    cubic soot of distilled water, taken at its maximum of den
    sity,  70 pounds 223 grains.

      Fabbroni has examined the refractive power of various
  fluids, and shown that they are exceedingly different. Thus,
  æther has a refractive power much more considerable than
 oil. The former gives a focus of 60, the latter of 75.
      Haiiy has shown that several mineral substances have               a
 double refraction     ; such as, transparent     quartz, the topas, the
 emerald, calcareous spar, sulphat         of  barytes, the euclafe, the
 idocrase, sulphat of stroutian.         Among the soluble and sapid
 salts,  borat of soda (borax) and fulphated magnesia have
 double refraction     ; sulphur has double refraction ; amber and
 the diamond have single refraction ; carbonat of lead, or
 white lead ore, has double refraction.
     Brougham, in a paper printed in the Transactions of the
 Royal Society, gives an account of some experiments which
 seem to him to prove that the doctrine of Newton respecting
 the refrangibility of the rays of light, is false.          Prevoll, of
 Geneva, thinks that Brougham is mistaken: he maintains
 the theory of Newton, and shows that the experiments op
 posed to it are not conclusive.
     Dize  has considered     the matter   of   heat as the cause  of all
luminous effects.         He has made      a great   number of experi
ments to prove, that in all the terrestrial phenomena there is
never light without heat. His conclusions are : 1. That heat
always precedes luminous effects.           2.   That light cannot    be
a    body sui   generis ; because light     does   not take place but
when caloric is free, and in sufficient accumulation, on which
depends the force       of  the luminous effect produced.       3. The
effect   called luminous can only be a luminous               property,
which every molccula of free caloric possesses.             4. Caloric
being a substance, the quantity of which is limited, darts
itself towards the fun, which is its strongest point of attrac-

 I  N   natural    as well  as civil history there are facts presented
 to the meditation of the observer, which, though confirmed
 by the most convincing testimony, seem on the first view to
 be destitute of probability.          Of this kind is that of people
 consumed by coming           into, contact with common fire, and of
 their bodies being reduced to ashes.                How can we conceive
 that fire, in    certain  circumstances,         can  exercise so powerful
 an action on the human body as to produce this effect ? One
 might    be induced to give less faith to these instances          of com
 bustion as they seem to be rare.                I confess that at first they
 appeared     to  me  worthy    of  very   little  credit, but they are pre
 sented to the public as true by men whose veracity seems un
 questionable. Bianchini, Maffei, Rolli, Le Cat, Vicq-d'Azyr,
  and several men distinguished by their learning, have given
  certain testimony of the facts. Besides, is it more surprising
  to experience sut:h incineration than to void saccharine urine,
  or to  see the bones softened to such a degree as            to be reduced
  to the   state  of a jelly ? The effects of this combustion are
  certainly    not   more wonderful than those of the bones soften
  ed, or of the diabetes mellitus.               This morbific disposition,
  therefore, would be one more scourge to afflict humanity ;
  but in physics, facts being always preferable to reasoning,
   I shall here collect those which appear to me to bear the
   impression    of truth ; and,     lest  I  should alter the sense,   I {ball
   quote   them such      as they are     given in the works from which
   1 have extracted     them.

                     the lower class,
spirituous liquors to such excess that she would take no other
nourishment, having fat down one evening on a straw chair
to steep, was consumed    in the night-time, so that next morn
ing  no part of  her  was   found but the skull and the extreme
joints of the fingers ; all the rest of her body, fays Jacobæus,
 was reduced to ashes.
   The following extract of the memoir of Bianchini is taken,
from the Annual Register for 1763:— The Countess Cor
nelia Bandi, of the town of Cesena, aged 62, enjoyed a good
state   of health.        One evening, having experienced a sort of
drowsiness,         she retired to bed, and her maid remained with,
her till   she fell asleep.           Next morning, when the girl                   entered
to awaken her mistress,                 she   found nothing but the remains
of her body in the most horrid condition. At the distance
of four feet from the bed was a heap of ashes, in which could
be distinguished            the legs and arms untouched.                    Between the
legs lay the head,               the brain of which, together with half the
 posterior     part    of   the cranium,     and the whole chin, had been
 consumed       :    three fingers were found in                 the          of a coal ;
                                                                          state
 the    rest   of     the    body was reduced            to     ashes,     which, when
 touched, left on the singers a fat, foetid moisture. A small
 lamp which stood on the floor was covered with ashes, and
 contained no oil            ;   the tallow of two candles                was     melted   on
 a table, but the wicks still remained, and the feet                          of the can
 dlesticks     were covered with a certain moisture.                         The bed was
 not damaged ; the bed-clothes and coverlid were raised up
 and thrown on one fide, as is the cafe when a person gets
 up. The furniture and tapestry were covered with a moist
 kind of foot of the colour of ashes, which had penetrated into
 the drawers and dirtied the linen.                           This   foot
                                                                        having been
 conveyed                   kitchen,
                    to a neighbouring                           adhered to the walls
  and    the utensils.            A
                           of bread in the cupboard was
                                      piece
  covered with         it,
                and no dog would touch it. The infectious
  odour had been communicated to other apartments. The
  Annual       Register states, that the Countess                    of   Cesena was ac
  customed          to bathe all her body in camphorated                    spirit of wine.
  Bianchini          caused the details            of this deplorable             event to he
  published         at the time when           it   took place,        and no one con
                                                                                    tradicted.

     J34           On the Combustion of the Human Body,
    tradicted    them.     It  was attested also by Scipio          Masse:,   a
   learned cotemporary        of Bianchini, who was far from being
   credulous; and, in the last place, this surprising fact was
   confirmed to the Royal Society of London by Paul Rolli.
   The Annual Register mentions also two other facts of the
   fame kind      which   occurred    in England,     one at Southampton
   and the other at Coventry.
       An    instance of the like kind is preserved            in   the  same
   work    *  in a letter of Mr. Wilmer, surgeon : —         " Mary     Clues,
   aged 50, was much addicted to intoxication.               Her propensity
  to this vice had increased after the death              of her husband,
  which      happened a year and a       half before.    For about a year,
  scarcely a day had passed in the course           of which     slie did not
  drink     at least half a pint of rum or aniseed-water.                 Her
  health gradually declined, and about the beginning of Fe
  bruary (lie was attacked by the jaundice and confined to her
  bed.      Though she was incapable of much action, and not
  in a condition to work, she still continued her old habit of
  drinking every day and smoking a pipe of tobacco. The
  bed in which she lay stood parallel to the chimney of the
  apartment, and at the distance from it of about three feet.
  On Saturday morning, the 1st of March, she fell on the
 floor ; and her extreme weakness having prevented her from
 getting up, she remained in that state till some one entered
 and     put her to bed.       The following night she wished to be
 left alone. A woman quitted her at half after eleven, and,
 according to custom, shut the door and locked it. She had
 put on the fire two large pieces of coal, and placed a light in
 a candlestick      on a chair at the head of her bed.                At half
 after five in the morning a smoke            was  seen   issuing    through
 the window,        and the door being speedily broke open, some
 flames which were in the room were soon extinguished. Be
tween the bed and the chimney were sound the remains of
 the unfortunate Clues : one leg and a thigh were still entire;
 but there remained nothing of the skin, the muscles, ami
 the viscera.        The   bones    of  the cranium,      the breast,     the
spine,     and the upper extremities, were entirely calcined,            and
covered with a whitish efflorescence.            The   people were much

                                                                   surprised

 surprised that the furniture had sustained so little    injury. The
 fide  of the bed which was next to the chimney had suffered
 the most ; the wood of it was slightly burnt ; but the feather
 bed, the clothes, and covering, were safe.            I entered the
 apartment about two hours after it had been opened, and
 observed that the walls and every thing in it were blackened ;
 that it was filled with a very disagreeable vapour ; but that
 nothing except the body exhibited any strong traces of sire."
     This instance has great similarity to that related by Vicq-
 d'Azyr in the Encyclopedie Metbodique, under the head,
 Pathologic Anatomy of Man.            A woman, about si sty years
 of age, who indulged to excess in spirituous liquors, and got
 drunk every day before slie went to bed, was found entirely
 burnt, and reduced to ashes.        Some of the osseous parts only
 were left, but the furniture of the apartment had suffered
 very little damage.      Vicq-d'Azyr,   instead  of disbelieving thi9
 phenomenon,        adds,  thai there have    been many other in
 stances   of the like kind.
     We find also a circumstance of this kind in          a  work en
 titled, A8a Medica et pbilofophica Hafnienjia ;           and  in the
 work of Henry Bohanser, entitled, Le nouveau pbo/pbore en-
Jlamme.       A woman at Paris, who had been accustomed, for
 three years, to drink spirit of wine to such a degree that she
 used no other liquor,      was one day found entirely reduced to
 ashes, except the skull and extremities      of the fingers.
     The Transactions of the Royal Society of London present
 also an instance of human combustion no less extraordinary :
  It was mentioned at the time it happened in all the journals;
  it was then attested by a great number of eye-witnesses, and
 became the subject       of many   learned discussions.    Three ac
  counts of this event, by different authors, all nearly coincide.
 The    fact is related as follows : — " Grace Pitt, the wife of a
  fishmonger of the parish of St. Clement, Ipswich, aged about
  sixty, had contracted a habit, which (he continued for several
 years, of coming down every night from her bed-room, half
  dresied, to smoke a pipe.      On   the night   of the 9th of April
  1744, flie got up from bed as usual.            Her daughter, who
  slept with her, did not perceive (he         was absent till next
  tnoming when        she awoke,   soon after which she put on her
                                          8                    clothes,

 t$6           On  the Combustion    of the Human Body,
 clothes, and going down to the kitchen, found her mother
 stretched out on the right side, with her head near the grate J
 the body extended on the hearth, with the         legs on the floor,
which was of       deal,  having the appearance of a log of wood,
consumed      by a sire without apparent flame.   On beholding this
spectacle, the girl ran in great haste and poured over her mo
ther's body some water contained in two large vessels in order
to extinguish the fire ; while the foetid odour and smoke which
exhaled    from the body almost suffocated some of the neigh
bours who had hastened to the girl's assistance. The trunk
was in some measure incinerated, and resembled a heap of
coals covered with white ashes.            The head, the arms, the
legs, and the thighs, had also participated in the burning.
This woman, it is said, had drunk a large quantity of spi
rituous liquor in consequence of being overjoyed to hear that
one of her daughters had returned from Gibraltar,             There
was no fire in the grate, and the candle had burnt entirely
out in the socket of the candlestick, which was close to her.
Besides, there were found near the consumed body the clothes
of  a child and a paper screen,      which had sustained no injury
bvj the fire.    The    dress  of this woman   consisted of a cotton
gown.
    Le Cat, in     a memoir on spontaneous      burning, mentions
several other instances       of combustion of    the human body.
"   Having,"     fays he,
                            "  spent several months    at Rheims   in
the years 1724 and 1725, I lodged at the house of Sieur
Millet, whose wife got intoxicated every day. The domestic
economy of the family was managed by a pretty young girl,
which I must not omit to remark, in order that all the cir
cumstances     which accompanied the foct I am about to relate,
may be better understood.           This woman was found con
sumed on the 20th of February 1725, at the distance of a
foot and    a half from   the hearth   in her kitchen.    A  part  of
the head only, with a portion of the lower extremities and
a few of the vertebrae, had escaped combustion.          A foot and
a   half of the flooring under the        body had been consumed,
but a kneading-trough and a powdering-tub,              which  were
very near the body, had sustained no injury.           M. Chretien,
a surgeon,     examined the remaius of the body with every
                                                           juridical

               produced by the Use       of Spirituous Liquors.            137
 juridical formality.         Jean Millet,       the husband, being inter
  rogated   by    the judges who         instituted an inquiry into the
  affair, declared, that about eight in the evening on the 19th
  of February he had retired to reft with his wife, who not
  being able to sleep, had gone into the kitchen, where he
  thought (he was warming herself; that, having fallen asleep,
  he was wakened about two o'clock by an infectious odour,
  and that, having run to the kitchen, he found the re
  mains of his wise in the        state described       in the report of the
  physicians and surgeons.           The judges having no suspicion of
 the real cause of this event,             prosecuted      the affair with the
 utmost diligence.        It   was   very unfortunate for Millet that
 he had a handsome servant-maid, for neither his probity nor
 innocence was able to save him from the suspicion of having
 got rid   of his wife bv a concerted plot, and of having arranged
 the   rest  of the circumstance in such a manner as to give it
 the appearance of an accident. He experienced, therefore,
 the whole severity of the law ; and though, by an appeal to
 a superior and       very enlightened court, which discovered             the
 cause   of  the combustion,        he came off victorious,        he suffered
 so  much from uneasiness of mind,                 that he was obliged to
pass the remainder        of his melancholy          days in an hospital."
    Le Cat     relates another instance,          which has    a most perfect
 resemblance       to the    preceding —   :
                                                " M. Boinneau,        cure of
 Plerguer, near      Dol,"     says he,
                                           "   wrote to me the following
letter, dated February 22, 1749             :  Allow me to communicate
to you a fact which took place                here about a fortnight ago.
Madame de Boifeon, 80 years of age, exceedingly meagre,
who had drunk nothing but spirits for several years, was sit
ting in her elbow-chair before the fire while her waiting-
maid went out of the room for a few moments.                          On her
return, feeing      her mistress    on  sire,   slie   immediately gave an
alarm, and some people having come                    to her assistance,  one
of  them eiideavoured        to extinguish the flames with his hand,
but they adhered to it as if it had been dipped in brandy or
oil on fire. Water was brought and thrown on the lady in
abundance, yet the fire appeared more violent, and was not
extinguislied till the whole flesh had been consumed.                     Her
skeleton,    exceedingly black, remained entire                in the  chair,

which  was only a lillle scorched ; one leg only, and the f\rr>
hands, detached themselves from the reft of the bones.        It
is not known whether her clothes had caught tire by ap
proaching the grate.     The lady was in the fame place in
which she sat every day ; there was no extraordinary- lire, and
flic had not fallen.                What        makes       me     suspect that              the use
of spirits might          have produced              this effect      is,   that     [   have been
assured, that at the gate                of Dinan       an accident             of   the like kind
happened           to another woman under similar circumstances."
     To    these instances,             which   I    have multiplied to strengthen
the evidence,         I     shall    add two other facts,                  of   the fame         kind,
published in          the   Journal Je Mtilicine*.                    The first took place
at    Aix, in Provence,     thus related bv Mun.trc,
                                     and      is         sur                                  a
geon      :— "In         of February
                         the month     1779, Marv  JauOrct,
widow of Nicholas Gra\ier, shoemaker, of     small size, ex                 a
ceedingly corpulent, and addicted to drinking, having been
burnt in her apartment, M. Roeas, mv colleague, who was
commissioned             to make        areport respecting             the remains            of her
body, found only               a    mass of askes, and
                                           a- bonus, calcined    a    fe
in such  manner that on the least pressure they were reduced
               a
to dust. The bones of the cranium, one hand, and         foot,                                a
had       in   part escaped the action    of the lire. Near these re
mains stood          a   table untouched, and under the table    small                       a
wooden stove, the grating of which, having been long burnt,
assorded an aperture, through which,      probable, the lire     it   is
that occasioned                the melancholy accident had been commu
nicated        :   one chair, which flood too near the flames, had the
feat and           fore- feet burnt.            In other         respects,           there   was ih>
 appearance of fire cither in the chimney or the apartment                                            ;
 so that, except the fore-part of the chair,   appears to me                it
 that no other contbustible matter contributed to this speedy
 incineration, which was effected in the space of seven oj
 eight hours."
    The other instance,                  mentioned in the Journal dc                             j\LJt-

 surgeon of that city, still alive: — "Iking    requested, on tht

 was said to have been burnt,              I  made   the following    observaV
 tion»:   — The       body lay with       the crown     of  the head    resting
 against one os the andirons, at the distance              of eighteen   inches'
 from the lire      ;  the remainder     of   the body was placed obliquely
  before the chimney,          the whole being nothing but a mass of
 allies.      Even the most solid bones had lost their form and"
 consistence      5  none of them could be distinguished except the
 oronal,       the two parietal       bones, the two lombar vertebrae,-'
 a  portion of the tibia, and a part of the omoplate; and these,
 even, were so calcined,             that they became dust by the least"
 pressure.       The right     soot was      found entire, and scorched at
 its upper junction        ;  the left was more burnt.           The   day had
 beeti cold,      but there was nothing in the grate except two or
 three bits      of wood, about an inch in diameter, burnt in the
 middle.        None of the furniture in the apartment was da
 maged.        The   chair on which Mademoiselle Thuars had been
 fitting, was found at the distance of a foot from her, and ab
 solutely untouched.            I must here observe,       that this lady was
 exceedingly corpulent ; that (lie was above sixty vears of age,
 and much addicted to spirituous liquors ; that the day even
 of her death flic had drunk three bottles of wine and about
 a bottle     of brandy    ;  and that     the consumption       of  the body
 had taken place         in  less  than   seven hours, though, according
 to appearance,         nothing     around     the body was burnt but the
 clothes."
    The town of Caen              affords    several other instances     of the
 fame kind.         I have been told by many people, and parti-
cularlv     a  physician of Argentan, named Bousiet, author of
an Kli'ay on Intermittent Fevers, that a woman of the lower
class, who lived at Place Villars , ' and who was known to be
                                                                                 '
much addicted to strong liquor, had been sound in her house
burnt.        The extremities of her body only were spared, but
the furniture was very little damaged.
    A  like unfortunate accident happened also at Caen to an
other old woman addicted to drinking.                      I was assured by
those who told me the fact, that the flames which proceeded-
from the body could not be extinguished by water; but                          I
think    it needless to relate the particulars of this and of an
other similar event which toolc place in the fame town, be-

inspire the same confidence.
    This collection of                      therefore, by all
                                    instances is supported,
those authentic proofs which can be required to form human
testimony ; for, while we admit the prudent doubt of Des
cartes, we ought to reject the universal doubt of the Pyr-
rhonists. The multiplicity and uniformity even of these facts,
which occurred in different places, and were attested by so
many enlightened men, carry with them conviction; they
have such a relation               to each          other that .we are inclined              to
ascribe them to the same cause.
    1.   The    persons who experienced                    the   effects    of this    com
bustion had for  a long time made an immoderate                                use    of    spi
rituous liquors.

    8.                of these bodies left as residuum fat fœtiJ  a

    Let   us now enter               into an examination of these eight                    ge
neral observations.
   The first idea winch occurs on reading the numerous                                      in
stances of human combustion above related    that those who           is,
fell victims to those fatal accidents were almost all addicted
to spirituous liquors. The woman mentioned in the Transac
tions of Copenhagen had for three years made such an im
moderate use of them that she would take no other nourish
ment.      Mary Clues, for             a   year before the accident happened,
bad scarcely been             a   single      day    without drinking        half    a
                                                                                           P'n*
                              6                                                              of

             produced   by the Use    of Spirituous Liquors.        141
of rum or of     aniseed-"water.      The wife of Millet      had  been
continually intoxicated ; Madam de Boiseon for several years
had drunk nothing but spirits; Mary Jauffret was much ad
dicted to drinking ; and Mademoiselle Thuars, and the other
women of Caen, were equally fond of strong liquors.
   Such excess, in regard to the use of spirituous liquors, must
have had a powerful action on the bodies of the persons to
whom     I  allude.    All  their fluids and solids must have expe
rienced its fatal influence      ; for the property of the absorbing
vessels,   which is   so active   in the human body, seems on this
occasion     to have    ailed   a distinguiflied   part.   It has been
observed that the urine of great drinkers is generally aque
ous and limpid.        It appears, that in drunkards who mak«
an immoderate use of spirituous liquors, the aqueous part of
their drink is discharged by the urinary passage, while the
alcoholic, almost like the volatile part of aromatic substances,
not being subjected to an entire decomposition, is absorbed
into every part of their bodies.
   I shall now proceed to the second general observation,
that the combustion took place only in women.
   I will   not pretend to assert that men are not liable to com
bustion in the same manner, but I have never yet been able
to find one well certified instance of such an event ; and as
we cannot proceed with any certainty but on the authority
of facts, I think this singularity so surprising as to give rife
to a few reflections.       Perhaps when the cause is examined,
it will appear perfectly natural.          The female body is in ge
neral more delicate than that of the other sex. The system
of their solids is more relaxed ; their fibres are more fragile
and of a weaker structure, and therefore their texture more
easily hurt. Their mode of life also contributes to increase the
weakness of their organization.           Women, abandoned in ge
neral to a sedentary life, charged with the care of the inter
nal domestic economy, and often shut up in close apartments,
where they are condemned to spend whole days without tak
ing any exercise, are more subject than men to become cor
pulent.      The texture of the soft parts in female bodies being
 more spongy,       absorption ought to be freer         j and as their
                                                                  whole

I4S                On       the   Comhutihn os '.hi Human Both,
whole bodies imbibe spirituous liquors with more
                                               ease", they
ought to experience more readily the impression of fire.
Hence that combustion, the melancholy instances of which
seem to be    furnished by women alone ; and it is owing
merely to the  want of a certain concurrence of circumstances
and of physical causes, that these events, though less rare than
is   supposed, do not become more common.
     The                       serves to explain the third ;
           second general observation
1 mean,  that the combustion took place only in women fir
advanced in life.  The Countess of Cesena was sixty-two
years      of    age   ;    Mary Clues, fifty -two      ;   Grace   Pitt,    sixty ;
Madame de Boiseon, eisfht'v ; and Mademoiselle Tliuars
more than sixty.   These examples prove that combustion is
more frequent among old women. Young persons, distracted
by other pasiions, are not much addicted to drinking; but
when love, departing along with votitli, leaves a vacuum in
                                            '
the mind, if its place be not supplied bv ambition or in
terest, a taste for gaming, or religious fervor, it generally falls
a prey to intoxication.    This passion still increases as the
others diminish, especially in women, who can indulge it
without restraint. Wilmer, therefore, observes, " that the
propensity of Marv Clues to this vice had always inci eased
after the death of her husband, which happened about a
Tcax    before:"        all the other women of whom I have
                           almost
spoken, being equally   unconfined  in regard to their actions;
could gratify their attachment to spirituous liquors without
opposition.
     It may      have been observed         that the obefity of women, as
they advance               in life, renders them more sedentary; and             if,

masses, durine;         the  moment of intoxication, should              expe
rience the effects of combustion.
     Perhaps we have no occasion to go very far to search for
the     cause of these combustions.             The fire of the wooden
stove, the chimney, or of the candle, might have been com
municated to the clothes, and might have in this manner
burnt the persons above mentioned, on account of the pecu
liar disposition of their bodies.               Maffei "observes that the
Countess of Cesena was accustomed to bathe her whole
body with spirit of wine.              The vicinity of the candle and
lamp, which were found near the remains of her body, oc
 casioned, without doubt, the combustion.                   This accident re
 minds us of that which               happened    to Charles      II.  king of
 Navarre.          This prince, being      addicted     to drunkenness and
 exceffes     of every kind, had caused himself to be wrapped up
 in   cloths     dipped in spirits, in order to revive the natural heat
 of his body which had been weakened by debauchery ; but
 the     cloths caught fire while his attendants were fastening
  them, and lie perished a victim to his imprudence.
      Besides accidental combustion, it remains for us to exa
  mine whether spontaneous              combustion of the human body
  can take place, as asserted           by Le Cat.         Spontaneous com
  bustion      is the burning     of the human body without the con
  tact   of any     substance in a state   of ignition.        Nature, indeed,
  affords     several instances      of  spontaneous       combustion in the
  mineral and vegetable kingdoms.                The decomposition of py
   rites, and the subterranean processes which art carried on
  in    volcanoes,      afford  proofs   of it.   Coal-mines       may readily
   take    fire spontaneoustv      ; and this has been        found to be the
   cafe with heaps        of coals deposited in close places.         It i3 by a
   fermentation of this kind that dunghills sometimes become
   hot, and take sire. This may serve also to explain why trusses
   of hav, carried home during moist weather, and p'ded upron,
   each other, sometimes          take fire.    But,  can spontaneous      com
    bustion take place in the human body              ?    If some  authors arfl
    to be credited *, very violent combustion may be produced in
    cur bodies by nature and by artificial processes. Sturmiusf

                                            in   a state Three'
 noblemen of Courland having laid a bet which of them
 could drink most spirits, two of them died in consequence of
 suffocation by the stames which issued with great violence
 from their stomachs.    We are told by Thomas Bartholin *,
 on the authority of Vorstius, that a soldier, who had drunk
 two glasses of spirits, died after an eruption of flames from
 his mouth.    In his third century Bartholin mentions an
 other accident of the fame kind after a drinking-match of
 strong liquor.
    It now remains to decide, from these instances, respecting
 the accidental or spontaneous causes which produce combus
 tion.     Nature, by assuming                    different forms, seems
                                              a thousand
 at first as    if   desirous to elude our observation ; but, on mature
reflection,      if it   be found easy to prove accidental combustion,
spontaneous combustion appears altogether improbable ; for,
even admitting the instances of people suffocated by flames
which issued from their mouths, this is still far from the
combustion of- the whole body. There is a great difference
between this semi-combustion and spontaneous combustion
so complete as to reduce                    the body to ashes, as              in   the cafes
above mentioned.      As the human body has never been seen
to experience total combustion, these assertions seem rather
the productions of a fervid imagination than of real observa
tion ; and it too often happens that Nature in her mode of
action does not adopt our manner of feeing.
   I shall not extend further these observations                             on the com
bustion of the human body, as I flatter myself that after this
examination every person must be struck with the relation
which      exists between the cause               of this phenomenon and                 the
effects    that ensue.           A     system embellished
                                                  imaginary            with
charms is often seducing, but it never presents a perfect
whole.  We have seen fa£ts justify reasoning, and reasoning
serve afterwardsto explain facts. The combustion of the
human body, which on the first view appears to have in it
something of the marvellous, when explained, exhibits no
thing but        the utmost simplicity             :   so true   it   is,   that the won
derful    is   often produced          by   effects    which,    as they rarely strike

real cause.
   Some people, however, may ascribe to the wickedness of
mankind what we ascribe to accident. It may be said, that
assassins, after putting to death their unfortunate victims,
rubbed over their bodies with combustible substances, by
which       they        were   consumed.           But   even    if   such   an idea
should ever be conceived,           it would be impossible to carry it
into execution.            Formerly, when criminals were condemned
to the flames, what a quantity of combustible substances
was necessary to burn their bodies ! A baker's boy, named
Renaud, being condemned to be burnt a few years ago at
Caen, two large cart-loads of faggots were required to con
sume the body, and at the end of more than ten hours some
remains of the bones were still to be seen. What proves that
the combustion in the before-mentioned instances was not
artificial        is,
             that people often arrived at the moment when
it had taken place, and that, the body was found in its na
tural state. People entered the house of Madame Boiseon at
the time when her body was on sire, and                          all the neighbours
saw it.        Besides, the people         of whom       I   have spoken were       al
most all       of   the lowest class,      and not much calculated            to give

Jauffret that of           a   shoemaker; and two other women, who

the combustion was always accidental and never intentional.

 to this vice, and particularly on women, who most frequently
 become the victims of it.              Perhaps the frightful details of so
 horrid an evil as that of combustion will reclaim drunkards
 from this horrid practice. Plutarch relates, that at Spaifa
 children were deterred from drunkenness by exhibiting to
 them the spectacle of intoxicated slaves, who, by their hi-
 deous contorsions, silled the minds              of  these young spectators
 with      so   much     contempt        that  they    never  afterwards      got
drunk.         This state of drunkenness, however, was only tran
sitory.       How much more horrid it appears in those unfor
tunate victims consumed by the flames and reduced to ashes?
May men never forget that the vine sometimes produces very
bitter fruit — disease, pain, repentance, and death !

G,'UR           meteorological observations arc as old as the esta
blishment of the Academy of Sciences in the year 1666, and
have never yet been interrupted.                 The    most celebrated aca

C'allini,     a  Fouchy,     a  Chappc, &c.       have contributed towards
them     ;   and    several    members, such as Morin, Duhamel,
Malovin,         Messier,    Sec. paid attention to the fame object
without making themselves much known.                        The correspond
ents of       the  Academy        also    frequently communicated to it
their meteorological observations.                All the learned societies
in Europe comprehend meteorology in the list of their la

Academies of Berlin, Stockholm, Petersburg, Sec. but, above

deavoured to neglect nothing that had any relation to me
teorology, and I flatter myself that I have given the result of
every thing that has been published for a hundred years on
this branch of science.           But how tedious      is its   progress   !
From this        astonishing collection of observations       I   have as
yet  been     able  to deduce only a very small number        of  physical
truths, which        I here lay before   the   public under the title of
Meteorological        Axioms.    They   are  not drawn from the whole
mass of the before-mentioned observations,            made for a very
long period, and in a careless manner, and with very imper
fect instruments, but from those of the last thirty or forty
years.      They are as follow : —
                                     I.
                            Of  the  Barometer.
    1.  The    greatest changes    of the barometer commonly take
place,     during     clear weather, with a north wind ; and the
small    risings   during cloudy, rainy, or windy weather, with
a south, or nearly south, wind.
   2. The state of the mercury changes more in the winter
than the summer months; so that its greatest rising and fall
ing take place in winter; but its mean elevation is greater in
summer than in winter.
   3. The changes of the state of the barometer are nearly
null at the equator, and become greater the more one re
moves from it towards         the poles.
   4. They are more considerable in valleys than on mountains.
   5. The more variable the wind, the more changeable the
state  of  the barometer.
   6. It    is lower at midnight and noon than at other periods
of  the day    : its greatest daily height is towards evening.
   7. Between ten at night and two in the morning, and
also in the dav, the risintr and falling of the mercurv are less :
the contrary is the. cafe between         six and ten  in  the morning
and evening.
                                    Ui                       8.  Between

148                    Meteorological Axioms.
    8. Between two and six      in the morning   and evening it rises
as often as it falls ; but in such a manner that       it oftener rises
about that time in the winter months, and falls oftener              in
the summer months.
    9. The oscillations are less in summer, greater in winter,
and very great at the equinoxes.
    10. They are greater also in the day-time than during the
night.
    11. The higher the fun rises above the horizon, the less
are the oscillations ; they increase as he approaches the west
ern side of the horizon, and are exceedingly great when he
comes opposite to the eastern part       of the horizon.
     1 a. They are, to a certain degree, independent of the
changes of temperature.
     13. The mercury generally rises between the new and the
full moon, and falls between the latter and the new moon.
     14. It rises more in the apogeum than the perigeum : it
usually rises between the northern lunistice and the southern,
and falls between the southern lunistice and the northern.
     15.  In general,  a comparison of the variations of the mer
 cury with the positions of the moon gives nothing certain ;
 the results of Nos. 13 and 14 are the most constant.
     16. In our neighbourhood the barometer never continues
 twenty-four    hours without changing.
     17.  The barometers in       the western   districts rife or fall
 sooner than those in the more eastern.
     18.  When    the   sun  passes  the  meridian the mercury if
 falling continues to fall, and its fall is often hastened.
     19. When the mercury at the fame period is rising, it
 falls, remains stationary, or rises more slowly.
     aa. When the mercury, under the same circumstances, is
 stationary, it falls ; unless, before or after it becomes station
 ary, it has been in the act of rising.
      ai. The above changes commonly take place between
  eleven in the morning and one in the afternoon, but oftener
  before than after noon.
      22. Before high tides there is almost always a great fall
  of the mercury ; this takes place oftener at the full than tht
  new moon.
                                                                     II.

                                    Of   the Thermometer.
    I.     The       extreme    degrees          of      heat   are almost     every where
the fame        :    this, however, is not the cafe in regard                         to the
extreme degrees of cold.                    .
    a. The thermometer rises to its extreme height oftener in
the temperate  zones than in the torrid zone.
   3. It changes very little between the tropics ; its varia
tions, like those of the barometer, are greater the more one
proceeds from the equator towards the poles.
    4.     It   rises higher    in the plains than on mountains.
    5.     It   does      not fall so much in the neighbourhood of the
sea as  in inland parts.
    6. The wind has no influence on its motions.
    7. Moisture has a peculiar influence on                              it, if   followed    by
a   wind which disperses it.
    8.     The       greatest       heat,       and       the   greatest cold,     take    place
about six weeks after the northern or southern solstice.
  9. The thermometer changes more in summer than                                              in
winter.
    10.     The          coldest period         of the day before fun-rife.
                                                                 is
    11.     The          greatest    heat       in the fun and the shade                  seldom
takes place on the fame day.
   13. The heat decreases with far more rapidity from Sep
tember and October,                      than       it    increased   from     July to Sep
tember.
     13.
            It      is   not true, that         a   very cold winter     is    the prognostic
 of a      very hot summer.

    7. Violent winds are more prevalent in the neighbourhood
 of mountains than in        the open plains.

                       Of Rain and Evaporation.
    1. Kain is more frequent in winter than in summer, but
 more abundant in summer than in winter.
    3. It is also more abundant, but less common, in southern
 countries, than in those where the temperature is cold and
 moderate.
   3. The increase and decrease of rivers are not always in
 proportion to the quantity of the rain which falls.
   4. The quantity of rain is greater in low than in high
districts, and still more       so  in the neighbourhood       of forests
and mountains.
   5. The quantity of evaporation generally exceeds that of
the rain.
   6. The greater the heat, the stronger the evaporation.
   7. It is greater also while the wind blows from the northern
regions, than when it comes from the southern.
   8. In the last place, it is greater during dry and cold, than
during moist and warm, weather.
   9. The greatest drought indicated by the hygrometer takes
place    in April.

   1. Electricity     manifests   itself oftener   without storms than
with them.
   2.   It is occasioned   more frequently by dry than by rainy
clouds.
   3.   It  is oftener  positive   than negative, particularly when
occasioned by stationary clouds, because these, without doubt,
                                                                     are

are at such    a great distance,       that the electricity which rises
from the earth cannot reach them             : in the opposite cafe it is
exceedingly variable.
    4. The atmosphere exhibits signs of electricity at all times;
at every hour of the day and the night.

                        The Magnetic        Needle.
    1.  The  greatest declination       of the   needle from the north
towards the west takes place about two in the afternoon, and
the greatest approximation of it towards the north, about
eight in the morning; so that, from the last-mentioned hour
till about two in    the afternoon, it endeavours        to remove from
the north, and between two in the afternoon and the next
morning to approach it.
    3. The annual progress of the magnetic needle is as fol
lows   : — Between January         and March it removes from the
north; between March and May it approaches it; in June
it is stationary; in July it removes from it; in August, Sep
tember, and October, it approaches it ; its declination in
October is the fame as in May ; in November and December
it removes from the north        :   its greatest western declination is
at the vernal equinox,        and   its greatest approximation to the
north at the autumnal equinox.
    3. The declination of the magnetic needle is different ac
cording to the latitude : among us it has always increased
 since 1666 : before that period it was easterly.
    4. Before volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, the mag
netic needle     is often    subject     to very   extraordinary  move
ments.
    5. The magnetic needle is agitated before and after the
appearance of the northern lights : its declination on these
occasions is about noon greater than usual.
    6. The greater or     less appearance      of  these northern lights
is variable  :  some years     this phenomenon is very frequent,
in   others  uncommon.          For two or three years they have
occurred very seldom.
    7. The northern lights are more frequent about the time
of the equinoxes than at other periods of the vear.

winter in the polar regions, and is the more uncommon the
nearer the equator.
   9. Southern lights have been observed also in the regions
near the south pole.
   10. The northern lights are often accompanied with light
ning, and a noise like that of electricity; while the lightning
proceeds partly from the  middle of the northern lights, and
partly from the neighbouring clouds.

    It   appears that the general temperature                      of        a year   returns
every nineteen years ; an epoch                      when the phases and posi
tions of the moon in regard to the earth are again the fame.
   I might add more results, but I (hall confine myself to
those found most constant by observation,                          and conclude         with
wishing, that the zeal of observers may contribute to confirm
more and more the certainty of these Axioms, or to discover
new ones.
IX.    On the Decomposition of Azotic                            intoHydrogen and
    Oxygen Gas, by M. Girtanner,                                 and on the radical
    of   the   Muriatic Acid.             A          Letter from             Van Mons,     of
    Brussels,     to   Delamtberie *.
I     TAKE            opportunity of informing you, that
                  the earliest
Girtanner has decomposed azot, and reduced it to hydrogen
and oxygen, in the proportion of 0^93 of the former and
0-07 of the latter. From this it seems to follow, that azot,
ammonia,          water, atmospheric air, &c. are compounds                                of
these two principles  in varied proportions.   In analysing air
we do not separate but compound the -azotic gas by sub
tracting a part of oxygen from the hydro-oxygen fluid, which
constitutes that air.  This              is,
                                perhaps, the reason why com
bustion     is   more lively     in   pure,    oxygen gas, or orygen gas not
                        • From                 rte   Pbj/iqui,   an.

                                                                                      engaged

engaged in a combination with hydrogen.                  Argil is the sub
stance which best decomposes atmospheric air, and so com
pounds azot ; and this agrees pretty well with the experiments
of Humboldt.         This property of argil explains the necessity
of its presence in artificial nitre-beds, and gives us reason to
think that Wiegleb and Wurzer are not altogether deceived
when they think of converting aqueous vapour into azotic
gas.    You must have remarked in my experiments on this
conversion, that I could not account properly for the large
quantity of gas which I frequently happened to collect.
    Stormy rains may be means employed by Nature to free
atmospheric air from that excess of oxygen continually flow
ing into it from plants, by combining into water a part of the
two   gases of which it is composed.              This much is certain,
that the uniform mixture of two fluids of densities so different
as those of azotic and oxygen gas, has always led me to sus
pect an union      of  these two gases.
    In a word,   if  the discovery     of Girtanner    shall be confirmed
it will enable us to account for the almost total disappearance
of azot during the decomposition of nitre by sire.
   M. Girtanner persists in maintaining, that hydrogen is the
radical of the muriatic acid, but this hydrogenic acid contains
less oxygen than water.          The experiments which I opposed
to my friend * all tend        either to oxygenate that liquid or to
de-oxygenate the acid.            I followed an opposite course to
Girtanner, but which was pointed out to me by himself, who
at that time considered the muriatic acid as oxygenated water.
   Trommsc'orsf was not wrong when he informed me f, that
there would perhaps be more hope of discovering the radicals
of  undecomposed       acids, by endeavouring rather to oxygenate
than to de-oxygenate these substances.
    I am not yet acquainted with the experiments of M. Gir
tanner, but I have already made a mixture of hydrogen gas
and oxygen gas, in the proportion mentioned, without ob
taining azotic gas.                                J.  B.  VAN MONS,

JP  O R the discovery of this useful vine, we are, I believe,
indebted  to Mr. Howison, late surgeon at Pullo-pinang; but
it would appear he had no opportunity of determining its
botanical character. To Doctor Charles Campbell; of Fort
Marlborough,                   we owe the gratification arising from                  a   know-      •
                          ¦
ledge thereof.
  About twelve months ago I received from that gentleman,
by means of Mr. Fleming, very complete specimens, in full
foliage, flower, and fruit.                       From these       I   was enabled         to re
duce it to its class and order in the Linnæan                                    system.        It
forms    a   new genus in the class Pentarldria, and order Mono-
gynia,       and comes in immediately after Tabernœmontana,
consequently            belongs to the thirtieth natural order, or class
called Contort          a by Linnæus in his natural method of classi
fication or arrangement.     One of the qualities of the plains
of this order    their yielding, on being cut,
                        is',                      juice which            a                      is
generally milky, and lor the most part deemed of poisonous                       a
nature.
   The generic name Urccola, which        have given              I                       to this
plant,   from
          is   the structure  of  the corol,  and the                                     specific
name from the quality of its thickened juice.
   So far as    I       can find,      it    does not appear lh.it ever this vine
has been taken notice                  of    by   anv European till now.                  I   have
carefully looked         llortus Malabaricus, Rumphius'a
                                over   the
Herbarium Amboine/ije, ccc. kc. figures of Indian plants,
without being able lo lind any one that can with any decree
of certainty be referred to. A substance of the same nature,
and probably the very same, was discovered in the island of
Mauritius          by   M. I'oivre,          and    from thence          sent to France          ;
but,    so   far as I          know,   we arc still ignorant             of   the plant that
yields it.

    The impropriety of giving         to Caout-cbouc the         term    gum,
 resin,  or gum-resin,       every one seems sensible of, as it pos
sesses  qualities totally different from all such substances as
are usually arranged under thole generic names; yet it still
continues, by most authors I have                 met   with,   to be deno
minated elastic resin or elastic gum.              Some term        it simply
Caout-cbouc,      which    I  wish may be considered         as the   generic
name    of  all such concrete     vegetable juices (mentioned in this
memoir)     as  possess elasticity, inflammability,         and are soluble
in the essential oils, without the assistance of heat.
    In  a  mere    definition it would be improper to state what
qualities the object does not possess; consequently, it must:
be understood that this substance is not soluble in the men*
ilruums which usually dissolve resins and gums.
    East- India Caout-ckouc would be a very proper specific
name for that of Urceela clajlica, were there not other trees
which yield juices so similar as to come under the fame ge
neric character; but as this is really the cafe, I will apply
the name of the tree which yields it for a specific one.

   It contains much combustible matter, burning entirely
away, with a clear flame, emitting a considerable deal of
dark- coloured smoke, which readily condenses into a large
proportion of exceeding fine foot, or lamp-black ; at the fame
time it gives but little smell, and that not disagreeable : the
combustion is often  so rapid as to cause drops of a black li
quid, very like tar, to fall from the burning mass ; this is
equally inflammable with the rest, and continues when cold
in its semi-fluid state, but totally void of elasticity : in Ame
rica, the Caout-cbouc is used for torches ; ours appears to be
equally sit for that purpose. Exposed in a silver spoon to a
heat about equal to that which melts lead or tin, it is re
duced into a thick, black, inflammable liquid, such as drops
from it during combustion, and is equally deprived of its
elastic powers, consequently rendered unfit for those purposes
for which its original elasticity rendered it so proper.

glutinous.  Spirits of wine, added to the solution in Cajeput
oil, soon united with the oil, and left the Caout-cbouc float
ing on the mixture in soft semi-fluid state, which, on being
                                        a

great, that each end instantaneously returned to its respective

they never had been separated, and without any clamminess

 wine, consequently remained obstinately united to the for
 mer, which prevented its being brought into that state of
firmness     fit for handling,      which   it acquired when Cajeput
 oil was the menstruum.
    The Cajeput solution employed            as  a varnish did not dry,
but remained moist and clammy, whereas the turpentine
solution dried pretty fast.
    Expressed oil of olives and linseed proved imperfect men-
struums while cold, as the Caout-cbouc, in several days, was
only rendered soft, and the oils viscid, but with a degree of
heat equal to that which melts tin, continued for about
twenty-five minutes, it was perfectly dissolved,             but the solu
tion remained thin, and void of elasticity.                I also found it
soluble in wax and in butter in the same degree of heat; but
still these solutions were without elasticity, or any appearance
of being    useful.
    I shall    now conclude what        I  have to offer on the Caout
chouc, or Urceola elajlica,        with observing, that      some philo
sophers   of eminence       have    entertained doubts of the Ame
rican   Caout-cbouc       being a simple vegetable substance, and
suspect    it   to  be  an  artificial production; an idea which I
hope the above detailed experiments will help to eradicate,
and consequently, to restore the histories          of that  substance by
M. De      la Condaniine       and others, to that degree         of credit
to which        they seem justly entitled;      in support    of which it
may be further observed, that, besides Urceola elajlica, there
are many other trees, natives of the torrid zone, that vield
a  milky juice, postesling qualities nearly of the fame nature,

its qualities,     as  well as   thole of Jicits  Indica and artocarpus
integrifolia, by experiments similar to those above related,
and found them triflingly elastic when compared with the
American and Urceola Cuoul-cboucs, but infinitely more
viscid than either ; they are also inflammable, though in a
less degree,       and   show   nearly the same phenomena when
                                                                 immersed

   fame Still upwards of Four Hundred and Eighty Times

I   N   our last Number we gave some account of the progress
of the distillery business in Scotland ; of the improvements
that had been recently introduced there in the construction
of the stills ; and of the causes that led to these improve
ments.
    A  memorial,         presented     to a Committee        of  the House of
Commons          by Dr. Jeffrey, who was appointed by the Lords
of the Treasury to examine the works of the distillers ia
Scotland,       contains much curious and useful information on
this subject ; and, indeed, the whole of the Reports of the
Committees           on the Scotch Distilleries          in  1798   and 1709
are extremely interesting.
    The   still    described    in our last was       a great  improvement ;
but the one we are about to describe                     is so powerful  that
hardly any evidence             short of that with which the fact is
supported, could make it credible.                But the evidence is com
plete;    for   it  is that  of  the  distillers themselves, whose interest
it evidently was to depreciate rather than over-rate the
power of their stills, the duty paid on the content of the still
having been from time to time increased in proportion to
the acquired dexterity with which they were able to work
it off.
    We    have already mentioned, that the first grand improve
ment was that of increasing the width and diminishing the
depth of the still, by which a greater surface was exposed to

the action os the sire, and consequently a quicker evaporation
produced. To lessen the possibility of the still running foul,
and to hasten the escape and consequent condensation of the
vapour, seemed to be the only points necessary to the per
fecting of the process.
   Dr. Jeffrey describes a still which seems well calculated to
answer       every     end   that can be desirable        in   such an utensil.
It   was constructed by        Mr. Millar, a Scotch distiller of great
ingenuity.           Dr. Jeffrey called Mr. Millar's notice to the
giving the free and most direct escape to the steam.
                                                      " After
mentioning to him," fays Dr. Jeffrey,
                                          "  that M. Beaume
had contrived a still that had many apertures in the head,
and that he had found that the more of these openings he
made the faster did the distillation go on, Mr. Millar set about
constructing another very flat still, on the principle of giving
exit to the steam at as many points in the shoulder of the
still             Fig. 1 . Plate V. is a bird's-eye view of the

was evident           that the principle on which the shoulder was
constructed          was just; for, though the body and head held 52
or 53 gallons only, the still could work with 22 gallons of
wash,    the workmen were careful
          if                         but Readily, and without

     The following description of the mode of carrying on the
 process of distillation at Cannon Mills, near Edinburgh, in
 1798, before the improvements had been carried to their
 present pitch, will serve to give our readers some idea of the
 expertness and steady regularity        of  the people employed    : —
     In this work    there are two stills generally used tor distilling
 wash ; these stills contain fifty-five       or fifty-fix gallons in the
 body, and twenty-nine         in the head of each 5 arc charged with
 wash up to the fight-hole,         which may be within four or sivt
 gallons of    the full content    of the body.      A very strong fire is
 put into the furnace below the stills ; there are a quantity of
 iron chains affixed to a spindle, which a man, who stands on
 the top of the furnace, turns round, and the chains sweep
 round on the bottom of the inside of the still all the time
 that the wafli is coming to boil, and when the spent wash is
 running ofl". If the wash stiould rile up too tar in the act of
 boiling, and which is known bv a man who keeps striking
  the head of the ttill with        a stick,   he gives the alarm to an
  other man, whose sole business is to attend the furnace, and
  who instantly dashes a pailfull of cold water on the bottom of
  the still, and on the fire, which causes the wash to fall down ;
  the lire is then stirred up to a very strong heat, and this pro
   cess gees on     till the steam is condensed,       and tiie low wines
   run off clear. There is another man who attends at the end ot
   the worm, where the low wines run off into a receiver, who
  is called    the ball-man,      and who, with      an instrument, exa
   mines the low wines       as they  run off; and when he finds there
   is no more spirit remaining in them, calls out lei go, upon
   which every man employed about the still is at his post. He
                                                                        who

                         introduced      by the Scotch      Dijlillers.                  165
who attends the discharge cock turns it about, and the spent
wash runs instantly off; which done, he gives the signal to
the man on the top of the furnace, who having opened the
sight-hole, turns the charging cock, and fills the still as before
with fresh wash ; the furnace-man dashing in coals, and the
other man turning all the time the iron-work round ; and the
fame process goes on again day and night, and the discharg
ing the spent wash,                   and renewing      the charge, is done              in   a
few seconds.
   The low wine                 still is wrought much in the fame way,                   with
this difference,              that the fore-shot,     as   it is called, which is the
first    of the spirits that           come off,   is kept from the spirits, and
returned back into the next or some succeeding operation, as
are also the faints or spent low wines; the discharge of the
spirits is likewise attended by a ball-man, who moves a cock
placed in a receiver for receiving each separate kind, and
which is done in the twinkling of an eve.
    "     It   has been proposed,"             says     Dr. Jeffrey,       "   to    adapt     a
steam-engine to a still. There is no difficulty in effecting
this : it may be said to be already accomplislied, for Mr.
Cartwright's steam-engine is a still and steam-engine con
joined ; and it may be also observed, that a steam-engine
 fitted to a Scotch fast-going still would have great power ;
 for the quantity of steam that rises from these stills in a given
 time is prodigious.    Such an engine could grind the malt,
 turn the mash-stirring machine, work the pumps, &c. and
 it     is,
         think, likewise obvious, that under survey
          I                                           would                         it
 aid the excise in detecting frauds  for   would show when
                                                    ;          it
 the still was at work.               But however convenient and econo
 mical such              a   steam-engine-still might be in England, wheie
 the distiller may work when and how he pleases,        never can              it
 be profitably used in Scotland, where the distiller works against
 time.   For, as the steam would be pent up  the still during         in
 the half of the time the beam of the engine makes stroke,                          a
 the distiller would lose that time                 :      besides, as the heat accu
 mulates            in   the wash when the steam             is   not allowed to escape,
it      is     to   be       feared   that the sediment            would be frequently
               of course the spirit produced would
 singed, and that                                                                   be tainted
 with empyreuma."

      X IIIS        question     is   of the   utmost   importance to the phi
  losopher      as    well as the astronomer; and the more so at the -
  present    period, as the dispute             between   the so-called    Atmo-
  spherians        and Auti-atmospherians,            which    has been     conti
  nued     ever since the beginning              of this century,     is not yet
  ended.        It   relates    in particular      to  the atmosphere      of    the
  moon, which was                so   strenuously    maintained by Plutarch.
  But it would         be as ridiculous       to refer the contest     to reason,
  as  if we sliould      endeavour       to give a decisive opinion respecting^
 a circumstance with              which we are totally unacquainted.              It
 is certain that nothing                 on this point can be determined
 a priori; and therefore such conclusions as are drawn from
 analogy must be considered as decisive.                     The fenses mast
 here be our guide ; but it is much to be lamented, that our
 organs arc often too weak, and our instruments too imper
 fect, notwithstanding the great precision to which the latter
 have been carried in modern times.
      But we       must    first endeavour       to establish what we mean
in     general     by the term atmosphere.            By atmosphere, I un
derstand       that delicate         subtile  body which immediately sur
rounds the planets, and which is mixed with those heteroge
neous particles dissolved on their surfaces, or which evaporate
from them.            By this definition it is evident, that, according
as the nature of the planet, and the particles dissolved on its
surface, are different, the atmospheres               must necessarily be     dif
ferent also      ;   so that, by knowing          the physical nature of the
surface of any of the planets,               we   can form a conclusion re
specting     the    nature    of   its atmosphere,    and vice versa. Of thja
we have       a sufficient number of instances in regard to the
earth.      Let us here only compare the pure air of the dry-
districts of Arabia with the air of marsliy watery districts,
which is continually filled with vapours, clouds, and rain, and
we sliall soon be convinced of the truth of this position. But

whether each of the planets is surrounded by such a subtile
mass or not, is another question, which our experience                   hi
therto has left in the greatest uncertainty, and respecting
which    we can form only probable conclusions a priori.
    If we consider the heavenly bodies at the period of their
formation,       it must     naturally    occur,    that, when created,
they must have had atmospheres ; for, as loon as the fixed
stars began to burn, let their substance be what it might, a
great many particles must have thereby been disengaged from
them, and have formed a kind of atmospheres.                 Now, if each
of these fixed stars is surrounded by a certain number of pla»
pets, its action on them must have separated from them abun
dance    of particles, which, on account of their levity, would
immediately ascend and form atmospheres around them : but
as the disengaged particles could not all have the fame gravity,
the lighter would rife to a greater height than the heavier;
and, on that account, the rarity of these atmospheres must
have increased according as the distance from the planet was
greater.      The different aqueous, earthy, saline, sulphureous,
and mineral particles form therefore in the air, belonging
to each planet, what ought properly to be called its atmo
sphere     .
    That   the sun has an atmosphere          is admitted by all the mo
dern astronomers.          Peyroux de la Coudrcniere         has   in parti
 cular asserted, in modern times, and his opinion has been
almost universally adopted, that the sun is not a ball of fire,
 but that his light comes entirely from a luminous atmosphere
 by which he is surrounded, and which is filled with a highly
 inflammable vapour that forms a continual coverii.g of sire.
 According to him, therefore, the fun is a prodigious burning
 mirror, which can effect with less waste much inore than it
 could do were it      a  globe of sire. M. Schriitcr concludes also,
 from his observations, that the light of the fun arises from the
 luminous matter by which he is surrounded ; so that hopes
 are entertained     that, in the course of time, by making fre-

 1 68       On the Question, whether the Sun, Moon, and
quent observations of the spots and faculæ, we shall be abte
 to obtain a chart of the fun, as we have obtained one of the
moon : for, according to this hypothesis, the spots of the fun
are not clouds and thick vapours that arise from the opaque
bodyof the solar orb. According to Peyroux de la Coudreniere,
ail the planets are still approaching nearer to the nature of
the fun ; and, in his opinion, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn,
would not exhibit such a luminous appearance were they en
lightened merely by the fun.           He concludes, therefore, that
abundance of inflammable vapour must ascend into their at
mospheres, and, by* taking fire, increase their light.                 Ac
cording to him, our earth acquires a considerable light from
a like cause : and this indeed is not altogether improbable;
for I myself, with a telescope of a great magnifying power,
have frequently observed the heavens, by day as well as night,
for this purpose alone, and have seen, in a quarter of an hour,
a great many inflammations of this kind in the atmosphere.
Peyroux de la Coudreniere, however, goes too far when he
believes that Saturn, the remotest of the planets, seems as if
inclining to remove from our system altogether ; to convert
himself into a sun, and to have planets revolving around
him. This conceit is sufficiently refuted by the discovery of
Uranus (the Georgium fidus) by Pr. Herschel.
    Upon the whole, we have no certain grounds on which
we can reason respecting the atmospheres of the planets.
Because our earth has one, and is a planet, it does not thence
follow that the     rest must have atmospheres.          We indeed find
every   where   in  nature  the   greatest diversity   and   variety ; and
if we always formed conclusions from analogy, we should fall
into the greatest absurdities and errors.
    M. Schroter, from the alternate obscurity and bright ap
pearance of Jupiter, which he has observed, thinks himself
authorised to conclude, that the atmosphere of Jupiter, in
genera!,    has a great similarity to ours *.        It is very remark
able, adds he, that the whitish and light zones are not al
ways perfectly bright, but in common seem to be covered
with   a   thin  atmospheric matter, and to have sometimes a
more luminous appearance than at others.                It is not impro-

 babie that the surface of Jupiter may reflect a very lively and
 white light, according to the nature of its component parts,
 with which we are unacquainted. The stripes observed on
 the surface of that planet lie in a position parallel to his equa
 tor  ; are subject  to a great many variations ; and,         in general,
 are considered to arise from atmospheric            matter liable to ac
 cidental changes.       The fame thing may be conjectured in
 regard to Saturn, on which there are stripes of the fame
 kind, according to the late discoveries of Dr. Herschel. But
 in  regard to the atmospheres of Mercury, Venus, Mars, and
 Uranus, our conclusions must be attended with still ,less cer
tainty.     If they have any, they must be far more subtile, and
finer, than that of our earth ; else these bodies would not al
ways appear with so much brightness. The existence of an
atmosphere around Mars has, indeed, been rendered highly
probable by Dr. Herschel and Mr. Schroter ; and the latter
 thinks he observed a crepusculum of 15 '{ ° in Venus, which
seems to suppose that it has an atmosphere *.
    In  regard to comets,     I  can  the less venture to hazard any
assertions,   as some   of our modern philosophers          consider them
to be merely nebulous bodies j          I  sliall therefore  confine what
I have to fay, to the moon, which still remains to be taken
into consideration, and respecting the atmosphere of which
there has been the most dispute.              Towards the end of the
sixteenth    century it was strenuously           maintained by Kepler.
 In the seventeenth the same opinion                was   entertained   by
Kircher, Scheiner, Mostlin, Fabricius,               Bulliald,  Hevelius,
&c.      In the present it has been         adopted by Louville, Ma-
raldi,    Fontenelle,    Bianchini, Carbone, Wolf, Bol'covich,
Euler,    Du Scjour, Herschel, Schroter, &c.              Those who op
posed this opinion were, Huyghens,             Caffini, Malezien, Dc la
Hire, De Tide, Mylius, Tobias Mayer, Grandjean de Pou
chy, 80c.
    Those who maintain that the moon has an atmosphere
found their opinion on the following grounds : —
    1. During total eclipses of the fun, a light ring has been
seen around the moon parallel to her limb.                   This pheno-

tnenon was observed, in particular, during those remarkable
total eclipses of the fun in the years 1706 and 17 15. That
of   the  1 2th  of May 1706 was observed in London by Hal-
ley ; in Paris, by Caffini and De la Hire ; at Montpellier, by
De Plantade; at Berlin, by Hofmann; at Leipfic, by Baron
Vpn Wolf; at Dresden, by Tschirnhausen ; at Nuremberg,
by Wurzelbau ; at Jena, by Hamberger ; at Zeitz, by Teu-
 ber; and at Breflau, by P. Heinrich.
     On this occasion Caffini, De la Hire, De Plantade, Wolf,
Wurzelbau and Heinrich observed, during the greatest
 darkness, a light ring around the moon; but, on the other
 hand, Hofmann and Teuber perceived nothing of the kind ;
 and those who saw the ring differ very much from each other
 in   the accounts thev have given       of its magnitude and colour.
     The eclipse of the sun on the 3d of May 17 15 was observed
 at London by Halley and Louville in particular, and a ring
 of the same kind was observed.            Rings of the like kind have
 been observed also at various periods.
     2. Many astronomers observe, that the planets sometimes
 when they approach the moon's limb have a coloured ap
  pearance, change their round figure, and seem to assume that
 of an   ellipse.   It has often happened     that a planet at its ingref-
 fion has appeared perfectly round, and at its egression quite
  distorted ; or, vice versa, distorted at its ingreffion, and round
  on its egression.      The latter cafe I once observed myself, in
  regard to Venus ; the former was seen,            in regard to  Jupiter,
  by M. Kastner at Leipsic.            This phenomenon takes place
  not only with the planets but also with the fixed stars, as is
  proved by a multitude of instances both old and new ; so that
  it seems to be a fact established beyond all dispute.
      3. It is said to have been remarked during solar eclipses,
  that the limb of the fun trembles before the moon entirely
  touches it.
      4. The diameter of the moon is said to have been observed
   small at the beginning and end       of the darkness during eclipses,
   and greater    at  the time  of the greatest darkness.    On this cir
   cumstance      Teuber founds      his proof for the existence of a
   lunar atmosphere.         Euler, from the diameter of the sun ap
                                                                   pearing

                   other heavenly            Bodies, have Atmospheres.                           171
pearing to be magnified during the annular solar eclipse of
1748, concluded also that the moon has an atmosphere*.
  5. The moon, during serene weather, when stars of the
seventh magnitude could be seen, has totally disappeared,                                          so
that (he could not be discovered by the best telescopes.     Se
veral instances of this kind are related by Kepler in his Astro-
nomtæ pars   opticaf, and by Copernicus in his Epitome of
Astronomy J. The fame thing was observed by Hevelius,
Riccioli, &c. It is worthy of remark, that at the time when
the moon disappeared to Riccioli, she disappeared suddenly
also in Holland.
   6. Several astronomers                     have found that the moon does not
always appear equally bright and clear. Hevelius fays, that
at various times, though the weather was equally serene;
though the moon had the same altitude, and was at the fame
distance from the earth ; and though he used the same tele
scopes, her spots did not appear equally bright and distinct,
but were more apparent at some times than at others. The
fame thing was observed by Erasmus Francisci,                                      and   Bulliald;
and before them, by                   Mostlin.
   7. Fiery phenomena have been seen on the moon; and
from this circumstance some have concluded that she has an
atmosphere.                 Kolben      saw in 1705, not far from                        the line,
thirty hours after new moon, the two horns of that luminary
touch each other ; so that she formed, as it were, a bright
ring.   It is related in the Breflau Collections §, that some
people          saw     the    moon, the day after she had been new, as
bright        as   if   she   had been full ; and Siegesbec says, in the fame
work   that in 1^24, two days after new moon, he saw the
          ||,
same phenomenon as that observed     Kolben.                  by
  From all these circumstances    might be concluded thatit
the moon has an atmosphere    but to these grounds, others,
                                                  ;
perhaps equally strong, might be opposed.   These proofs for
the other fide of the question may be found in Mylius's

 Thoughts on the Lunar Atmosphere*,         and T. Mayer's
 Proofs that the Moon has no Atmosphere t : but, without
 transcribing them, I shall here give a short view of them,
 and       in     the same order as          I   have related the grounds on which
 the opinion            of
                        the lunar atmosphere is founded.
         In   regard to the bright ring (i) which has appeared round
 the moon during total solar eclipses, it is evident that, even
 if we admit that the moon has an atmosphere, it mull have
 been occasioned by its refraction. But experience has shown
that bright rings of the like kind are produced around all
opaque bodies when they are placed opposite the fun or any
strong light.  This was found to be the cafe by De la Hire,
who opposed this circumstance to the opinion of Louville,
who was             a strenuous       advocate for the lunar atmosphere.                        For
this purpose he took an unpolished globe of stone, and, placing
it between his eye and the fun, saw the interior edge of the
ring, which              was       formed around         it,   broken and uneven,                as
Louville           had seen     part of the ring around the
                                   the interior
moon.     A like experiment was made          De l'lfle junior.   by
He caused the rays of the fun to pass through small hole                       a
into   darkened room
          a             held   circular piece of lead between
                                     ;            a
him and the fun and observed, on
                              ;         sheet of white paper,a
that the shadow of the lead was evidently surrounded                                        by   a
luminous ring       John Caffini explained the ring seen
                          J.
around the moon during total eclipses of the fun from the
                                                                                        it by
solar atmosphere; and this was carried still farther        De
Plantade.   But this explanation      not necessary, as is ap
pears that the whole phenomenon may be explained as well,
if not much better, from refraction.      Du Sejour, however,
is of opinion, that refraction of the fun's rays at the moon's
limb cannot be admitted unless we first admit lunar atmo                   a
sphere    and he shows, from Short's Observation of the Solar
              :
Eclipse in 1764, that the refraction of the sun's rays which
touched the moon's limb amounted to 4^".

    One of the latest instances of such a ring around the moon
is that seen on the 24th of June 1778, by Don Antonio de
 Ulloa, between Tercera and Cape St. Vincent *.                    Five or
fix seconds after the fun was completely covered, a very
bright    ring began to be seen around the moon; and this
ring    seemed to be      in a continual and violent motion round
the moon's circumference.             The  nearer the moon approached
to the centre      of the fun,   it always became brighter and more
luminous.        Its colour was not every where the fame : next
to the moon's limb it was reddish             ; then of a pale or gold-
yellow colour ; and towards the exterior edge it always be
came whiter : but it was every where equally luminous and
beautiful.       All the parts of the ring seemed to be carried
round the moon with the same velocity, without the order of
the colours being confounded. Every thing before observed,
in  regard to this luminous ring, might be explained from re
fraction ; but the circumstance, never observed on any other
occasion,    of  its moving with a continual and uniform motion
around its centre, if this was actually the cafe, and if it did
not arise from some deception in the organs of sight, makes
a  new, and, according to every appearance, an almost insu
perable difficulty      in the explanation. It is much to be la
mented that we are likely to remain in this uncertainty a
considerable time ; for, according to a calculation of M. Du
Vaucel    fj   a total eclipse   of  the  sun, visible at Paris,   will not
take place for       iao  years,   and none can occur visible       in any
part of Europe till the year 1816 J. From the above obser
vation Don Antonio de Ulloa does not hesitate to conclude
that the moon has an atmosphere.
    I shall now proceed to the second point, adduced as a proof

 174         0" Æ*    Question, whether the Sun, Moon,       and
of the moon having an           atmosphere.     Some suspicion is ex
cited   in  regard to the accuracy of this observation,          because
many astronomers, during the fame celestial occurrences at
other times, have never observed the smallest change of
figure in the stars either during their ingress or egress.           De
la Hire *, however, observed, during an occultation of Ju
piter by the moon, that when Jupiter was at the distance of
iz'   from the moon, he showed the same lively colours as
when he approached nearer. But, to make these colours
appear,    it was necessary that Jupiter should be at the edge of
the aperture of the telescope ; for when he was in the middle
of it none     were seen.    From this circumstance         he naturally
concludes, that the colours did not proceed from the moon,
but from the glasses of the telescope, which, as they are
convex, form at their edges        a fort of circular prism.     Venus,
which appeared soon after, exhibited the fame colours as
Jupiter.       T. Mayer, therefore, gives this excellent rule :
Make the experiment without prejudice, and take care to use
the telescope with the necessary precaution : it will then,
perhaps, be found, that the planets and fixed stars approach
the moon at all times in their proper form. De l'Isle ascribed
this phenomenon to the inflexion of the rays alone .          f
    We now come        to the third argument adduced        in favour of
the lunar atmosphere,        or the  tremulous   motion    of  the fun's
limb before he touches the moon during a solar eclipse. This
undoubtedly arises from our atmosphere alone ; and we have
so many instances of such quivering on other occasions, that
I do not     think it necessary to fay any thing farther respecting
it.    This is certainly one of the weakest proofs advanced in
favour of a lunar atmosphere.
    In regard to the fourth proof,         that the diameter of the
moon at the        commencement and end of eclipses has been
observed to be smaller, and at the time of the greatest dark
ness to be greater, it appears to be almost void of foundation ;
and indeed we have more instances of such a phenomenon not
being seen, than of its being observed.              During the total

              vlher heavenly Bodies, have Atmospheres.               175
solar eclipse     of 1669, nothing of the kind was discovered ;
and this was the cafe in regard to that of 1706, which Hof-
niann observed at Berlin. Tobias Mayer, also, during the
great total eclipse of the sun in 1748, though he made his
observation with the utmost attention, could perceive no such
thing.
     I  must   now     say a few   words respecting the fifth and sixth
proofs.       The cause of both these phenomena lies, no doubt,
in our atmosphere, and not in that of the moon ; for the
phenomena have been seen in one place and                    not in an
other.
     These are the grounds on which the existence of the lunar
atmosphere may be contested : but it appears to me, that we
 should decide       too rashly were we to deny altogether that the
 moon has an atmosphere ; for we may still admit one, though
 it may be of such a nature as to elude our fenses. There
 are many things in nature which our imperfect organs of
 fense are incapable of perceiving ; but it would be ridiculous
 on that account to deny their existence.             I need only request
 the reader to recollect the phenomena of general gravity or
 attraction, magnetism, &c. This much, at any rate, is cer
 tain, that if the moon has an atmosphere, it must be of a
 nature totally different from that of our earth. This will
 appear the more evident, if we consider that, according to all
  the observations       hitherto made,    the moon does not abound
  with such     seas and rivers as    our earth.    M. Schriiter conjec
  tures, that as the moon,        in regard to the fun, turns round her
  axis only once       in  39 days 12 hours, this monthly change of
  day and night may probably have a considerable influence on
  the lunar atmosphere, and supply the place of our seasons.
  Of this he is the more convinced by the monthly change in
  the colour and spots of the moon which he has remarked.
  The     atmosphere      of the moon     must be different from that   of
  the earth,     not only in regard to its brightness and transpa
  rency, but also in regard to its power of weakening and break
  ing the rays of light. But on this subject nothing decisive can
   be obtained from all the observations         hitherto made *.

 the atmospheres             of       the celestial bodies            we know very little         ;

acuteness        of fight,        and     good    instruments, will endeavour to
determine this point, for which no person seems fitter than

bark as       a   substitute          for galls; and the examination of his
process      was referred              by the Government first to Macquer,
who gave   favourable report of the result, and afterwards to

fame stuff and the fame size, had been prepared with all the
precautions which each of the two methods required, and
the whole process was carefully observed by a commissioner
who attended for the purpose.          After all these hats had been
properly dried, cleaned, and brushed, they were placed in
discriminately on a table. Several of the most expert dyers
of Paris were invited to select, from the twenty-four hats, the
twelve which should appear to them to be the best dyed.
These dyers arrived separately at two different times, so that
there were two selections ; and in both cafes, one hat ex
cepted,   these dyers   pointed out as the best dyed those hats
which had been treated with oak bark. Was any thing
more necessary to determine which method deserved the
preference    ?  The  fate  of this new     process  however, which
to success   in the operation of dyeing, unites economy, and
the advantage of freeing us from paying tribute to a foreign
nation, has remained       in  a state of uncertainty.
    " One of the    strongest objections which has been made to
dyeing black with       oak   bark, is the considerable     difference
                                                                        *
between    the quantities   of  the precipitates  ; and we must fay,
for the information      of  those unacquainted with the subject,
that the black matter of the dye, of which we here speak,
results from the combination of an acid, called the gallic,
with iron; and in the operation we are describing, the quan
tity of this acid is generally determined by knowing how
many parts of iron (furnished by sulphat of iron, commonly
called green copperas,) have gone into a known quantity of
the precipitate t the remaining parts which are necessary to
make up the known quantity are counted as gallic acid.
    " If the decoction of a given quantity of gall nuts be poured
on a solution of the sulphat of iron, you obtain a bjack pre
cipitate ; and if the same operation be performed with a de
coction of oak bark, and in the same quantities, you will
have also a black precipitate, with this difference, that the
gall nuts will have produced eight or ten times as much as
the oak bark : but this abundance in the gall nuts is only
apparent, and is owing to a sort of feculent matter, or gum,
which adheres to the acid and is carried down with the pre-

  cipitate, where it cannot but diminish the intensity of the
 black.        In a word, to be convinced of these truths, it will
 be sufficient to give a comparative view of the two processes,
 and of their results.        We shall suppose, therefore, a kettle for
 twentv-sive dozen of hats,          as is the cafe    in several manusac-
 torics.      That quantity will require twenty-five pounds of gall
  nuts and the like quantity of fulphat of iron, about 150 or
  200 pounds of logwood, and twelve pounds of acetat of cop
  per (verdegris), and from 100 to 125 pails of water.                    The
 gall nuts and logwood must be boiled for about six or eight
  hours, which will reduce the decoction to about a third.
 The     sire is  then diminished, to throw in, portion by portion,
 the fulphat       of iron and the verdegris.           In this manner the
 bath is prepared,         and you plunge into it the felt or hats,
 which       are to be drawn        out and again immersed different
 times,      as experience    has shown that atmospheric air contri
 butes a great deal towards the efficacy of the operation of the
 dve. There is some difference in the method of manipula
 tion  ;   but this depends on the practices followed in different
 manufactories : in regard to the doses, they are nearly every
•where the fame.
     "   The method of Dimo Stephanopoli consists merely in
 substituting oak bark in the stead of gall nuts in the proportion
 of a half, that is to fay, twelve pounds and a half instead of
twenty-sive.          It requires no other preparation before it is
 employed than to be cut, or coarsely broke.
     " This bark furnishes a dye much fuller,                as  well as more
beautiful and more durable; and the operation becomes much
easier, for it is not subject to what is called burning.                  It is
free from an immense quantity of sediment, which is found
 in the bath when gall nuts are employed, and which com
municates a dust that can be removed only by a rod or
 brush, which, however, requires                tedious    and troublesome
 labour.
     "   By forming      an estimate at the usual prices, in the opera
 tion above mentioned, the gall nuts employed cost 75 francs,
 and the oak bark 14 sous*.             Janin, in the street Avoie, pro
prietor of one of the largest hat manufactories at Paris, and

 who dyes twenty-five dozen of hats at a time, has emptoyed
 for ten years, with constant success, the process of Stepha-
 nopoli.    He assures us, that from his own experience oak
 bark deserves in every respect to be preferred to gall nuts.
  , Morel, hatter, near the
                                   gate of St. Martin, one of those
 who first employed the process of Stephanopoli, has never
 discontinued it. Huaut, in the street des Mencstriers,' had
 formed an establishment for dyeing hats, but for want of
 proper encouragement he was on the point of abandoning
 his enterprise.    Morel, however, advised him to pay a visit
 to Stephanopoli, from whom he obtained the process j, and
 since that time he has succeeded.             He declares that he is
 under the greatest obligations to Morel, and the author of
this new method.         He regularly heats a kettle of 300 hats
every twenty-four       hours.      Both Janin and Morel have for
 several years past received many letters from their customers
 respecting the beauty and durability of the dye of their hats,
 and, according to their declaration, only since they employed
 oak bark.
    "  It results from what has been said, that oak bark is pre
 ferable, in every respect, to gall nuts : that, being a produc
 tion of our own foil, it will free us from paying tribute to
 foreigners; and that a scarcity of gall nuts, or accidents
 which    may happen to prevent a supply of that article, can
 no longer hurt the manufacture of hats in France, which is
 of so much importance, and that of wool dyed black, &c.
    " We    have not entered into all the details which this sub
ject would admit      ;  it is susceptible  of  great extension,  and,
 in many respects,    may be considered       as new.    It cannot   be
 doubted   that the operation called galling might be performed
 with  oak bark,    and it is to be regretted that the researches of
 Lapalle, Member of the Constituent Assembly, on this object
 were not published.
    " The use    of oak bark was already known in some branches
 of dyeing,   and this use      of it had been mentioned by several
 authors.    To conclude      :  We   are certain that, in the dispute
 respecting oak bark and gall nuts, the views           of each  party
 were equally pure    ;  but experience alone was able to remove
 every difficulty,   and the Assembly must have seen that there

    XIV.     Some     Account     of the late     Peter Charles
                             Le Monnier.
JL eter Charles Le Monnier,                         the oldest astronomer
in  Europe at the time        of his death, which happened on           the
ad of April 1799, at           Lizieux in Normandy, was bom               at
Paris   on   the   20th   of  November       1715.     At  a very early pe
riod of life he applied to the study of astronomy, and made
his first observation of the opposition of Saturn on the 23d of
September 1731, when he was only sixteen.                    At the age of
twenty   he   was   chosen    a member      of the  Academy os Sciences
at Paris.     In 1735 he was sent to Lapland, along with Mau-
pertuis,  to  measure     a degree of the earth.       In 1748 he accom
panied Lord Macclesfield to Scotland to observe the annular
eclipse of the sun, which could be seen with most advantage
in that country ; and he was the first astronomer who had
the pleasure of measuring the diameter of the moon on the
 sun's disk.
    Louis XV. who          was   fond of and patronised astronomy,
 showed a great esteem for Le Monnier.                  When his Majesty
wished to observe any of the celestial phenomena, he always
 attended him ; and it appears, by the memoirs of the Aca
demy of Sciences at Paris, that the King observed in this
 manner, at his country palace of St. Hubert, both the trans
its of Venus over the fun's disk in the years 1761 and 1769.
 It is worthy of notice, and deserves to. be here recorded, how
 much his Majesty seemed to be interested in the success of
 these observations,       and how careful      he was not to interrupt
 the astronomers      during the course        of their operations. L?
 Monnier, in his       paper on    this subject in the Memoirs of the
 Academy,      say3 :
                      — " His     Majesty perceiving that we consi
 dered the     last contact to be      of  the utmost     importance,    we
 were at that moment surrounded                  by   the   most  profound
                                                                  silence."

          Account    of the   late Peter Charles          Le Monnier.                I Si
silence."        During   the transit       of Venus in         1769, his Majesty
allowed that able naval officer the Marquis de Chabert, who
had just returned from a scientific voyage to the Levant, to
have a share in the observations made on that occasion.
     In
      the year 1750 Le Monnier was requested by the King
to draw a meridian line at the palace of Belle-vue, where he
often made observations ; and his Majesty for this service gave
Le Monnier a present of 15,000 livres (about 600/. sterling).
In  1743 his Majesty gave him a house in Rue de la Paste at
Paris, where he resided and made observations till the period
of   the Revolution.          In
                           1751 the King presented him with a
block of    marble eight feet in height, six in breadth, and fif
teen inches in thickness,      in order that                  he might             it
                                                                              affix to
his five feet     mural quadrant. This large                mass     of marble, with
all the instruments attached                to    it,   moves on         a   large brass
globe,     which the quadrant can be turned from south to
            by
north, and by which the great eight feet mural quadrant,
which    fastened in an immoveable position lo
          is                                   wall front                a
ing   the south, can be adjusted.
     With      these quadrants      Le Monnier, for the Ipace of forty
years,    observed    the moon,        with unwearied attention, at all
hours of the night. No person but                              diligent astronomer
can know to what inconveniences one                     is a            in making
                                                               exposed
an uninterrupted series            of   observations     of    the   moon. As tht
moon, during one revolution, may pass the meridian at every
hour of the day and the night, which     the moment for ob
                                                         is
servation, the astronomer who pursues these observations must
be prepared at all hdfcrs           of    the    day and night,          and sacrifice
fleep and every other enjoyment.
   Le Monnier was Lalande's astronomical preceptor; and
the scholar has, indeed, shown himself worthy of the master.
The discerning mind of Le Monnier could readily foresee in
young Lalande, then only sixteen, what the course of little                      a
lime afterwards confirmed.  In the twentieth year of his age
Lalande, on the recommendation of his preceptor, was elected
a Member of the Royal Academy of Sciences    and     1752,           ;         in
on proposal made
      a                       by
                     him, he was sent to Berlin along with
La Caille, who afterwards undertook                     a     voyage     to the Cape
of Good Hope to make corresponding                       observations,          in   order
                                                                                     .   to

 iZl       /lcmunt     of the late "Peter  dories he Mamturr.
to determine the parallax            of the moon, which never had
been accurately ascertained.           On this occasion Le Monnier
lent to his pupil his fire feet mural quadrant.               His zeal for
the promotion of astronomy was boundless ; and' therefore
 Lalande fays,       in his Notice   des Travaux du C. Le Mcrmier,
"   I myself    am    the  principal result of his zeal for astronomy/*
     Le Monnier was naturally of a very irritable disposition,
 and, though warm in his friendship, was easily offended : in
that cafe his hatred was irreconcileable.            Lalande, as he savs
himself, had the misfortune to incur the displeasure of his
preceptor, for whom he entertained the utmost affection, and
whose good graces he was never able to recover.             But Lalande
never ceased      to (how his esteem and gratitude for him         till the
latest day    of his life.     "I  never ceased   to declare," says La
lande,     " as Diogenes did to his master       Antisthenes, You will
never find a baton sufficiently heavy to drive me away from
you." In the year 1797 Lalande wrote an eulogy on Le
Monnier for the Connoijsance des Terns, annee 9, which dis
played the utmost respect and esteem           of the pupil towards his
preceptor; but Le Monnier would never read it *.
    Hennert, that celebrated geometrician and professor of ma
thematics at Utrecht, may also be considered as a scholar of
Le Monnier,        as appears    by the following extract from one o£
his letters, dated May 26, 1797 : — " Le Monnier is an acute
and philosophic astronomer.            I learned a great deal from him
while I resided at Paris, though I lodged at the house of the
late De l'Isle,        where I often observed with Meffier.              Le
Monnier       was   a great friend of D'Altmlftrt, and consequently
an opponent       of Lalande."
    Le Monnier left behind him a great many valuable ma
nuscripts and a multitude of excellent observations, which he
was very fond of keeping to himself, and which, in the latter
period of his life, he never made known.              Besides others, he
had a series of important observations of the moon, and a
great many observations of (lars, made for a catalogue, which
    *
       It imy  not be improper here to remark,   that Lalande  had a great
friendship and respect for that eminent astronomer La Caille, whom Le
Monnier mort~j.lv hated. Le Monnier and D'Alcrr.bcrt were also great
fsi<:nds, but Lilande had no kind of intimacy with the latter.
                                                                         he

He announced so early as the year 1741,           and among which
 there were two      of the new planet Uranus.     The more   he was
 entreated   to communicate them to the public, the more ob
 stinate he became       in withholding them ; and he even some
 times threatened to destroy them.           When the Revolution-,
broke out, Lalande, who was exceedingly anxious for the
preservation     of   these papers,   made an attempt to get them
into his   possession   ; but his exertions were fruitless. He could
only learn, that Le Monnier had concealed them under the
 roof of his house.        When Le Monnier was attacked by the
first sit of the apoplexy on the 10th of November, Lalande
was therefore afraid that,       as no one but himself knew where^
these papers were hid, the old man, through mental debility,
might forget where he had placed them. Le Monnier left
three daughters, all married ; the second       of whom was mar
 ried to the celebrated mathematician La Grange on the 31st
of May     1792.

    C. Guyton has presented a table of the direct combina
tions of forty-two chemical elements ; that is to fay, of sub
 stances which the chemists have never been able to decom
pose,   and which they must consider         as  simple  till proofs   of
the contrary are obtained. These forty-two substances, com
bined only two by two, give 861 different combinations, with
the half of which we are not yet acquainted. Combining
them three by three, and four by four, paying attention to
the proportions of the constituent parts of each combination,
the number of the latter increases in such a manner as to
excite astonisliment.      One might be inclined to consider our
ignorance respecting      the greater   part of these combinations
as a proof of the imperfection of science ; but so far is this
from being the case, that it is by the immense progress sci
ence has lately made that we are enabled to know that these
combinations are possible.
    Among    the substances with     which modern chemistry has
been lately   enriched   are in  particular some semi-metals, one
of which, by its discoverer, Professor Klaproth of Berlin, has
been called Uranite, from the planet Uranus of Herschel,

  Chemists have given the name of affinity to that power by
which different substances tend to unite with each other, and
which properly forms the object of all their researches ; for
chemistry will never be complete     until we obtain a table of
the degrees of affinity of each substance for all the rest under
given circumstances. What renders it difficult to form such
a table       is,
            that these affinities do not preserve the same order
in all circumstances.       has been long known, for example,
                                      It
that this order varies according to the degrees of heat but                      ;
several other causes, to which chemists have not hitherto
paid sufficient attention, concur also to render   uncertain.          it
C. Berthollet has been employed on this part of chemistry,
and has presented on that subject     work of great labour,
                                                       a                                  a
portion of which he communicated to the Institute of Egypt,
and which proves, that in going to search for new facts in                                a
distant country,             he has been           the occasion    of making new
progress       in    the theory which ought to unite them.
   Among the causes which change the order of affinities                                  is,
the respective quantities of each of the substances brought
into contact. One substance, which would exercise no action
if    entered the mixture in
     it                           quantity equal to the others,
                                                   a
exercises   very perceptible
               a             action when its quantity     con                   is
siderably augmented              :   it   seems, then, that the different parts
of   each      substance         unite their efforts to overcome             the resist
ance opposed to them.
  Another of these causes       the          is,       greater or less cohesion          of
one of the substances or mixtures.                     It   augments   the resistance
to the change which the affinities ought to produce.

             or more substances, then, which enter into any
mixture, are of such a nature as to produce an elastic, con
crete, or even insoluble compound, we must no longer cal
culate their effect in the definitive result according to the ab
solute affinity belonging to each, but must deduct what
this concrete or elastic
                      state takes from the affinity. It may

   C. Berthollet, by means, of these principles, has been able
to bring under the common laws of chemistry a multitude of
facts which seemed insulated, or even contrary to these                          laws.
Hitherto, for example, the affinities of                     the greater      of
                                                                              part
these        compound        bodies     were   considered       independently of
those        of their compounds,            because the circum fiances above
mentioned         were       not taken into           account..      C. Berthollet
clearly shows that in many cafes they depend on each other;
and how, from so small a number                      of elementary        substances,
when chemically considered, so many compounds, and effects
so various as those exhibited by Nature, can be produced.
   Besides the table before mentioned,       Guy ton has preC
sented to us sour others, destined,                  like the first, for the in
struction       of the pupils in the Polytechnic School.                        One   of
them contains            a                         of minerals into

to the principles of Verner, with additions.           The object of
the third and fourth'                 is,
                              to facilitate to beginners Haiiv's

      C Villars,     associate, ha? announced to us that he sound
  fossil, wood in the turf on one- of the highest mountains of
  the Alps,, near a glacier, and at the height of more than
   2280 sect above the nearest forests" now in existence.           This
  fossil wood consists of trunks of larch, birch, and moun
  tain-ash, with their roots:in perfect preservation.        Their £tu>
  ation gives C. ViHars reason to believe that they grew on the
  fame spots where they are buried.            But how has the cold
  become      so violent that the fame trees can no longer live at
  such a great altitude      ? G. Villars assigns the cause to the sink
  ing down of the summits of. these mountains ; their wasting in
  consequence of being waslied away by the rains ; and the im
  prudent destruction of wood by the hand of man.
     A fact no less curious has been communicated to us by
  Poiret.     He has found fresh-water shells in strata of turf, and
 covered     by other strata of the fame turf containing marine
 (liells.    The soil which presented these objects must then
 have     been   first watered   by rivers, and afterwards inundated
 by the sea, though at present it is found in the middle o.
 the Continent.
     C. Bcavois, associate, has brought us, from North America,
 proofs of changes no less astonishing in the state of the earth.
 The remains of enormous quadrupeds, absolutely unknown
 at present,     have    been   found there at various periods ; but
 C.   Beavois     has shown us bones different from any hitherto
 dug up.       Each day, and every climate, furnishes proofs ot
 the revolutions which our globe has experienced,           and which
are imprinted on its surface and in its bowels in indelible
 characters.
     In Botany,      the Class has received   from C. Broussonet va
luable observations         on such plants in Morocco and the Ca
nary isles as are either useful or new. In these islands the
inhabitants cultivate; the mesembryantbemum cryjlallinum, from
which they extract soda, and which by combustion gives a
third of its weight.         C. Broussonet is of opinion, that this
plant might be        cultivated  in the department of Var, between
Montpellier and the sea.

    C. Desfontaines presented the second and last volume of
bis Flora of Mount Atlas.            This work, which, on account
of the correctness of the descriptions and the beauty of the
plates, may be ranked with any thing of the kind ever yet
published, is a striking proof of the zeal of its author, who
collected the materials in the deserts of Africa, where he was
every moment exposed to new dangers.
    C. Ventenat has communicated a very extensive work on
the lime-tree.       He has described seven species unknown to
Linnæus, several of which might be naturalised in our gar
dens ; and particularly one, which, no doubt, would be pre
ferred to the common lime on account of its leaves, which
being thicker, resist better the heat of summer; and of its
flowers, which are sweeter and last much longer.
    Our anatomists have been employed chiefly in unfolding
the organisation of two animals of the simplest kind and the
 most distant from man.           One of them, named        the medusa,
is found in the waters         of  the sea, where it is nourished not
 by one mouth, as all the other known animals, but by a
 multitude of small tubes, which may be compared to roots.
 Its  stomach supplies     the place     of a  heart, and conveys the
 nutritive juice, through ramified vessels, to every part of the
 body.
    The     second, to which     C. Huzzard    has called the attention
 of  the Class, is found in the interior         part of the brain of
 sheep, and      never   any where else, though it is difficult to
 conceive      why this should invariably be the cafe.         This ani
 mal occasions a mortal malady, the symptoms of which are,
 that the sheep assccted jump and run round with a sort of
 convulsive     movement.        The body of this animal forms a ve
 sicle  filled  with water  :   on  one body there are several heads,
 and each head has a mouth.            A special  commission has been
 appointed to endeavour to find out the best means for destroy
  ing this singular    insect.

those who have the upper part of the arm shattered, or the
head and          neck of the humerus attacked               with caries or ex-
ostofis, from the cruel and dangerous   operation of amputating
 that limb at the joint, that is to fay, at the place where it is
joined to the shoulder, merely by extirpating the upper part
 of the bone. Several persons treated according to this me
thod have experienced no sensible decrease in their strength
or the mobility of the arm.

  We have already had occasion to mention the result of
some experiments made at the Medical Pneumatic Institu
tion, Bristol, with this new gas, and the hopes these afforded
that it would prove a powerful remedy for various diseases.
The following extract of a letter, with which we have been
favoured      from Dr. Beddoes,              gives some farther information
on this subject, that cannot fail to prove interesting to our
philosophical readers            :   —
     *' SIR,
   fi   I
        am sure it will give you pleasure to hear that the gas
which you noticed in your Magazine has fully maintained
its character.  The inference I could not fail to draw from
                with regard to its power in curing palsy, has
the first effects,
turned out just. You will undoubtedly believe that I do not
mean to affirm that it will prove an infallible remedy in p?-
ralytic complaints ; but in the most inveterate                    cases   of hemi-
plegia, originating             in apoplectic     seizures   and    confirmed by
repeated strokes,          it   has restored feeling and the power         of vo
luntary motion to the affected side; and I am persuaded it
will continue to do as much in a large proportion of in
stances.  The full details will be given in a work by Mr.
Davy and myself, now in the press. No untoward accident
has occurred in the many hundred trials lately made with
the gas : but a few hysterical females having cautiously re
spired      it,   there    has been reason          to think that   larger dose

      We may      take the present opportunity to mention, that we

  Laws of Animal Nature, and            on the Meant of preserving    the
  SyJUm.    from Injury   upon the most important     Occasions  of com
  mon    Life.
      " A popular     exposition of the principles of the animal eco
  nomy, with their application to the purposes of individual
  and domestic welfare, upon a plan widely different from that
  of any existing publication, has long been seen necessary by-
  many people.
      "   Heretofore an acquaintance with the causes of his per
  sonal condition has seldom been numbered among the ac
 complishments      of the scholar, or the qualifications with which
 (be man of business is fitted out for success in the world : yet
  it will be confessed, that neither success in business, nor pro
  ficiency in the sciences accounted liberal, are separately suf
  ficient for rendering the condition of human life desirable ;
 and, in fact, to endeavour, by any combination of these ma
 terials, to construct a system of personal happiness, is to pro
ject an edifice which shall stand secure without a foundation.
 Of a    truth,  so long and   so generally neglected, a portion of the
 public, it is believed,      begins to feel that degree of conviction
which       operates   upon conduct.       In this belief, the present
 opportunity of instruction is offered to those who may be
desirous of it.
     " Numbers fall victims to their own impatience under
 illness,    or to the wavering conduct of their friends. Fre
quently on the onset of dangerous diseases, people, by suffer
ing    themselves to be amused by trifling       domestic    expedients,
lose an opportunity which no medical            (kill can ever retrieve.
Upon       these evils the prevalence    of juster ideas would act as.
a-  check.      Nor is it paradoxical to suppose that the mortality
among       infants  would be smaller, and debility of constitution
at all periods of life more rare, if parents (however instructed
in other things) were not in common nearly upon a level
with nurses in that which it so much imports them to pos
sess — an acquaintance with the powers             that operate to the
injury or advantage, the destruction or preservation, of the
objects of their affection."

 thinks he could bestow his time in a manner more advan

 from being carried into effect.

                               Dr. Pearson.
          "  DEAR SIR,
      "   Two Hanoverian        gentlemen, Dr. Ballhorn and Mr.
 Stromeyer,       who,   as you know, are making experiments with
  cow-pock, and with whom I correspond, informed me that
  this disease is very well known in Holstein, and that a cer
  tain Dr. Nessen,         of Siegeberg, has collected many facts
  which prove its anti-variolous property. Being myself lately
  in company with several English gentlemen, who were put
  ting to me many questions on the subject of cow-pock, an
  American gentleman, Mr. Murray, of Philadelphia, told me
  that his servant, a German,' had lived three years in the
  Duchy of Holstein,        and that he thought he recollected   that he
   had mentioned to him some facts which coincided much             with
   what     I was telling them about the cow-pock. This gave me
   the curiosity of speaking to that servant, who, he told me,
   was very intelligent, and had shown often a spirit of observa
   tion.      Here is the summary of his answer : — That during a
   stay of three years in Holstein, in the environs of Kiel, he
   had very often heard of a disease of cows called Die Finnen,
   ( finite means,     in general, a pimple, un bouton ;   finnig, pim
   pled, boutonne,)      and that he had    had frequent occasion of
   seeing cows affected with that disease : that its property of
    preserving against the small-pox is well known by the farmers
    and physicians of the country : that, in the town of Kiel, the
   inoculation with the finnen is sometimes practised upon chil-
                          6                                           dren

 dren in the idea            of preserving their      beauty r that the country-
 people         do not like this inoculation,               because
                                                    they pretend
 that it leaves behind it several other disorders : that, waiting
 at table, he had very often heard gentlemen, and among
 others a Dr. Ackermann, speak of its anti-variolous power :
 that in great farms men do not milk cows, but that in the
 smaller ones that happens very often : that a disease of horses
 called mauke (true German name for grease) is known by
 all those who take care of them : that old horses particularly,
 attacked with the mauke, are always put in cows' stables, and
 there are attended by womenthat it is particularly in harvest
                                               :
that men in small farms milk cows : that he never heard of
any relation existing between the finnen and the mauke.     He
describes that disease of cows like a pimple between flesti and
skin (that is his expression)              ;   and fays,    that when a cow is
affected        with   it,   she   loses her       milk   and becomes     very lean    :
that farmers kill the               sick   ones     to prevent
                                                       contagions the
that they sometimes salt those cows, and give them in winter
to eat to their servants, who dislike theflesli so much that they
look upon this treatment as mark of avariciousoess

  Dr. Herschel, whose discoveries have already tended so
much to the increase of science, has, we understand, made
adiscovery within these few days past that bids fair to place
his name higher than all the researches he has yet made —
he has found out    method of separating the rays of heat

    the Manners and Customs         of its Inhabitants.     By Mr. Vo N
    WURMB *.
  jL HE       Portuguese,     Dutch,     and English, ever since the
sixteenth     century,     have  in turns endeavoured to establish
themselves      in this island, which is one of the largest in the.
Indian    ocean   ; but the Dutch alone, by being so fortunate 33
to have a preponderance in India, were able to accomplish
their object.      On account of the gold and diamonds found
here,    as  well   as   of the  pepper,    of which     the  Dutch East
India company export annually 600,000 pounds, this island
is of considerable importance to their trade.
    It is reported that, when the Portuguese wished to form a
settlement here in the year 1526, they presented to the sultan
of Landac      and Succatana some beautiful pieces          of tapestry on
which     figures   of various kinds were represented ; but that
the sultan,     who    took these figures to be animated or magic
figures, and apprehended that they might unexpectedly rush
from the tapestry and strangle him, rejected the present, and
expelled the Portuguese, with their presents, from the coun
try.     The English were not much more fortunate, having
quitted Borneo entirely ever since the year 1706.                  In 1766

they made an attempt to form a settlement in the island of
Balambangan, at the northern extremity of Borneo, which
was given up to them by the king of Solon.     They had in it
a few Europeans for the fake of trade, and a garrison of three
hundred soldiers, Europeans and blacks.      Their view was
to establish      factory, where they might exchange the
                 here      a
productions of Europe and Hindoftan for those brought
hither from China and the Indian islands ; but in the year
1772, after a part of their troops had been swept off by con
tagious diseases, the fort they had constructed, being badly
fortified, was suddenly attacked, and the whole establishment
destroyed.    The English are still ignorant who were the au
thors of this violence           ; and    they do not know whether they
ought to ascribe           it   to the    Dutch, jealous of their trade in
that neighbourhood, or to                 the Spaniards, afraid of their pos
sessions in the Philippines.
   Various accounts of Borneo may be found in the works of
different authors ; such as Valentyn's General Description of
India, Salmon's Present                  State    of all Nations,   the General
History of Voyages by                  Prevost, and the paltry compilation
of the   abbe de la Porte.                But as this large island is as yet
little known          even      in India,       and as no European    has been
able to penetrate to the interior part of                   it,
                                            all these descrip
tions are erroneous and imperfect.     That    may therefore  I
give the public the latest and most authentic information
respecting     this island,    confine myself chieflv to the
                                 I     sliall
account of published in the Transactions of the Society for
               it
promoting the Sciences at Batavia, in the island of Java.
The island of Borneo extends from the fourth degree of
southern latitude to the eighth of northern, and from the
hundred and fiftieth to the hundred and fifty-eighth of lon
gitude.      It   about 780 miles in length and 720 in
                      is
breadth. Its climate    almost the fame as that of Java; but
                                  is
Borneo   is    less   mountainous,              and the land, for twelve or    fif
teen miles, and sometimes                  more, from the coast,       is   almost
every where marshy.      The remaining part of the island                       is
sufficiently fertile, and would be productive were not the
natives too indolent to cultivate the foil, and fonder    of search
ing for gold      and      diamonds, which they barter with the Ja
                                                                            vanese

 vanese for various necessaries of life.         The middle of the
 island is occupied by an extensive ridge of mountains called
 the Crystal Mountains, because a great quantity of crystal is
 found in them.        At the bottom of these mountains is a
 large inland lake, which       gives rife to all the rivers that tra-
 terse the whole island.
     The  real natives  of this  island  are the Biadjoos or   Dajak-
 kese, who live in the interior parts of the country.        The sea-
 coast is inhabited by a mixture of Malays, Javanese, and Ma
 cassars,   It is only of the countries situated on the coast that
 we have any certain accounts, for the interior parts of the
 island are as yet very little known.
     The greatest kingdom in the island, and the most important
 on account of its connection with the Dutch East India com
 pany, is that of Banjermasling on the southern side. The
great river Pontiana, which is navigable for (hips that draw
 from twelve to thirteen feet of water, is exceedingly conve
 nient for trade.    The sultan Susuhunan Natahalam, since the
 year 1771,    has transferred    his residence from Cagu-Tangie
 to Martapura,     where   he  caused a large city to be built, and
 a canal to be dug which passes through the middle of it; at
 the fame time the name Martapura was changed into Bumie-
 Kintjana.     The reader may from this readily conceive that
 the power of this sultan is not inconsiderable.            The inha
 bitants of the city, as well as those who reside in places at a
 distance from the coast, are mahometans, mixed with a great
 many Biadjoos or Dajakkese, who are pagans.             These Biad
joos,   who  inhabit  a great many villages,   the  number   of which
 is said to amount to 784, are subject to various petty princes,
 who acknowledge the sultan as their superior.           Of these Bi
 adjoos, who are the original natives of the island, I sliall
speak hereafter.
     The factory of the Dutch East India company is situated
 at the end of the village of Tatas, or Banjermaffing.         It con
 sists of an octagonal fort surrounded by palisades, which 011
 the east side   next   the river is furnished with three,     and on
 the west, or land side, with      two bastions.     The productions
of the country fought for as      articles of commerce, are pepper,
gold, (mostly gold-dust,      not   very  abundant   in metal,) dia-
                                 C  c  z                      monds,

monds, canes, birds-nests, wax, pedra del porco, dragons-
blood, and iron.        For these the Dutch give in exchange,
agates   of a longifli   form, rings of red agate, different kinds
of coral ; all sorts of Chinese articles, such as coarse porce
lain, red and other kinds of silk ; all forts of cotton cloth,
clothing such    as is worn by the Indians, various production*
of Java,  and also opium      : but the last must be introduced pri
vately, as the     use  of it   has been strictly prohibited        by the
sultan.
    Succalana lies in o°       $d   south latitude.    A   little further
north is the river Pontiana,         which, through       a great many
 mouths,    discharges    itself into the   sea under the line.       This
river at its mouth is twelve feet in depth, and at high water
sixteen, so that sloops and small vessels can proceed to the
 company's factory with great ease.             The passage from the
 mouth of the river to the factory requires twelve hours                At
 the distance of seven or eight miles from its mouth, the river
 divides itself into two branches        ; the southernmost      of which
flows through the country governed by Pangerang Josep, who
in 1778 was raised by the East India company to be sultan
 of  Sasango and Pontiana, under the name            of Sarief Abdulla
 Rachmann.       These two kingdoms extend            a great way into
 the country.      One of the servants of the company saw at
 the court of this sultan, one of his vassals, the kingofGas-
 caro, whose dominions lay at the distance of upwards of a
 hundred miles; and he was told that in that country there had
 been found some pillars, three feet in height and three in
 breadth, inscribed with European characters.                 If this in
 formation be correct, the Europeans at some early period
 must have penetrated a considerable way into the interior
 parts of the island.      The Society of the Arts and Sciences at
 Batavia had hopes of obtaining a copy of these inscriptions,
 by which means the mystery might have been explained; but
 hitherto they have been disappointed.
    Pontiana and Sasango produce excellent gold, wax, birds-
 nests, pearls, sago, diamonds, tin, and iron, which arc bar
 tered for provisions   of all kinds     and cotton cloth,      but parti
 cularly rice and salt.      Heavy rains, accompanied with thick
 clouds, prevail here from the month of November till Mav.
                                                                         It

It   deserves to be mentioned, as a meteorological observation,
that the thermometer here is never lower than 8a°, and never
higher than 940.
     Landac lies on the northern arm of the river Pontiana,
about seventeen miles higher up, in the latitude of o° 35'
north.        The Dutch     had a resident        here so early as a hun
dred and fifty years ago.          After that period their possessions
were destroyed, till the         king of Bantam, to whom Landac
and Succatana had for many years belonged, made a present
 to the company of all these lands in the year 1778 —but
 whether voluntarily or through compulsion                I  cannot venture
 to fay.      This much, however,            is certain,    that the Dutch
 after   that time considered these lands            as their property, and
 the princes who govern in them as their vassals;                 built their
 fort at Pontiana,       between     Landac and Succatana, and ap
 pointed Pangerang Saidja              Nata as regent of the whole
  district.
     The     residence  of the prince of Landac is situated on the
  projecting corner of a mountain, to which there is an ascent
  by 118 steps. Two rivers, which are so full of rocks that no
  kind of vessel can be navigated in them, flow on the right
  and left of this mountain; and as there are other mountains
  on each fide of these rivers, this place is so strong by nature
  that it is impregnable.        It   is also well furnished with artil
  lery  : besides several small cannons, there are in it two iron
  guns, eight-pounders, one of which has on it the company's
  arms, and the other the Danisti.                 It is inconceivable how
  luch heavy masses could have been conveyed to the summit
  of  so steep a   rock.    In this kingdom         there are gold and dia
   mond mines of considerable           importance.
      Between Landac and Borneo, the most northern kingdom
  of the island, and from which, in all probability, the whole
   country takes its name, there are several smaller kingdoms,
   which are not of great importance, but which are not yet
   sufficiently known.        Their regents are, in part, vassals of the
   sultan   of Borneo.     A   small     trade  is carried on    in these dis
   tricts with gold, diamonds, canes, wax, and other articles of
   the like kind, which are given in exchange for the produc
   tions of Java; but this traffic is of little consequence,           and at
                                          7                                the

 the same time uncertain, because             this part of the country
 is inhabited      by several discontented         princes who live by
 piracy.
    Borneo is governed by a sultan, who has his residence in
 this pTace, where a considerable trade is carried on with the
 productions of the country, which are pearls, birds-nests,
 wax, staves, rice, and camphor.            The camphor of this island
 is considered as the best, and is preferred even to that of
 Sumatra.       Houtynn,       a physician of Amsterdam, to whom
 natural history is so     much indebted, and who, in the Trans
 actions of the Society of Haarlem           *,  has given a description
 with figures of the camphor-tree from the dried branches,
transmitted to him by a member of the Society of the Arts
and Sciences at Batavia, fays : " The camphor of Borneo
and     Sumatra is produced        by a tree with oval, sharp-pointed
leaves and large tulip-like flowers.           By these marks it is dis
tinguished     both   from    the  camphor-tree of Japan, and from
the other species of the laurel.             A hundred weight of the
camphor of Borneo costs 3000, and one of that of Sumatra
2000 rix-dollars, but the Japanese costs scarcely fifty : the
last, however, is much more volatile than the other kinds."
Of     the camphor      of Borneo about      4375 pounds are exported
even' year.       The   articles imported are tin, cotton cloth, and
all the productions of Java except             rice, which is cultivated
here in great abundance.
    The    sultan   of Borneo lives in great state, and is more
feared    by   his  subjects than that of Banjer ; but at the fame
time, according to the account of some Englishmen who
frequent this part of the coast with small vessels, and carry
hither cotton cloth, which they exchange for pepper, he is
more constant in his friendship and truer to his engagements.
    Between Borneo and Tidor lie the two small                  kingdoms
of Balangan and Baraoou,            where    birds-nests, wax, &c. are
exchanged       for  Javanese      productions    and a sort of coarse
cotton cloth.       Next comes       Dannuar,     which   is subject to a
Dato called Beginda ; and a little further, Sammunta, under
Dato Tomongong; and Cottee, which is governed by a sultan
named Adgie Umut.                 Between the two last there are a

Thua and. then Pastier, the last kingdom, which belongs to
        ;
the sultan Annom.    The articles of trade in this country
are gold, birds-nests, wax,                  and canes,    which are exchanged
for the productions of Java.                       The inhabitants of Pastier are
ver)' few in number, and therefore    has not been possibleit
for them to drive back the Buginese, who have made them
selves masters        of   the river, and at the fame time                   of   the trade.
  Further         south     lies    Simpanahan,             which       is   governed     by
Pangerang*           Prabo.  The whole country from this place to
the extreme          boundaries of Salatang belongs to the king of
Banjermasting,             who     possesses also         the great and small island
of Pulu-Lauts.    There appear to be no other kingdoms in
the interior part of Borneo  at any rate, ;there are, they         if
are not known.     The inhabitants of the mountains bring
the production's           of their lands,'         and their different articles           of
manufacture, to the nearest part of the coast for sale.
 I shall now lay before the reader what     have been able to   I
learn respecting the Biadjoos or Dajakkese, who for the most
part inhabit an extensive district, in the interior part of the                                 .
country on the weft fide os the river Banje'r. The Biadjoos
are of large stature and well built. Their women are laid to^
be fair and handsome   but they never bring them to Bahjer,
                                   ;
or any other of the places where they trade.   The dress of
the Biadjoos has  great resemblance to that of the Malays.
                           a
Their women,           and even the wives                 of their princes,        go naked
to the middle,             and     in   general          have   nothing      around their
body but      a    short gown.           The men paint their                  bodies    with
figures      of   various kinds,        as   the cafe among the other na
                                              is

Banjer to fell their gold, canes, and rice, for which they re
ceive in exchange      coarse Chinese porcelain, copper ahd^
earthen vessels, or tampayangs, on which are represented
dragons, snakes, and other figures suited to their taste.
   Their marriages              are accompanied             with   some very        singular

 ceremonies.     When     a bachelor has conceived       an attachment
 for a young woman, he employs some female to ask her in
 marriage from her parents ; but he is sure of receiving a de
 nial unless he has given a proof of his courage by cutting off
 the head   of an enemy.       If his offer is accepted, he carries to
 his bride a present, which consists of a male or female slave,
 two dresses, and a water-pot, on which some of their favourite
 figures are represented.      When the wedding-day arrives, the
 bride and the bridegroom each give an entertainment at their
 houses; at the conclusion of which the bridegroom, in his
 best apparel,    is conducted to the residence of the bride,
 where he finds at the door one of her relations, who smears
 over him the blood     of a cock which      has been killed    for that
 purpose ; and the same ceremony takes place in regard to the
bride, with the blood of a hen. They then present to each
other their bloody hands ; but it is considered as a bad omen
if the blood, in consequence of this joining of hands, spirts
out too far around them.         The new-married couple then re
main together, and the whole solemnity ends with a second
entertainment. When the wife lies-in, the husband assumes
the office of nurse,    and no other care is usual on this occasion
than that one       of their conjurers, whom          they call laliant
gives   the   newly-delivered woman some medicines, amidst
singing, and beating on certain instruments named gindang.
If  the wife die, the husband cannot enter again into the mar
ried state until he has cut off the head of some individual of
another nation, and thereby avenged the death of his wife.
    When a Biadjoo dies, the body is put into a coffin, and
kept in the house until all the remaining males of the family,
father, son, and other near relations, have purchased a slave ;
who is to be beheaded on the day when the body is burnt, in
order that he may attend the deceased in the other world.
Before this unfortunate wretch is butchered, it is earnestly
recommended to him to be faithful to his master on the other
fide of the grave. The ashes of the burnt body are afterwards
collected in one of the above-described           water-pots, and the
pot, together with       the   head   of  the   slave   who has been
strangled,   is deposited   in  a small   edifice  or tomb built for
that purpose.      A  year often elapses before        the relations   of
                                                                     the

the deceased are in a condition to purchase a slave to                   serve
him in the next world.
    Their    houses    are constructed       of boards      joined together,
and   have neither windows nor partitions except that which
ieparates a small corner for sleeping in.                 The whole family-
reside together along with their slaves,              forming in the whole
sometimes       a hundred persons.          They have nothing to afford
them light but a thin piece of pine-wood, which burns no
longer than till about eight in the evening. Over their doors
they suspend the heads which they cut off in their slrirmislies,
and often while        they are still bloody.          Whenever they con
ceive a desire of displaying their courage by cutting off heads,
they set out on an expedition for that purpose.                  On such oc
casions, the person who wislies to gratify              his  bloody intention
makes known his design to his friends and relations, who de
liberate with him on the means to be pursued, and who ac
company him, together with their dependants and slaves.
They    then proceed,      in great secrecy, to the river Banjer, and
lie in wait for some small           vessel  belonging to Banjer fisher
 men, whom they cither surprise in the night-time or attack
and carry away in the open, day.                 One or perhaps two of
these unfortunate captives           are then destined to become         a sa
crifice to their insatiable       rage for murder.
    When theDajakkese bring home a head, the whole village,
men, women, and children, testify their satisfaction by every
 demonstration of joy.           People who beat on gongs
                                                                   *  are sta
 tioned in    a  row in the    street   to conduct the conqueror,        with
 the head in his hand, to his own house,               where he is received
 by all the women present, who dance around him. When
 he approaches the door, he finds where the gongs cease a
 cushion placed for him, on which he fits down, and where
 the head is taken       from him by the women.                 The fortunate
 head-hunter       receives   presents    from    all   the   company,    who
 dance    and afterwards partake of a repast.              At the fame time
 some food is thrust into the mouth            of  the head,     and a little
 drink   is poured     into   it;   after which it is hung up as a per
 petual   trophy of victory.

     These people,         however, before they undertake expeditions
of this kind in          questof Banjerefe heads, always endeavour to
deduce some omen               of   good or bad          fortune from the flight of
a    kind of hawk*.              With this          view they entice  the bird to
perch on the ground, by strewing rice on                                  it,   and       by    other
means     ;   and   if   he wheels round when he rises, and disappears
in   the clouds, or flies towards               that quarter to which they                        in
tend      to proceed,       they      consider      it   as   a    sign   of    good fortune,
and they set out           with       fresh courage           :    but   if   the bird directs
its flight towards    quarter opposite to that to which they
                           a
visti to go, they defer the expedition till  more favourable         a
opportunity.       often happens that they must wait two or

   The Biadjoos have scarcely any form of government, and
no written laws.            Isa       person   is   accused        of theft, and   suffi  if
cient proof cannot be adduced against                              him, the culprit and
the accuser are carried before one of the oldest inhabitants.
An earthen pot with ashes and water placed on the ground,     is
and   bit of wood, on which are deposited two small copper
      a
buttons,    laid across the pot. After an oath has been ad
              is
ministered to each of the parties, the bit of wood     turned                         is
round in such    manner that the buttons fall into the water
                     a                                                                             ;
the accused and the accuser must then each                                draw one of the
buttons from         it,   and      he whose button appears as                    if      scoured,
and rendered white               by
                       the ashes, gains the process.
  It   issaid that the Biadjoos have some idea of Supreme                         a
Being,  to  whom they address prayers under the name of
Dewatta; and as they believe that this Dewatta not only
created, but still preserves and rules the world, they request
him to grant them happiness and prosperity.        Respecting
the notions which they entertain of this deity, and the par
ticular worship they pay to him,     can give no further ac

their deity must be    gloomy and revengeful being

covered by her husband, the latter never makes any attempt
 against the adulterer, but contents himself with putting to
death    two or three of his slaves ; after which he imagines
 himself freed from all stiame.              The woman, on the other
 hand, is punished       merely with words, but sometimes with
blows.       Do not     a people,       whose conduct is regulated by
such laws, deserve pity          ?  Revenge,     superstition, avarice, and
a spirit of plundering,         are often among civilised as well as
uncivilised nations the strongest incitements to acts of cruelty
and murder : but the Biadjoo, who attacks only poor de
fenceless beings, and carries about their heads as trophies ot
his courage      ; who never attacks his enemy           himself, but en
deavours      to be avenged by putting to death innocent staves,
certainly surpasses in cruelty the ravenous animal that de
vours    others    only to appease its hunger.            Let us hope, for
the honour of humanity, that a good deal in this imperfect
relation may be exaggerated.
    The Biadjoos arc unacquainted with polygamy. When a
man wistics to separate from his wife in consequence of her
having been guilty of some crime, he retains her clothes and
ornaments, and causes her to pay besides a fine amounting
to about thirty rials. After this, each party may again marry.
These    people acknowledge the             sultan  of Banjer   as their  so
vereign, and pay him yearly a small tribute in gold dust of
the value of twenty rials.
    The principal part of our information respectinrr, these
people was obtained from a Mr. Palm, who made a journev
from Fontiana to Landac in the year 1779 on business of the
Dutch      East India company, and who, on this occasion, pe
netrated     a considerable       way into the country.         At Landac
he paid a visit to the         gold   aud   diamond    mines,   and on his
return had the good fortune to get into his possession an

proceed to give         the reader some account         of the diamond and
gold mines.
    In working        the diamond mines great            care is required   to
examine the ground intended to be dug. The places where
diamonds are to be found may be known by certain small
flints, generally of a black colour, which lie on the surface,
and     also by the yellow colour           of the stony soil.     The  surest
method, however, is to follow the directions of the people
who reside in the neighbourhood of these mines, and to
whom superstition ascribes the fame wonderful power as the
so   called divining-rod          of  the Europeans was supposed to pos
sess   formerly.        It   is said that at certain periods      of the day,
such as four o'clock             in  the morning,     twelve   at noon, and
 four in the afternoon, they have the faculty of seeing the re
flection or shining of the diamonds through the earth. These
mountaineers point out to the diamond-miners a certain spot
where they ought to dig ; but they receive no payment till it
actually appears that it contains diamonds.                   A pit about six:
feet square is then made in the place with a kind of pick-axe,
for in such stony ground shovels and spades cannot be em
ployed. The earth when loosened is taken up in baskets,
formed into heaps, and afterwards sifted by people, who sit
in water-pits dug for the purpose,               first with coarse and then
with finer sieves.            The remaining     sand   is then washen    with
the water, amidst which the labourers sit and examine it once
 more.       If nothing       is found, the stones and earth are thrown
on one      side ;  but    if any diamonds      appear,   the overseer,   who
 is alwavs     present, watches         with great care till the good stones
 are collected and formed into a heap.                The workmen receive
 but very moderate pay for their labour.                     All those stones
 that weigh above five carats must be immediately delivered
 to the sovereign prince or the iultau.                But this law is made
 only for the simple, as nothing is easier than to swallow such
 stones, and in that manner to carry them away.
     The mines         are dug,       in  a perpendicular direction, some
  times to the depth of ten fathoms.               The labourers, however,
  are totally unacquainted with the art of mining, and there
  fore when the least difficulty occurs they are entirely at a
  loss.    The    sides   of   the pits arc prevented      from falling in by
                                                                      bundles

        Preservation   of Birds and Quadrupeds     by   Ether.      305
bundles of rice-straw and pieces of wood placed in a cross
direction ; but such accidents often happen, particularly in
the time of violent storms.        As they are incapable of freeing
the pits from water during heavy          rains, they are prevented
from working, and must suspend their labour till the weather
becomes dry.        The most productive diamond mines are at
Ambauwang, beyond Molucco, in the district of Banjer-
mafling, and at Landac and Pontiana.             Besides these mines,
which lie among the mountains, diamonds are sought for
also on the banks of various rivers ; but those who follow this
occupation have      so little success, that ten or twelve men      will
dig and search sometimes a whole month before they find
diamonds to the value of twenty Spanish rials.
     In regard to the gold mines, the ignorance of the natives
 respecting    every thing that relates to    mining   is so great, that
 little advantage is derived from them, though they are sup
 posed to be very rich.        In Banjermafling the gold is found
 at the depth of about three fathoms ; the veins properly so
 called are of a reddish kind of marl.          At Landac the ore is
  found at the depth of about ten feet, and the workmen must
 dig till they come to a crust which has almost the appear
  ance   of rotten wood.      Until this vein, which is called the
 covering of the mine,       be found, there are no hopes       of meet
  ing with gold.
  II.  Method of preserving Birds and small Quadrupeds                 by
                 means of Ether.      By C. Chaptal.
         HIS     method of preparing all kinds of animals for ca
  binets is exceedingly simple, and so certain in its effect that
   C. Chaptal never found it to fail in a single instance.           It is
   as follows  : —The   matter contained in the bowels of the ani
   mal must be evacuated, either by gradually pressing the body
   towards the rectum, or by injecting some liquid which may
   remove every thing that stands in its way.         After this opera
   tion, the end of the rectum is to be tied with a thread, and
   ether to be injected, with a proper instrument, into the body
                                                                 through

to6          Preservation      of Birds and           Quadrupeds       by   Ether.
through the mouth or bill               ;    and when       the bowels have been
filled with      it,
             the animal               is    to be hung up       by     the head.       One
of the     eyes must then be scooped out, and the brain extracted                        :
after which the head            is   also filled with ether,           which must be
prevented  from escaping                by
                               plugging up the eve-hole.    On
the second or third day the injecting of ether  to be repeated,    is
and this process    to be continued till the animal be com
                          is
pletely dried.
   While the animal     gradually drying, care must be taken
                                is
to give to the body its proper position, and as soon as
                                                                                       it
                                                                                       is
completely desiccated     may be put up without further care
                                it
or any other preparation.   A small female papajay, prepared
according to this method in the year 1782, was lost behind
the shelves of library, and remained there two years with
                      a
out its solidity or form being in the least changed. This pro
cess   for preserving          animals seems to be attended                  with con
siderable      advantages.            C. Fouchy,           of Montpellier,             fays
C. Chaptal, who has made ornithology his particular study,
recommended spirit of wine,   few years ago, for the fame
                                                 a
purpose    ;   but    as soon as the        spirit of this liquid has evaporated,
the remaining           aqueous      part promotes corruption           in   very  a
great degree    whereas ether,
                 ;                              by
                                  its evaporation, carries with
it not only its own aqueous particles, but those also which                              it
absorbs from the body. Besides, this method neither destrovs
the form       of     the animal       nor tarnishes the splendour                 of the
feathers  or hair, and    exceedingly cheap: one ounce
                               is                                                 of ether
is in general sufficient for small bird.
                                      a       A large papajay re
quired only one ounce and       half. As the process
                                        a                attended            is
with     little expence,
        so                  may  be
                                it   used for  animals of    con                  a
siderable size.
     C. Chaptal remarks, that in                 regard to animals which have
been wounded,  and on that account have apertures in their
bodies which cannot be shut     well as the natural apertures,
                                                so
the process more difficult, and attended with greater trouble,
                 is
as they are less capable             of containing         the ether.        Such ani
mals, therefore,          must be chosen             for preservation as have died
a    natural death, or         as have been            killed by  being strangled.
The    process   will     be performed sooner or more slowly accord-

  The theory of this process, as C. Chaptal thinks,        that                   is,

III.       Description        of   a new Injlrument      for Trepanning, invented
      by   Mr. John Rodman, Surgeon in Paisley.                                Communi
     cated      by   the Inventor.
 -L HE operation of trepanning must be considered very                            a
important one in surgery, both on account of the dangers
with which       often attended, and the beneficial effects
                        it   is
which follow the successful  performance of it. The danger
and accidents which attend this operation arise partly from
the imperfection of the instruments employed, and partly
from want of dexterity in the operator.
     To     manage the instruments now                  in   usefor trepanning with
neatness and facility, would require                     a   degree of mechanical
dexterity which falls to the lot of few surgeons: yet surgeons
the most inexperienced, and unaccustomed       to operations of
any kind, are often necessarily called upon to perform this
operation.
     The       trepan    is   allowed    by
                                     number of surgeons
                                              the greater
to be  dangerous instrument, and the use of the trephine,
           a
though more generally employed, has been sometimes fol
lowed    fatal accidents.
               by
     The chief objection              to the more general use             of   the trepan
seems to arise from the chance                  of   its passing suddenly in upon
the brain towards the end of the operation.                               To   avoid such
an accident, the celebrated professor                   of anatomy         at Edinburgh
says,      in his lectures, that          it    might be as well to begin the
operation with the trepan, and to finisti with the trephine.  it
But, whichever of these instruments be employed, there   still                     is
a   risk   of the    bone being unequally              cut: for,     if   the instrument

tion,    the bone at that side to which it is most inclined wif?
soonest give way, and consequently the brain may be injured
before the surgeon is apprised of it. Such accidents, it is
well known, have frequently happened.        Sometimes, too,
the centre-pin, from agitation or inattention of the surgeon,
has been left in the instrument to the end of the operation,
and, after pasting through the bone, has perforated the brain.
   Besides these, and several other obvious objections, the
number of necessary auxiliary instruments sufficiently evinces
the propriety of attempting to simplify and improve the pre
sent mode  of operating.               .
  The manner of perforating the skull by the instruments
now in use         is,
               first, with the perforator, to make small hole               a
in the bone of sufficient depth to receive the centre-pin of
                         a
the saw, then to apply the instrument, and to continue saw
ing till the groove  deep enough to preserve the instrument
                               is
steadily without the centre-pin                :    the instrument then           with
                                                                                 is
drawn,        the pin removed
             and                    means of the    by                        key. The
surgeon  now  proceeds to finish the operation, and, having
replaced the instrument, works through the bone with the
greatest caution, taking care to withdraw and replace the
instrument         from time to time, in order not only to clear
away the dust that fills up the teeth    of the saw, but to dis
cover whether the portion of bone to be removed                                 is    nearly
separated.
     By this way of operating                  it   is   evident   a   considerable       por
tion    of the time       is   taken up even       in preparing for the opera
tion, beside what            is   lost   during the course of it. To save time
in this,          in
             every other operation, must be considered as
             as                                                                             a
matter of great consequence both to the patient and surgeon.
With view to show how this may be accomplislied, will
         a                                                                            it
be necessary to mention            in what manner the operation may
be conducted           with the instrument now to be proposed.
     The patient being              prepared   for the operation, and the in
strument applied, as                in the plate, care must be taken to make
the sawing- teeth round the whole circumference touch the
surface of the bone equally. This can easilv be done for,                             ;
though the inequality of the bones on which the instrument
isplaced be such as to prevent the saw from acting on all

points of the circle alike, one or other of the legs may he
lengthened or shortened at pleasure, by means of the setting
screws ; and in this manner it may be made to fit exactly.
   The next         step   of   the operation                is,     to cut the pericranium
with one or two turns of the instrument, and,                                        if       necessary,
that portion of the membrane within the circle of the saw
may be removed with the fingers. The sawing    now begun                            is
 by   turning    handle with one hand, and holding the in
                    the
strument firmly with the other.     Thus the bone may be
cut very quickly   and    the surgeon wish to proceed cau-
                           ;           if
tioufly towards the end of the operation, he may then work
the instrument in the manner of the trephine, which can be
done    bygrasping the handle with one hand, and supporting
the frame       as before           mentioned.
   The simplicity of                the instrument,                  and    the mode              of   ope

   and poisonous Quality of some os the English Species of
   that Genus.          By RiCHAiiD Pulteney, M.D.F.R.S.
   and     L.   S. *
B<)OTH           ancient and modern writers on Botany and the
Materia Medica           agree, pretty uniformly, in attributing to
many species of          the genus      Ranunculus a corrosive and poi
sonous quality.         In   several    it abounds in        such a degree as,
when applied externally, in a recent state, to excite vesica-
tions, and ulccration of the parts, frequently of a malignant
and gangrenous nature           ;  and, when taken inwardly, to prove
poisonous and fatal, by inducing vomiting, inflammation                       of
the stomach,         with the usual consequences            of acrid   poisons.
These qualities are particularly manifest in the recent plant,
while in its highest vigour before flowering; and more in
tensely     in the germen of          the flower itself, and      in the petals
              *
of  some.
   The      poisonous    species, that are indigenous,           and  common
in England, are, the Ranunculus Flammula, or Lester Spear-
wort; R. bulbosus, bulbous-rooted Crowfoot; R. acris, up
right Crowfoot ; R. sceleratus, Marsh Crowfoot; R. arvenjis,
Corn Crowfoot ; and the R. aquatilis, or Water Crowfoot,
according to the report of various authors. Of these the
 Flammula, bulbosus, and sceleratus, are judged to be the most
acrimonious.
    Before the introduction of Cantharides, the acrid Ranun
 culi were, all in their turn, used as vesicatories ; and Hallcr
 tells  usf,     the R. Flammula is still in       use as such    in some parts
 of France.        Giliberl  assures   us  % that the     R.  bulbosus vesicates
 with    less   pain than ihejlies, and has no effect on the urinary

epispastic.          Other authors allow   qualities in the Ra

nunculi, and that they are quicker than Canlbarides in their
vesicating effect ; but fay, that all these advantages are more
than balanced by the greater uncertainty cf their action on
the skin, and their frequently leaving ill-conditioned ulcers,
of which Murray                 and other writers have recorded instances*.
Nevertheless, the Ranunculi                         were      employed            in local spas
modic complaints and in fixed pains, and not unfrequently
in cataplasms to the wrists in intermitting fevers. Crowfoot
is known           also to have been one                of     the ingredients            in Plun-
ket's epithem for cancers.
     The acrimony of                 these plants       is,    however, of           so   volatile     a
nature, that, even              in    the most virulent,            it   is   wholly dissipated
in drying      ;    that, in the form of hay, they appear to be
                     so
harmless,       and nutritive to cattle.   also instantly expelled

in decoction, probably in                     all the species       ;    at least,   Murray in
forms us, that the shepherds of Morlachia eat even the R.fce-
hratus, as    culinary plant, after boiling it: the R. aurico-

212              Observations   on the  Economical Use
species   of Ranunculi, with which         trials were made, except
the R. auricomus, were rejected by the horned cattle; and it
is well known, that while our meadows and pastures are
eaten bare    of other vegetables, the R. acris and         R. bulbosus,
which     are but too plentiful, are left untouched        : neither do
cattle  willingly    eat the R. repens, although it is not wholly
rejected   by   horses,  sheep, and goats.
    The R. Flammula, according to the above experiments,
was eaten only by horses, to which animal it is there said to
be very grateful ; whereas the R. auricomus, eaten by all the
rest, (except that swine choose only the roots,) was rejected
by horses.       The R. sceleratus, which is supposed to be the
Herba Sardonia of Dioscorides, was touched by goats alone ;
the R. bulbosus only by the latter, though it is well known
 in England that hogs are fond of the roots.              The R. acris
 was eaten by sheep and goats ; but the R. aquatilis is re
 corded as the only one rejected by all the five species of ani
 mals on which these trials were made.             It does not appear
 by either edition of the Pan Suecus, that any trials were
 made with R. arvenjis ; and though horned cattle and horses
 will eat this species greedily, (although not without subse
 quent injury,) yet it is known to have been highly delete
 rious to sheep.       A notable instance of this occurred in Pied
 mont in the year 1786, where a number of these animals
 died, as it was at first supposed, of an epidemical disease; but
 subsequent examination discovered          that this destruction    was
 owing to the Ranunculus arvenjis.            The history of this acci
 dent is circumstantially related in the Memoirs of the Royal
  Academy of Turin,, by M. Brugnon *. The herb grows lux
  uriantly in Piedmont, and the sheep fed with much eagerness
  upon it. The effects here mentioned were not immediate,
  but progressive; and M. Brugnon, on further investigation,
  was convinced they were principally owing to the roots of
  the plant ; since, by experiments purposely made on dogs,
  these animals were almost instantly killed by them.                On
  the dissection of the sheep, all the four concoctive organs
  were found affected with erysipelatous        and gangrenous spots;

tans. J. B. iii. 782.   Without entering here into any dis
quisition relative to these distinctions of the species,                         I    (hall
come to the ultimate object of these observations,                                by re
marking,        that   I    was lately witness              to a fact, with
                                                      respect
to the Ranunculus aqua tills JluviatUis, which, after what I
recollected of the character of the plant, somewhat surprised
me, while it sufficiently proved, nor merely the innoxious
quality of this plant, but that it is nutritive to cattle,                            and
capable     of being       converted    to useful purposes  in agricultural
economy.          Unless these varieties        of the R. aquatilis Linn,
be endowed        with     different    properties, it is a proof that the
experiments on this plant were not made with sufficient ac
curacy, or discrimination of the varieties ; not sufficiently re
peated on different individuals of the fame species of animals ;
or, that in different countries or situations it is divested of its
virulence.   In the present instance, it is probable, the plant
is rendered inert as a poison, by growing in the water ; al
though        in certain other instances,                   moisture is thought to
heighten the deleterious property of vegetables, especially in
the umbelliferous tribe.
   The fact that I have alluded to                    is,
                                      that in the neighbour
hood of Ringwood, on the borders of the Avon, which affords
this vegetable in great abundance all the year, some of the
cottagers      sustain their cows, and            even horses,        almost     wholly
by this plant since the remaining part of their food
                  ;                                      no                      is

heath, which affords little more than Ling, Lichen, Bog-
moss or Sphagnum,               &c.    It    is   usual to employ          a    man to
collect   a   quantity for the day every morning, and bring                             it
in   the boat to the edge    of the water, from which the cows,
in   the instance  saw, stood eating    with great avidity.

frozen over.   examined the whole parcel, on which four
                  I
cows were feeding, in the beginning of March, and found the
whole consisted, exclusively, of the Ranunculus sluviatilis,
without any mixture of the Potamogeton, Carex, Spargantum,
or other aquatic plants. In summer, however,   can scarcely            it
be avoided but that there must be mixture of some of these

by whom     Iwas further informed, that hogs are also fed with

should be conducted before                  a  decisive judgment on the powers
of any reputedly poisonous vegetable can be formed, may in
duce such as were unacquainted with this fact to adopt the
use of this plant in similar situations, since    one of the          it   is

 distinctly as to be easily ascertained.        It approaches however
 to one or two species mentioned by Dr. Pallas, Mr. Pennant,
 and others; but differs in size, being much larger, as well as
 in  the appearance    of  the fore-feet, which      have claws differ
 ently formed from any        of  the pouched species hitherto        de

    In order   to secure its knowledge among naturalists, it may
 be proper to form for it a specific character, viz.

    Afh-coloured rat, with short, round, nearly naked tail,
       pouched cheeks, and the claws of the fore-feet very
       large, formed for burrowing in the ground.
    The cheek-pouches are far larger, in proportion to the
 animal, than in any other of this tribe, and therefore have
•given occasion for the specific name. (Plate VIII.)

     HAVE been travelling during the greater part of the
summer for the restoration of my health.             I spent some time
in Swisserland, where I met with          one    of my old friends, an
excellent chemist.      We     repeated, amidst the thunder      of can
non,   a great number     of the experiments I had made on the
analysis   of azot ; and   I can now prove that this substance is
a compound body. The experiments of Wiegleb and VVurzer
are true, whatever the Dutch chemists may fay to the con
trary  ; but these experiments, as you may readily conceive,
prove nothing against the theory of Lavoisier. I have written
a memoir in French on the analysis of azot, which I should
send you to be inserted in the Annales, were           I  certain that it
would not be lost by the way.
   I am now     publishing the third edition of my Principles of
                 * From  the Annales dc Cbimie,   No. 99.
                                                                     the

 the Antiphlogistic       Chemistry,           in which you will find new
 ideas on the acidisiable           base   of   the marine acid.          I  am cer
 tain it is hydrogen ; but the acid contains much                       less  oxygen
 than water.
     That I may not leave your curiosity ungratisied in regard
 to the analysis     of azot, I must tell you, that it is composed
 of hydrogen and oxygen in the proportion of CV2I of the
 former, and o"jg of the latter *: it is nothing else, therefore,
 than an oxyd of hydrogen. All our eudiometry is false, since
 azot is a production of our eudiometric analysis, and did not
 exist in the air before the experiment.                  Alumine or argilla
 ceous earth      is the substance most proper for changing atmo
 spheric   air into azotic gas.            This is the principle on which
 the production' of saltpetre, so much sought after in France
 at the commencement of the war, depends, and which is
 now discovered by my experiments.
     Hydrogen gas may be transformed into azotic gas by re
 spiration : the oxygen gas, a part of which is always con
 densed in the lungs, joins itself to the hydrogen, and chances
 it into azot.      The   fame conversion            may be effected, and in a
 much more sensible manner, by bringing                        hydrogen gas into
 contact with moistened argil.

 2 18        Meshed employed at Astracan       Jw   making
 i> pretty right in what he says     of it in general. It is one of
 those arts of the Last, which, like that of the Turkev dve for
cotton, the preparation of Ruslia leather, isinglass, &c. have
remained unknown and unemployed, not because they are kept
secrets, but because none of the European travellers ever took
the trouble to learn them, and because the materials used are
not so common and so cheap in Europe.             It mav be of some
utility, therefore, if I here    give  a circumstantial description
of this art as it is practised    at Astracan by the Tartars and
Armenians-, especially as the method of these people is per
fectly similar to that used in Turkey, Persia, and various parts
of Bucharia,     and  as the shagreen-makers         of Astracan ac
knowledge that they obtained the process originally from
Persia.
    All kinds of horses' or afles' fltin, which have been dressed
in such a manner as to appear grained, are by the Tartars
i-Mcdfauvtr, by the Persians /ogre, and bv the Turks Jagri,
from which the Europeans have made Jhagrcen or chagrin.
The Tartars who reside at Astracan, with a few of the Ar
menians of that city, are the only people in the Ruffian em
pire acquainted with the art of making sliagreen. Those who
follow this occupation not only gain considerable prosit by
the sale of their production to the Tartars of Cuban, Astra
can, and Casan, who ornament with it their Turkey leather
bools, flippers, and other articles made of kadier; but they
derive considerable advantage from the great sale of horses'
hides, which have undergone no oilier process than thai of
being scraped clean, and of which several thousands are an
nually exported, at the .me of from 75 to 85 roubles per hun
dred, to Persia, where there is a scarcity of such hides, and
from which the greater part of the sliagreen manufactured in
that country is prepared.       The hind part only of the hide,
however, which is cut out in the form of           a crescent about a
Huflian ell   and  a half  in length   across the  loins, and a sliort
ell in breadth along the back, can properly be employed for
sliagreen.    The remaining     part,  as  is proved by experience,
is improper for that purpose, and is therefore rejected.
    The preparation of the skins, after being cut into the above
 form, is  as follows : — They   are deposited   in  a tub silled with
                                                                  pure

                      grained Parchment, or Shagreen.                      2T9
 pure water, and suffered to remain there for several days, til!
 they are thoroughly soaked, and the hair has dropped off.
 They are then taken from the tub, one by one, extended on
 boards placed in an oblique direction against a wall, the cor
 ners of them, which reach beyond the edges of the board,
 being made fast, and the hair with the epidermis is then
 scraped off with a blunt iron scraper called urak.              The skins
 thus cleaned are again put in pure water to soak.               When all
 the skins have undergone this part of the process, they are
 taken from the water a second time, spread out one after the
 other as before, and the flefli side is scraped with the same
 kind of instrument.             They are carefully cleaned also 011
 the hair fide, so that nothing remains but the pure fibrous
 tissue, which serves for making parchment, consisting of coats
 of white medullary         fibres,  and which has a resemblance          to a
 swine's bladder softened in water.
     After this preparation, the workmen take a certain kind
 of frames called p'Jlzi, made of a straight and a semi-circuLir
 piece of wood, having nearly the same form as the skins.                  On
 these the skins are extended in as smooth and even a manner
 as possible by means of cords;           and during      the operation     of
extending them they arc several times besprinkled with
water, that no part of them may be dry, and occasion an
unequal tension.           After they have been all extended on the
frames, they are again moistened, and carried into the house,
where the frames are deposited close to each other on the
floor with the flesh          side  os the skin next the ground.         The
upper    side    is -then thickly bestrewed      with the .hlack exceed
ingly smooth and hard seeds            of a  kind of goose-foot, (chent-

The   frames, without (baking the seeds, are then carried out
into the open air, and placed in a reclining position against a
wall to dry, the side covered with the seeds being next the
wall, in order that it may be sheltered from the sun. In this
state the skins must be left several days to dry in the fun,
until no    appearance     of moisture    is observed in them ; when
they are     sit to be   taken    from the frames.      When     the im
pressed feeds are beat off from the hair side, it appears full         of
indentations or inequalities, and has acquired that impression
which is to produce the grain of the shagreen, after the skins
have been subjected         to the last smoothing or scraping, and
have been dipped        in  a  ley, which will be mentioned here
after, before they receive the dye.
    The operation of smoothing is performed on an inclined
bench or board, which is furnished with an iron hook, and
is covered with thick felt or sheep's wool, on which the drv
 skin may gently rest. The skin is suspended in the middle of
 the bench or board to its iron hook, by means of one of the
 holes made in the edge of the skin for extending it in its
 frame as before mentioned ; and a cord, having at its extre
 mity a stone or a weight, is attached to each end of the skin,
 to keep it in its position while under the hands of the work
 man.      It is then subjected to the operation of smoothing and
scraping by means of two different instruments. The sirli
 used for this purpose,       called by the Tartars    tokar,  is a piece
 of stiarp  iron   bent like   a hook, with which     the surface  of the
 shagreen is pretty closely scraped to remove         all the projecting
 inequalities.      This operation, on account         of the corneous
 hardness of the dry skin, is attended with            some difficulty    ;
 and great caution is at the fame time required that too much
 of the impression of the alabuta feed be not destroyed, which
 might be the cafe if the iron were kept too (harp. As the
 iron, however, is pretty blunt, which occasions inequalities
 on the shagreen, this inconvenience must afterwards be re
 medied by means        of a sharp scraping-iron or urak, by which
 the surface acquires a perfect uniformity, and only faint im
 pressions of the alabuta feed then remain, and such as the
  workman wislies.        After all   these operations, the shagreen is
  a^ain put into water, partly to make         it pliable, and partly   tQ
                                                                     raise

raise the grain.          As   the feeds occasion    indentations in the
surface    of   the skin, the intermediate spaces, by the operations
of smoothing       and scraping,    lose some part    of their projecting
substance ;      but the points which      have been      depressed,   and
which have lost none of their substance,    now swell up above
the scraped parts, and thus form the grain of the shagreen.
To produce this effect, the skins are left to soak in water for
twenty-four hours; after which they are immersed several
times in a strong warm ley, obtained, by boiling, from a
strong alkaline earth named Jcbora, which is found in great
abundance in the neighbourhood of Astracan.     When the
skins have been taken from this ley, they are piled up, while
warm, on each other, and suffered to remain in that state
several    hours; by which        means   they swell, and become       soft.
They                              hours in a moderately strong
          are then left twenty-four
pickle of common  salt, which  renders them exceedingly white
and beautiful, and fit for receiving any colour. The colour
most usual for these skins is a sea-green; but old experienced
workmen can dye them blue, red,               or black, and even make
white shagreen.
   For     the    green colour nothing is necessary but filings of
copper and         sal-ammoniac.    Sal-ammoniac is dissolved in
water till the water is completely saturated ; and the shagreen
skins, still moist, after being taken from the pickle, are
washed    over with the solution on the ungrained flesh fide,
 and   when well moistened a thick layer of copper filings is
 strewed over them : the (kins are then folded double, so that
 the fide covered with the filings is innermost. Each (kin is
 then rolled  up in a piece of felt; the rolls are all ranged
 together in proper order, and they are pressed down in an
 uniform manaer by some heavy bodies placed over them,
 under which         they remain twenty-four         hours.    During that
 period the solution of sal-ammoniac dissolves                a quantity of
 the cupreous particles sufficient to penetrate the skin and to
 give it a sea-green colour.      If the first application be not
 sufficient, the process is repeated in the fame manner; after
 which the (kins are spread out and dried.
    For the blue dye, indigo is used. About two pounds of
                                                                             is it,

 When still moist, they are folded up and sewed together at
 the edge, the flefli fide being innermost, and the shagreened

which must not be expressed. The skins are then hung up
in      the shade to dry           ;   after which    they are cleaned and paired
at the edges.
        For black fliagreen, gall-nuts               and vitriol       are employed              in
the following               manner: —The           skins, moist       from the pickle,
are thickly bestrewed                  with finely    pulverised gall-nuts.                 They
are then folded together, and laid over each other for twenty-
four hours.              A
               new ley, of bitter saline earth orschora,    in                              is
the mean time prepared, and  poured   hot into small  troughs.
In this ley each skin    several times dipped

from the dust of the galls. When this done, they arc rubbedis
over, on the shagreen side, with melted sheep's tallow, and
exposed        a   little in the sun, that they may imbibe the grease.

tlent quantity of vitriol of iron                is dissolved   in water, with
which the shagreen is moistened on both fides, and by this
operation it acquires a beautiful black dye. It is then dressed
at the edges, and in other pjaces where there are any ble-
misties.
    To obtain white         shagreen, the skins must first be moistened,
on the shagreen side, with a strong solution of alum.                       When
the skin has imbibed this liquor, it is daubed over on both
sides with       a paste     made     of flour, which        is suffered to dry.
The     paste is then washed off with alum-water, and the skin
is placed in the fun till it is completely dry. As soon as it
is dry, it is gently besmeared with pure melted sheep's tal
low, which it is suffered to imbibe in the sun                   ; and, to pro
mote the effect,         it is   pressed    and worked with the hands.
The     skins are then fastened          in succession to the before-men
tioned bench, where warm water is poured over them, and
the superfluous fat is scraped off with a blunt wooden instru
ment.        In the last operation the warm water is of great ser
vice.      In this manner stiagreen perfectly white is obtained,
and nothing remains but to pair the edges and dress it.
     But this white shagreen is not intended so much for re
maining in that state as for receiving a dark red dye, because,
by the above previous process, the colour becomes much
more perfect.          The skins destined for a red colour              must not
 be immersed       first  in ley of bitter salt earth (febora),         and then
 in pickle, but, after they have been whitened, must be left
 to soak in the pickle for twenty-four hours.                   The dye is pre
 pared from cochineal, which the Tartars call kirmitz.                      About
 a pound      of  the dried herb tschagann,             which grows in great
 abundance in the neighbourhood of Astracan, and is a kind
 of soda-plant or kali, (salsola ericoides* ,) is boiled a full
 hour in a kettle containing about four common pailfulls of
 water;      by which       means     the water acquires         a greenisli     co-

 Travels through Russia, explains        the  heib tschagann   by artemijia   annua,

 it has been dried. Besides, this artemisia is found only in the middle of

 Ions. The herb is then taken out, and about half a pound of
 pounded cochineal is put into the kettle, and the liquor is
 left to boil a full hour, care being taken to stir it that it may
 not run over.            About        15   or 20 drams     of   a substance    which
the dyers call later (orchilla) is added, and when the liquor
has been boiled for some time longer the kettle is removed
from the fire.    The skins taken from the pickle are then
placed        over each other in troughs, and the dye-liquor                              is
poured over them four different times, and rubbed into them
with     the hanils, that the colour may be equally imbibed and
diffused.          The Hquor                    which they

          neighbouring- Countries, called the Plica Polonica.
 A      HE         celebrated      Professor     Brera, who resided in Poland
during the summer of the year 1795, and who had        good                     a
opportunity of making observations on this singular disease
in the country to which     peculiar, has published the fol
                                       it   is
lowing account of                it
                                  :   — " Under  the term plica polonica                  is
understood         a   disease    by   which the hair on the head and other
parts of the body swells, becomes matted together, and forms
hard knots, and, on being touched, occasions the most acute
pain. The patient at the fame time       seized with    kind of
                                                       is                   a
nervous fever, and the functions of the brain are deranged.
This disease prevails throughout all Poland but       seems to   ;         it
be more peculiar to Lithuania, where the inhabitants, of every
age and condition, are, sooner or later, attacked it. Some            by
times     found among the wild animals, but oftener among
         it   is
the domestic,          and most frequently among horses.                    In Lower
Hungary,    the Bannat, Croatia, and Sclavonia, there       at                      is
present   similar
              a   disease, from which   foreigners  who reside
long in those countries susser more than the natives.
   " The symptoms of this dreadful malady in general are,
sleep disturbed            by    terrible dreams,     a   sudden     depression          of
ihe spirits,        and   a      loathing of     every kind of food.            A    few

days after, gouty pains are felt, sometimes                  in the arms, and
sometimes      in   the knees.     The     disease     then more and more
manifests itself, accompanied with a fever, at first of a doubt
ful nature, but which commonly exhibits a nervous charac
ter, the affections of which still increase. The physicians, in
those countries where this disease prevails, often treat it in an
improper manner, and waste the time in the application of
palliatives. The pains, uneasiness, and other affections, are,
however, sometimes lessened by the common mode of treat
ment, and the patient often recovers in some measure his
appetite,     might entertain hopes of a cure, did not a
             and
shivering of the whole body, and a stronger or weaker heat
which follows, with violent pains and an uncommon heavi
ness, remind him too much of the lurking evil.  Uncertain
respecting     the event,   he wanders about for several              months,
and, instead    of health, the disease returns with more violence
than ever.      The pains in the limbs become more acute, the
itching in the arms greater, and the patient remains confined
to his bed.   The hair begins gradually to swell, and to be
come clammy,          and a fixed pain takes place above the socket
of the eye, and gradually extends               over  the whole forehead.
The functions of the brain begin               to be deranged ; all objects
seem to the patient to have an appearance different from what
they usually have ; and he is frequently seized with sits of gid
diness, and even blindness. He is at the fame time tormented
with intolerable thirst,         and experiences       a violent sensation      of
burning in the throat, and over the whole skin. The urine
is commonly turbid, almost of a coffee-brown colour, and
gives a dark sediment.           The body      is costive.
  "    Under       these circumstances the disease           increases,   and   it
then becomes high time to apply means for lessening, or ra
ther removing, if possible, those affections which threaten the
life of the patient. This is the critical period for bringing
the disease,    as the   Polish physicians fay, to maturity. When
this is accomplistied, the patient      will be past all danger. The
surest means       of effecting this   end     is,   to endeavour to excite
perspiration   ;    for which purpose the warm bath, strengthened
with   a decoction       of aromatic or other herbs according to
  Vol. VI.                             G   g                          circum

circumstances, and which the patient ought to use every day, is
to be recommended. At other times, the body must often be
rubbed with flannel, in order to maintain a determination of
the juices           towards the skin.                Diluent medicines,              such    as
the extract            soap, hemlock, and mereurius dulcis if
                     of bitters,
no scorbutic diathesis exists, are to be administered internally.
It has been confirmed by repeated experiments, that strong
perspiration, often continued, for several days, is the conse
quence of this treatment. The matter perspired is in general
exceedingly clammy, and has a nauseous foetid smell.        In
consequence            of this perspiration the morbid affections                          gra
dually disappear, the patient feels himself lighter, and might
imagine himself quite well, were he not obliged to drag about
a heavy load of filthy matted hair, filled with a multitude of
small worms *.              By cutting       off" the    hair, the patient would be
exposed to the utmost danger                     :    the consequences are, blind

instance of a lady, who, after having been almost cored, died
suddenly on attempting to draw a comb, even with the utmost
gentleness, through her hair.   The best method       to bear                       is,
the inconvenience with patience for three or four years.  Al
the favourable period when the hair begins to be disengaged,
at   which time the young hair                   is   seen   springing up, the follow
ing rules arc to be observed                :—    A       place     to be sought for in

and this process must be daily repeated, sometimes in one place
and sometimes in another.     The hair which has been com
pletely disengaged    then to be cut with great caution. After

hair must be suspended, and bathing be resumed.     By these
means the affections not only disappear, but the remaining
clotted hair often becomes loosened of itself.                                In this     disease

IX.       On the Ammoniure of Cobalt, and an Acid contained in
     the Grey Oxyd         of that Me/al known under the Name of
     Zaffar.       By  L. Brugnatelli              *.
          HE     metallic ammoniures have for some time past en
gaged my attention.             These compounds result from a che
mical combination of ammonia with metals.                        Hitherto they
have been little examined, that             of copper     excepted,    notwith
standing their characteristic properties,             which  distinguish them
from other bodies. The ammoniure, which first became the
object of my researches, was that of cobalt f. The parti
cularities which it presented are as follows : —
     i. I had several times observed that the precipitate, formed
by ammonia in a solution os the nitrat of cobalt, was re-dif-
solved       in that alkali.       I  collected some of it on a filter,
and washed and dried it.            On half an ounce of this precipitate,
which was of a dark colour, I poured two ounces of liquid
ammonia, stopped the bottle, and left it at rest. The tem
perature of the atmosphere was 200 above zero of Reaumur.
At the end of twenty-four hours the alkali had assumed a
dark-red colour        |,   and   the precipitate was entirely dissolved.
I  thought       I had formed a pure ammoniure, but              I endeavoured
to procure a larger quantity by other means.
     2.    I tried to dissolve   smalt or blue cobalt in caustic am
monia, but without success, even when long digestion was
    * From the Annahs       dc Cbimie,  No. 9$.
    f   I   have since examined    the ammoniures      of mercury,  zinc, copper,
and arsenic.
    % Bergman      had observed only that ammonia assumed      a red colour with
cobalt.      Coballum,  says he, a niccolo differt quod omnibus acidis el alcali
volatili Jblvatnr colors ritbro. This circumstance has been noticed by all
chemists without niiding any thing to it.
                                     Gg    %                        employed    j

 228           On  the  Ammoniure and         Add of Cobalt.
 employed ; but I easily succeeded in dissolving the grey oxyd
 of this metal, commonly called zaffar. This substance af
 forded me the means of easily procuring ammoniure in abun
 dance, and permitted me to repeat and vary my experiments
 different ways.
    3. I evaporated to dryness the ammoniure obtained from
 zaffar.    The  concrete     residuum    I obtained, was      composed of
two very distinct substances ; one of which              had    a  dark     red,
 and the other a pale-yellowish colour.
    4.  I poured distilled water on this residuum,               stirring    the
matter with     a glass spatula.       The   red   part was entirely        dis
solved,    and   communicated          to  the   water a beautiful          role
colour.     The yellowish matter remained undissolved.
    5.  The  yellowish substance may be obtained during the
evaporation of the liquid ammoniure, from which it begins
to be separated at the moment when it is reduced to half its
bulk.     The red substance remains dissolved in the last quarter
of the liquid *.
    6. The ammonia then takes from the zaffar, and holds in
solution, two very distinct matters ; one of which, soluble in
water, has a red colour; and the other, insoluble in the same
liquid, has a yellowisti colour.           The latter substance is the
pure oxyd of cobalt.          I think I discovered in the former                a
peculiar   acid,  distinct   from   all the other acids known.
                    Of   the   pure Oxyd     of Cobalt.
    7. The yellowish substance, which is separated by the flow
evaporation of the ammoniure in the air or in the sun, may
be considered as the pure oxyd of cobalt.                 It is insipid, in
odorous, insoluble in water, and soluble in all the mineral
acids. The nitro-muriatic acid forms with it a yellowish
solution, which is in great measure deprived of its colour by
the addition of a little distilled water.
    8. This solution may be employed for sympathetic ink,
like the common nitro-muriat of cobalt.                    Sometimes the
acid refuses to dissolve the whole of the oxyd, but by                 adding
a little water the solution is completed.

Well stopped, there is separated from it  a yellow  matter.'                  .
                                                                     0. This

     9. This solution is precipitated by the                            prufliat of pot-afli
of   a blueifh-green colour, which does not change.                                         It   is not
precipitated by the gallic acid, but the mixture acquires a
darker colour.  In other respects this solution exhibits all the
phenomena of a common solution os cobalt in the same acid.
     10.   The muriatic acid               dissolves exceedingly well the yellow
oxyd, and assumes a beautiful highly-charged green colour.
This colour immediately disappears with the nitric acid as
well as with a little water, but it reappears by the addition
of   a   little of the muriatic acid well concentrated.
                         Of    the sure Ammoniure                    of Cobalt.
   11. The yellow oxyd dissolves entirely in ammonia, and
forms pure ammoniure of cobalt.       This ammoniure has a
yellow, and sometimes a rose, colour.   It is not decomposed
by acids.           It   is deprived           of   its colour by the muriatic acid.
The          of pot-ash changes it to grey, and occasions after
         prussiat
wards            of the fame colour. The fulphure of pot-ash
           a deposit
makes it assume a dark colour inclining to black, and preci
pitates from it fulphure of cobalt *. The borat (alkaline) of
soda is decomposed by      and precipitated into borat of cobalt
                                         it,
of   a   very white colour.

     12.   The      red substance      of the preceding experiments was
separated from the              yellow oxyd.  For this purpose   evapo                   I

to about the fourth                of    its volume,          and no longer precipitated

    7. It decomposes all the alkaline sulphures from which it
precipitates the sulphur.
    8. It precipitates ammoniure of copper of a bright green,
and that of zinc of a pure white colour.
    9.   It precipitates the sulphat of copper of the         same colour
as the ammoniure         of that metal.
    10.    It precipitates the nitrat of    silver white ;

gold and platina.
     15.   It  precipitates lime-water in a white coagulum inso
luble in water, and super-saturated with acid.
     16. It precipitates the acetite and muriat of barytes.
     17.    It is separated from the water which holds it in solu
 tion by alcohol.
     18.    Emploved as a sympathetic ink, it is not coloured
 green     or  blue like solutions of cobalt, but renders the paper
 brown and then black when it has been exposed to a strong
 heat, as is the cafe with other acids.
     19. With tincture of gall-nuts newly made, it forms an
 abundant yellowish precipitate.
     20. With a saturated solution of soda it gives an irregular
 transparent      salt soluble in water, but not deliquescent         in the
 air.
     21.    With pot-ash it forms        a  salt crystallisable   in square
  crystals,    transparent, and not deliquescent in the open         airj

      The     presence   of an acid in zaffar made me suspect that
  this acid might be of an arsenical nature ; but this doubt soon
  Tanislied by comparing the characters of the two acids.
      1st, The arsenic acid does not precipitate solutions of silver
  like the cobaltic acid,           ad, The arsenic acid precipitates
  lime-water: this arseniate is redissolved by the acid as well
  as by a fresh quantity of lime-water.             The contrary is the
                            9                                            cafe

 the cobaltic acid, decompose themuriat and the acetite of ba-
  rytes.    4th, The arsenic acid is soluble in alcohol, which
 precipitates the cobaltic acid under a concrete form.
     It  remained to be ascertained         whether the acid extracted
 from zaffar existed already formed in that oxyd, or whether
 it was produced by the action of the ammonia.
     As   the acid     of cobalt readily dissolves in water, I boiled fix
 pounds     of  zaffar  in eight pounds of water for a quarter of au
 hour, and filtered the liquor while warm.                What passed was
 transparent       and colourless,    but manifested    a sensible taste.   I
 evaporate'd       the liquid,    taking care to cover the vessel with a
 piece   of  silk.    When       reduced to   one-half it became turbid,
 without the substance which was separated appearing sensibly-
 coloured.        I continued the evaporation till a third only of
 the liquor remained. When I removed it from the sire there
 was deposited a very white matter, which, on coming into
 contact with the air, assumed a beautiful rose colour.                 I se^
 parated this matter, and collected it on the filter.
    The liquor which passed had a bright-yellow colour, and
 was perfectly transparent.          It manifested in a decided manner
 an acid taste ; reddened tincture of turnsol ; speedily decom
posed lime-water,          salts  of barytes,   and   those of silver; was
precipitated with alcohol, Sec.            In a word, it exhibited all
the properties of the cobaltic acid obtained by the processes
before mentioned.
    The red deposit which remained on the filter was insipid,
aud gave to the muriatic acid a very beautiful green colour.
It was the pure oxyd of cobalt. This oxyd dissolved in a
large quantity in its acid, and was precipitated from it in
proportion as the latter was concentrated. The acid which
the ammonia had separated from the zassar was found then
entirely formed in that iubilance.                It still remains to be
determined, in        a positive   manner, what is its radical.      In the
mean time        I  thought it my duty to        retain its name of the
cobaltic acid.

 I RELAND             has very    abundant oyster-banks near the vil
lage of Arklow, on the eastern fide of Dublin, from which
feed is conveyed to the artificial beds of the capital on the
northern side near Clontarf ; and further south, at Sutton,
not far from Howth. Also at Polebeg and Dalkey, not far
from Dublin         ;   and    particularly    Ireland's      Eye,   where the
largest and best oysters lie at the depth               of about     eighteen    or
twenty fathoms under the water. Likewise to the north of
Dublin, near Rush and Skerries, where the oysters are falter
and harder than in places where more fresh water falls into
the sea*.        Scotland has great abundance of oysters near the
island of Inch Keith, which is not far from Leith.
     I  have   no intention of enumerating all the places where
oyster-beds are found ; but I stiall here give a list of those with
which I am acquainted, because it perhaps may be of use
 to travellers    who think objects of this kind not unworthy of
their notice.         These shell-fish are found in various places on
 the coast of France ; such as the mouth of the Seine, where,
 though few in number, they are of an excellent quality.                        On
the coast of Caen, in Normandy, there is a bank six miles in
length and one in breadth. They are found also in the Bay
 of Isigny, and in the neighbourhood of Cherbourg.                          Those
 in particular are highly valued which are collected at the
 mouths of some streams where the sea-water                        is sometimes
 thrown entirely back, and which are called buitres de pied.
 Granville, in Normandy, gains 50,000 livres by this fishery. f
 On     the coast     of Brittany    there are very large oysters,           parti
 cularly at Concalle, where a great many are preserved in
 places enclosed for the purpose.               The bank at Painpol is al
 most entirely exhausted. At the mouth of the Loire; between
 the rocks on the coast         of Poitou, on       the coast    of Aunis      and
 Saintonge, where those who make bay-salt transplant oysters to

 marfliy places, in which they acquire a better quality, though
 they never become so good as the green ones of Saintonge :
 also a la tetc de Bucb, near Bourdeanx.                      In Languedoc, near
 Cape Leucate, there is an oyster-bank at the depth of twenty
 feet.    At the mouth of the Rhone, on the coast of Provence.
 At Paris those oysters are most esteemed which come from
 Bretagne, Rochelle, Bourdeaux, and particularly from Medoc.
    The Dutch have some oyster-beds on the coast of Zealand,
 near Zierikzee; oysters are kept there aMb in pits as well as
 at the town      of Brouwershaven, and particularly at Petren in
 North Holland: those of the last- mentioned place are much
 esteemed, and are known under the name of Petten oysters.
 For these pits * many ship loads are transported every year
 from the coasts of England.
    There are exceedingly rich oyster-banks in the duchy of
 Holstein and in the neighbourhood of Jutland, which sup
ply most of the oysters used in the northern part of -Ger
 many. I entertained hopes that we should have obtained a
complete     description of these oyster-beds in the highly valu
able collection      of the Prov'mz'tal-blattern of Schlefwig-Hol-
ftein,  as  well as of the trade to which they give rife; but hi
therto this hope, as far            as   I  know,      has never been realised.
It   gives   me greater          pleasure, therefore,         to be able to supply
in  some measure        this deficiency by the information on that
subject, which, by the means of Professor Tychfcn and
M. Adler, I obtained from M. Todsen, a clergyman at
Uberg near Tondem.
    The royal      oyster-beds        lie all together on the western coast
of the duchy ofSchleswig, between the islands Fande, Rom or
Romoe, Sylt, Fcihr, Amrom, Nordftrand, Silworm, Stide-
rog, and extend          from the district of Ripen to Helgoland.
The number of         the beds from which oysters can be fiflied is
at present reckoned          to be fifty     : the    greaterpart of them           take

their names from the persons by whom they were discovered.
Some of them are a furlong, some a quarter of a mile, and
some half a mile in length ; and their breadth is equally va
rious.      M. Todsen ascribes, and with great propriety, the
excellent quality of these oysters to the water which in the
spring is swept by a continued east wind that blows from the
continent through the canal and sluices.                    The oystere of
these different banks are not all          of  the fame kind j      in some
they are large,     in   others  of  a moderate       size,  and  in many
only small : the last, were they left to grow older, would
never attain to a larger size. The large oysters are called de-
putat-aujlern, the rest kaufmanfaujlern.              Till the year 1794,
the royal chamber of domains let these oyster-banks to the
highest bidder for the term of six years ; but as this period
was too short for the persons who took the lease, and preju
dicial to the fisliery, they were let to the present lessee,
M. Asmussen, merchant in Tondern, during his natural
life, from the year 1795, for the yearly sum of 7505 dollars,
which must always be paid in advance. He has bound him
self to furnish yearly ua^ barrels of oysters to be delivered
from time to time, but each time never less than four, and
never more than eight barrels, carriage free, at Hadersleben,
for the royal family.          This city is distant about ten miles
 from the village of Hoyer, where the oysters are landed, and
which      is a mile from Tondern.            The   lessee is  permitted to
 fish for and sell oysters only during the four last and the four
 first months of the year.           The instruments used for fishing
 up these oysters are of the fame kind as those employed in
 other countries. The most common is a kind of drag-net
 made of thongs of seals- skin worked together, and fastened to
 an iron frame which scrapes up the oysters.                    These nets,
 when the fishermen         have arrived at the proper place,         are let
 down by means            of  ropes   made     fast  to   the  iron frame.
 M. Asmussen uses at present eighteen vessels, which are per
 fectly similar to those of which figures have been given by
 Duhamel.        The fishermen bring their lading either to the
 above-mentioned village of Hoyer or to Husum *, which is
                                                                        seven

   seven miles from Tondern.             From there the oysters are con
   veyed to Apenrade and Flenfburg,               and thence in ships to the
   East Sea,     where the consumption is greatest, for a barrel
   sometimes     is fold there at the rate of 100 roubles.              It is not
   true that they cost dearer        to the natives      than to foreigners :
   a hundred cost a dollar ; and a            barrel, containing from 800
  to 1000 oysters, about ten dollars,             sometimes     more or    less.
      The number caught,           and   the consumption,        vary exceed
  ingly in different years.          During stormy        weather and severe
  frost, none can be fished.          The number fished         up yearly, the
  lessee,  for  reasons   which     cannot be disapproved, has hitherto
  kept a secret; but it is certain that 2000 barrels would scarcely
  be sufficient to pay the rent and expences.
      These shell-fish    are more or less injured by frost and stormy
  weather, according to the depth              at which     they   lie.    Some
  beds at high       tides have only eight, some three, and some
  scarcely two      fathoms      water above them ; and the last suffer
  most when continued frost prevails with a wind from the east
  or north, because on those occasions the tide is scarcely per
  ceptible on this coast. The beds during stormy weather are
  sometimes     covered with sand and sea-weeds,             but by the fame
  cause they may be freed from them.                 Those beds which are
 in danger of being           covered    with mud, sand, shells, or          sea
 weed, the fishermen endeavour to keep clean by continual
 fishing on them ; but those beds which contain a grea.t num
 ber of young oysters they' spare as much as possible.
     The five-fingered fifli infests these beds, but the oyster-
 fishers call it the star-fish. A long red worm, also, with a great
 number of feet, is found among those oysters which are old
 and sickly.       Oysters    of three years      old are accounted       fit for
 sale.    The   lessee is  forbidden, under the        severest  penalties,    to
 fish up any younger.           The fishermen must carefully separate
 the young ones from those which are eatable, and throw
 them back into the beds. To be able to distinguish the three
years old oysters,      it is necessary to be well acquainted with the
oyster-bed   were formerly offered up in the church of Husum ; but this
has been   omitted for several   years past, because the owner refused to allow
the clergyman about two hundred oysters, which he claimed for performing
that duty.
                                                                           beds,

size of their {hell.
   The oyster-banks of Jutland lie on the              eastern side  of the
northern extremity, near Fladstrand, a market-town,                  where
there is a passage over to      Norway;      also at the ifland  of Lessoe,
situated   in the Cattegat, three miles from Sabie, in the dis
trict of Aalborg.        Respecting this fishery, several regulations
have been published, one of which is dated February 1709.
Attempts have often been made to transplant oysters to the
large bays which extend from the Cattegat twenty miles
across the country, and nearly intersect it; but they have
been attended with as little success as those on the coast of
Seeland.
   Norway      has excellent oysters,       and in great abundance on
the western coasts.        The   best are those found on the         rocks,
and called rock-oysters.           Many of them are pickled, and
sent   in jars and other vessels, which contain the sixteenth
part of a barrel, to different parts of the East Sea.                These
oysters often contain pearls ; but they are not of a large size,
and never have complete          splendour.
    Sweden has excellent oysters on the coast of Bahus-Lan,
near the ifland of Kastero, a mile west from Stromstad, from
which they are sent, as well as from Udewalla, to every part
of the kingdom.         The   fishermen    there pretend that, when an
oyster-bed     has been exhausted,       it requires    from four to five
years before it is again stocked *.
    Italy has oysters of different qualities.          Those found near
Ancona      are of   a large size,    but not very well tasted. Those
are accounted the best which are produced in prodigious
multitudes near Tarento, in the sea called Mare Piccolo, or
Jl  Picciol Mare, which is a large bay that extends past Ta
rento towards the north-east.            I mention this circumstance,
because in most of the geographical books and charts these
names are wanting.           I found them only in an old chart of
the Terra di Otranto, by         J.  Janfon, though      they often occur
in books of travels.

 chiefly five by it : on this account the greatest care is taken
 to preserre                and increase         the oyfier-beds.            At   present there
 »re seven,             which belong partly to the king, partly                          to   the
 clergy, and partly to private persons.                               They are all        set  on
 fcase.           Those who pay to the proprietors 30 carlini may fHh
 for oysters till St. Andrew's day. It is asserted that they bring
in yearly 21,348 ducats, and that the duty on all the cyflers
 and shell-fish which are sent from the city amounts to 5615.
 If we        add to this what b gained bv the preparation of byflus
 {tana pinna*) we may estimate, according to the assertion of
 the archbishop Joseph Capece-Latro t, the whose annual re-
 rum at 100,000 ducats. Great care is here taken that the
 oysters may not be disturbed during the time they are spawn
ing,         and that all the young ones be thrown back again                                into
the       sea.         It is generally believed here that all {hell-fish                      are

cattle. In the year 153S, on St. Michael's day, an earth
quake, which had continued some time, became so violent
 that the lake retired from its banks, and its bason was almost,
entirely filled up ; as was the cafe, in part, with the lake
Avernus.         The neighbouring small town of Tripergala was
 swallowed      up with all its inhabitants and riches. It con
 tained    a  great many monks and nuns, who, it is said, led
 very irregular       lives.     "  It might     have been expected,"        fays
 Blainville,     "   that the gulph would have been satisfied with
 the nuns and monks, and that it would not have carried its
 revenge further : but this was not the case ; as a monument
 to posterity,    it threw up       such a quantity      of filth, that it pro
 duced a mountain a mile             in height    and four miles    in circum

  find them much more pleasant than fresh ones when they

XI.   Description of Mr. Collier's improved Apparatus             for
       Filtering and Sweetening Water and other Fluids.
   J. HE     importance of obtaining pure water for culinary
purposes    is so obvious, that any invention for facilitating that
object deserves, and will be sure to meet with, due attention
 from the public,    as it is  a matter that very much concerns
 their health.
    The  general practice     of pasting a fluid simply through the
 pores or interstices of any compact substance is attended with
obvious objections.       If the filter is either of animal or vege
 table production, it must necessarily be acted upon by the
fluid, which at the fame time percolates through its own
 sediment and corruption.        Hence arises the necessity of fre
 quent change of the filter, which, while it does not alto
gether remove the evil, is at the fame time attended with
much trouble and expence.           If we use natural or artificial
 stone, or any other substance found in the mineral kingdom,
the sediment finds its way into the substance of the filler*
 which    is thereby rendered      extremely foul, and cannot be
 completely cleansed     by any contrivance hitherto resorted to
 for that purpose.     In percolations through sand, or any thing
 in the form of powder, this reasoning does not completely
 apply ; but in that cafe the powder must be often displaced
 to be washed      or changed.      If unconfined, the fluid forms
 channels for itself in various directions; and if confined, as
 by mechanical force, in a strong box, it is liable to the very
 objections urged against the use of compact substances.          The
 inventor of the machines, of which it is now proposed to give
  some account, does not pretend to have arrived at the nt plus
                                                                 ultra

¦ultra  of improvement in an art of so much importance to
society as that of purifying water.            So far, however, as con
cerns the difficulty hitherto complained of in the process of
filtration, we think he has completely succeeded.                  He has
also consulted the only true principles which can shorten the
extreme tediousness         of this  process.
    First, The grosser particles and corruption form no obstruc
tion, as the fluid takes a direction from the exterior of the
filter inwards.
    Secondly, As the filtering medium comprises numerous
cylinders of small diameters, the contents of which are also
small compared with their external surface, the percolating
superficies    altogether     is as much increased as the magnitude
of the machine will allow.
    Thirdly, As these cylinders           do   not themselves   form the
vessel  containing the fluid, but are placed in the vessel, they
sustain    a pressure proportioned to the whole perpendicular
height of the fluid within it.
    Moreover,      it  must be admitted       that the substance chosen
as a percolating medium is free from any possible chemical
objection, being formed of materials of sufficient durability,
and altogether       insoluble in water and most other fluids.
    Fig. 1. (Plate IX.) a section of a cistern of any materials
and   of any size, with a cock A to draw water for common
use. B, a leaden reservoir, holding 4, 6, or 8 gallons, placed
inside, the cock C of which comes through and is soldered
into the fide of the cistern, from which filtered water is drawn
off.    The bottom of the reservoir is raised about two inches
above the lower edge DD of the side B, that it may stand
above     the   sediment      in the water. — EE are 4, 6, or more
hollow cylinders, closed at one end, fastened into the lead,
formed of argil and iilex baked together in a potter's kiln,
through which the water percolates into the reservoir B, which
has a tube a few inches diameter, as high as the cistern, with
a small aperture at top for the air to escape, while its dimen
sions answer another purpose.             As water will    find  its level
when the machine has been long at rest,               the water  will ob
tain the fame altitude in the tube as it stands at in the cistern ;
and whenever it is drawn off for common purposes, the fame
principle    causes   it to fall in the tube, passing inversely through

 well as a flux, which will always keep the pores free from

     Fig. 2. a section of a calk or tub, contrived, as to the filter
 ing part, precisely on the same principles, but furnished with
 a sweetening apparatus, which cousists of broken crockery
 placed between two partitions, so that the water poured in at
 the top falls through small apertures upon innumerable sur
 faces; and the cask being perforated all round at GG, is ex
 posed to atmospheric air, probably some hours before it escapes
„drnp by drop into the division below.
     The   reservoir only differs   in shape from those contrived for
 cisterns, as may be seen Fig. 3. which is a horizontal section
 of the   cask Fig. 2.
     Fig. 4. a section of a case lined with lead, and furnished
 inside with cylinders supported on a frame above a cistern
 lined with lead to receive the filtered water.            It only differs
 from the cask in this respect, that the filtering process pre
 cedes the sweetening; the foul water is drawn off at the up
 per, and the water for use at the lower, cock. A funnel or
 bason, with a hole in its bottom, is placed within the frame
 of this   apparatus   between     the   cafe and    the cistern already
 described.      Through this funnel, which is filled with broken
 crockery,     the  water which falls from the cafe is obliged to
 pass before it can reach the cistern.        A vertical section of this
 funnel is represented      in Fig. 5.

 for the convenience       of moving, lashing      to a ship,  Sec.   The
  frame is furnished with a hanging door on each side impan
 nelled with canvass, which, while it excludes dust, admits air,
  and may be lifted up to examine the          state of the cistern when
  necessary.

   of a nut and screw, and,         with   the afli stance of leather, a
   sound   joint is   made to connect it with the leaden bottom          of
   the  cafe Fig. 4  and 5.
      It would be vain to attempt, by mere mechanical means,
   to free water from those principles which are held in a state

rendering   rain  or  river  water   as  clear   and transparent as hard

of using the latter, which generally abounds with pernicious
impregnations collected from the bowels of the earth by

  XII. A    cursory     View of some of         the late Discoveries    in
                                  Science.
                        [Continued from Page 132.]
 B>ARRUEL          has made       researches     respecting   the cause of
elasticity, which he ascribes        to two principles:        1. "Every
body in nature,"       fays he,
                                   "  is porous, and      these pores   are
proportioned to the density of the substance : 2. These pores
are filled with different fluids, and principally with caloric.
But caloric possesses a strong repulsive force ; from which it
follows, that, when an clastic body is compressed, the caloric
in its pores drives back by its repulsive power the displaced
parts, and brings them to their former state."                 Libes, who
has examined the fame subject, makes elasticity to depend
on caloric interposed        either between        the moleculæ of the
bodies, or combined          with them, and at the fame time on
the attractive force of these moleculæ.               " This being pre
mised," says he,      "   I fay, that the restoration of solid bodies
after compression     is a combined effect, which depends in part
on the repulsive force which their integral moleculæ have
received from caloric, and in part from the attractive force
of these moleculæ."           He then applies elegant formulae of
calculation to these phenomena.
   Soquet has made experiments, which seem contrary to those
of Count Rumford, respecting the non-conductibility of ca
loric by fluids.     " I have seen," says he, " at Venice a piece
of glass, in a state of incandescence, immersed into a pail of
water without     the    latter  being reduced to a state of vapour;
but, having plunged my naked arm into the water, I found
it exceedingly hot. I then approached my hand gently be
low the mass of glass, and sensibly felt its heat." He admits,
however, that fluids in general are not good conductors of
                                    Ii 2                           caloric.

caloric.      He then        makes     some    researches    respecting  the
cause why the water is not reduced to vapour by incandes
cent glass, while it is by incandescent iron.
   Pictet has given some very interesting observations on
elastic fluids, and aqueous         vapour in particular.         It appears
that all fluids are indebted for their elastic state to the matter
of sire, or caloric.        Some preserve this elastic state at every
temperature, and this is the cafe with aqueous vapour. The
author endeavoured to determine the quantity of caloric con
tained in water       in   a state  of vapour       at the temperature     of
ebullition  ;   and experience        proved    that this aqueous vapour
had eight or nine times more caloric than the fame water in
a liquid   state    at the fame       temperature.       The following   are
the means he employed            to obtain this result    :
   Let  M   be one     of  the masses, and      T  its temperature   ; m the
other mass, and        t  its temperature ; the temperature           of the
              ....        MT + «/
mixture will be = — —                   .
                             M+ m
   This formula he applied to the following experiment : —
He took a balloon, the water in which weighed fix ounces,
and was at the temperature            of 130. He introduced into this
water, for five minutes,          the   vapour of an eolipyle, and the
temperature of the water rose to 490, that is to fay, was
raised 360, and its weight            was    increased 228 grains.       He
then endeavoured         to discover    what calorific effect would be
produced      by 228 grains of boiling water on six ounces or
3456 grains of water at the temperature of 130 ; that is to
fay, what would be the temperature               of  the mixture.

— I7° 15' for       the temperature       of  the mixture.    Boiling water
then did not produce         but   40 T'-Js more heat in six ounces of
water at the temperature of 130 ; while the fame quantity of
water, in a state of vapour, at the temperature of 8o°, raised
the heat 360.          The calorific effect, therefore, of water in
vapour is about 8^ times greater than that of the fame water,
boiling.    But the volume of the vapour is about 1800 times
greater than that of boiling water.                 There is therefore 213
times more fire in any given volume of boiling water than
                                                                          in

in an equal volume of vapour.     The author then makes va
rious applications of these principles, but particularly to
steam-engines, the different degrees of the power of which
he determines   according to the state of compression of the
aqueous vapour.
   Perolle has made experiments on the intensity of sound in
different gases, which seem to give a result contrary to those
of Priestley, Chladni,      and   Jacquin jun.   and Paul,Maunoir
of Geneva, having  inspired hydrogen gas without being in
commoded by      were much surprised, when they attempted
                   it,
to speak, to find that their voice had become shrill and
squeaking.
   Perolle has given experiments also respecting the propaga
tion of sound,      by
                   which he shows that air       not the best     is
medium for conveying it. He stopped his ears with bits of
chewed paper, and, having applied his watch to them, could
not hear the noise of its beating. He removed the watch, and
placed   in contact with small cylindric piece of wood, the
          it                   a
other extremity of which touched one of those external parts
of the head that propagate sound such, for example, as the
                                           ;
cartilaginous parts of the ear     ;   and he then heard the beating
of the watch.
     He   suspended the wateh in the middle              of   a   bocal, and found
that the sound reached him   but having filled the bocal with
                                   ;
water, the sound was much stronger. The joints of the watch
had been luted. He placed the watch on different bodies,
such as wood,    marble table, &c. and found that the latter
                   a
transmitted the sound faintly, while the former transmitted
itwith greater or less force. He thence concludes that the
sound of musical instruments, such as violins, harps, harpsi
chords, &c. depends on the property which wood has of trans
mitting sounds; and that houses built of marble or stone are less
sonorous,      because these bodies are worse conductors                    of   sound.
     Lamarck     has observed that sounds are transmitted in vacuo
in water, and through the most solid bodies.   The cannon
of Toulon are heard at Monaco, that to fay, at the distance
                                                 is is
of more than 25 leagues, while one    lying on the ground                             ;
but the fame sounds are not propagated nearly     far in the           so
air.  From  this he concludes          :
                                                                            ist, That

proper matter which conducts found, since, notwithstanding
the great transparency of this fluid,     still too grose to pe
                                                             it   is
netrate freely the masses of those bodies which have greater
density than itself;             a    property which the matter fit for con
ducting sound evidently possesses.
  ad, That there exists an invisible, exceedingly subtile and
Angularly elastic fluid, of extreme rarity, which easily pene
trates         all bodies, which           is   diffusedthroughout every part                 of
our globe, and consequently                      throughout our atmosphere.
  3d, That this fluid    the essential cause of the elasticity
                                      is
with which atmospheric air seems to be endowed, and that
it   is   to the vibrations communicated                         to this subtile fluid —
vibrations which are transmitted with great celerity through
different mediums, and even the most solid — that we ought
to ascribe the immediate cause of sound and noise in regard
to us.
   4th, That the subtile fluid which constitutes the propa
gating matter of found      exactly the fame as the ethereal
                                           is
fire, of which the author fays he has demonstrated the exist
ence      in his different writings,                and      which may be considered
as the ethereal          fluid mentioned                  by   Newton,    to its well
                                                                               if
known properties we do not                          add the supposition               by   which
Newton gives to its vibrations                      a   velocity greater than that            of
light.
  Tremery has confirmed the opinion of those who think
that electricity         is
                 propagated in vacuo.  He exhausted en
tirely    of air     the tube     of   a barometer; and having extracted                      a
spark          by   means    of   a    metallic rod, the electric fluid passed
in the vacuum,              and      the whole inside              of   the    tube      became
luminous.
                                 ATMOSPHERIC                   AIR.
   Humboldt has published the result of his observations on
the nature of atmospheric air,       which              by
                                               appears that the        it
purity of this air  subject to
                         is is great  variations.  The sum of
his observations   as follows  — The quantity of oxygen con

dry and     serene weather.     After   great rain the eudiometer       in
dicates    in atmospheric air only 0-364, and 0*359 of oxygen.
But when the blue        sky appears, the eudiometer marks 0-284
of oxygen,      and as far as 0-290.        The experiments of Read
seem to announce a combination             between    oxygen -and elec
tricity; but we are still ignorant whether the air being charged
with the electric matter has any influence on its purity. Bach
collected the air     of the Gisberg at an elevation of 3890 feet,
and Humboldt found this air exceedingly impure. It appeared
 by the eudiometer that it contained 0-036 less of oxygen than
that of the plain ; which confirms what we before knew, that
the air on high mountains is more impure than that found
at a less elevation.       The purity of the air varies to such a
degree,      that the author saw the eudiometer announce, be
 tween   April   and November       1797, from 0-290 of oxygen to
 0*336.     But, does atmospheric air contain only oxygen, azot,
 and carbonic acid       ?   The author thinks it probable that it
 contains also a portion of hydrogen, which combines with
 the azot, and which we have no means of detecting. Hum
 boldt collected air in the crater of the peak of Teneriffe, at

 gen. It must be observed that there is no longer any erup
 tion from this crater. The pure air of the plain at the bot
 tom of the peak contains 0-278 of oxygen. The air at sea
  in  the latitude   of io° 30' contained more than 0-30 of oxy
  gen. This observation stiows that the air at                sea  contains
  more oxygen than that at land *.

     Bouvard     continues to make meteorological observations
  with great accuracy. He has found the variation of the
  needle at Paris to be 33° 15', and the dip 700 35*.             Coulomb
  employs a new process to find the dip of the needle,                which
  at Paris he estimates at 68° 10'.
      Humboldt     has made interesting observations       respecting     the
   magnetic needle.         The following      is the  result   of  those  in

   He found the variation at Marseilles on the nth of No
vember 22° 55' 30"; at Madrid, in May, 220 2'; and at
Aranjues, about the fame period, 210 58'.                     The water of
the   sea    appeared to    him   to be less dense under the         equator
than at some distance from it.
   Buch      has given some researches          respecting the barometer,
in which      he examines      the causes      of  its variations.    In his
opinion, the state of the barometer and its variations do not
depend on the state of the surface of our globe, and we must
seek, for the causes beyond it.          His proofs are :
   1st,   That   the barometer varies very little under the tropics,
and that its variations'        increase    on approaching the poles.
But if these variations depended on the state of the atmo
sphere, they ought to be equally perceptible over the whole
surface   of the globe.
   ad, The barometer         often remains almost motionless          amidfi
the greatest agitations of the atmosphere.                Thus, in 1794,
when Vesuvius was in the utmost agitation, and when the
air was silled with the flames, ashes, and smoke                of the   vol
cano, the barometer was almost motionless.
                                                                       Cotte

                                 Meteorology.                            349
    Cotte has presented          3  view of the severe winters which
 we have experienced.            A dispute had arisen among the sci
 entific men at Paris respecting the cold which would take
 place in the winter of the year 1798 : and some asserted that
 it would be severe because that of 1398 was so ; founding
 their opinion on this circumstance, that the fame temperature
 must take place       every four hundred years.          Mazuyer main
 tained, that the     severe   winters in our climates take place be
 tween    the fourth and fifth year, or the eighth and ninth
 years; because, according to the remark of Toaldo, tbe sea
sons and constitution         of the years must have a period almost
equal to the revolution         of the lunar apogeum, which is from
eight to nine years,          and that, towards the middle of this
period, that is to fay, every four or five years, there must be
a return.        Thus the severe winter of 1788-1789 followed
one which took place ten years before; and that of 1794-
 1795 took place four years after that of 1788-1789.
    Cotte seems rather to refer to the period of nineteen years,
which brings back           the moon to the fame points.            He  esti
mates,     therefore,    that the general temperature of any year
ought    to   correspond with that of each antecedent nineteenth
year after the commencement of the century. But these rules
he considers only       as probabilities.
    Lamarck       has published an annuary,           in which he endea
vours to determine a prognostication of the temperature from
the position of the moon in the southern or northern signs.
When stie is in the southern, it is probable that north and
east winds will prevail ; when she is in the northern, it is
probable that south and east winds will be most prevalent j
and these winds have a decided influence on the temperature
and rain      *.
    Cotte has given an extract of a memoir, by Beaume, on
thermometers. The motion of those made with spirit of wine
is different from those made with mercury.                 Thus, near the,
degree     of boiling water, when           the  mercurial thermometer
falls five degrees, that made with spirit of wine falls seven ;
and on the other hand, near the freezing point, when the
mercurial thermometer falls five degrees, that made with

spirit of wine falls no more than three or four. The mercury
dilates from the freezing point to that of boiling water, in the
ratio of 5045 to 5122, or of a 65th part of its volume. Mer
cury in a state of ebullition in the open air makes the mer
curial thermometer rife to 190 degrees, the barometer being
at 28 inches.
                               GALVANISM.
    Jadelot   has translated       into French     Humboldt's      work on
galvanism, to which he has added a great many                  of his own
experiments.         The   general consequences       he presents    are as
follows :
    1st,  The  effects   of galvanism are for     the most part different
in   the different parts    of animals.
    2d, The diaphragm, in warm-blooded animals, is that
muscle which, if not irritated most strongly, is at least irri
tated with the most readiness; for it is the only one that al
ways contracts itself with the greatest violence in experiments
where no chain is formed, but which do not however suc
ceed unless in those whose irritability         is greatly exalted.    May
not this observation         contribute towards determining the re
spective degrees       of  the irritability  of the different muscles ?
These experiments         attest :
    3d, That,     as  Humboldt       has  remarked, the living nerves
 and muscles are surrounded           with an active and sensible at
 mosphere ; a condition that, added            to the    conducting pro
 perty in which       the animal organs       participate with all moist
 substances,    supports the explanation       of  professor Reil respect
ing    the   action of the nerves,         which    extends    beyond the
 points where they disperse themselves.
    4th, That, as Humboldt observed                also,   galvanism   may
 excite movements         in  the organs    altogether     independent on
 the   will, as in the heart and stomach.
    5th, That the galvanic fluid, coming from             a warm-blooded
 animal, may act with efficacy           on the nerves of the human
 body.
     6th, That the galvanic phenomena take place without the
 intervention of any external body: that,thus, the cause which
 produces    them resides in the living animal economy.
                                                                        7th,

                     On the Cure     of the Hydrophobia.                   251
      7th, That they        can manifest     themselves      by means     of  a
  chain established between two points of the fame nerve, and
  by adduction in organs brought into contact with some part
  of  the flesh.
     Vassali-Eandi       has given interesting observations           on gal
  vanism.      "  We    do not yet      know,"     says he,
                                                               "  what is'the
  cause  of  these extraordinary phenomena           :   Volta  is inclined to
  believe   that    the muscular contractions are excited by the
  electricity  which     the metals that touch each other, or the
  heterogeneous       bodies that serve as conductors, acquire; and
  that, consequently, we see no animal electricity in the phe
  nomena of galvanism ; which, according to this theory,
  proves nothing else than that animals are electrometers more
  sensible of the smallest degree of electricity than other elec
  trometers."       The author then         relates    the   experiments of
  those who ascribe        all  these phenomena to an electricity pe
 culiar to animals      ;  and   he concludes by saying —           " Were    I
 to declare my opinion,          I should be inclined to believe that
 the muscular contractions are produced               by the movement        of
 animal electricity directed by the conductors of natural elec
 tricity."     The changes of electricity which different fluids,
 experience      in the body, may serve to explain these pheno
 mena;     for he himself has proved, for example, that urine
 when issuing has negative electricity, while the blood which
 flows from     a  vein has positive electricity.
     Fabbroni has published an important work on several phe
 nomena ascribed to galvanism.              Instead of ascribing the ef
 fects to electric fire, he is of opinion that they depend on a
 chemical operation ; that is to fay, an action exercised by the
 two metals on each other. (See Phil. Mag. Vol. V. p. 268.)

thods of cure      as  may prove useful to mankind.

252              On the various Remedies recommended
     Sea-bathing was for a long time held to be a fovereign
cure, is timeously reforted to : the many melancholy failures,
however,       of this   boasted remedy        have long fince convinced
medical practitioners, that even in those cases where a sup
posed cure had been essected, there had actually been no dis
ease ; the faliva in such cases having been previously cleansed
from the tooth of the animal that inssicted the bite, by pass
ing through thick clothes besore it reached the patient's skin.
     Mercurial frictions,       there   are reafons for believing,            have
 fometimes proved beneficial in the hydrophobia.                         Dr. Fo-
 thergill seems      inclined    to  ascribe    their    good     essect more to
 the ingredients with which the mercury is made into au
 ointment, than to the mercury itself : But of this hereaster.
 Dr. Metee        ascribes   them    to the volatile         alkali which the
 mercury disengages from the ammoniacal falt contained in
 the lymph of the animals.
      The king of Prussia, in the year 1777, purchased from a
  Silefian peafant     a remedy     for the hydrophobia, which he or
  dered to be kept prepared in all the apothecaries' shops, and
  by all surgeons.        The bafis of this remedy is the melde pro-
fcarabæus et majalis, (oil-beetle*,) a black unctuous insect,
  which, when touched, emits from all its articulations a brown
  oily liquor, and on that account it has been called the oil-
  beetle.     It  is found    in almost      every country         in the spring.
  It   is called fometimes the farrier's             beetle,   because    the far
  riers prepare from it a blistering ointment by pounding three
   hundred of the insects in a pound of oil of laurel. The fol
  lowing is the method of preparing                 the anti-hydrophobic         re
   medy of Prussia :
       R. Take twenty-four        beetles preserved in honey, two grains
   of ebony wood, one grain of Virginian snake-root, one grain
   of filings of lead, twenty grains of the moss of the ash-tree,
   four ounces of theriac, and a little of the honey in which
   the insects have been preserved.
        The dose of this opiate varies according to the age and sex
   of the patients. It is to be taken once in a dose of two grains
    for male adults,     a  grain and a half for semales,             and   a  grain

                                                                                  for

                   for  the Cure   of  the Hydrophobia.               253
for children of twelve years of age, diminishing             the dose ac
cording to the age.           Four grains are given to oxen morning
and evening, and they are made to fast twenty-four hours.
It    is recommended       to those who take this remedy, to remain
twelve hours in bed          in order to excite perspiration. The pa
tient also, during that period, must abstain from food and
drink.       It is recommended likewise, in the observations on
 the Pruflian cure, to burn the shirt which the patient had on
while subjected to perspiration. The wounds are to be washed
 ¦with    wine and vinegar into which salt has been put, and to
 be afterwards dressed with basilicon or salt butter.               If this
 remedy      succeeds,    its effects are to be ascribed to the fro/ca-^
 rabeeus meloe, which has the property of cantharides ; an in
  sect which      belongs to the fame genus, and which the cele
  brated Stoll, professor of medicine at Vienna, and director of
  one    of the hospitals     in that city, has  asserted  to be a specific
  In the hydrophobia.           His first care was to cover the wound
  with a vesicatory, which he continually renewed.                 He pre
  scribed internally      tincture  of  cantharides,   at first two drops,
  which he increased progressively for forty days, according to
   the age and constitution of the patient : the dose at last was
   carried to twenty-four drops, which may seem almost incre
   dible.     This medicine is the most violent diuretic known,
   and the application of it requires an able hand : but its effi
   cacy is asserted to be well established ; as also, that it pro
   duces the most salutary effects even when the hydrophobic
   poison has had time to diffuse itself throughout the mass of
    the blood.      In the last stages of the disease, the obstacle hi
    therto most invincible is the difficulty of making the patient
    swallow any remedy.            Every body knows the convulsions
    and horrid paroxysms into which the unfortunate sufferers
    are thrown merely by the fight          of  any liquid.     Stoll was of
    opinion, that the effect of the hydrophobic virus on the fenses
    is directly the reverse of that of opium : it augments irrita
     bility as much as opium lowers it : the least noise, the smallest
     degree   of light,  to persons labouring    under this dreadful ma
     lady, produces torture beyond description ; and the dissection
     of bodies, in which no change in the humours or in the or
     ganisation was observed,        seems to prove that this opinion is
              9                                                         well

   254             ®n    &e various Remedies recommended
   well founded.         If these obstacles,   then, were removed, and if
   the patients could swallow the remedies prescribed for them,
   there is reason to think that their lives might be saved.             Stoll
  entertained some good ideas on this subject ; but want of op
  portunity, and premature death, prevented him from apply
  ing them to practice. He was of opinion, that the excessive
  irritability, occasioned by the hydrophobic virus, might be
  overcome      by opium       ; and,    as the patients cannot swallow
  any thing,      he proposed administering          it in injections. The
  difficulty here would be, to         determine what quantity of opium
  ought to be employed 5 but, after proceeding far enough to
  produce the intended effect, the patient would then be able to
  swallow the tincture of cantharides ; and, as there is no time
 to lose in such cases, it would be necessary to raise the dose
  at first to four drops, and to follow up the cure with activity.
     If  Stoll's idea be correct respecting the action of the hy
 drophobic virus, the high          state of irritability might, we think,
 be subdued speedily by making the patient inhale bydru-car-
 bonat.      The    idea    is certainly worthy of the attention of the
 faculty ;    but this gas should not be resorted to except with
 the aid of a physician. With such aid, however, if a mere
 reduction of the irritability be all that is necessary to enable
 the patient to swallow medicines, the end might certainly be
 gained.
     C. Delametherie * informs us, that several eminent physi
 cians, such as Tissot, Lassore, Blais, Belleteste, &c. have
 employed the volatile alkali with success in the hydrophobia.
 In the Gazette de France of May 4, 1799, there is an ex
 tract of   a letter   from Carmont in Andalusia, dated March 37,
the fame year, which fays, that a shepherd having been bit
by a mad dog, and symptoms of the hydrophobia having
begun to appear,           Don Candido Trigneros,            a physician in
the neighbourhood,            applied to the wound a little lint dipped
in volatile alkali, and with the approbation of Don Joseph
Mexia, os the Medical and Patriotic Societies of Seville, or
dered the patient to swallow, for four days, twelve drops of
volatile alkali in three ounces of water; which made the
symptoms       of  madness disappear.

1778, from M. Noguerez, cure of Passy-les-Paris, in which
he gave me an account of the method by which he cured
of the hydrophobia a gardener named Olivier, who had been
bit in the middle ringer by a mad cat. Some days before, a
man in the fame house, who was bit by the fame cat, had
several sitsof the hydrophobia, of which he died in the
Hotel-Dieu.    It was not till twenty days after the accident
happened, that Olivier's sleep began to be interrupted by
violent agitations, during which he was delirious.       When
awake, his eyes had a haggard appearance.     The cure having
administered  to him fifteen drops of volatile alkali in a glass
of water, his patient paid him a visit next morning, and in
formed him that he had enjoyed good rest during the whole
night.   The cure made him take, for two days longer, ten
drops of alkali in a glass of water, and ever since Olivier has
remained in good health.       I have employed this remedy
    with   success   for preventing the hydrophobia."
      C. Pelletan,        one    of   the most celebrated surgeons          of Paris,
    has inserted in the public papers, that, by cauterising      the part
    bit, and afterwards       plunging it into cold water,  the effects of
    the hydrophobic         virus might be prevented.      " This fact,"
    fays Delametherie,
                                 "
                       brings to my remembrance an experi
    ment which a game-keeper of He Adam made, several times
                in the presence of the late prince of Conti. He
    successively,
    caused himself to be bit in the arm by a mad dog, sprinkled
    over the wound some gunpowder, and, having set fire to                              it,
    tied up his arm in   wet cloth.
                                a   These bites were never at
    tended with any bad consequences,      was    witness to an

    experiment of the like kind made at Blois by    limonadier,       a
    near the bridge.            Having       been bit in the hand by           a   mad
    dog, he immediately burnt some gunpowder on the wound,
    and continued well. — The theory of this important fact  as                    is
    follows  The burning decomposes the animal tissue, and dis
             :
    engages      volatile alkali, which          is   circulated with the blood,
.   and neutralises the hydrophobic               virus.    Volatile      alkali acts
    with   the greatest efficacy, and prevents the effects                of   the hy
    drophobia.       It    is   sufficient    to put some   of   it   on the wound,
                                                                                   and

  siderable quantity         of water."
     The Ormskirk medicine, from its great celebrity, deserves
 some notice here ; and the more so, as we can lay the recipe
 before    the    world, which will enable medical men justly to
 appreciate      its pretensions.        The quantities of the various in
 gredients are, to be sure, rather loosely expressed, were accu

 sixpence,      and the fame quantity           of ash-coloured ground liver

from the continent of its curing the hydrophobia in a very
advanced state, when given in large doses ; and we know that

      From what               source the author                   of this     letter learnt that the
rities, powder it and waft it : the finer part may be decanted into another
vessel ; the impurities              will remain.          After the finer parts        are subsided,   pour
off   the       water, and dry the bole for use.                  Bole was formerly much esteemed
as an alexipharmic,                 and singularly         serviceable in malignant and pestilential
diseases.
   " The   inula, or elecampane, grows commonly in moist places, and is
often cultivated  in gardens ; the flower is a y t llowift-grecn, somewhat
similar to a chrysanthemum, but larger.    According to Linnæus, it is the
second order of the 19th class, Syngenefia Polygamia superflua.    The root
is here to be used only.  In the recent state it does not smell so strong as
in the dry; for it then is highly aromatic.   The proper time for taking
up the root is toward the end of September.     The druggists have a trick
of mixing other substances with it when it is purchased from them in.
powder.            As    a medicine,         it was formerly in high estimation.                Rembertus
Dodonæi,           an eminent German                botanist, who        wrote about 120 years since,
fays it is an excellent                remedy        against      the bite and stings of all venomous
animals.    Dr. Hill fays, from his own experience, that an infusion of the
freft root, sweetened with honey, is an excellent remedy for the hooping-
cough.
      "    We now come to the liverwort, which stands part of the original pre
scription,    although often omitted. Dr. Mead judged it of that importance
as to recommend               it,with black pepper, under the title Pulvis Antilyjfui, to
the College of Physicians; and                 found itplace in the Dispensatory.

3.^8              On   the  various Runedus recommended
hydrophobia had actually been cured by the                  use   of olive oil,
we know not ; but the fact is worthy of the more notice, as
the fame remedy has lately been recommended by Dr. Fo-
thergili, of Bath*, without knowing the fact, but with a
force of reasoning that cannot sail to insure its receiving pro
per attention.       Speaking of oleaginous medicines, the Doctor
fays   :
           " The   ancient remedy against the bite of the viper was
long confined to the fat of that reptile, till it was at length
discovered that olive oil was equally efficacious ; a circum
stance since well known to viper-catchers,               and confirmed by-
reiterated     experiments.        Whether it     act by a specific power,
or merely by inviscating the poison, or otherwise destroying
its activity, matters not ; the fact has always appeared to me
interesting, and the analogy obvious. Whatever share of
success the mercurial ointment may have had                   in counteract
ing the canine poison, it          has invariably been attributed       to the
mercury      ;  but  I   have long suspected it ought          rather to have
been ascribed to the oily quality of the lard, with which it is
compounded, and which constitutes two-thirds of the com
position.
    "    To form    a just estimate      of the  cures  attributed to mer
cury, we must take into the account the oth«r means                       em
ployed at the        fame     time.     Thus M. Baudot, M. Bouteille,
and other French practitioners of eminence, unwilling to
trust     to the above       mercurial process alone, expressly order
the wound to be first carefully anointed with warm olive oil.
    " M.     Le Roux        and his followers,     who rejected mercury,
and attributed their success to the antimonial caustic alone,
employed nevertheless an ointment, consisting chiefly of fresh
butter, to dress the wound f.
    "    In this and other obstinate diseases of the convulsive
kind, the ancients anointed the body with warm oil ; a
practice too much neglected by modern practitioners.

 specific power, yet (as an animal mucilage well adapted to
  render the oil misciblc with the animal fluids, and also to
  reconcile it to the stomach) seems a proper addition ; nor
 need there be much            exactness   from an apprehension of an
 over-dose.        A    domestic remedy so simple, so innocent, and
 so   well recommended, is certainly entitled to            a  full and candid
 trial in this country.
      "  That     the    human body may be thrown into a copious
 perspiration by friction with warm olive oil, is a circumstance
 unnoticed till lately. The effects of this process, as practised
 at the Smyrna hospital, in the prevention and even                      cure   of
 the    plague, in the first stage of infection, are related by
 Count Berchtold in his late interesting tract on that sub
ject *;     and since confirmed by the testimony             of father Lewis,
 iuperintendant of the hospital.
      " If olive oil, then, be really           a preservative       against the
 poison    of   the incensed     viper, and even the pestilential           con
 tagion itself,      is there not reason to suspect that oil and             ole
 aginous substances may have had a greater sliare in counter
 acting the canine poison than the votaries of mercury ever
 imagined ?
      "  It is not pretended, indeed, to be a certain, only a pro
bable remedy, after the hydrophobia has actually commenced;
analogy affording only a presumption, not a proof; nor can it's
efficacy     be fully ascertained,     but by repeated trials and atten
tive observation.          As the prevention depends on due manage
ment of the wound, this medicine is judiciously ordered to be
applied externally for several days.                On this, probably, and
this alone, ought the main stress to be laid ; yet, to calm the
patient's mind, and to strengthen his hopes of security, it
may not be amiss to give the oil also internally,                according to
the directions.          Previous to this plan of treatment, however,
the wound ought to be diligently waslied and cauterised.
     "  Is it   cure dogs after the infection has taken place, it is
a remarkable circumstance;              but still more so, if it effect this
by throwing them iuto            a profuse  perspiration.     This     must cer
tainly be a mistake.           Dogs, indeed,       perspire  copiously from

nomed wound, tend to destroy                   the       activity of the canine
poison   ?
  "   As the saliva differs very little from the gastric liquor,
may it not, in the act of sucking out the poison, add to the
security by subduing any minute remnant lurking at the bot
tom of the wound ?
  "    Mr. Whitaker,       an intelligent member                   of   the Bath   Agri
cultural Society, has just now favoured me with the following
remarkable fact, which tends to corroborate this opinion :—
Two    persons,      nearly related, had the misfortune to be
                    very
bitten, at the fame time, by a mad dog.   One of them, being
bitten in the thumb, immediately sucked the wound diligently
till the blood ceased to flow ; and, without using any other
precaution, remained          well.    The other,              whose      lip   had been
lacerated      by
              the dog, being disabled from sucking out the
poison, had  immediate   recourse to the usual remedy, sea
bathing — and with the usual event.      The infection took
place; the hydrophobia came on; and death ensued.
   " As this safe and simple method   suction requires no     by
medical apparatus, can be instantly performed abroad or at
home, either        by
                  the party or   companion, with little loss of
                                           a

             to all persons

preliminary step be any hindrance in prosecuting at leisure
the other modes of prevention, which have been considered
as most effectual.  Were these diligently pursued immediately
after every accident of this nature,     presumed, the hydro

                               ever, appear.   After the proper
precautions, therefore,        have been duly observed,

may be encouraged               anxiety, and rest in full assur

gusts    of anger, or other       strong      passions.    No internal     re
medies at this period have been              insisted upon, because none
seemed necessary;        nor could they, for reasons assigned, add
to the security.
     " The canine poison seems to attack the oxygenous prin
ciple of the blood, the probable source of irritability and of
hfe. Hence the depressed unequal pulse ; the chilliness of
the extremities, accompanied with internal heat                ;  the melan
choly aspect; the dejection         of spirits;     and the general absence
 of  fever.
     "   It appears that the hydrophobia may be considered                as  a
 species    of  spasmodic   angina, produced by specific contagion,
 which exerts its influence, ist, on the injured part, and af
 terwards on the organs of deglutition : 2dly, That the local
 stimulus, being propagated to the brain, excites the moving
 powers of the system into re-action ; and hence the convul
 sive motions which speedily exhaust the strength,                 and finally
 extinguish the vital principle            :  3dly, That profuse bleeding
 may prove highly injurious          :    4thly, That the forcing down,
 large quantities     of liquid  is a   cruel pradtice, as it cannot but
 increase the spasms, and exasperate the malady.
                            Indications of Cure.
      "   The chief indications of cure appear evidently to be the
  following : — ist, To dissolve the fatal connection between the
  injured part and the organ of deglutition.               2dly, To calm the
  violent spasms, and soothe the nervous system.                     3dly, To
  support    the strength,    and invigorate the whole frame.
      "   To   answer the first  of    these indications,      much depends
  on external     means,     and close attention to the          injured part.
  The moment any darting pains,                attended with numbness and
   discoloration,    are perceived,       they denote the poison       to be  in
   an active state, and that no time ought to be lost in prose
   cuting the most vigorous measures.
       " The period from the commencement of these symptoms
   to the approach of the hydrophobia is uncertain, and perhaps
   rarely exceeds five or six days.              To prevent, therefore, the
   irritation being propagated           to   the   throat, let the suspected
   part be immediately cut out, and the surface of the wound
                                                                            duly

  t6i            On the various Remedies recommended
  duly cauterised.      If any difficulty   of deglutition has       already
 been felt, let a {harp blister or sinapism            be   applied to the
 throat, extending from ear to ear.            For, unless the morbid
 impression     can   be   obliterated  by  one    yet stronger, and the
 natural action of the sympathising parts speedily restored,
 there can be but small hopes of success.
    "  A malady so rapid in its progress,           so  intractable by na-*
 ture, demands       Hercalean     remedies,     and warrants a prudent
 trial of the most active substances with which we are yet ac-,
 quainted.      The atropa belladona, in doses of four or five
 grains, has been highly extolled by some German professors;
 the laurocerasus half grain, and arsenic one-eighth by others.
 The hyoscyamus niger, in form of extract, given in doses of
 15 or 20 grains, in cafes of fixed melancholy, attended with
 horrors and obstinate watchings.               I have sometimes found
 very beneficial.      It moreover procures sleep and composure
 of mind   ; often where opium         fails, or even adds to the in
 quietude.     Now these potent remedies, with due caution,
may    be tried   in succession : if they fail, they only mare the
 common fate of former antidotes; but if one of them should
 answer,   it may     afford   an important addition to our stock          of
 knowledge.
    "  adly, To     assuage    the spasms,     and    soothe   the nervous
 system.
    "  To   effect this after the hydrophobia has actually ap
 peared,  all impediments, and whatever may hurt the acute
feelings of the patient, or, by the power of association, tend
to aggravate his sufferings, must be first carefully removed;
no dog must on any account be allowed to enter the room.
Not water only,        and other liquids ; but all glaring colours,
and glass mirrors, must be kept entirely out of his sight. No
Joud noise,     nor cold air, must       be suffered to molest         him.
Having thus      removed impediments, we must next endeavour
to assist nature in alleviating      the spasms and in procuring a
lucid interval.      If  there   be any    critical evacuation in this
disease favourable to our views, it must,           I  conceive, be that
of sweat.
    " In the     cures    recorded   by Dr. Nugent and others, in
five or fix cafes   of  the hydrophobia in an advanced state, the
                                                                 treatment

                     for   the   Cure     of the Hydrophobia.                    264
treatment was different in each ; yet there was one circum
stance common to all, and that was a copious sweat.      Till
that appeared, the recovery seems   to  have been  doubtful.
Nor is       the cafe described            by   Van Helmont
                                             an exception :
the patient being plunged in the cold  bath  till half dead,
the cure was attributed to the fright, but ought rather to
have been ascribed to the re-action of the system, which,
being aided by a warm bed and sudorific regimen, termi
nated     in     a salutary      sweat.        In   a subsequent        experiment of
this kind, equally terrific, no sweat ensued,                          and the disease
soon proved fatal.
     "Sudorisics, indeed, seldom produce a copious sweat, un
less their operation can be assisted by warm diluting liquors.
 Hence, perhaps, it             is,
                         that musk, valerian, opium, and other
powerful sudorisics, have     often failed.

antispasmodics,  without  proper  dilution, they  serve but to
flatter hope at the expence of disappointment     let therefore        ;
the following method have     fair trial  a               :
   " In pint of olive oil dissolve an ounce
             a                               of camphor: let
the entire surface of the body be diligently rubbed with this
solution, made warm, continuing the friction, before     gentle              a

be covered           with flannel,        and       put into   awarm bed till         a
copious perspiration be procured.                        This may be encouraged
 by   an enema        of warm wine-whey,                 with an addition of vola
tile alkaline spirit, or cau            de luce,      which

also the neck and spine, ought to  be well embrocated twice
a-day with tepid oil, which,                        by
                                   soothing the nerves, may
act as  powerful anodyne and antispasmodic

                                 it
to   a   common bath of warm water.
     "   A  patient, in consequence of the poison of arsenic, had

 the feelings of a melancholy or outrageous maniac, as men*
 tioned on the highest; authority, can any cause be assigned
 why, in a musical age like the present, its powerful influence
 should not be tried against this dreadful malady ? Though its
 effects on the     disease occasioned    by the tarantula may have
 been greatly exaggerated,      yet, if what has been confidently
 asserted of its efficacy against the envenomed bite of the most
 dangerous serpents, be true, the analogy would afford, at least,
 a presumptive argument in its favour.              But, independent of
 this, other beneficial effects, in removing the wild ravings in
 certain fevers, might here be produced *. And it was consi

 of the hydrophobia.        The distressing scene,      near the close of
 the disease, induced the physician to try the effects of music,
 by playing before him on the guitar. The harmony, even at
 this late period, we arc told, appeased the spasms, and ren

 eggs, jellies, and bread soaked in generous wine. If, from his
 dread of liquids, neither food nor medicine of the fluid kind
 can be got down, they, must be conveyed in the form of me

    From    the variety   of  facts  which we have laid before our

have been incomparably ardent and successful.            Our  fathers
were   therefore    content, during that period, to accept the
Germans, Dutch, and French, for their chemical instructors.
The French, though not the proper authors of the most im
portant discoveries in that which is called Modern Chemistrv,
were, however, the first to combine, correct, and advance
those discoveries     into one general system : and we therefore
honour them      as   our masters   ; and have submitted to rective
from them,    as well a new chemical language, as our favourite
elementary chemical books. Even the Germans, though not
more fortunate than we in discovery, nor more ablv instruc
tive in  academical     lectures and the exhibition  of experiments,
have been lately more forward to publish compilations          of the
facts and principles     of chemical science ; and we neither deny
praise  to their    industry, nor reject their aid. Such is the
progress   of  chemical discovery as to demand the frequent
composition of new systems, which sliall           assemble facts   as
they are observed, and principles as they are established.
Books thus necessary we gladly accept, from whatever quar
ter and under whatever name.            We fliould wish them to be
originally in English, to illustrate especially the state of British
science, of British investigation, of British arts.      But, posses*
they the true merits which are to be desired of such works
in general, we sliall receive them with eager gratitude and
respect even   in translation from a foreign language.
   The following abstract of this work, by Dr. Grcn, may
perhaps assist our readers to judge what utilities are likelv to
result from the addition of it to the present stock of English
chemical literature.
   It opens with an introductory sketch of the history of che
mistry.    In ihejirjl chapter are explained those more general
laws which respect alike all the other parts        of chemical   sci
ence, the general nature of the most remarkable processes of
the laboratory, and the forms and peculiar uses of those in
struments    which     chemistry chiefly employs.      The chemical
history of the more remarkable gases, and of some of their
proximate compounds, sills the second chapter. The general
characters of the acids, of the alkalies, and of their neutral

different mineral acids are explained with considerable mi
nuteness of detail.  The chemical composition of vegetables,
their principles immediate and ultimate, with their uses in
the arts,are the subjects of the sixth chapter.  The seventh
chapter is employed upon animal matters.        Fermentation
and putrefaction are the subjects of the eighth.   The ninth
and     tenth chapters    give the chemical history          of bituminous
and carbonaceous         minerals.      The   metals   are the subjects      of

dex concludes the last volume.          A preface    by the translator, and
a tableof contents, are prefixed at the beginning of the first.
   Such are the parts, the structure, the exterior form, of
this work.  Its scientific value is not to be discovered with
out a more intimate examination of it.

origin of the science, among the ancient Egyptians, to the

phlogistic system.

                                       ;                                     if   fixed,   it   must have
gravity, and that,                 if  it   have gravity, the bodies out                        of which
it   is   evolved       must       be lighter,         as to          their other matter, after
thev have lost              it,   than while          it   still existed in them.                    He   re
gards       it   as    being, though              a   distinct substance               from caloric,
yet the matter              of    heal, and the principle                    of  combustion.
     Speaking of             combustion, Gren scruples                           not to affirm, that
the antitblogistic Jyl'.em affords no explanation of the reason,
why   certain degree of previous heat
          a                               necessary to the com         is
mencement of flaming combustion.        Flame he describes as
eflentiallv consisting of the burning gas of the bodies which
are decomposed under it.
     He thinks not improbable that gas-azot and gas-oxvsren
                        it
may co-exist in the atmosphere, not in   merely mechanical                   a
mixture, but even    intimate chemical
                                   in  combination.

turbid, is regarded by Dr. Gren as the basis of aqueous va
pour entirely deprived of its caloric.
   Dr. Gren regards that which has been called the oxygen*
ated muriatic acid, as being nothing but the proper muriatic
acid in its full energy. To that which is now commonly called
the muriatic acid, he gives the name of muriatous acid', re
garding it as analogous in its character to the sulphureous
and the nitrous acids.
    He        rejects,   after DoerfTurd, the peculiar existence      of the
camphoric acid.               He   considers   the narcotic matter of certain
vegetables as worthy to be distinguished as one of their pe
culiar immediate principles.
  The lithic acid does not appear to this author to be one
that is formed by the organic functions of animals.
    He affirms,          that those which are called the acetous and the
                       in the degrees of their concentration,
acetic acids differ only
not in the proportions of their principles.
   His general account of the acids, alkalies, and earths, is
indeed brief, and rather incomplete, but in almost every par
ticular sufficiently correct.
    According to our personal experience, hot lime and sulphur,
coming  into intimate  contact, are apt to exhibit a combus
tion of the sulphur, from which ensues a formation of sul
phureous acid. Dr. Gren recommends, to prepare sulphuret
of lime by mixing chalk with sulphur, and then igniting the
mixture, to expel the carbonic acid 1
    In    his accountof vegetables, Dr. Gren relates, contrary to
the experience   of other chemists, that pyro-ligneous acid, when
                              is,
sufficiently pure,        the nature and proportions of its prin
                              in
ciples, precisely  the same  with acetic acid!
   He ascribes to the mechanical porosity alone, of charcoal,
unaffiiled         by
               any chemical re-agency, that power of purifying
saline        leys from colouring         matters     which    charcoal    is   well
known to           possess.
    From accurate             analyses   of wheat,      able chemists     have re
solved this substance               into the two immediate principles of
farina        and gluten      ;   but Dr. Gren rather considers as com
                                                                    it

mediate principle as aroma; but supposes that which has
been hitherto called aroma, to be merely volatile or ethereal
oil.
   The    plates  of the chemical apparatus    at the end of the first
volume are very beautifully engraved by Mr. Lowry.
   Dr. Gren discovers no analogy between the gelly           of ani
mal bodies and the gluten of vegetables.
    He maintains, that, in bread, flour is    so thoroughly, so en
tirely altered,   as to be no  longer capable of affording even the
smallest portion of farina or gluten.
   He reckons no substances to be properly susceptible of fu-
trefaclion,   save such as contain azot.
   Of   bitumens he assert*,  that they must necessarily have had
their origin from the decomposition of animal bodies.
   Though more ample in his accounts of the metals than in
the preceding departments of his work, he gives no account
of the new Cornilh metal the menaebaniie.
    At  the end the editor has given several useful tables.
    As  to the other matters    in the composition    of this work,
they differ not materially from the     explanations in the systems
of Fourcroy, Chaptal, Nicholson, and Jacquin.
    The translation is not free from Germanisms } but in books
of chemical and physical science, elegance and propriety of
this sort are rarely regarded as objects of primary concern.
    On the whole, we cannot doubt but the public must receive,
with partial favour, a work' of such singular merits. The
translator, and those who have encouraged the translation,
evidently deserve the warmest thanks of British chemists.
Essays     on tbe Venereal   Disease.    Part  II.   By William
    Blair, A.M.F.M.S.            &c. &c. &c,       Symonds,    Pater
    noster  Row. i8co.
   IT was some time since stated by Mr. Scott of Bombay,
that he had discovered the acid of nitre to possess the powers
of a specific remedy for the venereal disease. Dr. Beddoes,
Mr. Cruicksliank, and other medical gentlemen in this coun
try, eagerly repeated the trials indicated by Mr. Scott.         The
success was various.       One party affirmed the decisive efficacy
of   the new medicine j another declared, from alleged expe
                                                              rience,

Hence, that Us powers were imaginary, or at best uncertain.
Inaccuracy of observation and experiment, with the influence
of   personalpartialities and preconceived opinions, were na
turally supposed to be the chief causes of these contrarieties
of report.      Mr. Blair, Surgeon to the Lock Hospital and Asy
lum,   therefore,undertook to collect such a system of evidence
concerning the action of nitric and nitrous acid in lues vem*
rea, as should, if possible, finally ascertain the true practical
principle in regard to its use. The result of his first inquiries
was made public in a former part of the present work.     la
the second part the ingenious author presents a multiplicity
of new testimonies ; analyses and examines the facts pub
lished on the same subject by others ; and endeavours to de
duce those general truths, to establish which, he conceives
that all his assembled testimonies          combine their force.         His
inquiry    has been     conducted, and his last inferences          are de
duced, with the candour of a gentleman and the cautious
discrimination of a philosopher.  " That the acids of nitre,
&c. though very useful auxiliaries to mercury in the cure of
the venereal        disease, are,   in no modification of that com
plaint, to be confidently and exclusively substituted instead
of mercury," is the general practical position with which
Mr. Blair closes his whole investigation.
  This opinion          is,
                  perhaps, the safest to             be at present acted
upon in medical practice.            It
                               seems to              be allowed on all
hands, however, that  nitric acid, taken             together    with mer
cury, counteracts its debilitating effects without              diminishing
its remedial energy.
     Of   the ratio of the operation of either mercury or nitric
acid, as an anti-venereal remedy, no very particular account
has ever yet been given.              It
                                has indeed been conceived,
that, since oxygen     the basis of vital air,
                            is                   must be, in all
                                                       it

disease and the nourishment           of life
                                            ;   that nitric acid    is   a   re
 medy against lues venerea, on account of the oxygen which
it contains   and that other oxygenous compounds may pro
                ;
 bably act with similar effects. All beyond this still left in
                                                            is

 human art, which the healthful           functions  of the animd
 economy continually form by the endlessly varied combina

 virus, thus compounded, decomposable, probably, by the affi
nities of many acid and saline substances, provided these sub
stances   might be brought into mixture with it in all those
parts of the system in which it is active, and without being
themselves previously altered by decomposition or new com
binations ? Are not the activity with which mercury pene
trates throughout       the  whole body, and that remarkable de
gree in which, in every one of its combinations, it preserves
its primitive energies — are not these the causes of its being a
specific   for the decomposition and entire expulsion of the
venereal virus ? Does it not then certainly appear, if oxy
gen, or perhaps nitric acid, without decomposition, without
new combination, might be brought in sufficient quantity,
and for   a  sufficient length of time, into mixture with all the
venereal    virus that is at any time in the system, that the
virus might be entirely decomposed, and the disease com
pletely healed     ?

most authentic experiments; and in particular, How does
the nature of the foil, situation, and culture, contribute to
render this influence active                and efficacious      ?    The prize    is a
medal of the value of 24 ducats ; and the papers, written
either in the Latin or French language, must be transmitted,
with a sealed note containing the author's, name and place of
abode, to     C. F. Hindenburg,                public professor of natural phi
losophy   and secretary to the society.
   The following prize                 questions     have been       proposed by the
French National              Institute.
  CLASS OF THE MATHEMATICAL                                    AND PHYSICAL
                 SCIENCES.
   I. The Class p'oposed, for                  the second time,       in the    year 5,
as the subject          of
                        prize,a             an anatomical comparison             of the
liver in different kinds of animals                  ;    but as no paper has been
transmitted on that question, the Class has thought proper
to withdraw       it,
               and to propose the following
   "
                                                                  :
        To determine,             by   chemical and anatomical observations
and     experiments, what are the phenomena of the torpor
which certain animals,   such as the marmot, dormouse, &c.
experience,    during winter, in regard to the circulation of the
blood,  respiration, and irritability: to make                        researches    re
specting the cause of this steep, and why                                   peculiar to
                                                                  it

these animals."
   The competitors                are requested          to examine    in particular
what differences are observed between                        these animals in their
lethargic and their ordinary                state,       in regard to the quickness
of their pulse;     the degree            of   the warmth         of the blood; the
frequency of their respiration; the quantity of oxygen con
sumed in    given time; and their excitability
              a                                   galvanism.           by
They will examine also the anatomical differences which dis
tinguish these animals from those not subject to torpor during
the winter; and they will endeavour to discover whether these
differences    are sufficient            to explain the         phenomena of that
torpor.
  The prize will be   gold medal of the value of kilo

 the piece which shall be thought worthy of the prize in ita
 public sitting of Vendemiaire, year 11.
    II.  The  Class proposed    also in the year 6, as the subject:
 of a prize, to be determined in the public sitting of Germi
 nal, year 8, the following question     :
    **
        To endeavour to ascertain, by accurate experiments,
 what influence atmospheric air, light, water, and earth, have
 on vegetation."
    Though no memoir has been received on this interesting
 question, the Class has thought proper to propose it again;
 but as the different labours necessary to resolve it completely
 would require many experiments and considerable time; and
 as k can hardly be expected that all the information which
 may be wished for can be obtained from the competitors in
 the course of the new term proposed, the Class has decreed,
 that if memoirs in which the question is treated in its full
jextent be not received,     it will grant the prize to that   which
 shall contain a series  of experiments,   facts, and observations,
 that fliall appear calculated to augment the knowledge al
 ready acquired in regard to some parts of the question.
    The prize will be a medal of the value of a kilogramme,
 and will be decreed in the public sitting of the 15th of Mef-
 fidor, year 10.    The papers must be sent in before the 1st of
 Nivose, year 10.
    III. "   What   are the characters which      distinguish in ani
 mal and vegetable substances those which serve as ferment,
 from those in which they produce fermentation?"
    The prize will be a gold medal of the value of a kilo

   The prize will be a gold medal of the value of a kilo-
gramme, and will be decreed in the public sitting of the
15th of Nivose, year 10.             The papers must be written in
French, and sent in before the 1st of Vendemiaire the fame
year.
   In the fittting of      the 15th   of Germinal (April 4), at which
Bonaparte      fat   as  president,  C. Cuvier read an account of the
labours of the Mathematical              and Physical Class during the
preceding three months.
   It is in the department of natural history in particular that
the labours of the Class, during the last quarter, have enlarged
the boundaries of science.           It has treated some questions of
the utmost importance in regard             to the history  of minerals
and that of animals.
   Philosophers,        for example, have long been embarrassed
with   volcanoes,      on account of the difficulties which occur in
explaining       the   phenomena of them, and          in the attempts
made to discover the sources           of those immense quantities of
substances     of  every   kind  thrown   up by them during eruptions.
 C. Patrin, on this subject, has given some views which dis
play a bold imagination, and has called in to his aid all the
resources     of modern chemistry.         He  supposes that the water
of the    sea is  continually attracted    between  the strata of schist,
which generally forms the basis of volcanoes: that the ma
rine salt is there decomposed : that its acid becomes sur
charged with oxygen by pasting over the oxyds of iron and
manganese : that it decomposes the sultures of iron, and even
the water, by the intervention of carbon : that the different
products of these decomrosi.ions,             combining under other
forms, give petroleum and hydrogrn gas, which take fire,
and produce the most brilliant part of the volcanic pheno
mena    ;   while electricity, joining itself to these elements, al
ready so     numerous, forms sulphur and phosphorus.            It is the
last-mentioned substance above all, which, in the opinion of
C. Patrin, acts the most distinguished part. By it he sup
poses the oxygen is fixed under an earthy appearance, and
consequently, it is by it that volcanoes are enabled to furnish
that immense         quantity of lava which they are continually
pouring forth on the surrounding districts without exhausting
                                    Not                               the

C. Pattin ascribes the property of holding metals in a state
pf vapour,         and     of    depositing    them       under certain circum

found on the summits of the highest mountains.     The mat
ter which colours   burns with  it,smell similar to that of
                                                    a                                     a
great  many vegetable substances.   Sausfure, who often col
lected such snow on the Alps, was induced       this property,          by
as well as       by
              its being found in summer, and in places where
a great many plants were in flower, to consider the colouring
matter       as the   farina of some plant*.              C. Ramond, who found
this dust on the snow of the Pyrenees, having remarked that
it   heavier than water, suspected
     is                              to be of mineral origin

and he, indeed, found that  arises from   decomposition of
                                          it                        a
certain micas. This decomposition requires, without doubt,
the conditions mentioned   Sausfure; for C. Ramond found
                                        by
that they are necessary to the Pyrenees                             as well as to the
Alps.
   The production of native metals in the interior of mines
is one of those objects also which have attracted the atten
tion of naturalists, and which have given rife to      multitude             a
of systems.   An experiment of C. Gillet-Laumont points
out one of the ways in wbich this production may take
place. He has shown us, that                    by
                                       touching or rubbing with
zinc  or with iron   the muriat of silver, that   to fay,  com          is         a
bination of the oxyd of silver with the muriatic acid, the
silverimmediately resumes its purity and lustre    giving                        by
up its acid to the metal which touches it. But the cir
cumstances  necessary for this reduction, which chemistry
easily explains,           may. occur every moment in the interior                        of
mines.
     We      too often accuse the ancients              of error when            we do not
understand        them.
                    Aristotle speaks                    of the aspalax
                                                  as an ani
mal entirely blind.  The Romans and the moderns, having
translated the word aspalax mole, thought themselves autho-

rised to deny the assertion of Aristotle ; and indeed the mole
is not blind ; it is also an animal different from the aspalax.
C. Olivier has brought us from the Levant an animal ac
tually blind, its (kin not being even pierced at the place
where the eyes ought to be ; which lives under ground like
the mole, and which has all the characters ascribed by Ari
stotle to the aspalax. This animal is that known to zoolo
gists under the name              of    mus typblus and zemni.
  C. Olivier has given us also some information respecting
another small animal known to the ancients under the name
of     two-footed rat, and to the moderns by that of the
     the
jerboa. The very singular conformation of its feet, of which
those behind are five or fix times longer than those before,
has been known                 for some time, but we had no accurate
knowledge of the manner in which it walks.  C. Olivier in
forms us that it moves forwards only by jumping, but that
it always falls on all sour. He has described also the organ
isation of its genitals, which are armed with small points, that
niust render       its copulation               still    more           painful    than that   of
cats.      He    has described               also a small          species        of this genus,
hitherto imperfectly known.
   C. Beauvois has invented an instrument for indicating the
respective proportions of the crania of different quadrupeds.
He      has applied       it   to two animals                of North America, which
                            to make distinct species on ac
some naturalists still hesitate
count of their great resemblance to animals analogous to
them in the old continent.    These animals are the fox and
 the rabbit of the United States.                        The        result   of C.     Beauvois*
comparisons         is,
                    that they are two distinct species; and this
opinion    justified
            is           the habits of these animals.

 hollow trees.
    C. Latreille has presented two memoirs, which have been
 since printed.           The        first    treats     of       the    serpents    of France.
These animals, which occasion      much terror to the vulgar,
                                                        so
have not been sufficiently studied  naturalists. The eleven  by
species sound in France have often been confounded with
 eachother, but                C. Latreille has completely explained the
 nomenclature,
                                                                                             The

 <7*           Ultramarine.— Anatomical Preparation.
    The   second memoir       relates  to salamanders,     to which our
 ancestors ascribed the property of resisting the flames ; but
 they have shown to our cotemporaries a property more au
 thentic, and equally wonderful, that of reproducing their
limbs when they have been cut off. C. Latrcille has de
 scribed  six species   which hitherto have not been distinguished
 by naturalists.
    Every body knows ultramarine, that valuable colour, which
 alone imitates the azure of the heavens.          It is extracted from
a stone named lapis lazuli, by a very tedious manipulation ;
 and though it has been known for a long time, and was even
employed in the middle ages for those miniatures with which
manuscripts were ornamented, no precise idea was enter
tained respecting its colouring principle: it was long be-
lieved that it was copper. Margraf proved that it is iron ;
but the question was, to find in what state it exists in the
stone,   and how     it  produces    that beautiful blue colour with
out being combined with the acid of Prussian blue. C. Guy-
ton, treating gypsum which contained abundance of iron,
remarked that, in changing itself into a sulfure, that matter
assumed a blue colour        as  unalterable   as that of lapis lazuli,
and preserving itself even in pot-ash in fusion.              Guided by
this phenomenon, he treated lapis lazuli itself; and his ex
periments leave him no doubt that the colouring principle
of  that   stone is a blue sulfure      of iron, which      has hitherto
eluded the researches of chemists, because they confounded
the products of it with those of the grains of pyrites or yel
low sulfure of iron, which exist in every kind of lapis lazuli.
By   a few steps   more the arts will perhaps be enriched with a
rare substance, which may be formed at pleasure.
    C.  Chaussier   has rendered an important service to all those
sciences the object      of which is organised bodies, by commu
nicating the means        of preserving to the different parts of the
human body, and of those of animals, the forms which they
possessed when in the state of life.          This process consists in
keeping them for some time in a solution of the oxygen
ated muriut of mercury, commonly called corrosive sublimate.
When suffered to dry, aster being taken from this mixture,
they   assume a consistence       like that   of wood, and become

absolutely unchangeable in the air. If the bodies have been
injected before being immersed, they even retain the colour
and freshness of life, and consequently form mummies much
more perfect than those of Egypt, which, as has been said,
only eternised the image of death.    C. Chauflier has no
doubt that this was the method employed by Ruisch, and
which anatomists in vain attempted to discover.
   C. Vauquelin and C. Buniva have analysed the liquor of
the amnios of woman and that of the cow, together with the
substance found on the bodies of new-born children.   The
liquor of the amnios of woman contains albumen, soda, mu-
riat of soda, and phosohat of lime.    The crust on the body
of the foetus is a degeneration of the albuminous substance*
which begins       to pass to the state     of   a fat body.     The liquor
of the amnios of      the cow exhibited a peculiar animal matter,
a new acid, and sulphat        of   soda.
  Medicine        has produced four important           memoirs.       The
epidemic disease which broke out at Nice and Grenoble
alarmed the public, and a report was even spread that it
Was actually the plague.   C. Desessart, however, after col
lecting every information on the subject, has shown that it
 was only that disease long known under the name of the jail
fever, which too often attacks armies and other bodies of
 men when crowded together.
   Children                      with a portion of the viscera
                 are born sometimes
uncovered, and having a tumor which by medical men is
called an umbilical hernia. C. Lassus has shown that the
cause of this defect     is,
                      that the liver, receiving  larger quan a
tity of blood than   ought

which kept    it   in its place,               thin the ten
                                    dilates and renders
dinous substance  that separates them, and makes its way
through the fame opening of the skin through which the
umbilical cord passes.  This disorganisation sometimes pro
ceeds    far that the intestines, and even the heart and lungs,
        so
are also uncovered. This vicious conformation proves almost
always mortal     and C. Lassus announces this circumstance,
                  ;
that surgeons may save themselves the trouble of performing
operations, which may cause the parents to be accused                    of

 ignorance or cruelty.          C. Peiletan, on the other hand, en
 deavours to      encourage     them to undertake another operation,
 which may        be useful, and which        misplaced   timidity often
 prevents from being practised ;         it is that of  broncbotomj,  or
 opening the tracheal artery. Whenever any body capable
 of stopping respiration is introduced into that canal, it may
be boldly opened, in order to get rid of it.
    C. Portal has revived the ideas, which he announced in
 1782, on the treatment of that kind of apoplexv called serous,
 that is to fay, of that kind during which the face remains
 pale and livid.        He has proved that emetics, generally ad
ministered in such cases, are the more . inefficacious, as in
every kind of apoplexy the stomach is palsied ; and that, be
sides, it has appeared by all bodies which have been opened,
that in the serous apoplexy, as well as in others, there are
accumulations of blood in the brain.              He does not hesitate,
therefore, to recommend bleeding for the one as well as for
the other ; and he has proved by practical observations that
it  has often succeeded.
    C. Duhamel        has been employed in improving the art of
 assaying silver,    or of separating it from the lead it contains.
For this process, on a small scale, refiners employ small cups
of well lixiviated       bone-ashes  called cupells, which absorb the
lead as it vitrifies, and leave the silver pure : on a large scale
they employ cupells formed of wood-ashes ; but, besides their
being expensive, they are attended with several inconve
niences.        C. Duhamel, after remarking that the litharge,
or   glass   of  lead,    may be separated in proportion as it is
formed, without          causing it to be absorbed by the cupells,
proposes     that these vessels should be made of founders sand
mixed with clay        ;  that the surface of them should be covered
with   a  stratum of ashes ; that the blast of the bellows should
be directed on the fluid lead to accelerate the oxydation ; and
that the litharge should be made to run off by a groove
formed in the edge of the cupell, and which ought to be
dug lower in proportion as the bath sinks down.
   C. Lacepede read an ingenious memoir on some pheno
mena respecting the flight and vision of birds. He took, as
the object of his observations, the eagle and man-of-war
                                                                   bird;

of  flight and the acutest vision.      It results from his observa
tions that the fight of these birds is nine times more exten
sive than that of the furthest sighted man ; and that in 220
hours, that is to fay, in a little more than nine days, allowing
them 16 or      17  hours  of repose, they would make the tour of
the whole earth.
    C. Cuvier read the      eloge  of Daubenton, with an account
of his labours, in the      course  of which he drew a parallel be
tween him and his friend Buffon.                Buffon always suffered
himself to be led away by his imagination, Daubenton al
ways endeavoured to guard against his : the former was full
of vivacity, the latter of      patience : the first chose    rather to
guess at the truth than to observe        it ; the second remarked all
its details, and was always diffident of himself.
    The Class has received from several of its members the
following works :
    C. Olivier has presented the three first volumes of his
Natural History of Insects, which contain a description and
figures of an immense number of new and interesting species.
    C. Brisson presented a new edition of his Diflionnaire de
 Ptyjique, with additions containing an account of all the
 modern discoveries.
    C. Cuvier    has presented the two first volumes        of his Les
 sons    of comparative Anatomy. In this work the author ex
 amines the organs of motion and sensation in regard to their
 structure and uses in man and all the other classes of animals.
    C.    Levesque   read at the same time an account        of  the la
 bours of the Class of the Moral and Political Sciences during
 the preceding three months.
    C. Gosselin has examined the geographical knowledge of
 the ancients respecting the southern coasts of Arabia. He
 has proved that Ptolemy, notwithstanding the singular form
 he has given to      them, has preserved with the greatest accu
 racy all the distances, and that our best modern charts might
 be corrected by the labours of that ancient geographer.
    C. Buache      has communicated to the Class a memoir, in
 manuscript,     written  at Cairo in 1717 by the French traveller
 Paul Lucas.       This memoir contains some curious informa-

from Cairo for Africa.
   C. Langles, by his (kill In oriental literature, has been
able to procure some information, which he has communi
cated to the Class, respecting a people in India called the
Seeks. These people, whose capital is Labor, acknowledge,
as their sounder a Hindu born in 1469, who gave them in
one book their code of laws and the ritual of their religion.
They adore one God, to whom they ascribe neither paffions
nor human weakness.          As they are strangers to the sliackles
of superstition, they have not received those of despotism,
which, by oppressing the other tribes of India, enchains their
courage as well as their ideas. As they are industrious, opu
lent, and brave,      and  are protected    by natural ramparts im
penetrable to cavalry, they have never yet been              subdued
even by the Mogul princes, their neighbours.
  ELECTORAL ACADEMY OF THE USEFUL SCIENCES
                            AT ERFURT.
   In   the sitting of September a, 1799, A. F. Hecker read a
treatise on the care and education of orphans] on hospitals
for foundlings, and on child-murder.
   J. J.  Bellermann communicated some observations           on 6ve
oriental manuscripts which        had   been   presented to the Aca
demy.
   C. Cramp communicated his           analysis  of astronomical and
terrestrial refractions.
   In the silting of October 2, Charles Theodore Anthony
Maria Baron von Dalberg read a paper on steatites, and the
uses to which it may be applied in the arts by lapidaries ;
and communicated at the fame time some observations which
he had made on the steatites of Baireuth (talcum steatites).
Steatites   is an exceedingly soft stone, which can be cut or
turned    with   great ease, and which, when burnt in a close
vessel, acquires such a hardness as to withstand the file.        In
this manner an artist, with very little expence, might prepare
                 8                                           cameos,

cameos, gems, and small toys, which       in point of solidity would
not be inferior to those of the ancients. The author made a
series of experiments on the method of giving a durable dye
to hardened steatites, by which it appears that it may be made
to imitate the most esteemed and most beautiful kinds of stone.
In the specimens of the coloured steatites laid before the So
ciety, some of which had heads cut on them, the members
admired in particular the high degree of polish of which
burnt steatites is susceptible, and in which it exceeds even
agate.     These experiments are curious, and of the utmost
importance to the arts.
    Professor J. Bartholomew        Trommsdorf    gave  at the same
time    a chemical analysis of steatites, by which it appears that
siliceous   earth and talcky earth are the principal component
parts of this fossil.      The professor, however, observed also a
small mixture of argillaceous earth, which Klaproth, during
Mis researches,      did not find, but which, according to the
author, was perhaps accidental.
    Prince Demitri von Gallitzin gave an account of the expe
riments which he made with different kinds          of air in regard
to the germination of vegetables.         He sowed garden-cresses
in thirteen kinds of air, and kept them all at an equal tem
perature. The following were the results: — ist, In oxygen
gas, and in air corrupted by respiration and burnt bodies,
germination took place as well as in common air. zd, In hy
drogen gas and in carbonic acid gas, extracted from different
bodies, and by various processes, there was no germination.
The    feeds of the cresses swelled up a little, but in the course
of eight    days   there  was not the smallest sign of growth;
though the     seeds in atmospheric    and oxygen air, and air cor
rupted by respiration, produced in the same period four leaves.
Atmospheric air being admitted into the glasses which con
tained the carbonic acid, and hydrogen gases, the feeds in
forty-eight hours threw out two leaves.          From this it seems
to follow,     that carbonic acid and hydrogen         gases   check
and retard germination, but do not destroy it.         3d, Nitrous
air destroyed the seeds, gave them a black             colour, and
rendered     them incapable       of germinating in other kinds of

2ftf              Experiment to preserve Potatoes.
   This effect, as the author conjectures, arises from the ni
trous acid which the nitrous air contains.           The author com
municated also the following observation : — Being desirous,
M toe late Camper was, to discover some means for prevent
ing potatoes from growing, in order that they might be pre
served in a state fit for food throughout the whole year, he
put sixty of them into a glass bell with fixed air, and closed
the aperture      with mercury. The potatoes, indeed, did not
germinate,     but  at the end of fix months they were totally
spoiled, emitted a brown corrupted juice, and stunk most
intolerably.

    Dr. G. H. Thilow          read a paper on the action which puri
fied nitre and common fait have on the animal body.               From
several experiments which the author made              in the galvanic
manner, with many variations, on different animals, he con
cludes, that nitre poflefles the property of lowering the tone
of the nervous and muscular fibres. Thus, for example, the
crural nerve of a frog being strewed over with nitre, no conr
vulfive movements of importance took place ; but when com
mon salt was applied in the fame manner, exceedingly violent
convulsions were produced. The author is therefore of opi

strongest of stimulants.
    In the sitting of November          2, J. F. H. Baron von Dalberg
presented    a treatise    on   the  origin of harmony, and its pro
 gressive formation.         In this estay the author traces out the
 progress   of the musical gamut of melody             and polyphonic,
or singing in     parts, in the different periods of the history ot
 music   from   their  first origin to their present refined state; and
 shows, by historical and aithetic proofs, that all the arts, in
 regard to their formation,         have had the fame progress ;    thai
is, from simplicity to         complexness,    from rudeness to refine
ment, from great to exalted, until the art, by corruption of
 taste, again sinks into trifling minuteness, and becomes over
 loaded and spoiled.         From these observations the author de
 duces this practical       result  for musicians, that unity and va
 riety determine real beauty; that discords, chromatic and
 enharmonic proportions, the alternation of quick and slow
 time, and a mixture of the exalted and lively style, are ne
                                                                 cessary

and     that variety in the unity, order, and symmetry of the

thor at the fame time presented several illustrations, and a
few curious unpublished songs of the middle ages, with the
old mode       of notation in the form of cyphers, or the Hebrew
accents, part of which he brought with him from Italy.
     The president, C. F. Baron von Dacheroden, director             of
the Academy, presented an urn, dug up a short time before
near Strassfurt, the height of which was six and a half, and
the width at the greatest diameter nine inches. The president
observed,      as something remarkable,     that this Germanic urn
was found, with several others, in a low district, though the
burying-places of the ancient Germans were always on emi
nences.        Near this urn were found several masses of stone,
which      seem to indicate a   Druidical altar or habitation.
     Professor   H.  A. Frank read some observations which con
 tained a criticism on a supposed proof        of hereditary  diseases.
 Some person having asserted in a late publication on heredi
 tary diseases, that the Roman families of Pi so, Cicero, Len-
 tulus, Fabius, &c. acquired their names from certain spots,
 marks, or moles, resembling different kinds of pulse, which
 were peculiar to them, and which were transmitted through
 different generations, the author shows that Plutarch and
 Pliny, who speak of the derivation of these names, partly do
not make the above         assertion,  and partly are of another opi
 nion. Thus, Pliny         deduces the above    names from this cir
 cumstance, that those to whom they were first given distin
 guished     themselves in a particular manner by the cultivation
 of pulse.
      Professor Joseph   Hamilton read a paper on the nature of

                         HEAT AND LIGHT.
    By Dr. Herschel's experiments on this subject,     and which
have been laid before the Royal Society, it appears, not only
that the different coloured rays of the solar spectrum are en
dowed with very different powers of heating bodies ; but that
beat also comes from the fun by invisible rajs, which are left
refrangible than the red rays of the prismatic spectrum.

    A  peasant   of Steyermark,   a few months ago, in digging
at the large canal near Vienna, found an urn containing
298 pieces of the purest gold, of a straw colour, somewhat
smaller than Imperial ducats, but twice as thick, and conse
quently equal in value to about an English guinea. Twenty
of  these pieces he immediately gave to one of his fellow-la
bourers, and with four others he purchased from a Vienna
pedlar some clothes, with which, and the remainder         of the

 cumstance    was discovered by the magistrates,        and 374 of the
 coins have since been transmitted to the Imperial cabinet.
 Twenty of    these pieces    are still wanting,      but the Austrian
 government is making search after them.                All these coins
 are in excellent preservation,     but a sew of them are a little
  cut. They comprehend 76 of Nero; 95 of Vespasian ; 420s

    The proprietors of an enclosure near Montpellier, in lately
 digging up a plantation, discovered a tomb in which was en
 closed an alabaster urn, the cover of which was cemented
down.      On opening they found in it ashes, an alabaster in
cense-pot, the handle of which represented the head of a
 ram, a sepulchral lamp, and several pieces of money struck
in the reign of Domitian. Another discovery for the amuse
ment of antiquarians has also been made in France — a temple
 has lately been found which was dedicated to Ceres, and
 which, according      to history, was situated      on the road from-
 Paris to Chartres.
                          A NEW      EARTH.
    Professor Trommsdorff      has announced        that he has disco
 vered a new simple      earth in the    so called Saxon beryl.     "  L
examined," says he,       "  this fossil, and expected to find in it
glucine, but could discover no traces of it. The new earth
which I found possesses the following properties, by which it
distinguishes itself from other earths : — It is white, and to
tally insoluble in water. In a fresli state, when moistened
with water, it is somewhat ductile.                In the fire it be
comes transparent and very hard, so as to scratch glass,
but remains insipid and insoluble in water. The burnt earth
dissolves very easily in acids, end produces with them pecu
liar  salts, which   are entirely void       of  taste.  Fixed alkalies
dissolve this earth neither in the dry nor the wet way; and it
is equally insoluble with the carbonic acid and with caustic
ammonia.       It  has  a greater   affinity    to the oxalic than to
                                                                  other

 is insipid."     Professor Trornmsdorff informs ns, that a full
 analysis  of this earth, accompanied with an accurate descrip
 tion  of the  fossil by Dr. Bernhardi, as well as an analysis of
 a German soffit that contains chrome, will appear in the first

    A  letter from Rome        of  a recent date contains the follow
ing article:---" Mr. Hamilton, a young man twenty-sire
years of age, nephew to Sir William Hamilton, the British
ambassador at the court of Naples, and secretary to the British
ambassador at Constantinople,         is about to undertake   a learned
tour through Greece, Afia Minor, Syria, and Egypt. With
this view, during his residence in this city, he encaged various
artists, to whom he is to allow handsome salaries.            He takes
with him as architect an Italian named Baiestra ; a statuary,
also an Italian, is engaged merely for the purpose of super
intending the casts ; as models of all the monuments nut
transportable are to be taken on the spot.              Don Tito, of
Naples, is to attend Mr. Hamilton, as landscape-painttr,

by the court of Carlfruhe to Rome, but who was left there
several years without any protection, and who on that ac
count was in        narrow     circumstances,    is engaged to paint
figures. These artists are all engaged for two or three years.
Mr. Hamilton proceeded from Naples to Palermo, and thence

 I.   Description of the Island of Celebes or Macassar ; with art
     Account of its Gold Mines, and the Manner of working
     them.     By    Mr. Von Wurmb *.
        HE     island   of Celebes, called also Macassar, is of great
importance to the          Dutch f for the spice trade, on account of
its situation, as       it has on the north the Philippines, on the
 west the Sunda isles,           on the  east the    Moluccas,      and on the
south    Timor      and  Java.     It extends from the third degree           of
north to the fifth of south latitude, and lies nearly under the
 136th degree of longitude. It is about a hundred and twenty
miles in length from north to south, and forty-five in breadth
from east to west. Raynal fays its diameter amounts to about
a hundred and thirty miles,            by which, in all probability, he
understood        its length    from north to south.             Properly the
eastern side of the island is called Celebes, and the western
Macassar     ;   but in general the former name is given to the
whole island, particularly by the Dutch.
     As this island lies under the line, the air is exceeding
ly hot; but the heat is moderated by frequent rains and
cooling breezes, and in most places the air is not prejudicial
to the health of the inhabitants.                 It abounds with nioun-

English.

nut trees, mangoes, bananas, melons, and oranges, grow
here exceedingly well, and are cultivated in abundance, to
gether     with the cotton shrub, uby, and batta *. There are
here also plenty of horses, oxen, buffaloes, deer, wild swine,
and birds of all kinds, and in particular a variety of beautiful
parrots. Abundance of fish are caught on the sea-coasts as
well   as  in the rivers and lakes.
    The Dutch carry hither opium, spirits, lack, coarse and
fine cloths, &c. and receive in exchange rice, wax, slaves,
and gold.       Here, as well as in many parts on the coast of
Africa,     the unfortunate       beings doomed to slavery are not
prisoners     taken in war, or criminals, but people in general
who have been kidnapped for the purpose of being sold ; and
it often happens that relations do not hesitate, for the sake of
gain, to deprive their fellow-creatures of liberty, the greatest
blessing which mankind enjoy in the present life. The island
is well peopled : on the coast of Celebes alone there are said
to be fifty-fix     thousand inhabitants, seventeen thousand of
whom are capable of bearing arms.
     In this island there is a multitude of small kingdoms and
states, the greater part of which, however, depend on the
 two great kingdoms of Macassar and Bony.                    The king of
Ternate, also, has extensive possessions, which occupy almost
 the whole of the northern and eastern part of Celebes. The
 two most powerful kings, whom the Dutch, by the prepon
 derance     of their arms, obtained as allies, are the kings of
 Macassar and Bony.           The kings of Tello and Sandrabony are
 in alliance with the king of Macassar ; and those of Sopine,
 Luhu, and Tanette, with that of Bony.                 Some small states,
 such as    Wadjo, Mandhaar, &c. are independent. Though
 the kings of Macassar and Bony are allies of the Dutch, they
 are always sworn enemies to each other 5 and this is not un
 favourable to the policy of the Dutch, who in their Indian
  possessions still keep in view the maxim divide et impera, and

princes.
    The kingdom of Macassar or Goach lies on the western
fide of the island, of which it occupies the greater part. The
king of Goach and that of Tello both bear the title of Ma
cassar, though each has a distinct kingdom         : they assume the
titles of Goach and Tello from their places of residence. Ac
cording to an ancient tradition, the Macassars, like many
other nations, deduce the origin of their princes immediately
from the gods.       Once, fay they, after the death of the first
sovereign   of the kingdom,    a  beautiful female descended from
heaven    suspended by a golden chain.       This celestial beauty,
named Turhanurong-a, was immediately chosen by the Ma
cassars to be their queen.     She afterwards married a king of
Bonthain, and, after being pregnant three years, brought
forth a wonderful child, ^capable of speaking and walking as
soon as it was born, but exceedingly ugly and deformed.
This young prince was named Tuma-Salingabeerang. When
he attained    to manhood he broke the golden chain which his
mother had brought with her from heaven, and the mother
and her husband instantly disappeared, and left to their son
the kingdom, together with one half of the chain.                This
chain, which, it is asserted, was sometimes light           and some.
times heavy, and sometimes appeared of a pale colour, was
long preserved    as a valuable part of the regalia of the crown,
until it was lost, with various other rarities, during the war
like commotions which took place in this kingdom about the
middle of the present century.          This Tuma-Salingabeerang
is considered as the chief of the family of all the kings of
Goach.
    The Dutch      were involved    in violent  disputes with    these
sovereigns    before  they were    able  to establish   themselves   in
their kingdom.       In the year 1778 Goach, the capital, was
taken by storm and destroyed; and in 1781 the present king
Punduca Siri, sultan Abdal Hadja, was placed on the throne
by the government of Batavia. The king of Goach does not
enjoy unlimited power, but is subject to certain laws, which
he is obliged strictly to observe.      He can ondertake no mei-
sure  of importance without      the consent   of his council, nor
                               p   p  %                            car

be punished according to the laws.    He has a privy council
called Tonulalangs,       and       every village is under the direction
of   a particular governor distinguished by the title of Galarang.
     The Portuguese visited this island about the beginning of
the sixteenth century, and obtained from the sovereign then
on the throne permission to form an establishment. The
successors of this prince introduced the weights and measures
now in use, fixed the prices of merchandise, manufactured
gunpowder, and planted the first cannon on the walls of
Goach.   He gave permission also to the Malays not only to
reside in his kingdom,          but to erect a Mahometan
                                                     temple.
This religion     made such progress     that about the year
                                              here,
1588 deputies were sent to Mecca to bring from thence a
hadja or priest to instruct the Macassars in the doctrine of
Mahometanism,     which in 1603 was established throughout
the whole kingdom under the sultan Allahudier.
   The kingdom of Bony, which lies on the western fide of a
bay, called on that account the Bay of Bony, is the second
kingdom in point of importance in the island.  It is in close
alliance with the two small kingdoms of Soping and Luhu.
The natives of Bony, that they may not appear inferior to
the Macassars, deduce their origin in the like manner from
the gods.    The first king, they fay, descended from heaven,
and was known by the name of Matta-Solompo-e,           that                is,
the all-feeing.   This   sovereign, after reigning forty years,
Tefigned   the kingdom to his son, and with his wife ascended
again to heaven     :   but, notwithstanding this common descent
of their rulers from the race of the             gods,   the Macassars    and
people of Bony are sworn enemies,    and their incessant quar
rels greatly contributed to enable the Dutch, who, according
as their interest required, favoured sometimes the one party
and sometimes the other, to make themselves masters of the
island.     At   present the Bouginese, or people          of Bony,    are the
molt powerful, as       the Macassars        were about   a century ago.
 The Bouginese          are   ot"   a   middle stature, and have   abrown
complexion, but not dark. Among the female sex, in par
ticular, some are (bund almost entirely fair. Their features
in   general are agreeable,          only that the nose
                                                          is
                                                          a    little flatted.
                                                                         The

The Macassars, on        the other hand, are     of  large stature,   have
a manly warlike appearance, arc of a more open disposition,
and at the same time detest treachery ; while their opponents,
the Bouginese, never attack openly, but endeavour to fall
upon their enemies by surprise.           Those even who never did
them an injury are not secure from being murdered by them
when they can do it with privacy ; and they often commit
such actions for no other reason,         as  they fay, than to try the
goodness of their daggers.         Many Macassars, as well as Eu
ropeans, have fallen a sacrifice to this thirst for blood. Their
daggers and assagays are for the most part poisoned, as well as
their small darts, which they can shoot at their enemies to a
considerable distance by blowing them through a tube.
    Their clothing       consists of  a  piece   of   red or blue cotton
cloth wrapped round the body, and drawn through between
the legs.      The upper part of the body is quite naked. On
 the head they wear a piece of cotton cloth in the form of
 a handkerchief,       with which they     cover  their hair,     which is
 as black as pitch, and exceedingly long.             On   the other part*
 of  the body neither the men nor the women suffer any hair
 to grow; they pull it out by the roots, in the fame manner
 as the Mahometans and Indians, as soon as it appears.                They
 feed   for the most part on rice, fish, and pisangs; and their
 beverage is water, though they are not destitute of sagueer,
 or palm wine.         The Bouginese women are in general much
 handsomer than those of the other Indian tribes : some of
 them,     had   their complexion     the fame      mixture of red and
 white    as our females, would be accounted beauties               in Eu
  rope.    They are naturally of an amorous disposition, and arc
  capable   of undertaking any thing to gratify their inclinations.
     The Mahometan religion,' which           has here become general,
  permits the Bouginese to have four lawful wives, provided the
  husband can maintain them.            If the parties, however, are

 island, particularly in regard to their spice trade, they did
 every thing in their power to form a settlement in       and                                     it,

        The   road   of   Macassar         is   one    of   the most beautiful             in India,

turesque     appearance      of this   scene is heightened by groves
and scattered clumps          of sliady trees loaded    with fruit.   To
wards the       east  it is bounded by lofty mountains, called the
mountains of Bonthain, which divide this part of Celebes
towards the west from Bony, and towards the south from the
gulph of Tomini into two parts.
     The   seasons are here the fame as        in Java.   The  south-east
 monsoon continues from May till November, and is called
 the favourable monsoon : the north-west, called the bad
 monsoon, continues from November till May.                  During the
 former the sky is serene and the weather dry ; but continual
 winds and violent rain prevail during the latter. It is very
 singular, that on the east fide of the before-mentioned moun
 tains of Bonthain         the contrary takes place: for, when sine
 weather in the south-east monsoon prevails on the west fide
 of   the mountains,       there   is nothing but hurricanes and rain
 on the    east side ; so   that the boundaries of summer and win
 ter are only a few miles distant from each other.             The prin
 cipal productions        here are rice and cotton.       The rice, how
 ever, is inferior     in quality   to that   of Java, but the cotton is
  the best in India.
     The Dutch       East India company possess the castle of Rot

  dang, together with the surrounding district, in consequence
  of a  treaty  which they entered into with the prince of Ce
  lebes.     But as the boundaries of their possessions were per
  haps not accurately defined, the company always endeavoured
  ...
  to enlarge, and the Macassars on the other hand to confine
  them.      The company       possess also a   peninsula extending from
  this place towards the north, and a large flat district, which,
  on account of its fertility, is considered as the granary of
  Celebes, together with several places lying between this
  plain and the mountains,           and likewise a great many villages
  among the mountains.            These places border on each other,
   and are bounded on the         west  by the sea, on the north by the
   kingdoms of Tanette and Maros, on the east by Tamari, and
   on the south by the kingdom of Macassar.               The inhabitants

     I shall omit saying any thing of the other small kingdoms
in   the island of Celebes, and proceed to a description of its
gold mines, and the method in which the gold is collected.
Mining and the art of metallurgy are conducted in a very
careless manner in India ; which is owing partly to the igno
rance of the natives, and partly to their indolence.   In ge
neral it needs excite little surprise, that people who live in a
mild climate, and who have few wants, should be little in
clined to penetrate into the bowels of the earth to procure
metals, which are immediately extorted from them by the
avaricious Europeans, or of which they are in a great mea
sure deprived by their own princes.             If an   Indian   here and
there be compelled by force or necessity to dig for or collect
gold, he never goes to work with sufficient intelligence and
activity, but contents himself with what he can procure to
satisfy his wants in the easiest and speediest manner.            This is
exactly the cafe     with the Indians who inhabit          those parts   of
Celebes which produce gold.
  They obtain that metal by collecting the small particles
which have been carried down by the streams, or by washing
the sand which they dig up, rather than by working the
mines in a regular manner.   The auriferous mines in the
island of Celebes commence on the southern side of Bulang
and the northern fide of Kotta-Buna or Mogondo, and pro
ceed thence to Dondo on the south-west, and Tamperana on
the north-west fide, at the Bay of Tomini. Every where be
tween these two districts gold is found in a greater or less
quantity.  Where the land of Celebes becomes so narrow,
and the mountains so low, that a person can with ease pass
from the one coast to the other in a few hours, the auriferous
mountains end ; and on the whole coast on the other fide, as
far as Macassar, a single gold mine is not to be found.
   Besides the mines already discovered, a great many others
would no doubt be found, were there a sufficiency of labour
ers ; for the villages in these auriferous mountains are ex
ceedingly   ill   peopled.   Another   cause   of   these treasures being
                                                                         so

               <with an  Account   of Us Gold Mines.           igj
so  much neglected is the ignorant superstition of the natives.
They never will venture to dig in any place where they sus
pect great riches to be concealed until they have sent thither
a diviner, as he is called, to find out whether their labours
will   be attended with success.     The whole art of these di
viners, called in the language of the country Talanga, con
sists in their discovering, as they pretend,    by the voice of a
certain bird, whether abundance of gold is to be found in a
certain place ; whether the labourers will be attacked by sick
ness; whether there are in it many spirits to impede the la
bourers and conceal the gold from them, with other things
of the like kind.     If the bird gives a favourable answer to all
these questions,   the diviner must endeavour to secure the fa
vour of the protecting spirits of the place by offerings of va
rious kinds; after which a few workmen may begin digging,
and    continue their labour     as  many days or months as the
bird has prescribed.      If  the bird, however, gives an unfa
vourable answer to only one question, no person will venture
in such a place to dig a hole of only a few inches in depth.
Many rich mines remain, therefore, unexplored, because the
prophetic bird, or the Talanga, are not in good humour.
    When the workmen have arrived at the place where, ac
cording to the permission of the Talanga, they may dig up
gold, they hold serious counsel with the bird once more, and
alk it in what particular spot they must begin.        When this
is done, they first conduct water to the spot; for without water
they cannot proceed, as by its means they wash away the
earth and clay from the pit, that the stones and fine sand,
among which the gold is contained, may remain pure. If
the situation of the ground will not admit of the water being
conducted in furrows, they make a kind of gutters of hollow
ivakka trees, which they support with props. When they
have brought the water to the place where the mine is to
be worked, they make a pit of twenty, thirty, or forty feet in
circumference, according to the number of workmen : some
times there arc eight, and sometimes ten or twelve.       As loner
as the water has room to run off, they suffer it to carry with
it the earth, which they keep continually turning and stirring
in   the pit; but when     the pit becomes   so deep that there is

no   passage   for the water, they      must bale it out till they arrive
at the stones.      These they wash clean, and build them up re
gularly around the      sides   of  the pit, but without lime or mor
tar, to prevent the earth          from falling in.    When the pit is
carried to a very great depth, they secure these stones by means
of boards and beams of wood. These poor miners find some
times stones of from three to four and five hundred weight,
which they are obliged to raise and remove from the pit with
out any other machines than a common wooden lever.
   • When     all the earth, clay, dirt, and stones have             been
thrown      from the    pit, and      a kind of black sand begins to
appear, they are then sure that they stiall find gold.               This
sand they take up in a kind of small sliovels made for the
purposej and, having placed themselves in the water, they
put one handful of the sand after another on small round
wooden dishes named             dulangs.     These dulangs are about
 eighteen inches in diameter and somewhat hollow, and
have a small cavity in the middle which can be closed with
 a wooden cover.        When all        the sand has been washed from
 the dulang by being continually stirred round with the hand,
 the gold, which is much heavier, remains, in the above-
 mentioned cavity. When it can receive no more, they take
 the gold which has been collected, and hold it over the fire
 in   a coco-nut shell   till it is dry ; after which they blow away
 the remaining laud as well as they can, and preserve the pure
 gold.
     When they dig       a  hill or mountain which       is situated close
 to a river, they employ another method to obtain                the gold.
 In   this cafe they make a pit at the edge of the river, conduct
 into it   as much water as they have occasion for, throw into
  it the earth they have dug up, and wash it till -nothing re
  mains but the black sand mixed with gold ; after which they
  wash    it in their dulangs, as already described.           This  is the
  easiest  method of procuring gold, provided it can        be employed.
  They have, however, a third method; but it can be used only
  in mines newly discovered.            They go into the river with a
  basket on their back, and a piece of iron resembling a thick
  chisel, which      has a wooden handle, and search the fissures
  and crevices of the rocks, where they sometimes find lumps

of gold      equal in weight to two or three rials.                         In other     re
spects, the art         of digging for gold is            the famein all the mines
and among all the people on this coast.                        The only difference
is in regard to the depth of the pits. In many places it is
scarcely necessary to go deeper than ten or twelve feet ; but
in others the pits must be carried to the depth of several fa
thoms, and the fides must be supported by means of boards
and beams. The instruments used in these mines consist only
of a piece of iron about a foot and a half long and two inches
in thickness : it is pointed and sharp at the one extremity,
and at the other is furnished with                         a socket,      into which is
stuck a wooden pole about six feet in length.   Those who
are able to procure it have also an iron hook, with a short
wooden handle, which they employ for loosening and turn
ing up the earth around (tones. A mattock, with the above-
mentioned dulangs, which each miner makes for himself,
and a pair of gold scales, form all the rest of their apparatus.
    When   gold mine is discovered, the workmen do not im
               a
mediately begin to dig             it,
                          but first search the nearest river, in
which they turn up the stones and drain off         part of the           a
water.        After they
                   have turned up the sand to about the
depth    of
          foot,
              a they sometimes find large pieces of gold,
which in all probability have been waflied down       the                         by
streams from the mountains.                    It    has been remarked           that the
rocks on the borders of rivers, and even the greater part of
the stones which are taken up from pits where the ore                                     is
rich,    have      a   blue, and sometimes               yellow, colour, and are           so
soft that they may be used as paint.                        Where      the gold    is    less
rich,    the stones are gray or white,                   and either    of   a   hard tex
ture, or soft like limestone.                 By    these signs the produce               in
jjold of any mine may              be easily ascertained.
    In all     the gold mines,           but particularly those which lie at
a   distance from the shore,             it   exceedingly cold before sun

suffer   a   great deal.       As they        are obliged to fit in the water
from morning till night, their bodies, when they cease from
their labour, are almost rendered quite white  the saltpetre-.       by

as to drink   of it are seized with a dangerous dysentery.
   The labour of the miners is not always attended with the
fame success; for it sometimes happens that they work a
month and longer, during which they spend several dollars,
without finding gold of the value of one.                In that cafe
they are obliged to dig in some other place, and to renew
their labour.      In newly discovered mines they are for the
most part successful     ; but in mines that have been worked
for some time, they are often obliged to labour a whole
month before they obtain any gold. The quantity and value
of the gold which is found in any mine cannot            be accurately
ascertained.    One workman, also, is often more fortunate than
another.     In newly discovered mines there are labourers who
sometimes,    in  the course os fourteen    days, find to the value
of two hundred dollars      ;  whereas in other places the value of
twenty dollars is scarcely found in the course of a year.
   In the wide extended gold mines of the river Palella, which
divides itself into several branches, there are places where
gold is exceedingly abundant ; but in such places it is of less
value, being scarcely eighteen carats fine. The best gold
comes from the mines of Popajatu, Molifipat, Ankaliulu,
Tolodinki, Lembuno, Sonsio and Tamperana ; also from the
south and south-west side of Pogiama, Wongo, Toniollas
Bevool, and Tontoly.           The gold procured from all these
mines is for the most part above twenty carats sine.               Fre
derick Diihr, a servant of the Dutch East India company,
who visited these mines a few years ago, is the only person
who    has given an authentic account of them.             Those who
travelled   through these districts before him, never saw the
gold   mines,    but only visited the habitations of the chief
civil officers, which are at a considerable distance from the
places where the gold is dug up ; and the chief men among
the natives are too indolent to undertake journeys along those
difficult and dangerous roads which conduct to the mines,
and in which people are often in danger of breaking their
necks.

fineness exceeds even that          of Popajatu and Ankahulu.              This
place, however, is little frequented, because the small river
near which it is situated is not navigable, and the inhabitants                     •
are obliged to carry their provisions on their backs along a
difficult and dangerous road. Besides, the miners often find
in this place a great deal of copper, which, when they have
no acid to put it to the test, often deceives them, as they at
first take   it   to be gold.      This is   the only mine on the north
or north-west side where copper is found.    Near Bevool, on
the south  or south-west fide, there is another where good
copper is dug up in dust, which is as fine as the finest gold-
dust. In the mines of Bombula, Batodulang, Ankahulu, and
Palella,     a great     deal   of rock-crystal   is found, and likewise a
kind of iron ore.
  In almost all          the mines which the before-mentioned              Mr.
Diihr visited, he        observed, that the workmen, when they had
dug to the depth of five, and in some places of twelve feet,
came to a horizontal stratum of rock, which with their in
struments they were not able to penetrate.     They, however,
frequently told him, that they firmly believed that they should
find gold below these rocks, if they could break through them.
He saw also at Ankahulu, where a stratum of such rock is
found, at the depth of from twelve to fifteen feet, that there
were fissures in   two or three inches wide, which contained
                       it,
a blackish substance almost like rust of iron, mixed with                     a
great many pieces of gold, and which the workmen, after
they washed the rock perfectly clean, dug out to as great                     a
depth as they could with their tools.   In all the mines of
Celebes, the gold, when separated from the sand,  of consi      is
derable fineness.  At Pogiama and Palella alone gold ore                    it
found here and there, mixed among other stones; but                         is is
not rich, and the gold must be extracted                 by   pounding      the,
stone, which    not very hard.

 I?.   Observations      on preserving Specimens         of Plants.   By
                John Stackhouse,             Esq.   F.L.S.*
 I.N.   prosecuting ray researches with a view to complete the
 history of the British Fuci, I was desirous to discover, if pos
 sible, a method of preventing the olive-coloured, coriaceous
 species from turning black in drying.               For this purpose I
 tried the experiment of immersing them in a strong solution
 of alum. The result of my experiment did not answer my
 expectation.       They were prevented, indeed, from turning
 black, but they acquired a greenish hue. However, ima
 gining this might arise from the mixture of aluminous with
 muriatic salts, and being of opinion that the properties of
 alum might be of great use in preserving land plants on se
veral accounts, I set on foot a course of experiments, and am
 happy to fay, that the result has been favourable to my ex
 pectations.      After repeated trials, during which partial fail
ures    occurred,    owing to the proportioning the degrees of
 strength of the solution, and the admission of light and air
during the time of drying, I can safely recommend to the
 public attention the process which follows, not doubting but
that many improvements will suggest themselves to those who
possess a chemical knowledge of the various substances made
use   of by dvers in fixing their colours.
     Take a saturated solution of powdered            alum in common
water    :  immerse   carefully vour specimen, flowers, leaves and
stalk in this liquor.      During this immersion, with a camel's-
hair brusli, such     as varnishers    make    use of, wet thoroughly a
sheet   of blotting-paper    :  display   your specimen carefully 00
this paper, and prepare another sheet in a similar manner to
lay over your plant.           Then give a smart pressure to your
plant, either with a botanical press, a napkin press, or
weights of any kind applied to the specimen placed between
smooth boards, or books, observing to lay about half a quire
of paper below the specimen, and the same quantity above,
to take up the moisture.         After   a day   or two, according to

g~ ^                   ANATOM5T       OF  ANIMALS.
V>lUVIER           has   made    many researches respecting the or
ganisation     of   insects,  and the manner in which nutrition
takes place among them.             " I  think   I am  the first,"    fays
he,   "  who has distinguished worms into two grand families;
the moluscæ, which have a heart, and a complete system of
circulation    ;   and zoophytes, which have neither.         I have de
scribed the heart, and the vascular system of the principal ge
nera of the moluscæ ; and I have proved that their venous
vessels  perform at the fame time the function of absorbing
vessels."     He then fliows that insects have neither a heart
nor  vessels  of circulation.     Malpighi   observed in the si Ik -worm
a large knotty vessel extending along the whole back, and he
believed that this vessel performed the functions of the heart
and aorta, and that the fame organisation existed in all in
sects.    This opinion was adopted by all naturalists. Cuvier
has carefully examined this vessel, as well as the whole or
ganisation of insects; but he observed no movement of fluids,
or circulation.        Almost the whole body of the insect is filled
with tracheæ ; from which he concludes that there is no real
circulation      in  these animals,    and that their nutrition is per
formed by immediate absorption, as is evident in polypes
and other zoophytes, which are found immediately below in
sects  in the    scale  of organic perfection.
                                                                       He

   He then examines the organisation of the medusa or sea-
nettle, and shows that it approaches near to that of vege
tables.     "
            If I confined myself," says he, to announcing,      "
that there exists an animal without              a mouth, which is nou
rished, like plants,         by means        of ramified suckers, and in
which     the stomach        supplies     the place       of    heart,   one might
have some right to refuse assent to so extraordinary an afler-
tion; but I exhibit the animal itself." He then explains the
nature of its organisation.  This animal has no mouth, but
only some ojlioles, or very small apertures, which all termi
nate at a large cavity or bag, which may be considered as
the stomach. From this cavity proceed sixteen vessels, which
aTe   distributed to every part of the animal, and have a com
munication      with each other by means of a circular vessel
exactly concentric to the contour of the animal.   These ves
sels serve to
            convey  the nutritive juice. No  heart is observed
in this animal, nor any organ analogous to one.
    Cuvier has compared also the brain of various red-blooded
animals.    The character of that of man and apes         the ex         is,
istence of the posterior lobe and the digital cavity.  The cha
racter of the brain of carnivorous animals                     is,
                                                 the smallness of
the nates in regard to the tejles.  In herbivorous animals the
tejles are much larger  than  the  nates. That of the brain of
rongeurs (the stag kind)   the size of tht nates, and the absence
                               is
or ihallowness of the circumvolutions.      That of the brain of
the solidipedæ   the size of the nates, joined to numerous
                      is
and deep circumvolutions.  That of the brain of cetaceous
animals      its great breadth in proportion to its length, and
            is
the total absence of olfactory nerves.    Man and quadrupeds
alone have olfactory nerves properly      called   in real qua
                                                     so              :
drupeds they are supplied            by
                                    mammillary caruncles.
   Sue has described         the manner in which he prepares                      the
skeletons   of animals.        He    first boils them           in water,      as was
practised       by          after which he pours water over

    LeVeille      has given a very curious work on the manner                                   in
which young oviparous animals are nourished in the egg.
He compares it with that in which nutrition is performed in
the foetus of mammalia, and (hows :
   1. That the foetus of mammalia is nourished only by the
umbilical cord, and that it receives no nourishment by the
mouth : that the same thing takes place in the young ovi
parous animal enclosed  in the egg ; and to prove  he gives                        it,
the anatomy of the egg, and of the membranes which envelop
the foetus.
    2.     That   the egg, when incubated, consists                     of the
                                                                eye (cica-
tricula),      the yolk,        three distinct albumens, an absorbing ca
nal, five membranes, sanguine and serous vessels.
  3. That the third albumen   divided into two parts, united
                                                 is

           very thin prolongation           :     not at the                   is
two opposite poles of the yolk, and that each has for its
centre an annular cordon  in one of them
                                       ;         membrana-           it   is
ceous,in the other vascular.
  4. That  there exists   communication between the albu
                                    a
minous mass and the capsule of the yolk,    means of this             by
absorbing conduit.
    5.     That   the yolk has no suspending                      ligament, and that            it
floats at freedom           in the interior           of   the white.
  6. That the volume of the albuminous mass decreases in
proportion to the time of incubation, while that of the yollc
increases; which             seems to prove                that   the one absorbs             the
other.
    7.     That   the first albumen having no communication                                  with
the other two, there                   reason to presume that                            absorbed
                                                                           is it

    cemented to the shell            of the egg, except at the broad end.
    8.     That   the yolk,        besides its augmentation of bulk, has
very great fluidity         j   and that         it   is   absorbed       by   the vascular
membrane, which forms its proper tunic.

    10. That the chicken,        considered     as foetus,   is enveloped
in  a peculiar membrane, that separates            it from the yolk, with
which it has    a connection, and        from the white, with which it
has none, and from which it is at a considerable               distance.
    11. That all    substances      destined   for the nourishment of
this foetus are contained in distinct capsulæ separated from it.
    12. That there exists a perfect analogy between the vessels
of the yolk   and    those   of   the placenta ; and that the former
are to the yolk what the second are to the matrix, except the
difference in the circulation.
    13. That, contrary to the opinion of Haller, the albumen
does not communicate with the aqueous bag ; and that the
chicken makes no        use  of this fluid for    its nourishment.
    14. During the latter period of incubation, every thing
left enters into the abdomen of the chicken in such a manner
that no umbilical cord remains without.
    15. That   the red-blooded animals, which live             in air, may
 be divided into two grand classes, the              umbilical and non-
 umbilical.
    Dr. Jenner has made an interesting discovery in regard to
 the cow-pock.       He observed that cows were subject to pus
 tules on their teats.      Those who milk them acquire pustules
 also; and it is very extraordinary that by these means they
 are preserved from the small-pox.               He inoculated with the
 cow-pock in the same manner as with the common small
 pox, and by these means produced             the fame effects as when
 people  acquire  the   disease   by  touching      the pustules of cows;
 that is to fay, these people are not liable to the common
 small-pox, either by communication or inoculation.                   These
 facts have been confirmed by several other physicians, such
 as  Drs.  Pearson,    Pulteney,     &c.     Dr. Woodville, physician
 to the Small-Pox Hospital, has inoculated in this manner
 several hundred persons. This discovery is of the utmost im
 portance to humanity; for it is well known that the natural
 small-pox is one of the most destructive of all those diseases

•which    afflict mankind.      Inoculation,   therefore, ought no
longer to be performed     with  the matter   of the common small
pox or variolous matter, but with the vaccine ; because in
oculation with the latter is free from all danger, whereas
that with matter of the common small -pox is attended some
times with fatal consequences.
    Herhojdt has proved that the liquor of the amnios pene
trates sometimes into the tympanum of the foetus ; from
which he concludes, that it introduces itself sometimes, also,
into the tracheal artery, and fills it before birth.       When the
child is brought forth, it is necessary, therefore, to assist that
liquor in flowing off. Nature generally operates in this cafe
alone ; but its efforts are sometimes ineffectual, and the child
is supposed to be still-born.      In such circumstances it must
be assisted.     This the author did  in thirteen children, whom
he restored to life by facilitating the escape of the liquor.
    Dr. Buvina has made experiments which tend to prove,
that in living animals the red blood is retained in its proper
cavities by the active vitality of the parts, rather than by the
smallness of the vessels and pores. This he proved by making
injections of blood. These injections in the living animal
penetrate only to the vessels, in which it circulates during
life.   This he proved in a living calf; but, having deprived
the animal of life by cutting the spinal marrow, the injections
immediately penetrated to the most delicate vessels of the pe
 riosteum and other parts, and gave them a red colour, which
they have not in the living animal.          He has even seen the
blood issue from wounds, such as those of vesicatories.            He
thence concludes, that      if the blood in the living animal does
not penetrate to several delicate vessels, such as the lympha
tic, it is on account of the resistance opposed to it by the force
 of vitality, and not on account of the smallness of the orifice
 of the vessels.  The  spontaneous echymoscs,     which take place in
 the scurvy and some other diseases, seem to arise from the
weakness of the vital forces, which permit the blood to pe
 netrate to the capillary vessels.

   In conjunction with Vafalli, he has made experiments to
ascertain whether the opinion of the ancients, who pretended
that contagious diseases are produced by insects, be true ; but

                PHYSIOLOGY OF VEGETABLES.
   Desfontaines has given a memoir on the cultivation and
uses  of the date-tree, so valuable to the inhabitants of hot
countries.     These palms, as is well known, are of the family
of  the Jiœcia, the male flowers of which are borne on one
stalk and the female flowers on another.         The male flowers,
destined   for fecundation,    are detached   from the trees about
the end of March, before the antheræ have shed their farina.
They are prepared in such a manner that they can be tied to
the females   :  they are hung up and dried in the shade ; and
in this manner they will retain their virtue till the year fol
lowing.     Towards the end of April they are attached to the
female date-trees, which are thus fecundated ; because it
would be very imprudent for men, whose whole nourishment
is confined to the fruit of this palm, and who inhabit the
bosom of the deserts, to trust for the fertility of these trees to
the winds, which, in some cafes, may convey the fecundating
farina.
   Linnæus made known a part of the wonderful phenomena
exhibited    by the valifner'ia at the time of its fecundation.
 Picot la Peyrouse has added some new details. This plant
belongs to the diœcia. The male and female always grow
at the bottom     of the water.   At the moment when      the male
is about to flower, its stalks,   which    are terminated by a flat
 sheath, burst,   and the flowers are thrown out on the surface
of  the water;    where they unite, and float about at the plea*

sure    of   the winds.          The females, which                 have    a very long
stalk, turned into           a spiral   like   a spiral     spring, rise at the same
time to the surface of the water by the expansion of their
stalkj agitate themselves around the male flowers, which ap
proach them ; and when the rays of the fun begin to heat
the horizon, the stalk falls back, and carries with below                         it,
the water, the female flowers, which then (hut.                               But in the
evening, as soon as the fun finks below the horizon, they re
appear on the surface             of the water.            This     is   repeated several
times, but the author has not determined the number.       In
the last place, when the fecundation effected, the stalk falls

   Coulomb having caused to be cut down, towards the end
of April, some Italian poplars covered with flowers, observed
that one of them, which had been cut at the distance of some
lines from the axis of the tree, emitted at the cut   noise like            a

                   the air when    issues in abundance, and in

deal of sap flowed from it.   This experiment, being repeated
several times, wasalways attended with the fame success;
from which he concludes, that the sap in large trees does not
ascend       in   a   sensible   manner, but towards the axis, which
forms the medullary canal.                     To   ascertain this fact, he caused
severalof these trees to be pierced with  gimblet   but the     a             ;
instrument was scarcely moistened till   had arrived within    it
two or three centimetres of the centre of the tree when                       :         it
approached         the centre, sap issued  in abundance, with con                   a
tinued noise          of air-bubbles, which ascended with the sap, and
burst    in   the orifice formed          by   the gimblet.
   Saussurethe son has published researches on the influence
which oxygen gas has on the germination of plants. The greater
part of naturalists, fays he, who have examined the influence
of atmospheric air on germination, have perceived, that when
seeds are placed in contact with water and pure azotic gas
they do not germinate; and that there          production of    is   a
carbonic acid, which, mixing itself with the azotic gas, in
creases the volume of the atmosphere of the plant. They have
seen that, when              oxygen gas        is    substituted     in the preceding
                                                                             experiment

experiment for azotic gas, there is also a production of car
bonic acid gas ; but that the atmosphere of the plant de
creases, and that the oxygen gas is absorbed.              He made se
veral experiments to discover what takes place in these opera
tions.     The following are his conclusions :
    1. The atmospheric oxygen gas is not absorbed by the seed
in  the act   of germination,     as seems   hitherto to have been ad
mitted, but is employed merely to form carbonic acid gas
with the carbon of the feed.
    a. The feed in germination does not, by the contact of the
atmospheric air, form carbonic acid gas from its own sub
stance,    but only furnishes one of the constituent parts of that
gas,   viz. carbon.
    3.   It furnishes the oxygen       and carbon from its own sub
stance    in  the carbonic acid gas, which it produces          when it
is in   contact only with water and pure azotic gas.
    Though      the action which the vegetation      of plants  exercises
 on atmospheric air has been examined by a great number of
philosophers, much on this head is still wanting.               Spallan-
 zani, who        has been lately snatched from the sciences, has
also   examined      this subject. He concludes from his experi
 ments :
    1.   That    the leaves and tops   of  vegetables, when the rays
 of the fun dart upon them,            increase the proportion of the
 oxygen gas of the atmospheric air.
    2. That this augmentation is not            so considerable   as has
 been believed.
    3. That the fame parts of vegetables diminish the oxygen
 gas during the night, and cloudy days, by transforming it
 continually though slowly into carbonic acid.
    4. That the flowers, whether in the fun or shade, have more
 power to diminish the quantity of vital air or oxygen gas.
    5. That fruit have the fame effects in this respect as flowers.
    Delaville has examined several plants which afforded him
 sugar ; such as the mallow, digital is purpurea, cabbage, the leaves

    Desfontaines has published his excellent memoir on the
 structure    of the monocotyledons, or plants with one seminal
 leaf, such     as  palms, asparagus,    rushes,   &c.   He   has shown
                                                                     that

that the whole  of the interior of these plants is composed of
the medullary part, in the middle of which are a few longi
tudinal fibres. These vegetables have no solidity but at the
surface,     where the fibres              are collected and united ; whereas
in the dicotyledons the               surface is composed         of an epidermis,
which       has little solidity, while the interior has a great deal.
     Though the             which vegetates in water has al
                       green matter
ready been the object of much research to philosophers, Se-
nebier has thought it worthy of being subjected to a new ex
amination.   He informs us, that it was known to Lahire,
Leuenhoeck, and Homberg.      Adanson gave it the name of
tremella conferva gelalinofa, omnium tenerrima, minima, aqua-
rum limo innafcens.   Priestley, Ingenhouz, Senebier, Girod-
Chantram,         made         a variety     of experiments       and observations
dh this singular substance.                believes it to be
                                             Felix Fontana
a kind of polypier, that is the habitation of small insects,
which produce it as other insects produce coral. This is the
opinion also of Ingenhouz and Girod-Chantram ; but Sene
bier is of a different opinion.     Having made researches re
specting the manner in  which   this green matter is produced in
the water, he found, i. That it was never produced in water
kept in obscurity : 2. That a great deal of time was requisite
to produce it in distilled water, and that it was necessary that
the water should be long exposed to the air: 3. That water
into which he had put earth, was more favourable than any
other to the production of this green matter : 4. That none
of it     was formed        in   a vessel    of water    covered with a stratum
Of oil.
     To    ascertain       the   manner in which           it is formed,    he    put
glasses, on     which          some   of    the green     matter had been, into
vessels     of water,      and perceived       in   the water, some days after,
animalcula       without         green      matter.     The   green matter then
appeared,       and     he saw the animalcula penetrate into               it,   and
give   it   movement.            At other times        he saw the green matter
without       animalcula.             He    observed   in this green matter          a
very distinct pellicle, similar to              that of vegetables.  This pel
licle appeared to him to absorb                  the carbonic acid gas which
is in the water to decompose
                       ;                       it;    to absorb    the carbon    ;   to
nourish itself   j     and to suffer the oxygen gas to be disengaged.

This pellicle appeared to be the fundamental body of the green
matter; it is a kind of net-work, or tissue.
   He observed also, with great care, the animalcula gene
rally found in the green matter, and it appeared that they
were not different from those of common infusions.        This
much        however is certain,                that the fame animals are not
always found in the green matter. He mentions the expe
riments of Muller on infusion animalcula, and shows, that
the fame kind almost              in the green matter. He
                                     are found
shows further, that the green matter, examined with the mi
croscope, exhibits nothing that can be considered as a poly-
pier, or nest of small animalcula.     From all these observa
tions he concludes it to be probable, that the green matter is
a real vegetable analogous to the ulva intejiinalis, or nqftoch ;
that the animals most frequently found with it do not belong
to    it,
       since the green matter may exist without animalcula;
and that these animalcula are often found without the green
matter      :   so   that, in every respect, the green matter and animal
cula appear to be absolutely independent of each other the                             :
green matter must be    plant on which the animalcula feed.

matter proves also that              it   is   a   vegetable, for he extracted from

it,but several plants, when analysed, give the same and be                       ;

animalcula and other animals, which                         might      have furnished
ammonia.               His conclusion          is,

bility to the contrary, that this green matter      plant fur

IV.   On the   EffiSs of   the Acetic or Acetous    Ether, implied
     with Friclion in  the Rheumatism, Sciatica, and Gout.
  X HE different changes of weather from cold to heat, and
from dry to moist, which succeed each other so frequently
and so rapidly, often give rise to the rheumatism ; a malady
exceedingly painful, and for which medicine affords too sew
remedies.     If acetic ether, therefore, as appears, speedily al
lays the pains, and even cures them, the application of it is
a new benefit to mankind, which ought to be made known
that it may be brought into general use.
    About twenty-five years ago, when the acetous ether was
discovered   in the laboratory of Count de Lauragais, it was
not employed in medicine.         In 1784, C. Sedillot jun. being
tormented    with   the rheumatism, tried on himself this acid,
pouring twelve or fifteen drops, at different times, on the part
affected, which he immediately rubbed with his hand, to
render the action of the remedy more penetrating. After
this friction,   he kept himself warm in bed : a perspiration
took place at the part which had been rubbed, and soon
became general, and the pain was sensibly diminished.
Twelve    hours after, a second        friction  produced the like
                                                              effects;

from all the other remedies, both internal and external,

whole of the part affected    and after each friction he kept
                                                   ;
himself warm in bed.    After the third friction he found re
lief;    and at the sixth he was                       so    well cured that he went next

   It is recommended to those who employ this remedy to
use pure acetous ether ; but it is to be observed, that it is not
easily met with in that state.   The following is the process
for preparing          it,
                 prescribed    C. Sedillot   by                      :
   Take equal parts (for example,    pound) of alcohol, and
                                                        a
another of acetous acid. Distil this mixture in     glass re                       a
tort, and the result will be the acetous ether; which must
be rectified to free from the superabundant acid which has
                              it
passed over        with      it   in distillation.          For this       purpose put         it
into   a   glass vessel,      into which introduce               a    solution of the car-
bonat of pot-ash (salt of tartar): this alkali absorbs the acid,
and the ether floats on the surface.         then decanted, and
                                                            It   is
rectified     by   a   new distillation in          a   glass retort with          a    suitable
apparatus.

V>HEMISTS                     have         long made    that blue stone, known
under the name of lapis lazuli,                      an object of their research,
with view, in particular, to discover the colouring substance

prepared from it.                 This colour       was first ascribed to copper;
but the celebrated                Margraf      demonstrated               the fallacy    of this
opinion, as he found           only silex, fulphat of lime, lime,

    The means of analysis having, for some years past, been
carried to a degree of perfection which could scarcely have
been expected, it was natural to- think that the chemists most
expert  in this new art would not neglect to apply it to the
solution of this important question. Among this number I
shall    mention      Mr. Klaproth,             whose     labours have             so   much
enriched the chemistry of minerals, and who has paid par
ticular attention to all the blue-coloured fossils. In 1784 he
published experiments which demonstrate that what is called
native Prussian blue, a substance found in turfy soil/ and
which is often white before being exposed to the air, derives
its colour only from a combination of iron and the phosphoric
acid *.
    Another mineral, remarkable for                       the same colour,              which
has been successively taken for smalt, or the native blue oxyd
of cobalt;      for another kind of native Prussian blue; and for
a blue oxyd of copper, was discovered at Vorau in Austria.
But it results, from the examination of it by the celebrated
chemist of Berlin, that the colour depends only on silex,
argil, and iron ; and though he discovered that it resisted the
action of the fire less than lapis lazuli, he is of opinion that
it might be classed among the number of its varieties, if it
should be found to contain also lime f.     This last conclusion
stiows that Mr. Klaproth had previously determined, with
his usual accuracy, the constituent parts of the real lapis la
zuli; and he indeed indicates them in the tenth article of his
Researches          on Mineral Substances; where we                          fee    that the
purest lapis lazuli, called oriental, consists of 46 per cent, of
silex, 28 of carbonat of lime, 14*5 of argil, 6'$ of fulphat of
lime, 3 of oxyd of iron, and 2 of water.
    He rectified, therefore, the analysis of Margraf, by adding
argil ; of which the latter made no mention, and which I
showed, fifteen years ago, to be contained in           touching       it,   by
a  polished piece of lapis lazuli with the sulphuric acid, which
at the end of some hours left very regular crystals of alum,
that remained on it. But                   by

pruffic or the phosphoric acid                ?     Mr. Klaproth                 says that he
does not know *.
     The experiments of which             I   am about to give an account
seem to me to                      of this important question :
                      afford a solution
but before       I
             present  the  processes and the results, I ought,
for the fake of perspicuity, to give an account of some la
bours, which paved the way for arriving at this conclusion.
In the year 1780, when inspecting a pit in search of coal at
Montolier, in the road from Dole to Poligny, I found, at the
depth   of 35 metres, a gypseous bed containing zones of a
beautiful very bright red colour.   I gave a description and
analysis of it in the Journal de Pbyfique for the month of
December    that year, and I concluded from my experiments
that it was sulphat of lime coloured by the oxyd of iron.
  The recent discovery of several new metallic substances,
some       of which had the property of giving colours of great
intensity, induced   me  to think that the fossil of Montolier
deserved to be again examined with a view of searching for
one of these oxyds. For this purpose, at the commencement
of this year, I destined a piece of it for the experiments in
the analyses of minerals, which form part of my course at
thi. polytechnic School. They were conducted with as much
precision as sagacity by          C. Desormes, formerly
                                                 a pupil in the
laboratory of the second division. Having ascertained that this
fossil contained no carbonat of lime, we took ten grammes
of   it,reduced to powder, which was put in        crucible and              a
brought to      red heat.
                  a         The colour became darker, and
passed     toyellowish-brown,
                a                             and there was                  a   loss in the
weight of 2-23 grammes, or               W3        per cent.
     A. We       digested,    at several times,            the muriatic              acid   on
the 7-77 that remained after calcination; they did not lose
their colour, and the acid took up only  very small portion    a
of   the iron.
     £. We afterwards boiled the                  residuum          in   a   solution of the
carbonat of pot-ash, but only             a       very small part was                decom
posed.
     C. What remained was mixed with charcoal                                      dust,    and

composed       by the muriatic acid, which seized on the lime
and the iron, while the silex remained mixed with the super
abundant carbon.
    D. The liquors arising from             the three operations were
united,     and   then divided into two equal portions.               From
the first we separated iron, which was found to weigh 1*05
grammes ; and         I assured myself that       it contained no other
earth but lime.         We drew from the         second 8 decagrammes
of lime.      The whole liquor, therefore, contained, according
to the proportions determined by Klaproth,
            Oxyd of iron          -       -       a- 1 grammes.

    E. It remained       to examine the portion        of earth left by the
acid, and which was found mixed with the superabundant
carbon.       Here the operations began to present those unex
pected    phenomena, which, deviating from the ordinary
course,    inform the attentive chemist that he is advancing
towards a discovery.         This residuum was first calcined in an
open    vessel   to   consume    the carbon, but the silex remained
black   : it weighed i'6$.         It was treated with pot-ash in a
crucible of platina, and gave a fused mass of a superb blue
colour.      Water poured over it assumed the same colour.
The nitric acid        made   it entirely   disappear.     The silex, sepa
 rated by evaporating to dryness,           weighed no more than o*86
 grammes.
    F. It now became         of importance       to know     the effect  of
 different re-agents on the nitric acid which had been poured
 over the mass fused in the crucible, with a view to discover
 the substance      that had given it these properties. The fol
 lowing are the results of these trials :
    1. With the pruffiat of pot-asti this liquor gave a precipi
tate of a yellowish-green colour, which the addition of
acids, instead     of converting into blue,       made immediately dis
appear.
    a.  With the gallic acid there was no precipitate.
    3 . With sulphurated hydrogen there was no precipitate,
                                                                         as

  as might      bare been expected, looking only for iron ; bat it
  was proper thus to exclude the other metallic substances,
  which are precipitated by this re-agent.
      4. With the hydro-sulphure          of ammonia      there was a
 beautiful green precipitate.
-
     5. With ammonia, a white precipitate.
     6. With pot-ash, a light blue precipitate. —The two              last
  passed    to yellow in drying.
      Comparative experiments were made at the fame time
 with     a solution of the nitrat of iron, and the results were
 totally different.
      G. That no doubt might be left respecting the nature of
 the substances, the presence of which might hare had an in
 fluence in these results, synthesis was called in to the aid of
 analysis.      Sulphure of iron was prepared in a direct manner ;
 the nitric acid was poured over it in sufficient quantity, and
 the liquor, when filtered, was diluted with abundance of
 water, that the excess of the acid might no longer precipi
 tate the sulphurated hydrogen which was poured over it.               In
 this   state  the fame re-agents which had been before employed
  presented all the same phenomena.              One might have sup
 posed that the sulphat          of iron, (not oxydated,) in the same
  circumstances, would         have   given some analogous effects;
  but the prussiat of pot-asli produced only a white precipitate,
  as professor Proust had announced.
      H. It    was easy, after this,   to conclude the analysis of the
  red sulphat      os lime  of Montolicr    : it confirmed what I had
  announced, that it depended only on the ox yd of iron ; and,

   But the termination of this labour opened a field for new
researches, of which it is time I should give an account also.
    I. Observing the blue colour which the sulphat of lime of
Montolier had assumed with pot-ash, the effects of the re
agents on the acid holding its iron in solution ; and, above
all, seeing the green precipitate formed by the prussiats dis
appear by trie addition of acid, C. Desornics recollected that
he had observed similar phenomena during some experiments
which he undertook last year with C. Clouet on lapis lazuli.
This was already a strong indication that this stone con
tained some other colouring metallic oxyd than that of iron.
The question then was, to follow the coincidence of facts in
all its circumstances, to determine the particular state in
which this metal produces that beautiful blue composition.
Some experiments added to the observations              already known
respecting the properties of lapis lazuli will give an idea of
this coincidence.
    K. Lapis lazuli may       be brought to a red heat, and lose as
much     as o'2 of its weight without any sensible alteration in its
colour ; but at a stronger heat, such as that of an enameller's
 furnace, its colour    passes to  grey.    By still increasing the in
 tensity of the heat, it is reduced to a brownish vitreous scoria,
and there is a decrease of from 10 to 11 hundred parts of its
 weight.
    L. When       lapis lazuli is pulverised, one sometimes per
 ceives a smell similar to that of musk, and which argil and
 magnesia emit also when they are united with a little sulphur.
    M. Lapis lazuli      is deprived   of its colour by the three mi
 neral acids, but more or         less speedily.    This   effect, by the
 nitric acid,  is produced almost instantaneously        :  the muriatic
 acid is the next    in order:   the action   of sulphuric     acid is the
 slowest.    The  same odour is often disengaged       from it by these
 acids as by trituration.
     If the nitric acid is concentrated, there is a production of
 nitrous gas ; and, accidentally, of carbonic acid gas when the
 lapis lazuli contains carbonat of lime.          The liquor tried by
 prussiats gives a precipitate, the     colour   of  which approaches
 that of Prussian blue, but inclining sensibly to "green, and

with the sulfure of iron, since we have seen (F, G,) the sul-

    O. Before       I    terminate this memoir              I      shall   add some ob
servations,     which will be of utility to those who may be dis
posed to repeat these experiments.
   The composition of every kind of lapis lazuli not essen                  is

crystals which have metallic brilliancy.   Sometimes        dis                      it   is
seminated in small particles   and       this, no doubt, which

has hitherto prevented the most accurate chemists from de
tecting the real colnurircr principle of this substance. They
have seen the sulphur as au accidental production foreign to
the subject of the analysis, without suspecting that there ex
isted a blue sulfure       iron.   of
                                    may readily be conceived
                                                 It
that, in experiments as this kind, the greatest care must be
taken to choose fragments absolutely free from every particle
of pvrites or sulfure of iron, of yellow metallic appearance.

      The crystals of alum, which were formed very speedily,
  as already      mentioned, on     a   beautiful plate of lapis lazuli,
  leave no doubt that there          are some kinds in which a little
  pot-ash    may be accidentally contained.             It will be proper,
  therefore, to search for the colouring principle in what con
  stitutes its real essence, without paying too much attention to
  these accidental varieties.        We    must    not, however, believe
  that the affinity of earths, either with each other, or with,
  the colouring principle itself, has any influence on the na
  ture of the compound.         A proof of the contrary here pre
  sented itself,   in  a sensible  manner,     in  one of the synthetic
 operations.       Sulphat of lime     charged    with  iron having been
 treated with charcoal-dust,        and then held in digestion in the
 nitric acid, the pruffiat of pot-ash at first only coloured the
 liquor green, without giving a precipitate: the addition of a
 solution of argil immediately produced a green precipitate,
 which was taken up by acids, and, under all circumstances,
 exhibited     the fame phenomena as that obtained from the
 decomposition of lapis lazuli.
     The  consequences     which appear      to me to result from the
 facts announced in this paper, are         as  follows  :
     1.  The sulphat of lime of Montolier is coloured by a red
 oxyd of iron, which adheres so strongly to silex as to resist
 the action of acids.
     2. This sulphat, treated with carbon, gives birth to a sul-
fure of iron, in which that metal is less oxydated ; which
being dissolved in acids, does not by prussiats give Prussian
blue, but a green precipitate, which acids destroy instead of
heightening, and which retains the blue colour peculiar to
it  even in pot-ash, and at that heat          which   is required   for its
fusion   in  the dry way.
    3. By operating on the fulfure of iron prepared in a direct
manner, you obtain a product which manifests the fame pro
perties in the fame acids, and by the fame re-agents.
    4. These phenomena are exactly similar to those exhibited
by lapis lazuli sibjected to the same operations.

principle of lapis lazuli, the difference in the natural pro
duction necessarily resulting from the slow combination of
this principle    with    the earths and sulphat       of lime alone    ex
cepted.
    6.  In the  last place, the blue sulsure     of iron is the real and
sole colouring principle       of all the varieties   of the lapis lazuli,
and probably of that mineral also known under the name                   of
the blue (tone of Vorau.
VI.    Account   of certain   Phenomena     observed in the    Air- fault
    of the Furnaces as      the Devon Iron-Works* ; together ¦with
   some fracTical     Remarks     on the Management of Blajl-Fur-
    naces.    By Mr. Roebuck, in a Letter to Sir James
    Hall,     Bart.     Communicated       fy Sir James       HALLf-
 I     HAVE      examined my memorandums concerning the
observations     I made on the condensed air in the air-vault
of   the Devon    iron- works near Alloa; and, according to your
request, I now transmit you an account of them ; and also of
 an experiment I made, when a partner and manager of these
works, in order to increase the produce of blast-furnaces.
    The two blast-furnaces at Devon are of large dimensions,
each being 44 feet high, and about 13 feet wide in the
 bodies, or widest part, and are formed on a steep bank, by
 two pits funk in a very solid stratum of coarse-grained free
 stone.
    These pits were afterwards sliaped and lined, in the usual
 manner of blast-furnaces, with common bricks and sire-
 bricks;   and the hearth was laid           with   large   blocks of the
 stone that had been dug out, and which serve               the purpose   of
 sire-stones.     At the back of the two furnaces, next         the bank,
 the air-vault     is excavated, and formed by a mine drove in
 the solid rock, distant from the furnaces about 16 feet. The
    • These iron-works are on the banks of the river Devon, which run*
 into the Frith of Forth near Alloa. They are three miles from Alloa,
 and eight from Stirling.

                                                                   bottom

                      of  the Devon Iron~Works.                    325
bottom of the air-vault is only about four feet higher than
the level of the bottom of the furnaces. This vault has an
aperture    at one end to receive the air from the blowing ma
chine,    and has two at the opposite end, one          of which     re
ceives the eduction-pipe,        and the other is a door to give ad
mittance occasionally into the vault. As the rook is ex
tremely close and solid, the vault is dry, except that a little
water ouzes very gently from the side next the bank in small
drops, and does not appear            to exceed   an English    pint in
34 hours.
     These furnaces arc provided with air, or blast, as it is termed,
 by the means of a fire-engine of the old, or Newcoinen's
construction.        The diameter of the steam cylinder is 48J
inches; and the square area of its piston being about 1866J-
 fquare inches, the power of this fort of engine cannot be
 rated at more than 71b. to the square inch, amounting in all
 to about 130621b.         This power was employed to work an
 air-pump, or blowing cylinder, of 78 inches diameter, and
 about 7 feet long.         The number of square inches on the
 piston    of the air-pump       is 4778,    and therefore   this area,
 being     multiplied by z\, will produce 13139; being a re
  sistance   that nearly balances the above-rated power, and
  fliows that the air, which was expelled from the air-pump,
  could not be condensed more in the ordinary way of working
  than with a compressing       power of about 2' lb. on each square
  inch.     As  the   engine was not regulated, at first, to make a
  longer stroke than about 4 feet 8 inches, only one furnace
  being used, the quantity of air expelled at each stroke of the
  machine was about 155 cubic feet, which it discharged
  through     a valve    into  the   air- vault about  16 times     in a
  minute.      When two furnaces afterwards were blown, the
  engine was      regulated to work much quicker, and with a
   longer stroke.     The air-vault is 72 feet long, 14 feet wide,
   and 13    feet  high ; and contains upwards of 13,000 cubic
   feet, or above 80 times the contents of the air-pump.             The
   top, sides,   and   bottom   of  this   vault, where the least silfure
   could be discovered in the beds of the rock, were carefully
   caulked with oakum, and afterwards plastered, and then co
   vered with pitch and paper.          The intention of blowing into
                                                                       the

   325           Phenomena    observed in the  Air-Vault
   the vault is to equalise the blast, or render it uniform, which
  it  effects more completely than any machinery ever yet con
  trived for the fame purpose.         The air is conducted from the
  vault by the eduction-pipe, of 16 inches diameter, into an
  iron box or wind-chest, and from this it goes off to each
  furnace in two smaller pipes that terminate in nozzles, or
  blow-pipes, of only      i\ to -J inch diameter     at the tweer   of
  the furnace.
      When the furnace was put in blast, after having been
  filled with cokes, and gently heated for more than six weeks,
  the keepers allowed it to have but little blast at first, giving
 it   a small blow-pipe of about a'- inch diameter, and likewise
 letting off a very considerable quantity of air, at the escape,
 or safety-valve, on the top of the iron wind-chest; as it is a
 received, though erroneous opinion among them, that the
 blast must be let on very gradually for several months. From
 the construction of this valve       it was impoflible to ascertain
 the exact proportion of the blast they thus parted with, but
 I    believe it was very considerable.       The consequence was,
 that the furnace, after it had been in blast for several days,
 never seemed to arrive at its proper degree of heat, but was
 always black and cold about the tweer in the hearth, and ap
 peared    in danger of choaking, or gobbing, as it is termed.
     After various experiments, tried in vain, by the keepers
and the company's engineer, and others, (indeed they tried
every thing, except giving the furnace a greater quantity of
air, which, as I afterwards ascertained, was all that it want
ed,) they concluded that the air-vault was the cause of the
whole mischief; and, to confirm their opinion, they said they
had now discovered that water was, in considerable quan
tities, driven out of the air- vault through the blow-pipe,
which cooled the furnace; and they insisted, that the power
of the engine was    such as to force water out    of the solid rock ;
so   that this method of    equalising the blast never    would, suc
ceed.      The other managing partner was         so  much alarmed
by these representations,     that he began to consult with the
engineer, and others, about finding a substitute for the air-
vault at any expence.
    As   the plan of the blowing apparatus      had been adopted at
                                                                  mj

my recommendation, and was now so loudly condemned on ac
count of the water, I had other motives, than mere interest,
for trying to become better acquainted with the phenomena
attending it.  I accordingly determined to go into the air-
vault, and to remain enclosed in the condensed air while the
engine was blowing the furnace.       It is an experiment that
perhaps never was made before, as there never existed such
an opportunity.    I could not persuade the engineer, or any
other of the operative people about the work, to be my com
panions, as they imagined that there was much danger in
the experiment.   Mr. Neil Ryrie, however, one of the clerks
of the Devon company, had sufficient confidence in my re
presentations         himself along with me.
                   to venture
   The machine had been stopped about two hours previous
to our entering the vault, and we found a dampness and
mistiness in   which disappeared soon after the door was
                  it,
shut fast upon us, and the engine began to work                in its   usual
manner.          After four or      five strokes of the engine, we both
experienced       a   singular sensation    in our ears, as   they were
                                                              if
stopped     by   the singers,    which continued as long as we re
mained in the condensed air.             Our breathing was not in the
least affected.       I   had   no thermometer with me, but the tem
perature    of the air felt     to us the fame as that without the vault.
Sound was much magnified, as we perceived, when we talked
to each other, or struck any thing; particularly the noise of
the air escaping at the blow-pipe, or waste valve, was very
loud, and seemed to return back to us.     There was no ap
pearance of wind to disturb the flame of our candles  on the    j
contrary,  was
           I    surprised to find, that when  we  put one of
them into the eduction-pipe, which conveys the wind from
the vault to the furnaces,          it   was not blown out.    There was
not the smallest appearance of any drops of water issuing out
of this pipe. The ouzing and dropping of water from the
side of the rock next the bank, seemed the same as before the
condensation was made in the vault.     In short, every thing
appeared,     in other respects,         the fame   as   when we were      in
the common atmosphere.     Having remained about an hour
jn the condensed air, and satisfied ourselves that no water,
during that time, that we could in the least discover,                   was
                                                                   agitated

3*8             Phenomena     observed in the   Ait'Vault
agitated and forced out       of the rock and vault by the power of
the blast, as was imagined and insisted on, we gave the signal
to stop the engine.        As soon as it ceased to work, and the
condensation abated,        and before   the door    of the vault was
nnscrewed, the whole vault, in a          few seconds, became filled
with    a thick vapour, so that we could hardly see the candles
at four or five yards distance.        The door being now opened,
the work-people, anxious to know our situation, and what
had occurred, came into the vault, and prevented any further
observations.       I now   endeavoured    to account for this curious
appearance of the water, which only showed itself occasion
ally, in very small quantities, at the tweer, and at a hole I
ordered to be made in the bottom of the wind-chest to collect
it more accurately; for it never was observed, but either when
the engine, after working slowly, was made to work quicker,
or, after having been stopped for a few minutes, was set to
work again.
    I  considered    the vapour which we had discovered in the
vault to arise from the moisture of the fide of the rock next
the furnace, which being expelled by the great heat of the
furnace, and converted        into vapour, was able to force its way
through the pores       of the rock into the vault    ; but that being
in   a manner confined       within the rock, by the pressure of the
condensed     air, it found itself at liberty to come into the vault
only when the condensation abated considerably, or was to
tally removed by the going flow, or stopping of the engine.
 It also occurred to me, that the air, in a state of condensa
tion, might possibly be capable of holding a greater quantity
of water in solution, which might precipitate suddenly into
vapour or mist when the condensation abated.               I imagined,
therefore, that the very small quantities of water we at times
discovered,     proceeded from nothing else but this vapour      in  its
passage to the furnace along with          the blast, being condensed
into water, by       the coolness   of  the   eduction-pipe and iron
wind-chest. The quantity of water did not appear to amount
 to a gallon in twenty-four hours.
    A   few days after I had made this experiment, the water
ceased entirely to make its appearance, eith< r at the tweer or
 at the hole   in  the wind-chest    j but the furnace did not come
                                                                   into

into heat for   a long while after, and indeed not till the keepers
let much more air into it by a larger blow-pipe, and allowed
 less air to escape at the safety valve.       It is probable that the
 rock was now become perfectly dry by the continued heat             of
 the furnace.
     My experiment had the good effect to remove all the pre
judices against the plan I had adopted of blowing the fur
 naces, and likewise prevented the other partner from laying
 out a large sum of money, by stopping the works, and alter
ing the blowing machinery.            Indeed, it has since been ad
 mitted, by all who have seen it at work, to be the most
simple and effective method of equalising the blast of any yet
 put in practice.
     This experiment       led me, some time afterwards, to apply
 a wind-gauge that      I   contrived, to ascertain precisely the state
 of  the condensation     of the air thrown into the furnaces. I
 found that   a column of quicksilver was raised five inches; and
 sometimes, though seldom, fix inches ; and, in the interval of
 the return of the engine to receive air into the air-pump, it
 fell only  half of an inch. At this time only one furnace was
 worked.      But when two furnaces were in blast, the engine
 only raised the mercurial gauge about four inches ; because
 the Devon cbmpany, for certain reasons, did not, while I
 continued a partner, think proper to allow the blowing ma
 chinery to be completed, by the putting to work their second
  boiler of twenty feet diameter for the fire-engine, according
  to my original    design,   which, by adjusting the machinery,
  would have enabled us to blow two furnaces, with two boil
 ers, with as much effect, in proportion, as one furnace with
  one boiler.    This instrument had the advantage of enabling
  the work-people to discover the real power of their blast, and
  know the exact condition of the air-valves, and the gearing
  of the blowing piston ; for, if these were not tight, and in
  order, (although the engine might, to appearance, be doing
  well, by making the fame number of discharges of the air-
  pump    as usual   per minute,) yet the wind-gauge would not
  rise so high, and would show that there was an imperfection
  somewhere, by reason of a quantity of air escaping at the
  valves, or piston, that could not so easily otherwise be known.

   330           Phenomena      observed in the  Air-P'ault
   This contrivance was considered as of much use, and waa
   afterwards alway3 quoted in the company's journal books, to
   show the actual state of the blowing machine, in comparing
   the daily produce of the furnaces.
      I hope you    will not think    me tedious, when      I explain to
  you another experiment, which appears to me to be of con
  siderable importance to all manufacturers of cast iron.
      I had reason to conjecture, from my own observations on
  the effects of blowing machinery on blast-furnaces, as well
  as from the knowledge I had acquired from my father, Dr.
  Roebuck,     and from     my communications with other expe
  rienced iron masters, that a great part of the power of such
  machinery was misapplied in general practice by throwing
  air into furnaces with much greater velocity than necessary ;
  and that, if this velocity was, to a certain degree, diminished,
  the same power, by properly adjusting the blowing machinery,
  of whatever nature, would        be capable    of throwing into the
 furnace a proportionally greater        quantity of air. For,
                                                                " Since
  the quantities  of any fluid,    issuing through the fame aperture,
 are as the square        roots of the pressure ;" it follows, that it
 would require four times the pressure, or power, to expel
 double the quantity of air, through the fame aperture, in the
 fame time    :  but  if the area  of  the aperture  was doubled, then
 the quantity of air expelled by the fame power, and in the
 fame time, would be increased in the ratio os the square root
 of 2 to i, though its velocity would be diminished exactly in
 the same proportion.         Again : I considered that the quantity
 and intensity of heat produced in blast-furnaces, and conse
 quently its effects in increasing the produce, might be only
 in proportion to the quantity of air decomposed in the process
 of combustion, without regard to its greater velocity ; that is
to fay, whether or not the fame quantity of air was forced,
in the fame time, into the furnace through a small pipe, or
 through one of larger dimensions ; for, in attending to the
process of a common air-furnace for remelting of iron, where
there is a very large quantity of air admitted through the large
areas between      the bars, it is well known that a much greater
intensity of    heat is produced than       take* place in a blast-fur
                                                                  nace,

                              of    the Devon           Iron-Worh.                             331
nace, and yet the air does not enter into the fire through the
bars with increased density or great velocity.      I therefore
thought it probable, that increasing the quantity of air,
thrown into the blast-furnace, in a considerable degree, al
though     the       velocity           or density might            be much less, would
have     the    effect        of increasing its heat,                and operations, and
produce.            And    as, from the principles                       above   stated,       with
regard to the machinery,                     I   saw        I   could greatly increase the
quantity of air thrown into the furnace, by enlarging                               the di
ameter of the blow-pipe," and regulating the engine                                   accord
ingly, without being obliged to employ more power,  was                                    I
anxious to make this experiment.
  A system of management, of which I did by no means
approve, was adopted by the other partners of the Devon
company soon after the works were begun to be erected ;
and, in the prosecution of                       it,
                            they ordered their second fur
nace to be put            in   blast, without permitting those measures to
be taken that were necessary to provide and maintain suffi                            a
cient stock of materials; and also, without allowing their
blowing machine to be completed, according to the original
design,        by   the addition of its second boiler.                        As might         have
been expected,   trial of several months to carry on two fur
                          a
naces, with only half the power of steam that was necessary,
and an inadequate stock of materials, proving unsuccessful,
the company, as      remedy, instead of making up the above
                               a
deficiencies, ordered one of the furnaces to be blown out,
and stopped altogether. This improper measure, however,
afforded me the opportunity of immediately putting prac                              in
tice the plan  have mentioned.
                    I
    When one of                the furnaces was stopped,                  the other conti
nued to be blown                   by
                        blow-pipe of 2\- inches diameter, and
                                        a
the produce of the furnace, for several weeks thereafter, was
not 20 tons of iron per week at an average.     The engine at
this time was making                        about 16 strokes             a   minute, with        a
stroke    of   air-pump, about
                the                 feet   inches long; but 4        8
when   altered the diameter of the blow-pipe, first to 3, and
       I
immediately after to 3^ inches diameter, and regulated the
working gears of the engine,     as to make   stroke ofso feet            a            5
2   inches long, and about 19 strokes                               in   a    minute, on an

   333               Phenomena       observed in the     Air- Vault
   average,     the produce was immediately increased.                     It con
   tinued to be, on an average of nine months immediately
   after this improvement, at the rate of 33 tons of iron per
   week, of as good quality as formerly; for during this period,
   from the 21st of November 1795, to July 30, 1796, this one
   furnace yielded 1 188 tons of iron. No more coals were con
   sumed     in working       the blast-engine,       or other expences about
   the blowing machine incurred, and therefore no more power
   was employed to produce this great effect. It is also of much
   importance to remark, that the consumption of materials,
  from which this large produce was obtained, was by no means
  so great as formerly.           The furnace required very considerably
  less  fuel,    less   ironjltne,    and  less    lime/lone,   than were em
  ployed to produce the fame quantity of iron by the former
  method of blowing; and according to the statements made
  out by the company's orders, as great a change was effected
  in the economical part of the business.
       From the success of this experiment, so well authenticated,
  and continued for several months,                 I am led to be    of opinion,
 that all blast-furnaces, by a             proper adjustment of such ma
 chinery as they are provided with, might greatly and advan
 tageously increase their produce, by assuming this as a prin
 ciple, viz.
                   " That with the given power it is rather by a
 great quantity of air thrown into the furnace, with a mode
 rate velocity, than by a less quantity thrown in with a greater
 velocity, that the grcatcjl benefit is derived, in the smelting of
 irori/loiics, in order to produce pig-iron."                 However, it is by
 experiment alone, perhaps, that we can be enabled to find
 out the exact         relations of power, velocity, and quantity                 of
 air requisite to produce a maximum of effect*.
                                                                               But
     •  If Q,_be  the quantity of a fluid, issuing in a given time through an
aperture     of the diameter D, V its velocity, and P the power by w hich it
it   forced through    the aperture;   then the area of that aperture      being as
D*, the quantity of the fluid issuing in       the given time   will be as VD*, or
VD» = Q^
     Again : this quantity multiplied into its velocity, will be as the me-
imntumol the fluid expelled, or al the power by which it u expelled,
that U , V* DJ = P, or VD = ^/P.
     Here, therefor*,     if D  is given, V  is as   ^P,  as Mr. Roebuck aflinns.
                                                                              Also,

   But an unfortunate disagreement among the partners of
the Devon company put it out of my power to make further
progress in this matter, by laying me under the necessity,
two years           ago,        of withdrawing                  myself entirely                  from     the

          SIR,                            Spring Garden, May 1 5, 1E00.
    I,IT is now    more than twelve months since           I announced
my intention of publishing some remarks concerning the use
of the word beat, and the constitution of light. My avoca
tions have not allowed me to fulfil my promise ; and being
still uncertain when I may be able to finish for publication,
I  shall be much obliged to you to insert          in your   respectable
Journal the following brief results of my investigation con
cerning light, which I conceive to be of more importance
than those concerning heat, which chiefly relate to verbal
criticism.    The proofs and reasoning on which these results
depend, will, I hope, be soon submitted lo the public.

    ist, Light is a compound resulting from a peculiar com
bination of caloric and oxygen.
    2dly, In all those phenomena which have given occasion
to the idea that light is identical     with, or    a  modification of,
caloric,   the manifestation of the latter principle is to be re
ferred to the disunion     of  the   constituting principles of light.
The caloric, therefore, which so frequently results from the
application of light to various substances,        issues from the de
composition of light in various degrees. •
    3dly, The phenomena of colours are to be ascribed to the
different qualities of light, as containing caloric and oxygen
in different proportions. The different proportions manifest
themselves     in the circumstances both of the decomposition
and the formation of variously coloured light.
    4thly, The    separation  of light by  the prism is to be regarded
as a chemical decomposition, not a physical or mechanical
division of light.
    5thly, The changes which take place in the colours of
different substances, as of plants in the process of vegeta
tion, of metals in that of oxydation, are owing to corre
                                                               spondent

chemical action upon light.

absorption, of light, is to be referred to the complete resolu
tion    of this compound into its constituent parts.                                /
VIII.        Memoir on Azot, and on the Question, Whether            hie a
    simple or a compound Body.                  By       Christopher Gir-
    tanner, M.D. of                     Gottingen*.
 JL HE            most     chemists have long known the
                             celebrated
important part which azot performs in all the operations of
nature. Lavoisier, Fourcroy, Berthollet, Van Mons, Guy-
ton, Chaptal, Vauquelin,    Priestley, Van Marum, Goettling,
Wiegleb, Von Hauch,             Van Troostwyk, Deiman, and
                                        Paets
several others, have endeavoured, with more or less success,
to study its nature ; and it is to their labours united that we
are indebted for a knowledge                     of its singular properties, which
are very different from those                      of the other aeriform fluids
with whose bases we are acquainted.
  But it is in organised bodies that this singular principle
seems to perform the most distinguistied part.                                In   the re
searchesI have made                    for twelve
                                  years, respecting the me
chanism of life in animals and plants, I always found myself
stopped by this too little known principle.    In my experi
ments        I   saw    it   appear    and disappear,        without being able to
six    or to explain in what manner
       it,                                                  ithad introduced itself
into the body from which extracted it.   I  began, therefore,    I
to suspect that azot was not   simple body, but
                                             a   compound.                a
I formed several conjectures, which my experiments proved
to be false  and, despairing of success,
                 ;                          had entirely given

up pursuing  this subject, when  the  dispute which arose re
specting the azotic gas drawn from the steam of water, in
duced me to turn my attention to        once more. This dis
                                                       it

 It appears to me that this famous dispute has a great re
 semblance       to many others mentioned         in  the annals   of out
 science,    and    by which      the most important points of the
 theory of chemistry have been fixed. Such was the dispute
 on the existence or non-existence of the carbonic acid in
 chalk, which occupied all the chemists of Europe for several
 years j and such was that respecting the existence or non-
 existence    of oxygen in the        red oxyd   of mercury : a dispute
 in which      I  myself was engaged,      and abused by the German
 chemists, and particularly Gren,           who was exceedingly apt
 to become warm *.
    Wiegleb, Goettling, and Von Crell, assert,
    1. That the steam of water, in pasting through ignited
tubes, is converted into azotic gas.
    2. That this change always takes place, and under all
 circumstances, provided the steam of the water is brought
into contact with the ignited bodies.
    3. That water is changed into azotic gas by combining
itself with caloric.
    4. That water is the ponderable          base  of azotic   gas and   of
all the other gases.
    5. That consequently the theory of Lavoisier is false.
    The Dutch chemists, as well as Von Hauch, Juch, Van
Mons, &c. maintain,
    1. That the steam of water, in             passing through ignited
tubes, is not converted        into azotic gas in any cafe whatever.
    a. That the azotic gas obtained, has not been a produc
tion of the water, but has arisen from a part of the atmo
spheric air which passed through the tubes.
    3. That consequently the theory of Lavoisier remains un
shaken; and that the theory of phlogiston, or that of water,
being the base of all the gases, is erroneous.
    Being     much      interested   in this   dispute,   I followed its

not for the discovery of truth, but for victory and that they         ;

their particular theory required. This conduct prevented
them from seeing the object under its real appearance ex                           :
periments were multiplied                  ;   each party denied               of the

opposite party          ;   results entirely different were            found, and in
stead  of approaching, they receded still further from each
other. The only thing which interested me in this dispute
was truth.      am firmly persuaded that the system of Lavoi
                  I
sier   agreeable to nature.
      is                      Having heard of an experiment
which      was told overturned this system entirely,
           I                                            imme                 I

false, we ought to abandon                 it    as soon as possible,        and not to
wait till      it     abandon us.          Let     us not be attached        to systems,
but to truth        ;    and when Nature speaks,                 let us listen to her

of losing nothing but error, let                   us hasten to subject        ourselves
to that loss.
    Such was the manner in which                      I   reasoned.    I    had learned
from the history of chemistry, that in all disputes in which
two parties obtained contrary results from similar experiments
there was      a               of expression, and that both
                    mistake in the mode
at bottom were  in the right  and    doubted whether this
                                               ;         I
might not be the cafe in regard to the dispute in question.
I   proposed,  therefore, to resolve the following points                     :
    1.   Isthe steam of boiling water converted into azotic gas
by   passing through ignited tubes                   ?
    a. Under what circumstances does this change take place                             ?
  3. What     the rationale of this production of azotic gas
                    is                                                                  ?
  4. Are these experiments contrary, or not, to the system of
Lavoisier     ?
I     will                    enter on this discussion, that
              freely confess, before           I
the manner in which the production of azotic gas had been
explained,        by
             making   pass from the external

the tubes;      did not appear to me altogether satisfactory.                I
 had, indeed, formerlv adopted this explanation*; but I soon
 abandoned an opinion so contrary to every thing that we
know of caloric.         I am reallv sorry to see an opinion so im
probable defended by chemists of the first rank ; but the his
tory of chemistry affords many instances of the like kind.
 Before the immortal Lavoisier had proscribed phlogiston, the
 Stahlians extricated themselves from their embarrassment
 in  a manner absolutely          similar.    They put oxyd of mercury
in   a  crucible,    shut the crucible       in the closest manner possi
 ble, and exposed it to a strong heat.               On opening it after it
 had cooled,      the mercurv was found fluid.            But as such a re
duction, according to the doctrine of Stahl, could not take
place     without the intervention           of phlogiston, the Stahlians
 veTe asked to explain this, phenomenon so contrary to their
doctrine.        Their answer was, that the phlogiston had passed
through the crucible to join itself to the mercury.                     Even
 Bergmann        and Scheele were          satisfied  with this absord ex
planations; which           proves     that the spirit   of system misleads
 the ablest      men,   and renders        them ridiculous in the eyes      of
 posterity, more enlightened, and less slaves to prejudice.                  I
 shall show that azot does not pass through the sides of tubes,
 and that phlogiston does not pass through crucibles.                     The
'experiments       which Priest lev made to prove that the air          passes
 through earthen retorts, does not prove what he pretended
to prove. He saw the retorts smoke on the outside, but the
water, as he imagines, did not pass through : the exterior
¦part of the earthen retort only attracted             the water of the at
 mosphere.
    As I     propose, in a particular work on azot, to give a detail
 of   the   numerous experiments I have made to ascertain its
 nature, 1 shall confine myself at present to a general view of
 them, as well as of the results which I think mvfelf autho
 rised to deduce from them.              I think, then, that I may safely
 assert,   that  azotic  gas   is  obtained    :

340                 On the constituent Parts     of Azet.
                           General Remarks.
    To obtain azotic      gas in the greatest quantity, the water
must   be  evaporated very slowly, and over a very gentle fire;
and care must be taken not to increase the fire too much.
    In every experiment        of this kind,     without   exception, it
may be observed, that when the last drop of water is evapo
rating the azotic gas ceases to be produced, though the sire
be continued.
                     Results   of  tbe Experiments.
    Such are the facts and plain statement of the experiments,
independent of all system, of all explanation, and of all the
ory.    It  thence results   :
    1. That    Messrs.  Wiegleb     and Goettling were right in say
ing that water      was converted     into azotic gas by the action   of
 fire.
    2. That they were wrong in maintaining that this change
always takes place, and under all circumstances, when the
steam    of the water is brought            into  contact with bodies
brought to ignition      in the fire.
    3. That Mr. Wiegleb has not proved what he asserts, viz.
that the conversion of water into gas is owing to a mere addi
tion of caloric, and that water forms the base of all the gases.
    4. That the Dutch chemists were wrong in advancing
that the conversion of water into azotic gas never took place
in any   cafe whatever ; and that the gas obtained arose from
atmospheric air which had            passed   through   the retorts and
 the tubes.
    5. That there are certain circumstances under which water
is converted into azotic gas, and others where it is not ; and
 that it is easy to reconcile the opposite parties.
    The change of water into azotic gas by the action of ca
 loric and of earths being ascertained, the question was, 10 find
 a solution of this problem.         The manner in which I explain
 it is as follows : — I have observed, as well as Ingenhouz,
 Von Humboldt, and Van Mons, that moist earths are en
 dowed with the property of absorbing the oxvgen of the at
 mosphere     at the common temperature.           Besides, I have ob
 served a circumstance,         not mentioned by Von Humboldt,
               .  9                                                 that

                  On the constituent Parts       of Azof.             341
that they absorb oxygen in less time, and in greater quantity,
when they are heated.            I found, by other experiments, that
earths take the fame oxygen from the water ; but that, for
this purpose, a temperature higher than that of the atmo
sphere is required.        Argil, argillaceous earth, or alumine, is
that which takes up oxygen with the greatest avidity, and at
a temperature far below that of boiling water ; lime requires
 a higher temperature, and does not charge itself so much
with oxygen ; silex, before it absorbs oxygen, must be brought
 to a state of ignition in the fire, but afterwards it takes it up
 very rapidly.       Baked argil unites itself also with oxygen,
 but it requires a higher temperature.             Glazed argil does not
 absorb oxygen, the glazing being made of metallic glass,
 which has no action on oxygen.
      Having   made these observations,         I did not find it difficult
 to explain     the   phenomena of the          conversion   of water into
 azotic gas.       Recollecting the hypothesis which M. Mayer
  had ventured to start, a few years ago, on the nature of azotic
  gas, by supposing that it was a compound of oxygen and
  hydrogen, water converted into a gas *, I conceived a similar
  idea respecting it. As M. Mayer gave his hypothesis merely
 as an idea thrown out at hazard, and as he supported it with
  no chemical experiment whatever, I proposed to supply -what
  he had left undone.         Admitting this hypothesis, and reflect
  ing on the singular property which earths have of absorbing
  the oxygen of water, I explained, without difficulty, the ex
   periments above mentioned. They are the result of a double
   affinity.   The oxygen of the water unites itself in part to the
   earth, which is converted into an earthy oxyd ; the remainder
   of the oxygen in union with the hydrogen combines with
   the caloric, and forms azotic gas        ; consequently, azot is water
   deprived of a part      of  its oxygen.
       This  assertion   is suppported     by various experiments : but
   I  (hall confine myself to a few only, and shall reserve the rest
   to be mentioned in a second memoir, after I have repeated
   them.
       1. Provide porcelain tubes,       and try them by transmitting
    through   them   the   steam   of boiling   water, which will pass in

                                                                    vapour

 343               On the conjiitueni Parts of Azot.
 vapour without the least particle of gas except the air con
tained in the retort. After you have ascertained in this man
ner that the water is not changed into gas in these tubes, to
prevent the objections     of those who imagine that the external
air  passes through the tubes, fill one of them with filings of
tin  and put it into the sire, which you must take care to keep
np. Then make the steam of water to pass through it. In
the pneumatic apparatus you will obtain azotic gas mixed
•with oxygen gas.       The tin   is changed into an oxyd.     This
experiment,      which   was made by       M. Von Hauch,     may be
easily explained    from my principles.      The tin takes from the
water only a part of the oxygen it contains ; the reft remains
in union with the hydrogen, and forms azot.
    a. By transmitting the steam of water over lead, in the
same manner as       in the preceding experiment, you will ob
tain, according to M. Von Hauch, the fame result.            At the
commencement of the operation the oxyd of the lead panes
under the bell with the gas and the steam of the water, and
the metal then appears under the form of a very fine powder.
The azotic gas obtained is in proportion to the oxygen gas
almost as 64 to 36.
   3. By transmitting, in the same manner, the steam of
water through a tube filled with antimony, you obtain a
mixture of azotic gas and oxygen gas. There will be 89 parts
of  the former,    and  ti of  the latter.
   4.  A   porcelain tube was silled    with black oxvd of man
ganese,    and  the   tube exposed to   a very strong heat for more
than two hours, until the oxyd had entirely ceased to furnish
oxygen gas.       The steam of water was then made to pass over
this oxyd deprived of the greater part of its oxygen. At first,
oxvgen gas pretty pure was obtained, and then azqtic gas.
This experiment of M. Von Hauch is very instructive. The
manganese      evidently absorbed, first the hydrogen, and then
a part of the oxygen of the water.
    5. The steam of water was made to pass through the fame
 tube, silled with the fame manganese which had served for
the fourth experiment.        Azotic gas was obtained; and the
fire being continued for three hours, the disengagement os
 the azotic gas continued as long as the steam of the water
                                                                was

                            On the conjliluent Paris        of Azat.                   343
was made to pass.                 When no more steam was transmitted,
the disengagement                 of the azot ceased ; but it recommenced
as soon as the water was again boiled, and new steam began
to pass over            the manganese.          This experiment was              repeated
six days successively,               each    day for three
                                                         hours, and always
with        the fame success.             When the operation was ended, the
manganese              was found cemented         to the porcelain tube           in   such
a manner that it could not be separated.
   6.       Dr.    analysing water by an electric spark, al
                  Pearson
ways obtained azotic gas, besides the two gases of which
water is composed.
  7. The same gentleman burning, in a tube hermetically
sealed, a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen gas by means of
an electric spark, obtained water and azotic gas.
   8.       Dr. Priestley     that oxygen gas which had re
                                  observed,
mained in contact for some time with the purest distilled
water was in part changed into azotic gas.      I have proved
this observation, and I found 0.1 of azotic gas in the oxygen
gas.
  9. A mixture of hydrogen gas and nitrous gas, which re
mains for some time in contact with water, no longer burns,
and is found changed into atmospheric air; which I explain
by supposing that the hydrogen combines itself with a part
of the oxygen of the nitrous gas, or of the water, and is con
verted into azotic gas.                   This experiment, which            was     made
by Mr. Link, with                  me did not succeed.
      jo. Dr. Priestley found that hydrogen
                                       gas, which he had
kept for   long time in contact with water, was entirely
                  a
changed into azotic gas*. This experiment does not al
ways succeed.  It succeeded four times with Priestley. It
is,   no doubt, necessary that the water sliould contain oxygen.
      11.    In burning

drogen gas and one inch of oxygen gas, azotic gas     ob                           is
tained. This experiment was made       M. Yelin, but with   by
me did not succeed.
      12.    When the             steam     of water   is   made to pass through         a

in the   inside,    no hydrogen gas is obtained, but azotic gas,
as the iron is no longer able to take up any of the oxygen
presented to it by the water.              This is an experiment of
M. Yelin,      and was confirmed to me by          M. Mayer.
     13. An experiment made by Mr. Lampadius appears to
me to prove, in a very satisfactory manner, the presence of
oxygen in azotic gas.            He fused arsenic in the purest azotic
gas prepared by the combustion of phosphorus.                  The metal
was sublimated, and at the end of the experiment it was
{bund that it had been in part converted into oxyd of arsenic.
     14. In the combustion of two gases to produce water,
when the quantity of hydrogen is too great, nitric acid is
obtained.
     15.  The following experiment,         described  by Scheele, ap
 pears to me a new proof that azot is nothing but oxydated
hydrogen.         The following are the words of this celebrated
chemist :  *  —   " I filled a bladder with air obtained from iron
 filings dissolved in the vitriolic acid, and inhaled this air.
 Having inspired it twenty times, I found myself obliged to
 desist. Having recovered a little, I exspired, as far as possible,
 all the air contained in my lungs, and then again respired
 the inflammable air.          After ten inspirations I could inspire
 no more. The air, on being examined, was no longer in
 flammable;       but, however, did not render turbid         lime water.
 In   a word, it was corrupted air, (azotic gas)." It may be
 perceived    that in this experiment the pure hydrogen gas
 combined itself in the lungs with the oxygen gas, which
 remained after the preceding inspirations of atmospheric air,
 and formed there azotic gas.
     16.  For another experiment, which          appears to me to cor
 roborate my opinion respecting the nature of azotic gas, we
 are indebted to Mr. Henry, of Manchester.              It was repeated
 by him     several times, and        always with the fame success     f.
 His explanation of this phenomenon, which is very different
 from mine, because he believes azot to be a simple body,
 may be found in the work below quoted. His experiment
 is as follows : — In a bent tube of glass he mixed, in a mer

diminished the remainder to 23 measures.   In this experi
ment, therefore, 23 measures of azotic gas were produced                                         by
an electric explosion, the oxygen uniting itself to the                                         hy

When by chemical experiments, which                               very improperly have
been called eudiometrk, the oxvgen is separated from the hy
drogen, this separation                 never can be effected entirely or com
pletely, a part of the oxygen remains united to the hydrogen,
and forms that chemical combination which we call azot, and
which       we obtain by the above experiments.       Oxvgen, so in
dispensably        necessary for supporting the life of organised be
ings,       is,   byits combination with hydrogen, converted into
azot, which not only     unfit for maintaining life, but
                                        is                                              is

     Itresults from these experiments, that eudiometry, such as
it exists at present,    founded on erroneous principles.
                                   is                      The
azot obtained            by   these experiments being always                    a    product
of   the operation, and not having previously existed under the
form of azot in the air subjected to examination, Von Hum-

                   is

that earths            might be employed to determine the quantity of
                                                                 azot

azot contained in atmospheric air.             Earths do not indicate
the azot contained in atmospheric air} they convert that air
into azot.
    Cultivated     earth being in contact with the atmosphere
absorbs    its oxygen and forms azot.            In the polar regions,
and on the summits of the Alps, where the earth is always
covered with snow, the atmospheric air contains a greater
quantity of oxygen than in the southern countries or in the
plains, as the snow prevents the air from coming in contact
with the earth.
    Since the constituent parts of azot are now known, we
might write a new theory of the art of making saltpetre.
The Annales dc Cbimie* contain some very valuable ob
servations on this subject ; for example, the following : —
"   The   earth     taken up from deep subterraneous places well
secured    from the light, such as cellars, requires only to be
exposed to the air a few days to produce abundance of salt
petre.    It is worthy of observation, that such earth does not
furnish an atom of nitrat when taken from the damp and
obscure     places    where it was formed, and that it is only by
the combination or combustion of the azot of the earth by
 the oxygen of the atmosphere that this salt is produced."
The explanation given of this interesting phenomenon in the
 fame work     f,   \s a proof how far we were from the truth be
 fore the nature      of azot  was better  known.
    As lime    absorbs    oxygen with avidity, we fee the reason       of
 the insalubrity     of apartments the walls of which         have  been
 recently whitened.
    The following       bodies   are combinations     of hydrogen with
 oxygen in different proportions :          azot, the gaseous oxyd of
 azot, nitrous gas, the nitrous acid, the nitric acid, the mu
 riatic acid, the oxygenated muriatic acid, the nitro-muriatic
 acid, water, atmospheric air, ammonia.               I hope to be able
 soon to prove that to this lilt we ought to add potash, soda,
 and sulphur.        Phosphorus appears to me to be hydrogen in
 the purest     state with which we are acquainted with it; but

As I    do not intend lo enlarge on this subject in the                        present
memoir,        I    shall    only      mention       one    of   those   experiments
which      are conclusive.             When alkali         is fused with      silex    for
the purpose         of making
                        glass, you analyse the alkali.                                The
hydrocen escapes  under  the form of a gas, and the oxygen
combines itself with the silex, glass being nothing else but
an oxyd of silex.   Too much oxygen, however, must not
enter into the composition, as it would render it less transpa
rent : this is the reason why glass-makers add substances
greedy of oxygen, as manganese.
  Having communicated to M. Mayer the result of my ex
periments, by which I so evidently confirmed an idea thrown
out by him at hazard, and of which he has the merit of
being the author, this learned philosopher sent me a short
memoir, of which the following is an extract: — " I am in
clined to believe," fays he, " with Mr. De Luc, that the
evaporation of water, such as effected by nature on a large
scale, is a real conversion of water into air. It is indeed true,
that we have never yet been able in our laboratories to convert
water into air by evaporation ; but the reason of this     that                is,
we are unacquainted with the part which both light and
electricity perform in evaporation in general. appears to                It
me probable, however, that the ponderable parts of atmo
spheric air, that  to fay, oxygen and azot, have no other
                            is
source than from the water with which the surface of our
globe    is   covered.           The
                               small quantity of oxvgen gas

which vegetables exhale by the influence of the solar light,
is far from being able to make good the enormous consump

manv different ways but       :          by
                               supposing, according to this the
ory, that too grains of water are converted    the secret processby
of nature into ioo grains of atmospheric air, that to fay, into          is
a chemical mixture of oxygen and hydrogen, we may find, by
a very simple calculation, in what proportion the oxygen and
hydrogen combine to form the azot which we find in the at
mosphere.          We       must, however, keep            in view, that what we
call azot     is   not always of the fame nature, and that there                        is
                                                                         considerable

                      184 L = 51 O + 13a S.
                      100 L = 27-8 O + 72-2 S.
    "   Azotic   gas being a compound             of oxygen   and hydrogen,
            S  =   x O     + y H ; therefore,
             100 L = (27-8 + 72-2 *)0 + J2'2y H.
    "   But nature converts 100 grains of water into 100 grains
 of atmospheric air       ;   consequently,

     " That is to fay, 100 grains of azotic gas are composed
 of 79 grains of oxygen and 21 grains of hydrogen."
     Having applied this ingenious mode of calculation, em
 ployed by M. Mayer, to the other oxyds of hydrogen, I had
 the following result       :
     If N   be the   nitric acid, we know by experiment that
                       100 N = 79-5 O + 20-5 S.
    * This is  a very important     point, to which  M. Mayer  has directed our
 attention.   It will  be necessary   to make a great number of very accurate
 experiments to determine the different des roes of the oxydation of hydro

+ 4-3 H nearly.
   100 Grams of nitric acid contain, therefore, nearly 96
grains of oxygen and 4 grauis of hydrogen.
   The fame mode of calculation gave me also the following
results
   100 Parts      of ammonia = 6372 oxygen + 36-28 hyd.
   100 Farts      azot = 79-0 oxygen + 21 *o hydrogen.

   100 Parts      of water = 85*66 oxygen + 14*34 hydrogen.

   100 Parts of the nitrous acid = 94*33 oxyg- + 5*67 hyd.

   May not oxygen and hydrogen be the two elements of
which all bodies in nature         are composed   ?   To  me this seems
not at all improbable.         It seems probable, also, that the hea
vier a body, the more it contains oxygen in a concentrated
state, and deprived      of caloric; and that, on the other hand,
the more a body contains hydrogen, the lighter it ought to
be.     But these are merely hypotheses, which must be con
firmed or refuted by future experiments.
   It is seldom as simple bodies, but rather as compounds in
different proportions, that the two constituent principles of azot
enter into the combination of bodies.           Carbon or    the oxyd  of
the diamond is found in many bodies, and the diamond in
pone with which we arc acquainted.               We obtain carbon in
our chemical decompositions, and not diamond. We do not
even    know      the diamond     or diamontic      (adamantine) acid,
though      we know      very well the carbonic acid.        No chemist
will think of faying that we exhale diamond in respiration,
but carbon.         The diamond, perhaps, is not even a simple
body   ;  in all probability it contains still oxygen ; for all trans
parent bodies, if I ain not mistaken, contain more or less of
it. Thus, azot as well as #rbon enters into several combina
tions   as  azot,   as a double principle,   which     gives bodies very
                                                                different

different properties from those they would have were they
combined with the two simple principles of which azot is
composed. Azot, as a constituent principle of bodies, is not
hydrogen and oxygen, but azot; in the fame manner as soap
is not oil and alkali, but soap. Of this observation we ought
never to lose sight.
  In several experiments I have observed that sulphur often
exhibits a yellow or yellowish orange colour. We shall sel
dom be deceived if we suspect the existence of sulphur in all
bodies which exhibit                that colour.             Bodies which contain
carbon are black,                brown,      or violet.       Azot announces itself
by    a green    colour     :    stunted plants, which
                                            vegetate sheltered
from the air and light, are white, and contain very little azot :
if exposed to these two agents for some days, they assume a.
green colour, and the proportion                 of azot in their composition
is much more considerable.                     When nitrat of potasli is fused
in       retort, and the oxygen gas is disengaged from
     a glass                                                 one                       it,
may observe at  the  end of  the  operation,  when   the azot                                  is
formed, that    to fay, when the oxygen has
                   is                            greater affinity     a
to the hydrogen than to     the  caloric, that the green colour
appears,       and the disengagement          of oxygen cas ceases entirely.
     But what      requires        the attention of all philosophers    that          is,
when       water   is   exposed          to the sun the         light     decomposes           it,
and disengages the oxygen in      large quantity. The hydrogen

philosopher ought to stop       here that he ought to admire

 gree    of heat can supply its place ; and this                        single experiment
 might be sufficient to convince every unprejudiced reasoner,
that heat and light are two substances entirely different.                                          I
am surprised that this green matter of Priestley, this fonti-
ttalis, should not have been more attended to by chemists.
Itis the most wonderful substance existing ; the most singular
body in nature. Nothing can be more absurd than what
has been advanced by Priestley. To reason as he does, is to
reason like a child. This celebrated man, whose name will
live as long as the sciences are cultivated, has made most
important discoveries.    I admire his sagacity, but I am sorry
to see in all his works that he is rather an experimenter than
a philosopher.            While he displays to us with one hand the
astonishing secrets        of Nature, he keeps the other always ready
to close our eyes, lest we should show a desire of penetrating
further than he chooses us to extend our view. lie has given
as a striking instance of his unwillingness to allow us to fee
the wonders of Nature, except through his sacerdotal glass,
in the    disputewhich he had with Dr. Ingenhouz respecting
the green      matter in question. Ingenhouz, an enlightened
naturalist, having described a great number of experiments
respecting this singular substance, which arc worthy the at
tention of every thinking being, adds : " The water itself, or
                                                  is is,
some substance in the water,       in my opinion, converted
into this kind of vegetation.       real transmutation, which
                                               It    a
may appear incomprehensible lo the philosopher, but which,
at bottom,   not more extraordinary than the change of grafs
               is
and other vegetables into grease in the bodies of graminivo
rous animals, and the change of the aqueous juice of the
olive into   oil."
  Water      is   changed into            a    plant    :   such   is   the fact.         There
Ingenhouz      stops.         He fays,     I     have no comprehension                    of the
cause.     This     is   the language of            a   philosopher.        Priestley, on
the other hand,          is   scandalised       at this language-;           and he alls
Dr. Ingenhouz,           if   he   is   not ashamed to attempt to revive the
long ago refuted doctrine                 of   spontaneous         generation        *.       He

speaks to him almost in the fame manner as the inquisitor to
Galileo when he endeavoured to prove to that immortal man
that the fun moved round the earth. Priestley then gives us
his own theory on the production of organised azot. The
feeds of this plant, he fays, float every where ; in the air, on
the earth, on the sea, on the Alps, in the plains, under the
poles     and    the equator, in summer and winter, and in all
seasons, and are received into the water, where they germi
nate : but organised azot is produced in bottles well corked.
Dr. Ingenhouz has even proved, that by filling a bottle with
well water, and inverting it in a bason silled with water, or •
ganised azot is formed in large quantities.                       Priestley, who
could not maintain, without supposing an intelligence supe
rior to the pretended seeds of this plant, that they had come
through the water on purpose to settle in this bottle prepared
for them, extricates himself from his difficulty by making
them     pass   through the glass by imperceptible fissures*.                  Such
long ago refuted.      The following    are  his own words:       "  considering bow
long the doQrine    of  equivocal or spontaneous    generation bas been exploded."
A   philosopher ought never to make use of such an expression.               There is
no refuted opinion to which we may not recur, and again             examine.     Phi
losophy acknowledges      no authority   which    can proscribe it from admitting,
or forbid it to examine.     There are many other opinions, long ago refuted,
to which we ought still to recur ; for example, that of the transmutation cf
metals.     What chemist at present will dire to deny the polfibility of it ?
The     change of one metal into another ought to appear less difficult than
the   conversion  of the sweetest body (sugar) into the sourest (oxalic acid);
than the change of the hardest body (the diamond) into the softest (car
bonic acid gas); than the change of the most transparent (the diamond)
into the most opake (charcoal).        In the 19th century the transmutation of
metals will be generally known      and practised.       Every chemist, every artist
 will make gold ; kitchen utensils will      be  of silver,  and even gold, which
 will contribute more than any thing        else to  prolong life, poisoned at pre
 sent by the oxyds    of copper, lead, and iron, which we daily swallow with
 our food.     There will then be no other riches than natural licLes; the
 productions of the foil : artificial riches, such as gold, silver, and piper
 money, will vanish in rim hands of those who have accumulated them.
 What    a revolution  in socicrv !  Every enlightened chemist, however, will
 agree   with me, that this revolution       is not only probable, but at no great
 distance. — Vole of the Author.

354         Method of detecting Sulphur and Arsenic in Ore.
is the method which mankind have always employed when
they did not choose to see what was only too evident.                    It is
thus that phlogiston has been made to pass through crucibles,
and azot through tubes and retorts,
    I  shall here observe,     that to make       these experiments suc
ceed,     it is absolutely necessary that the water should contain
gas in solution, either oxygen gas or carbonic acid             gas.     The
more gas it contains, the sooner organised azot will            be formed
in it.
    It is much to be wished that chemists would examine with
attention what changes earths undergo by the oxygen which
they absorb by decomposing the steam of water,                   f have no
doubt that such an examination would lead to very important
discoveries.       These ideas    I submit    to the knowledge and cri
 ticism of the illustrious French           chemists   the editors    of   the
 Annales     de Chimie,    the fathers     of  the science  ; by   them      it
 was created.       Before them, chemistry was only            a  stiapeless
 mass    of facls, ill arranged    and still worse explained.

   J.   HE      torrefaction    or roasting of a mineral disengages
 and decomposes the arsenic and sulphur it contains: but the
 earth of the metal is calcined, and lays hold of a portion of
 the acid and the water; which increases its weight, so that
 no just estimate can be formed of the proportions of sulphur
 and arsenic which the mineral contains.               Besides, these two
 substances burn simultaneously          :  torrefaction, therefore, is not
 sufficient to afford any precision.
     The distillation of two parts of the vitriolic acid with one
  of the pulverised mineral, which contains sulphur and arsenic
  combined with metallic substances, furnishes the means of
  determining with precision the quantity of sulphur and arsenic
  they contain. There first passes over sulphureous acid, which
  arises from the decomposition of the metallic part *, and of
                                                                            the

 the phosphat    of lime than     is commonly found        in the bones
 of  quadrupeds,   &c.
    The different   bones also    of the   same fish were various     in
this respect;    and the bones about the head         of the skate only
differed from cartilage by containing         a moderate     proportion
of phosphat of lime.
    It is at present believed,   that phosphat,      with some sulphat
 of  lime, constitutes   the whole   of the  ossifying substance ; and
perhaps the formation of bone from cartilage depends only
on the phosphat of lime ; but whether this is the cafe or not,
it is fit that I should notice a third substance, which con
stantly occurred in the course      of my experiments.
    When human         bones or teeth, as well as those of qua
drupeds and lifh,     whether    recent or calcined, were exposed
to the action of acids, an effervescence, although at times
but feeble, was produced.         This circumstance at first I did
not particularly notice ; but the following experiments ex
cited my attention :
    After the phosphat of lime had been precipitated from the
solutions of various teeth and         bones    by   pure ammonia,       I
observed that a second precipitate, much smaller in quantity,
was obtained     by the addition   of carbonat of ammonia.         This
second precipitate dissolved in acids with much effervescence,
durin^ which carbonic acid was disengaged, and selenitc was
formed bv adding sulphuric acid. Moreover the solution of
this precipitate did not contain any phosphoric acid ; nor did
the liquor, from which the precipitate had been separated,
afford any trace    of it.
    This precipitate   was therefore    carbonat of lime; but     I still
was not certain that it existed as such       in  the teeth and bones.
    Although regular and comparative analyses of the bones of
different animals have not hitherto been made, yet by the
experiments of Messrs. Gahn, Scheele, Macquer, Fourcroy,
Berniard, and the Marquis de Bullion, it has been proved
that phosphat of lime is the principal ossifying substance of
bones in general, and that this is accompanied by a small
proportion of saline substances, and by sulphat of lime.
    I  was therefore   desirous to ascertain   whether the carbonat
of lime, which      I  had obtained by the above-mentioned ex
                                                             periments,

                     -   ob Shell aiid Bone.                            357
periments, had been produced from the sulphat of lime de
composed by the alkaline precipitant, or whether the greater
part had not existed in the bones in the state of carbonat.
     Each of the solutions in nitric acid afforded              a precipi
tate with nitrat    of  barytes  ; but the quantity of sulphuric acid
thus separated appeared by far too small to be capable -of sa
turating the whole of the carbonat of lime obtained from an
equal quantity of the solution.          To prove, therefore, the pre
sence    of  the carbonic acid, and the consequent          formation of
carbonat of lime, portions of           the   various teeth     and bones
were immersed        at separate times      in muriatic acid     ;  and the
gas produced was          received   in lime-water,    by which it was
 speedily absorbed, and a proportionate quantity of carbonat
 of lime was obtained.
     Although it    appears    that the principal effects during ossi
 fication are produced by the phosphat of lime, yet we here
 see that not only some sulphat, but also some carbonat of lime
 enters the composition       of bones ; and it is not   a   little curious
 to observe,    that   as the  carbonat of lime exceeds in quantity
 the phosphat of lime in crustaceous marine animals and in the
 egix-fliells of birds, so in bones it is vice versa.       It is possible,
 when many accurate comparative analyses of bones have been
 made, that some may be found composed only of phosphat of
 lime; and that thus shells containing only carbonat of lime,
 and bones containing only phosphat of lime, will form the
  two extremities of the chain.
      I shall now make a few remarks on the enamel               of  teeth.
      When a tooth, coated with enamel, is immersed in diluted
  nitric or muriatic acid, a feeble effervescence takes place, and
  the enamel is completely dissolved ; so also is the bony part ;
  but the cartilage of that part is left, retaining the shape of the
  tooth.     Or if a tooth, in which the enamel is intermixed
  with the bony substance, is plunged in the acid, the enamel
  and the bony part are dissolved in the fame manner as be
  fore ; that is to fay, the enamel is completely taken up by
   the acid, while the tooth, like other bones,             remains in a
  pulpy or cartilaginous        state,  having been deprived           of the
  ossifying   substance.     Consequently,     those  parts    which were
   coated   or penetrated     by lines of enamel are diminished in
                                                                  proportion

358                        Experiments and Observations
proportion to the thickness of the ,enamel which has beefl
thus dissolved ; but little or no diminution is observed in the
tooth *.
     Mr. Hunter            has noticed this         ; and, speaking of enamel,
feys,
          " when     soaked        in   a   gentle acid, there appears no gristly
or   fleshy part with which the earthy part had been incorpo
rated     f."
     Now when             the difference,         which      has been lately stated
between porcellaneous shell and mother-of-pearl, is consi
dered, it is not possible to avoid the comparing of these to
enamel and tooth.
  When porcellaneous shell, whole or in powder, is exposed
to the action of acids, it is completely dissolved without
leaving any residuum.
   Enamel is also completely dissolved in the like manner.
     Porcellaneous shell and enamel                     when burned emit little
or no smoke,          nor scarcely any smell of burned horn or car
tilage.
     Their      figure,    after having been exposed to fire, is not ma
terially changed, except by cracking in some parts; their
external gloss partly remains, and their colour at most be
comes gray, very different from what happens                         to mother-of-
pearl or tooth. In their fracture they have a fibrous texture;
and, in short, the only essential difference between them ap
pears to be, that porcellaneous shell consists of carbonat of
lime, and enamel of phosphat of lime, each being cemented
by a small portion of gluten.
     In like manner, ifthe effects produced by fire and acid
menstrua, on shells composed of mother-of-pearl,     and on
the substance of teeth and bone, are compared, a great simi
larity will be found for, when exposed to a red heat,
                               ;
    1    They smoke much, and emit smell of burned car
        ft,                                               a

luted nitric or muriatic acid,
                            they are dissolved without any apparent re
siduum; but when raspings. of tooth or bone arc thus treated, portions of
membrane or cartilage remain corresponding to the size of the raspings.

    3dly, The animal coal thus formed is of different incinera
tion.
    4thlv, They retain much of their original .figure, but the
membranaccous shells are subject to exfoliate*.
   ^thly, These substances, (pearl, mother-of-pearl, tooth, and
hone,) when immersed in certain acids, part with their har
dening or ossifying substances, and then remain in the state
of membrane or cartilage.
    6thly, When previoufly burned, and afterwards dissolved
in acids, a quantity of animal coal is separated, according to
the proportion of the gelatinous, membranaccous, or carti
laginous substance, and according to the duration of the red
 heat.
    And   lastly,   the acid solutions   of these substances,     by proper
precipitants, afford carbonat of lime in the one cafe, and phos-
 phat of lime principally in the other, in a proportion relative
 to the membrane or cartilage with which, or on which, the
 one or the other had been mixed or deposited.
     As porcellaneous       shell principally    differs from mother-of-
 pearl   only by      a relative   proportion between the carbonat of
 lime and the gluten, or membrane; in like manner the ena
 mel appears only to be different from tooth or bone by being
 destitute of cartilage, and by being principally formed df phof-
 phat of lime cemented by gluten.
     The difference in the latter cafe seems to explain why the
 bones and teeth of animals fed on madder become red, when
  at the fame time the like colour is not communicated to the
  enamel ; for it appears        probable that the cartilages, which
  form the original structure of the teeth and bones, become
  the channel by which the tingeing principle is communicated
  and diffused.
     These comparative experiments prove               that there is   a great
  approximation in the nature of porcellaneous shell and the
  enamel of teeth, and also in that of mother-of-pearl and
  bone ; and     if  a shell   stiould be found composed         of mother-
  of-pearl, coated by the porcellaneous substance, it will re
  semble a tooth coated by the enamel, with the difference of
  carbonat being substituted for phosphat of lime.
         * This is   a natural consequence aiising from their structure.
                            9                                            Some

 360                    Experiments and Observations
    Some experiments             on cartilaginous substances (which           I
 intended to have inserted             in this paper, but which I am
 prevented     from doing,         as they are  not as yet sufficiently ad
 vanced)   have in      a  great measure      convinced me, that mem
 branes and       cartilages     (whether destined to become bones by
 a natural process,        as  in young animals, or whether they be
come such by morbid ossification, as often happens in those
 which are aged) do not contain the ossifying substance, or
phosphat     of lime,        as  a   constituent principle.     I  mean by
this, that   I  believe the portion        of phosphat  of lime, found in
cartilaginous and hornv substances, to be simply mixed as an
extraneous matter; and that, when it is absent, membrane,
cartilage, and horn, arc most perfect and complete.
    The frequent      presence      of phosphat of lime in cartilaginous
substances,     is not    a  proof of its being one of their constituent
principles, but only that it has become deposited and mixed
with them in proportion to the tendency they may have to
form modifications of bone, or according to their vicinity
with such membranes or cartilages as are liable to such a
change. If horns are examined, few, I believe, will be found
to contain phosphat of lime in such a proportion as to be
considered     an essential ingredient.           I would not be under
stood to speak here           of  such   as  stag or buck- horn, for that
has every chemical character of bone, with some excess of
cartilage ; but I allude to those in which the substance of the
horn is distinctly separate from the bone, and which, like a
flieath, covers      a    bony protuberance which         issues   from the
os frontis of certain animals*.
    Horns of this nature,           such as those    of the   ox, the ram,
and the chamois,           also tortoise-shell, assord, after     distillation
and incineration,          so  very small a residuum,     of which only       a
small part is phosphat          of lime, that this latter   can scarcely be
regarded as a necessary ingredient.
    By some experiments made on 500 grains                 of the horn of
the ox, I obtained, after a long continued heat, only 1,50
grains of residuum ; and of this less than half proved to he
phosphat    of lime.
   * Nature   stems here to have mad* an an 'lysis, or separation of horn
from bone.
                                                                  78 Grains

                           on Shell and Bone.                              3<Ji
   78 Grains of the horn of the chamois afforded only 0,50
of residuum ; and 500 grains of tortoise-shell yielded not
more than 0,35 of a grain, of which                 less   than half was
phosphat of lime.
   Now, it     must be evident that so very small a quantity can
not influence the nature of the substances which afforded it ;
and the fame may be said of synovia, 480 grains of which
did not yield more than one grain of phosphat of lime.
   This    substance     is undoubtedly various in its proportions
in all these and other animal substances, arising, probably,
from the age and habit of the animal which has produced
them; but        I believe that I may at least venture to place
some    confidence in the foregoing experiments, as several
others, made since the above was written, have tended to
confirm them *.
   lathe      course  of making     the experiments      which have been
related,    I  examined the      fossil bones of Gibraltar, as well as
some glossopetræ, or shark's teeth.            The latter afforded phos
phat and carbonat of lime ; but the carbonat of lime was
visibly owing principally to the matter of the calcareous
strata which had inclosed these teeth, and which had insinu
ated itself into these cavities, left by the decomposition of the
original cartilaginous substance.
   The bones of the Gibraltar rock also consist principally of
lime, and the cavities have been partly filled by the carbonat
of lime which cements them together.
   Fossil    bones    resemble bones which by combustion have
been deprived       of their cartilaginous part; for they retain the
figure of the original bone without being bone in reality, as
   • These
              experiments were repeated on bladders, which      I chose in pre
ference to any other membrane, as not being liable to ossification, and
therefore likely to contain very little or no phosphat of lime.      250 grains
of dry hog's blaflder, after incineration, left a residuum, the weight of
which did not exceed 1- 50th of a grain.       This was dissolved in diluted
nitric acid ; and upon adding pure ammonia, some faint traces of phos
phat of lime were observed.     Now, as 150 grains of bladder did not afford
more than i-50th of a grain of residuum, of which only a part consisted
of phosphat of lime, there is much reason to regard this experiment as an
additional  proof  that the phosphat of lime is not an essential  ingredient  of
membrane.

 one of the most essential parts has been taken away. Now
 such fossil or burned bones can no more be regarded as
 bone, than charcoal can be considered as the vegetable             of
 which it retains the figure and fibrous structure.
    Bones which keep their figure        after  combustion resemble
 charcoal made from vegetables replete with fibre; and car
tilaginous bones which lose their shape by the same cause
may be compared to succulent plants, which are reduced              in
bulk and shape in a similar manner.
    From    these last experiments     I   much question     if bodies
consisting    of  phosphat    of lime, like bones,    have concurred
materially to    form strata of limestone or chalk    ; for it appears
to be improbable that phosphat is converted into carbonat of
lime after these bodies have become extraneous fossils.
   The destruction or decomposition of the cartilaginous parts
of teeth and bones in a fossil state must have been the work
of a very long period of time, unless accelerated by the action
of   some mineral      principle; for, after having, in the usual
manner,     steeped   in  muriatic acid the os humeri of a man
brought from Hythe in Kent, and said to have been taken
from a Saxon tomb, I found the remaining cartilage nearly
as complete as that of a recent bone.           The difficult destruc-
tibility of  substances    of  a somewhat     similar nature appears
also from the piercing implements formed of horn, which
are not unfrequently found in excavations of high antiquity.

 by steeping in water;         then, for a course of many weeks,
applied alternate exposure to the open air, and steeping or
boiling in alkaline lixivia, to bring all cloths of flax to perfect
whiteness.       It relates the manner of the applications of oxy
genated muriatic        acid in oxy-muriat of lime to abbreviate
 and perfect the bleaching process.           It lastly proposes, as the
cheapest and best of all modes of bleaching, the alternate use
of steeps of oxy-muriat of lime, and steeps of fulphurct of
lime, which in the course of ten days will bring green linen
 to a state of pure whiteness. We earnestly recommend this
treatise to general attention.

 OlNCE           our last report, several interesting papers by
Dt.   Herschel, on the subject of his late discovery respect
ing heat   and   light,  have been read.    Doctor Herschel, pur
suing his late discovery of what he calls the invisible heat-
making rays of the fun, has investigated, and experimentally
proved, that heat is occasioned by rays emanating from can-
dent substances ; and that these rays have a power of heating
bodies, and are subject to the laws of reflection and of refrac
tion.    The Doctor divides heat into six classes ; three of
which    are solar,    and three terrestrial.   On account of the
similarity between the former and the latter, he reduces his
subject to three general heads.        He treats in his first division
of  the heat   of the fun and of terrestrial flame ; in the second,
of the heat of prismatic rays and of red-hot iron ; and in the
third division, of the invisible heat-making rays of the fun,
and of terrestrial invisible or dark heat in general.

  A postscript by Mr. Howard to his paper on fulminating
oxyd of mercury, containing an account of some experiments
made with it at Woolwich; from which it appears, that 1 oz.
burst a shell which would have required 7 oz. of gunpowder;
and that half the charge of oxyd usually employed of gun
powder would burst any piece of ordnance.     A remarkable
property of this preparation          is,
                                that when fired with gun
powder the latter does not deflagrate.
   A paper,      by

his observations    appears, that its mountains bear the fame

proportion to its diameter as those of Venus and the Moon
do to theirs, and that the highest mountains are in its southern
hemisphere      ;   also, that its rotation on its axis      is   performed in
seventy-four hours.

  C. Jurine read lately   memoir on the monoculus ca/lor.
                                  a
Under this name the author includes the monoculi of which
Muller very improperly formed three species, viz. the Cy
clops, caruleus,       rubens,    and lacinulatus.          The    cceruleus     is
nothing else, indeed, than an old female of the rubetis and the        ;
character of the lacinulatus consists merely in foreign appen
dages, or   kind
             a     of infusion animals which often adhere to
this monoculus.    C. Jurine having successively reduced several
of these insects to state of asphyxy
                        a                means of by  few drops    a
of spirits thrown into the water which contained them, and
having revived them              by
                        adding new pure water, observed,
that  it  not the heart but the intestjnal canal which re
           is
tains longest its irritability, and resumes    the soonest.
                                                       it      The
female carries   her  eggs not in two clusters, like  the   greater
part of the other cyclops, but in large bag, which has
                                              a                                  a
little resemblance to the tail of the beaver.    from this    It   is
circumstance that the author gives to the above species the
                                                      name

 name of castor. The right antenna of the male has a hinge
 by means of which he lays hold of the threads that terminate
  the tail of   the female to force her to copulate.         When the
 two   sexes   copulate, they are in an opposite direction.
     C.  Cavier read a note on the fossil tapirs of France.          The
 author announced, that there are dug up in France the bones
 of two kinds of tapirs ; one of the size of the common tapir,
 which is no longer found alive in America, and the other of a
 size equal to that of the hippopotamus, and of which living
 individuals no where exist.        Both these kinds, like the common
 tapir, have teeth       (grinders) the summit of which is marked
 with two or       three transversal eminences or ridges that become
blunted with age. Among the animals known at present, there
is none but the lamanlin which participates in this character
with    the tapir.      The want of incisive and canine teeth, how
ever, and the form         of the jaw-bones of the lamantin, by no
means permit them to be confounded with those of the tapir.
The author has seen two considerable portions of the lower
jaw of the former, or small species, in the cabinet of C. Dree.
They were found on the last declivities of the Black Mountain,
 near the village of Islet, in the department of Herault, in a
 bed of coarse gravel.         They have no sensible difference from
the analogous parts of the common tapir.               In regard to the
large species, the author knows of four specimens: i. An
extreme grinder found in a ravine near           Vienne, in Dauphiny,
and described         and illustrated by a    figure in the Journal <U
 Phyjique     for   February 1773 '• 2- A considerable portion of a
grinder found by C. Gilet-Laumont at Saint-Lary, in Com-
minge : 3. The germ of a grinder without roots, preserved in
the National Museum of Natural History; and 4. The two
 halves of a lower jaw, containing each five grinders, but
 broken at both ends,         and consequently without     the inctsores
or canine      teeth, and without any determinate form.          It  may
 be easily seen that four      of these grinders have transversal emi
nences,      as   those  of  the  tapir; and that the one before        is
 alone flat at the top, and without any protuberance.                It is
 probable that the animal was not full grown, since it wanted
 the extreme grinder with three protuberances, and that the
 one next to     it had not     been  used.    From   the size  of  these
                                                                   teeth

     "  The Members of the British Mineralogical Society have
in view,     besides the     above,   another object of perhaps still
greater general importance.            In common with all other in
quirers into this most interesting department of natural his
tory, they have regretted the formidable obstacles to collect
ing    accurate   information in the mining districts, originating
from the vasiue' and peculiar terms in use among the miners,
and from the different ideas annexed to the fame terms in
different parts of the country.           They feel the impossibility of
introducing      a  scientific nomenclature       into the mines and col
lieries, and in consequence have arranged correspondences in
various parts for the purpose of collecting materials towards a
general explanatory dictionary of all the mining terms made
use of in the British islands.         The success of this plan, it is
obvious, depends essentially on the public concurrence; its
 advantage cannot be called in question, and therefore the
 Society requests with confidence the assistance of those gen
 tlemen who,         from their local situation, or other circum
 stances,    are able     to further   its execution,       and are willing
 that the whole science of mineralogy should be cleared from
 that confusion and' mystery in which it has been enveloped.
Besides lists and explanations of technical terms, the Society
wislies to be furnistied with specimens of such minerals as
 have received any names in the mines and collieries : with
 out the    possession   of specimens    it will be impossible to iden
 tify the substances so as       to aslign them their proper scien
 tific appellations; and these being deposited in the cabinet
 of the Society, will form a constant record and authority, to
 which the      most liberal access     will  at all times be allowed.

   "   The    consciousness   of contributing in their sphere to the
public good, and to the improvement of a favourite branch
of natural science, is the sole remuneration which the Mem
bers of the Society look forward to ; and they will esteem
the time and expense employed in the analysis of minerals
amply repaid, if those whom they have thus served will exert
their personal activity and influence among their workmen,
in furthering the execution of the above design, by the com
munication       of illustrative   specimens   and explanatory lists of
technical terms.

sponding      Members     a select  number of such persons, com
petently skilled in mineralogy, as may be zealous to affist its
views   ;  and that proprietors      of mines, who   have it much in.
their power to furnish such facts and specimens as are of
principal importance to the Society, shall be considered as
eligible to the class of corresponding Members ; all of whom,

                              GALVANISM.
    Mr. Carlisle     has lately made some interesting experiments
which     prove the identity of the electric and galvanic fluid.
A   number of plates of silver (fay, 40 or 50 crowns or half-
crowns) piled alternately with plates of zinc, with pieces of
wetted      pasteboard   between     each  to complete   the galvanic
chain,     will not only   give an electric sliock to the person who
touches the top        and bottom of the series, but continue to
give an uninterrupted stream of the electric fluid, which
being passed through water, decomposes it completely.                If
 gold, silver, or platina wire be employed to carry the electric
 matter into and from the water, both oxygen and hydrogen
 are liberated   3  but if oxydable    metals are employed, hydrogeu
 only.

teethit evidently appears, that the animal              to    which they   be
longed must in bulk have been equal at      least to the hippo
potamus,  or perhaps to the elephant. It is  not known where
these two portions of the jaw were found j they are in part
incrusted with sand.
   C. Lasteyrie, who is now travelling through the north of
Europe, has addressed a letter to the Society on the intro
duction of the fine-woolled breed of sheep into the cold coun
tries.    Near Leyden       and Haarlem,          in Holland,    he observed
that the climate,  though damp, does not prevent the breed
of the Spanish sheep from thriving. He saw the fourth ge
neration of these animals, bred in the country, which had as
fine wool  as the Spanish 'sheep, though both the soil and the
climate were in appearance very unfavourable to the constitu
tion of these animals. In another letter he fays he found the
fame success in Denmark and Sweden, and even in the most
northern parts of these two countries, where that breed have
existed for many years.   He mentions in particular, that the
Danish government,           two years ago,        sent for three    hundred
Spanish sheep, only one of which has died in the course of
that time notwithstanding the severe cold of the last winter.
   In    the annual sitting on the 10th            of January C.    Sylvester
made a report       of   the labours   of   the Society during the year.

               BRITISH      MINERALOGICAL SOCIETY.
   This Society      has just circulated the following           notice   of its
proceedings:
     "
     It is now some months since public notice was given of
the institution of the British Mineralogical Society ; one of
 the principal objects       of which       is,
                                         the gratuitous analysis of
such     of   our native minerals as may be sent to the Society by
mine-owners,        or other persons    who are interested in the in
quiry.   The Society's first meetings were necessarily much
 occupied in establishing arrangements for the most effectual
 attainment of its own designs and those of its correspondents.
Both     these objects have, we trust, been satisfactorily provided
     V91.VJ,                           3B                                  for;

37°                  British bfineralogical       Society.
 for;   and the number        of  specimens     sent to the Society for
 analysis,    evince   at the fame      time the utility of the scheme
and the public confidence.
    '* The
             Society consists of a competent number of members
in the habitual practice of chemical operations, each of whom
undertakes an analysis in rotation, (assisted, in cafes of pecu
liar intricacy, by a select committee,) the result of which,
after general approbation, is transmitted by the secretary to
the person who sent the specimen. Sincey however, several
of our correspondents, from inadvertence, have not complied
with the conditions mentioned in the circular letter of the
Society, we here repeat them, with the addition of some
others, and beg to have it understood that no analysis will be
undertaken where these are not complied with :
    " i. The whole of each specimen must be at least four
pounds weight, and in as few pieces as possible.                 The person
who sends the specimens, if more than one, mould break a
small piece from each, taking care to reserve and mark them
with the same numbers as those that he fends to the Society ;
because,     in the analysis returned to him, the different speci
mens will be distinguished by their numbers : the safest way
of marking each will be to write the number on a slip of
paper, and fix it on the specimen with gum-water.                      Every
piece   must    be  wrapped    in   paper,   and    packed  in   a  box with
saw-dust, addressed        (carriage paid) to        Mr. W. H. Pepys,
Poultry, London.
    "  a.  A paper    must accompany the specimens, stating their
provincial names ; the name            of the parish and county where
they are found      ; the  depth of the mine or quarry where they
are procured ; the general extent           and bearing of the vein or
stratum    towards the points of the compass; and the method of
procuring them, whether by blasting or by the pick-axe, &c.
    " 3. The Society also requests, that the metallic ores which
may be sent them for analysis may be accompanied with spe
cimens of the gangue or matrix in which they are found, and
of the superincumbent strata, with their respective depths and
                                                                        *
