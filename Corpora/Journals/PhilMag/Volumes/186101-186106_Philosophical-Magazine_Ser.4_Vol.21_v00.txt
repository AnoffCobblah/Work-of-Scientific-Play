Cauchy, and others have expended the greatest analytical power

   2. When a     spherical   body—or     a drop    of water—falls     upon
the surface of still water, a system of concentric and circular
waves are formed around the point of impact.              The foremost of
these waves   generally  exceeds the rest in     magnitude,      and being
                                                                                                                 it its

                                          depend upon the magnitude
of the body, and the height from which               fell. According    it                                        to

            and their relation to the Velocities                             of Currents.              3
drops succeed each other with sufficient rapidity, in short, if
they constitute a jet of water falling into the current, the suc
cessive waves will, by their intersection, give rise to a continuous
 series of points elevated above the general level of the liquid, and
forming a ripple more visible than the waves which it envelopes.
If we replace the jet by a solid cylinder, the effect will be essen
tially the same: the waves, it is true, may differ in form and
even in the velocity with which they are propagated; but, as
before, the ripple will be their envelope.      It is in this manner
that the    pebbles  and other  partially  immersed bodies on the
banks of a stream give rise to ripples whose forms, as we shall
see, indicate in every case the velocities of the adjacent parts of
the current. It is scarcely necessary to add that bodies moving
on the surface of still water produce precisely similar effects; the
ripples caused by boats and water-fowl are examples familiar to all.
    5. The relation between the form of the ripple and the velo
city of the stream may be easily determined without even know
ing the forms of the waves of which the ripple is the envelope.
Deferring this determination, however, to art. 10, let us first,
for the sake of completeness, consider the following question:—
    The initial form of a wave being known, through what varia
tions will it pass as it floats down a stream where the velocity
and direction of the current vary from point to point according
to a given law Z

methods        I
           found that the white disc, or aperture, was whitest in
the centre at certain velocities, and when the light was strong,
but that it was bluish when the light was moderate.     The fol
lowing was the order and character of the tints, reckoning from
the centre :—
                        White or bluish.
                        Darker blue.
                        White.
                        A dark ring, pretty well defined.
                        White.
                        Greenish yellow.
                        Reddish.
These colours vary, within certain limits, with the sensibility of
the eye and the intensity of the light. I have sometimes observed
the centre of the disc darkish blue, and sometimes yellow.           When
the velocity is great and the disc seen distinctly, there is not the
slightest trace of colour.
   Phenomena somewhat analogous to these may be seen in the
flame of a spirit-lamp, and in other flames, where the effect is
caused by the shooting up of the flame, which produces success
ive impulses on the retina.         At the top of the flame are seen
several curves,  convex   upwards,     like elongated parabolas.      They
are generally  of a sap   or  olive-green   colour;  and sometimes the
most brilliant red tints appear where the uppermost curve opens
at   its
       vertex, and leaves two lateral and almost parallel branches.
                                                                 of by

those portions of the retina are temporarily insensible to light.
   In order to see this phenomenon distinctly, we must employ
a large disc uniformly illuminated, such as a glass globe ground
on both sides, or a plate of ground glass. When the revolving
disc has a particular velocity, the illuminated surface will be
seen covered with the hexagonal pattern already mentioned; and
as the velocity diminishes, the pattern breaks up, exhibiting por
tions of circles and imperfect crosses, the exact forms of which
it is difficult to describe. In daylight, when the light of the sky
is used, the colours which accompany these phenomena are
better seen, and also the variations which they undergo in refer
ence to the foramen centrale of the retina, as described in a former
paper.
    When we maintain the revolving disc at that particular velo
city which produces the hexagonal pattern, so that the retina
may be greatly excited, a beautiful pattern of a very different
kind makes              its
                 appearance, occasionally mixing itself with the
first pattern, but most beautifully seen opposite the dark inter
vals between the slits    the disc when the velocity has become

quadrangles are separated by several parallel bright lines, it is
obviously produced by some structure in the retina itself; and
it is possible that it may arise from some regular arrangement
of the rods in the columnar or bacillar layer which has not yet
been detected by the microscope.
    The hexagonal pattern is very distinctly seen in the flame of
a coal or a wood fire, at that particular part of it where the jets
of ignited gas succeed each other at the proper interval.
    After making these experiments for some days in succession,
I  have found that the hexagonal pattern, and sometimes even the
quadrangular one, is seen when the eye is accidentally directed
to faintly illuminated surfaces.     This fact seems to show that
the pattern is rendered visible merely by the excitement of the
retina with the action of light, and not by     successive impulses,     its

THE        want of a
       rent resistance, and the great inconveniences thence arising,
especially in technical physics, suggested to me some years ago
the experiment I am about to describe.
    My original object was to procure for Jacobi's standards a
more general introduction into the arts.               soon found, how        I
ever, that this could not be effected without inconvenience.                On
one   occasion,  several of Jacobi's standards that            had  procured            I
were so entirely at variance with each other, and their actual re
sistances agreed so little with what they ought to have been,
that    Ishould have been obliged to have had recourse to Jacobi's
original measure, only that it was not then at my disposal.                                                 In
dependently of this, however, I became convinced that a stand
ard measure of resistance is only adapted for general use when
it is easily reproducible. Whether the resistance of a metal wire
is altered by time, by the shaking of transport, by the passage
of currents, or by any other cause, is not yet absolutely decided.
It     is,
         however, very probable that some such alteration takes
place, and         therefore altogether inadmissible
                   it  is                                       take the re                to

When R and r are nearly equal, the correction for the conical
form of the conductor, viz. the factor
differs little from unity; whence every tube not accurately cylin.

a Wheatstone's bridge.     As the bridge in question, in the form

part determined                by
                     Dr. Esselbach.    The method      pursued was                     he
as   follows:—
     Each end    the glass tube
                       of               tested was insertedto    be                                           ina
receiver, and retained there      means               by
                                               caoutchouc band.        of   a
This receiver was    placed that the unused neck projected up
                               so
wards, and      this position
                      in          was, together with the tube,
                                                      it
plunged into    trough filled with lumps
                      a                     ice.  One     these            of                        of
receivers was then supplied with clean dry mercury, which filled

  32                M. W.   Siemens on a new reproducible Standard
  the tube and ran through it into the other. By the time the
  mercury in the two vessels was at the same level, the tube was
  generally found free from air-bubbles.        Thick amalgamated
  copper wires were now inserted into the mercury through the
  top of the receivers, and the resistance of the tube was compared
  with that of one of Jacobi's standards by means of the bridge
  above described”.
     The resistance of the conducting rods was determined by
  plunging the amalgamated copper cylinder into a vessel filled
  with mercury.     It was found to be quite evanescent in compa
  rison with the resistance of the tubes.
     The experiments whose results are collected in the following
  Table were conducted as follows:–In the first position of the
  commutator, the slide B B was moved to such a position that,
  on lowering the contact lever I, the galvanometer exhibited no
  permanent deviation. The resistances to be compared were then
  changed by means of the commutator, and the slide was again
  adjusted. These two positions of the slide are given in the
  columns headed a and b.                    If
                              the observations were free from
 error, the sum of these magnitudes would be exactly 1000,
 which was generally the case, or very nearly so. We must here
 remark that, after establishing the equality of the currents, a
 small temporary deviation of several divisions, indicating a greater
 resistance on the part of the closely packed coils of Jacobi's
  standard, was observed immediately on completing the circuit.
 As on breaking the circuit an opposite deviation of the same
 magnitude resulted, this phenomenon was obviously to be attri
 buted to the extra current of the wire coil of the Jacobi's stand
 ard. It appeared, moreover, that on a long continuance of the
 current, the mercury in the tube began to grow warm, even
 though only a single cell of a Daniell’s battery was employed.
 On account of the slow oscillation of my mirror and the resist
 ance encountered by              its
                             prolongations, the error arising from this
 cause was    easily  eliminated              by
                                      allowing only short currents                to
 traverse the instrument.       The slide was always       placed that,so
 immediately         completing the circuit, there was slight move—
                       on                                              a

the windings of the tube.
   As mercury is not to be found in the list of metals the altera
tion of whose specific resistance by heat has been determined by
Arndtsen +, this deficiency had first to be remedied.    This was
effected  by Dr.  Esselbach,  by means of the  apparatus  already
described.   The resistance of one of the  spiral tubes was com
pared with that of the straight tube 2, first at the temperature
of ice-water, and then when the temperature of the spiral was
raised. If w represent the resistance of tube 2 (which according
to Table  III,is 4987), and w; the resistance of the spiral tube,
then, since the resistance of the conducting wires was rendered
equal for both tubes, and was equivalent to that of 11 cubes of-
mercury 1 millim. each way, we had
                                    wi-Hll_2
                                    w -- 11 T b”
where a and b represent the pieces of platinum wire of the bridge
when no current passed through the galvanometer.        This was
the case when

The temperature of the straight tube was now maintained at 0°
by means of melting ice, while the temperature of the water sur
rounding the spiral was raised. In the following Table, t indi

     It
      appears from this Table that the specific conducting power
of annealed silver wire is 10 per cent. greater than that of thc
same wire unannealed; that of annealed copper wire on the
average 6 per cent. greater.    The difference of conducting power
is especially great  in the case of brass.   As the density of wire
depends on the amount it has been stretched since the last heat
ing, that, as well as the conducting power, must vary much even
when the metal is perfectly uniform. The temperature to which
the wire was raised, the duration of the operation, and the
rapidity of the cooling,  affect        all              its
                                   specific conducting power.

a difference of polar pressures; and of the motion of a fluid, a
difference of maximum and minimum pressures; and similarly,
it is evident that the causes of the other mechanical motions are,
in fact, conditions of pressure.     Thus, rotation is the effect of
equal, a compound motion of translation and rotation of unequal,
differences of polar pressures in opposite directions with respect
to a line joining the points of application of each pair of polar
pressures.    It need hardly be said that it is not proposed that we
should use the phrase “differences of polar pressures” instead
of the term “forces.” But, preparatory to a mechanical considera
tion of physical and chemical motions, it seems of importance
clearly to see that, whatever force may be absolutely, whatever the
unknowable ultimate cause of motion may be, or have been, the
ordinary mechanical forces* called “a single force at the centre
of gravity,” “a couple,” and “a single force not at the centre of
gravity,” are, in fact, such conditions of pressure as above stated.
   3. Thus, as the cause of a mechanical motion               general, the                is,   in
                                            the pressures        of                              on

pressure under certain characteristic but interchangeable              con
ditions, and that, for instance, the movement             iron towards                of
magnet,         or                       paramagnetic  of

 But such discoveries as that the tangential force of a resisting
 medium is given in the very formulae of Encke's cometº, and
 that of inductive action through contiguous particles, and not at
 a   distancet, will,
                   it is believed, cause this first postulate of the
 theory to be generally granted f.
   5. To give distinctness to this idea of the parts of matter as
 mutually repulsive, a molecule, or a body (an aggregate of mo
 lecules), is conceived                   as a centre of lines                 of pressure; the lengths
 and curves               of               by the relative pressure
                               these lines are determined
 of the lines they meet;  and lines from   greater, are made up of
 lesser molecules and their lines, and so on ad infinitum.
    In speaking of a molecule or body as such a centre of pres
 sure,       it will            to have a technical name.
                           be convenient                         Rather
 than coin a new term, it is proposed to use “atom * in this
 sense.   In chemistry I shall use the term “equivalent * exclu
 sively, and not, as at present, as more or less synonymous with
 “atom,” which                      I
                      have thus ventured to appropriate for a new
 conception.     Atoms, or mutually determining centres of lines
 of pressure,  may   also be defined, and their relations analytically
investigated, as mutually determining elastic systems with cen
 tres of resistance.
    6. This is the fundamental conception (not hypothesis) of the
theory.    What can at present be called hypothetical in the
theory, is this only—that the application of analysis to the con
                                                                                                                as all
ception of elastic systems with such conditions, will in            cases
give results corresponding with phenomena.           An atom,      above

 spirit of such remarks as these:–“What we really want is not
 a variety of different methods of representing the forces, but the
 one true physical signification of that which is rendered apparent
 to us by the phenomena, and the laws governing them.        Of the
 two  assumptions   most  usually  entertained at present, magnetic
 fluids and electric currents, one must be wrong, perhaps both are.
 . . . . It is evident, therefore, that our physical views are very
 doubtful; and                          I
                    think good would result from an endeavour to
 shake ourselves loose from such preconceptions as are contained
 in them, that we may contemplate for a time the force as much
 as possible                 in     its     purity*.”

ment of the idea of the tension of atoms as above defined. Hence
it                 not a mediate, mechanical conception of the
     is an immediate,
phenomena; for the conceptions of atoms or of centres of lines
of pressure are not hypotheses, but convenient forms of the
general conception of the parts of matter as mutually repelling.
And the ground of the theory is this, that if matter is so com
ceived, experimental     facts may themselves at once, and with
out the aid of   hypothetical    virtues or aethers, be mechanically .
conceived.     For the    theory   has arisen from finding that the
more simply facts were worded the clearer expressions they
became of the general laws of motion; and that hypotheses
only obscured the meaning and necessity of the relations of
phenomena.       It should therefore seem to be here sufficient
briefly but clearly to express the conception of tension in                                                   its

conception as a true generalization by which mechanical principles
can be immediately applied to the phenomena of induction, it
may be remarked that, as the full proof of such a conception
depends on an experimentally based, and analytically expressed,
mechanical theory of the constitution of bodies, it is only sur
prising that, while so little has been done towards the establish
ment of such a theory, the general conclusions of researches on

repulsion of the body.                      Molecular and bodily motion, or resist
ance thereto, are inversely as each other.    Hence, if a force has
more effect in producing molecular displacement in one body
than in another, the difference will be seen in a tendency to repel
this second body, the reaction of which will evidently urge the
first towards the centre of force.

effect  of differential molecular action, that a better conductor
will, in moving in the direction of least resistance, pass to a
stronger place of action.
   The above conclusions are Faraday's*; but the theorem and
corollary as generalizations rest also on the facts adduced by
Ampère and his successors in support of his helix-theory of the
magnet.
   A third most important class of facts by which the view here
given of the mechanical conditions of the electric motions of
bodies may be supported, is the disposition of iron filings about
one or more electrified wires or magnets in various positions,
and the information given by a moving wire as to magnetic
forces.
   26. The fundamental importance of the conceptions of a force
as, in general, a difference of pressures, and of polar attraction
and repulsion as the effect of a differential molecular action, has
induced me to give such disproportioned length to their illustra
tion, that it will be impossible within the brief limits of this
paper to do more than note the other chief points of this general
theory.
    What, therefore, has to be said on (B) (3) the effects of
electricity as manifested in motions of the medium, must be
referred to the paragraph on the correlation of forces.
    27. There will not, it is hoped, be thought to be presump
tion in offering new views in theories which have been elaborated
with such admirable genius as those of light and heat; for the
most strenuous supporters of the present form of the undulatory
theory candidly admit that “there undoubtedly are several
 classes of phenomena which the wave theory has not merely
failed to eaglain, but which are apparently at direct variance with
its principlest.”
   It will be evident that the chief new view necessitated by this
general   theory (and which alone can be here noticed) resolves
itself into a theory of the connexion of the elastic medium with
the vibrating molecules in         Now, though according
                                       it.                      the             to
present theory “it certain that light
                       is                 produced     undulations

                             But the theory here proposed implies
such “laws    of  connexion.” For                its

pressure from molecules of the size to give by their vibrations
the sensations of light and heat.
   It would seem that this conception of the “aether” leads to
the explanation of more than one difficulty in the established
theory; but nothing can, of course, be advanced on such a point
except as the result of analysis.
                                                           I
   It will be understood that thus speak of the conception of
atoms, as above defined, as a mode of conceiving the “aether” of
the undulatory theory, only in order to make clear the applica
tion to that theory of the fundamental conception of the general
theory here proposed; and that this in nowise contradicts what
has been above said as to the seeming needlessness of hypotheses
of special fluids, or aethers, acting on, or through, matter.
    28. A general chemical theory is made up of two—a theory
of the constitution, and a theory of the combination, of bodies.
As to the constitution of bodies, the principal views here offered
are:—Bodies are conceived as states of dynamic molecular equi
librium, that           statesis,   as
                                   molecular motion  of     which, while                    is in

equal.     Hence, their differences are conceived         resulting from                  as
different conditions       molecular motion; and thus specific heat

                          Principles of the Science of Motion.                                 53
   29. The combination of bodies, in whatever way it takes
place, and not confining the meaning to the formation of salts”,
is conceived as the establishment of a new state of dynamic
equilibrium          f.
                Hence there must necessarily be definite laws of
chemical combination.
   But as it is proposed to give the outlines of this mechanical
theory of chemistry in a future paper or papers, it is unneces
sary to enter more fully upon it at present.      A theory so im
portant has been introduced in a paper in which it must be so
inadequately expressed, only to complete the general outline of
the science of motion, and because a mechanical theory of
chemistry is the necessary complement of the above-given
mechanical theory of electricity.
   30. In such a theory of forces as that here proposed, the
great experimental truth of the “correlation of forces”f assumes
an axiomatic clearness.   Especially is it to be noted that it gives
an account of the difference of the correlation between electricity
and magnetism, and that of either of these with light, heat, &c.
The former is a correlation of coexistence, the latter of change
of   conditions.
     If Ihave been successful in making clear the conceptions
offered in this theory of electricity and magnetism           and of
induction, it will be unnecessary here to say anything further
of this correlation of coexistence; for it is implied in the concep
tion of induction    as a mechanical effect varying with resist
ance, and manifested at right angles to a longitudinal or trans
verse (spiral) line of tension, that            is,
                                                    if of
                                           permanent (not alterna
ting) molecular displacement.      And    electricity    permanent,     is  a
light     alternating, molecular displacement, their correlation
         an                                                                                    is

   But not only      the correlation thus clear

     Here  it will be observed that the liquid followed the same law
 of descent   as that of the preceding experiment.
     Reducing the coke filter to the same thickness and diameter
 of orifice as in the case of the charcoal filter, we find, under the
 same circumstances of pressure, &c., the filtering power of the
 charcoal to be 3} times that of the coke.

   Here an increase of temperature from 50° to 90° caused the
rate of discharge to be increased 1707 times, a result nearly
coinciding with that determined for the charcoal filter. At 100°
temperature the rate of discharge is a little more than double the
rate at 50°. These results further show that, for equal volumes
of discharge, the decrements of time are for the most part propor
tional to the increments of temperature.
    The following experiment was made to determine the rates of
filtration of different liquids as compared with that of water.

   The filter used in this experiment was charcoal; and the
liquids compared were distilled water, and three different solu
tions of carbonate of soda. Solution No. 1 contained 2 per cent.
of carbonate of soda; No. 2 contained 4 per cent. ; and No. 3
contained 8 per cent.; that is to say, the per-centage of the salt
in these different solutions were in the geometrical progression
2, 4, 8. The discharge in each case was produced under the
pressure of a column of 9.2 inches of the liquid.

   Here it will be observed that the rates of discharge are very
nearly in geometrical progression. This property of filtration is
analogous to that of absorption, as shown in connexion with ex
periments XI. and XII. Thus it appears that the chemical com

     The near coincidence                        of the results in the third and fourth
columns shows that in this case the rate offiltration varies directly
as the pressure upon the filter.
   With a double filter the rate of discharge was found to be
reduced to one-half very nearly; and with a filter of ºths of an
inch diameter, that                      is,

probably the internal gradation of density chiefly results, as in
a body subject to the influence of electricity by induction.    a                  If
closed circuit of any metal be heated at any point, currents,
according to this theory, will be generated in consequence of the
different degrees of expansion of the metal at different points,
and, flowing in opposite directions, will neutralize each other if
they be equal.    But if by any mechanical means they be made
unequal, as by contortions of the metallic circuit, a galvanic
current should result, as is found to be the fact by experiment.
When the circuit is formed by two metals soldered together at
their extremities, and heat is applied at one of the positions of
junction, inequality of the opposite currents might be expected
to arise from difference of the capacity of the two metals for
generating currents, owing to difference of their atomic constitu
tion; and accordingly it is found that under these circumstances
a galvanic current is produced.           I
                                    proceed now to the theory of
magnetism.
  3.   In the preceding        theories       the generation     of secondary
aetherial  currents has been ascribed to a disturbance of the
atomic condition of bodies by external agency,        in electricity, by
friction; in galvanism, by the mutual molecular actions of dis
similar substances in contact; and in thermo-electricity, by
heat.   In the theory of magnetism it must be assumed that
there are substances in which a gradation of interior density
exists independently and permanently,–that         iron, for instance,
is found in this state in nature; that the same state may be
induced in steel by mechanical means, with different degrees of
permanence ; and that it may be momentarily induced in soft
iron. Also it must be supposed that the direction of the grada
tion of density depends on the form of the magnetized body.
These suppositions rest immediately        on facts of experience, the
 explanations of which, since they relate to qualities of the bodies,
 and not to the agency by which magnetic phenomena are pro
 duced, are not now under consideration.

 form of a long rectangular parallelopiped, and                let

 investigation            of

 having separate origins and interfering courses. The following

 that which would                   beeither stream flowing separately.

  end of the needle is consequently urged towards the east.         As
  the actions on the opposite halves of the needle are equal and in
 contrary directions, the total effect is simply a motion of rotation,
 and the north end of the needle deviates towards the west, the
 direction of the galvanic current being from south to north.
        If
       the direction of the current be reversed, the circular stream
 passes across the magnet from west to east, and consequently by
 the same reasoning as before, the north portion of the needle is
 urged eastward, and the south portion westward.      It is clear that
 the directions of the deviations of a needle above the current are
the opposite to those of a needle below, the direction of the
effective parts of the circular streams being opposite.
   This directive action of the galvanic current vanishes when the
axis of the needle is transverse to the direction of the current.
If the current acts simultaneously with the earth’s magnetism,
the needle must take a position intermediate to the transverse
                                                                                                    -
position and the plane of the magnetic meridian.
        All    these inferences              from the theory are in accordance with
 well known results of                experiment.
   10. The curvilinear paths of the atherial streams in the above
theory of the magnet, correspond to Faraday’s lines of magnetic
force, and points of greater or less velocity correspond to points
of greater or less magnetic intensity.
   11. The explanation of the reciprocal action of magnets on
galvanic currents on the same principles appears to be as follows.
In the case first supposed, the magnet being under and parallel
to the galvanic current, let the electrode be moveable about a
vertical axis, and the magnet be fixed.     Then the moving force
which urges the magnet when moveable, reacts upon the circular
current, and disturbs         uniformity.its     has been previously
                                                                   It
argued that the circular movement         necessary for maintaining
                                                           is
the  galvanic  current,     preventingby                    its
                                            flowing towards the axis
of the electrode.    Hence under this disturbance there will be                                a
tendency         of                the parts towards which the flow
                                     is to
              the fluid   rush                   to

is,of

impetus, being unopposed, will cause the electrode             deviate              to
towards the east. Like considerations would show that the
south portion              of
                    the electrode     made        deviate towards the

west.          Thus the magnet and electrode will have the                     scºme relative
positions        as
             when the former was moveable. Similar explanations
may      given

        MY DEAR SIR,                     December, 1860.
Yoº        will probably be interested to hear about a very direct
         application of physical science to a purpose of considerable
practical importance, which I had lately occasion to make. Having

THE“On    following
                the
                     communications were read:—
                    Insulating Properties of Gutta Percha.”    By Flee
ming Jenkin, Esq.
    The experiments described in this paper     were undertaken with the
view of determining the resistance opposed by the gutta-percha
coating of submarine cables at various temperatures to the passage
of an electric current.
    The experiments were made at the works of R. S. Newall and Co.,
Birkenhead. The relative resistance of the gutta percha at various
temperatures was determined by measuring the loss on short lengths
immersed in water. These experiments are described in the first
part of the paper. The absolute resistance of gutta percha has been
calculated from the loss on long submarine cables. These experi
ments and calculations are described in the second part of the
paper.
                                    PART I.
    The loss of electricity was measured upon three different coils,
each one knot in length.       One was covered with pure gutta percha;
the two     remaining   coils were covered with gutta percha and Chat
terton's    compound.     The coils were kept at various temperatures
by being covered with water in a felted tub; and the water was main
tained at a constant temperature for twelve or fourteen hours before
 each experiment.
    The loss or current flowing from the metal conductor to earth
through the gutta-percha coating was measured on a very delicate
sine-galvanometer.       The loss from the connexions when the cable
was disconnected, was measured in a similar manner. The electro
motive force of the battery employed was on each occasion measured
in the manner described by Pouillet. Corrections due to varying
electromotive force and loss on connexions were made on the result
 of each experiment.
     A remarkable and regular decrease in the loss was observed for
 some minutes after the first application of the battery to the cable;
 a phenomenon, which the author thinks may be due to the polariza
 tion of the molecules of gutta percha, or of the moisture contained
 in the pores of the gutta percha. The loss was therefore measured
 from minute to minute for five minutes, with each pole of the
 battery.
     Nineteen tables containing the results, with the reductions and
 curves representing the results, accompany the paper. The following
 results were obtained from the first coil; this was prepared with
 Chatterton's patent compound.          With a negative current between
  the limits of 50° and 80° Fahrenheit, the decrease of resistance is
  sensibly constant for equal increments of temperature;        and the
  increase of resistance due to continued electrification is also nearly

76                                Royal Society         :-
constant.     At 60° the resistance increases about 20 per cent. in five
minutes from this cause.       With a positive current, similar results
appear between the temperatures of 50° and 60°; but the resistance
is somewhat greater than with the negative current. The extra
resistance due to continued electrification is unchanged by a change
in the sign of the current.       Above the temperature of 63° great
irregularities occur in the observations, which could not even be
included in regular curves. The difference in the resistance of the
gutta-percha coating when the copper is positively and negatively
electrified, may be caused by the contact between the resinous com
pound and the copper : no such difference was observed when pure
gutta percha was in contact with the copper.
    The curves resulting from the experiments on the second coil,
which was covered with pure gutta percha, present an entirely dif.
 ferent character from those resulting from the first coil. The copper
 and gutta percha were of the same size in these two coils. The re
 sistance of pure gutta percha at low temperatures is greater than
 that of the compound covering. At 65° the resistance of the two.
 coverings is equal; at higher temperatures the resistance of pure
 gutta percha diminishes extremely rapidly. The curves obtained
 with positive and negative currents are identical up to about 75°; a
 slight difference occurs above this temperature, which may have been
 accidental. The extra resistance is less with pure gutta percha than
 with the compound; it increases slightly at high temperatures, and
 is not affected by a change in the sign of the current.
    The curves derived from the experiments on the third coil, which
 contained a smaller proportion of Chatterton's compound than the
 first coil, appear in some respects intermediate between those derived
 from the first and second coils.      The extra resistance due to con
 tinued electrification was still greater in this coil than in the others.
 40 per cent. of the entire resistance is at 70° due to this cause.
 This increase is believed to be due to the greater mass of gutta
 percha used in covering this coil, which was of larger dimensions
 than the two others.

   Professor Thomson has supplied an equation expressing the law
which connects the resistance of a cylindrical covering, such as that
of a cable, with the resistance of the unit of the material forming the
covering.

   The values of G for the covering of the Red Sea cable, after con
tinued electrification for periods of one, two, three, four, and five
minutes, were calculated in Thomson's Absolute British Units, from
four sets of tests made specially for this purpose on four different
cables, each about 500 knots long. Tables containing the results of
these calculations accompany the paper.
   A Table is also given of the resistance of the Red Sea covering
after one minute's electrification, and after five minutes' electrification,
at each degree of temperature, from 50° to 75° Fahrenheit.             This
Table was formed     by means of the     temperature   curves described in
the first part of the paper: this Table is here annexed (No. 1).
   Similar Tables were given for the covering of the two experimental
coils mentioned in the first part of the paper. The coil composed
of pure gutta percha, gave very regular and complete results. An
abbreviation of the Table is annexed.
   It was remarked that in the tests of the cable in the iron tanks,
the resistance after five minutes' electrification was invariably
greater with zinc than with copper to cable, whilst the reverse was
the case with the single knot covered by water. The length of the
cable, and the condition of immersion or non-immersion, have pro
bably some influence on the phenomenon of extra-resistance. This
phenomenon appears to the author to be of much importance, and
to demand further investigation.
   The values of G were also calculated from the daily tests of the
cables during manufacture at many temperatures.               These values
agreed with those given in the Tables above described. The general
results of the experiments may be summed up as follows.
   The relative loss at various temperatures through pure gutta
percha has been pretty accurately determined for                   all
                                                              ordinary tem
peratures.    To less extent the same knowledge has been gained
                 a
concerning two other coatings containing Chatterton's compound.
The latter appears superior        high, and inferior
                                  at                      low temperatures.

   Attention has been drawn         the considerably increased resistance
                                   to
which follows the continued electrification              of
                                                      gutta percha and                 its
compounds.      Some      of
                           the laws     ofthis extra resistance have been
determined, and some suggestions made                as   to

 be  used, which consider gutta percha          as conductor

IN      a communication to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, on

        the 3rd of January, 1859, related some experiments on
the vibrations of metallic bodies and of carbon, produced by the
passage of electricity through them f.                            I
                                                  learned soon after,
from a    paper  by  Dr. Tyndalli,   that these vibrations had been
already described by Dr. Page of the United States §. The
 analogy of the experiment to that of Mr. Trevelyan, on the
 vibrations of metallic bodies by heat, led me to suspect that the
 resistance to the propagation of heat in the first case, and of
 electricity in the second, in                 its
                                       passage from the one        the                          to
 other   of the bodies    contact, was the cause
                           in                            sensible me       of   a
 chanical repulsion.                So
                             strongly was persuaded         this, that

82                        Prof.         J.   D. Forbes on the Repulsion                           of
phenomena     founded on the familiar laws of conduction and ex
pansion alone.     Dr. Tyndall thinks that the effects of electri
city are also to be ascribed to the indirect action of the heat which
it   produces,in the way of expansion.   I have never been satisfied
with either of these explanations. The conviction to which I
still hold is that the alleged expansion and contraction cannot
sensibly operate in the almost infinitely short periods of succes
sive contact and separation, and that the effect must be due to
a molecular impulse of a far more sudden and instantaneous
characterº. We seem to be sufficiently conversant with such im
pulses in galvanic, and especially in secondary induced currents.

upon itself, and upon the different portions of one and the same
conductor conveying              one           it,

84              Trof. J. D. Forbes on   the Repulsion  of
of the horseshoe were adjusted by moving it on the pasteboard
shelf until simultaneous contact of the two limbs with the fixed
wires was obtained on moving the graduated head of the torsion
wire A from right to left. The completion of the current was
effected without much difficulty by gently pressing the rough
extremities of the wires into contact by the help of the torsion
head.
    I  found it convenient to increase the tension of the current
by introducing into the circuit an ordinary electrodynamic coil
of stout wire, with or without a core of iron wires.
    So far from finding anything like repulsion of the moveable
horseshoe on the continuation of the circuit, I soon observed
that attraction took place, resisting the force of twist of the
platinum wire exerted through a considerable arc, when it tended
to produce separation.       This attraction continued to subsist even
after the current was withdrawn.
    With a horseshoe composed of two straight limbs, a and b, of
bismuth, the connexion c being of copper, a still more decided
attraction was the result; and it continued to subsist after with
drawing the current of electricity, even if only one of the poles
touched the horseshoe.
    When the terminals P, M were somewhat flatly rounded (as
in fig. 6a), and the extremities of the horseshoe also carefully
rounded and polished,      I was unable to obtain electrical contact
by the pressure due to mere torsion. The current did not pass
until the extremities were touched with nitrate of mercury and
wiped dry, when it passed readily; and a marked adhesion took
place while the current lasted, and for some time after it stopped.
While the electricity passed, a fizzing noise was audible from the
extremities of the wires. This might possibly be due to an          in
 sensible vibration.     It thus appears that the irregularitics of
 surface of the wires at the points of contact in the first form of
 the experiment was favourable to the electrical propagation, as
 it is in the case of ordinary frictional electricity.
     A current from a very powerful Ritchie's induction coil, ex
 cited by four pairs of Grove’s, was next passed through the ap
 paratus last described. Distinct adhesion took place of the ends
 in contact, opposing a force amounting to 90° or more of tor
 sion. It continued while the current passed, and for some time
 after. By and by they separated through the effect of torsion.
     This experiment was very instructive. If it commenced when
 the terminations were a little apart, the high-tension electricity
 passed readily in the form of sparks from P and N to the horse
 shoe—the horseshoe steadily approaching—the sparks getting
 shorter and finally vanishing at both contacts, the attraction
 continuing and facilitating electrical contact.       Apparently the

                        a Rectilinear Electrical Current on itself.                                    85
  very same process, of polarity preceding conduction, obtains in
  the ordinary galvanic current.
     The form of the terminals P, N was again altered to a ham
  mer-shape, as in fig. 6 b ; and now electrical contact with the
  copper horseshoe was even more difficult to obtain than before.
  Though for intensity eight pairs of Grove's battery and a coil
  were used, the current did not pass without amalgamation, and
  also decided pressure being used; then the adhesion became
  strong, amounting to 140° of torsion of the suspending wire.
     A similar result was obtained when the current was passed
 from one of the hammer-shaped poles A (fig. 7) through a
  straight wire B, laid on the torsion-rod and terminating in a
  small trough of mercury C, connected with the opposite pole of
 the battery.       The adhesion and other phenomena were in                                            all
 respects the same                as
                             before.

                   it            doubted that these experiments are far

Mr. Pepys's gigantic single galvanic pair    at the London Institu
tion—cones of     mercury   rose over the general  level of the fluid
and above the polar wires*. Even Mr. Faraday has failed in re
peating the experiment, which is remarkable since, though he
only used 100 pairs, the electromotive power of modern batteries
vastly exceeds that of those used in Davy's time, and the suc
cess with Pepys's apparatus shows that intensity is not indispen
sablet.    Mr. Faraday thinks that Davy's cones and Ampère's
repulsion experiment are due to one and the same cause.          But
I incline to believe that Davy's cones intimate an attraction, and
not repulsion, and so                   far
                             concur with the results      my experi                  of

           Fourth Member of the Calcium group of Metals.                  87
 one blue line%, situated between the lines Sr 8+ and K S, about
twice as far from the former as from the latter. In brightness
 and sharpness of definition it is quite equal to the line Sr 8.
The method which, after repeated trials, we found most advan
 tageous for obtaining it in a state of comparative purity is the
 following. The deposit formed by boiling the water was dissolved
in hydrochloric acid, and a small quantity of sulphuric acid added
to the clear solution. The precipitate formed, consisting prin
 cipally of sulphate of calcium, but containing some sulphate of
 barium, sulphate of strontium, and sulphate of the metal under
 consideration, was collected, washed, dried and fused with car
 bonate of sodium. The fused mass was then boiled with water,
 and the insoluble carbonates of the above-named metals collected
 and treated several times successively in the same manner as the
original deposit.      By these means the lime was gradually re
 moved, the carbonates becoming proportionally richer in barium,
&c. Owing to the small quantity of substance at our command,
we did not attempt to remove the lime entirely. The carbonates
finally obtained were once more dissolved in hydrochloric acid,
and the solution, after considerable dilution, mixed with a few
drops of sulphuric acid.       After standing at rest for twenty-four
hours, the slight quantity of deposit formed, consisting of almost
pure sulphate of bariumi, was filtered off, and some alcohol added
to the filtrate, by which a further deposit was obtained, com
posed chiefly of the sulphates of strontium and the new metal,
though not quite free from sulphate of calcium. These sulphates
were again converted into carbonatés, which were then dissolved
in hydrochloric acid, and the solution evaporated to dryness.
When a portion of this dry residue was brought into the flame
of the apparatus, the spectra of calcium and strontium appeared;
and, in addition, beyond the line Sr 8, in the position indicated
above, a blue line, rivalling the strontium-line in brilliancy and
distinctness of outline.
    As far as we have been at present able to ascertain, the car
bonate, oxalate, and sulphate of the new metal are insoluble in
water, the last-named possessing about the same insolubility as
sulphate of strontium. The chloride of the metal does not seem
to be hygroscopic, resembling in this respect that of barium
rather than those of strontium and calcium.
   * Having been unable to separate it completely from calcium and stron
tium, we are not quite positive whether or not it gives any lines at the red
end of the spectrum.
   t  In our last communication there is a typographical error, Sry being
put for Sr 8.

of space, there would      seem to be no reason why a magnet should
not move various substances as an electrified body does.               In the
one  case,  as in the other,  variation of  pressure  is produced,    accord

that an electrified body acts indifferently on many kinds of sub
stances, whilst a magnet acts in a special manner on certain sub
stances, which from this peculiarity have been named magnetic :

hydrodynamical considerations, that converging and diverging
streams impress upon them the same moving forces, if the velo
cities be the same, and the degree of convergency be equal to
that of divergency; but the forces will be in opposite direc
tions with respect to the course of the streams. Hence, under
those circumstances, if one magnetic pole be attractive, the
other will be attractive also, and in the same degree. This
result experience confirms.
    21. If   a bar of bismuth be suspended either horizontally or
vertically between the poles of a magnet, it is found to be im
pelled in the directions of the lines of motion from the poles.
The action is therefore opposed to that which results from va
riation of density of the aether.        The same effect took place when
the bismuth was broken into          very small pieces. Also it appeared
that two pieces of bismuth subject to the action of magnetic
 streams, exerted no influence on each other; that                        se               is,   no
condary streams were generated.             From these facts         must              it             be
 concluded theoretically, that convergent and divergent magnetic
 streams, when they enter bismuth and substances                    the same           of

with which it conducts galvanic currents. Iron and bismuth,
which are not good conductors of galvanism, present very dif
ferent phenomena, in consequence, probably, of a great degree
of fixity of their atoms, by reason of which, and of atomic ar
rangement and constitution, the magnetic streams permeating
them may be so modified as to become respectively attractive
and repulsive. A bar of copper, when first acted upon by the
magnetic streams, begins to move as if it were a magnetic body,

from point to point of the streams.             But quickly        atoms, on                 its

induction of magnetism will be greater, the more directly the
primary stream flows through the bar, as is known to be the case
by experiment.
     26. When a coil of wire in the form of a helia surrounds a
cylinder of soft iron, and a galvanic current is sent through the
wire, magnetism is found to be induced in the iron. This fact
is explained by the theory as follows. The turns of the helix
being supposed to be very little apart, each turn will be nearly
 in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder. Hence the
 circular motions, which, according to the theory of galvanism,
 take place about the wire, will be very nearly in planes passing
 through that axis. Suppose the course of the current to be
 from the end B towards the end A of the cylinder, and the
 turns of the helix to proceed from the left hand, over the cylin
  der, to the right hand of a person looking from B towards A.
  Then, since the circular motion about any portion of an elec
  trode in which the current is conceived to flow parallel to the
  earth’s axis from south to north is always in the direction of
  the earth's rotation, it follows, in the case supposed, that if the
  circular motion within the cylinder be resolved into parts par
                                              A,its
  allel and perpendicular to        axis, the former will             the               all    be   in
  direction from        towards
                           B          and the latter will    very  nearly
  destroy each other. Thus the result will          longitudinal stream

due to the earth's rotation, it may be asserted that the gyratory
motion is transferred without alteration through space with the
earth.    It may not be that the motion of a given particle of the
fluid remains the same; but the motion is constantly the same
in positions which in successive instants are the same relative to
the earth’s centre and equatorial plane.               Coexistent with the
gyrations of the aether, motions of translation must be impressed
upon   it, having constant relations           the earth’s motion. With

  The terrestrial streams probably circulate, those which issue
nearly perpendicularly to the earth's surface in the antarctic
regions, after rising to great heights, turning back in curved
courses distant from the earth, so as to enter again                                             nearly      per
pendicularly in the arctic regions. To this circulation must be
added that spoken of in art. 27, which conspires with the ant
arctic streams and opposes the arctic, and thus probably accounts
for the observed excess of antarctic magnetic intensity.

tion of these motions, it must be concluded, in conformity with
what is said in art. 28, that there is no perceptible effect from
motion of translation of the atoms relative to the aether.
   34. The terrestrial streams will be disturbed by the streams
due to the gyratory motion about the sun, and the direction and
amount of the resultant, at a given place, of the combination of
the solar and terrestrial streams, will vary with the time of day.
Hence there will be a diurnal variation of magnetic intensity, as
is also known from observation.      The epoch of maximum                                             in
tensity will depend in part on the position of the place relative
to the magnetic poles.
   35. The amount of the variation of intensity on a given
day will depend on the sun’s declination, and therefore will be
subject to an annual variation, being in north latitudes greatest
at the summer solstice, and least at the winter solstice.             These
results are confirmed by observation.
   It may deserve to be considered whether the magnetic                                               in
tensity is sensibly affected by currents which must be produced
in the atmosphere by solar heat, setting in                directions from      all

a set of maxima prevailing in hours of the night, and another
set in hours of the day, and that the directions of the deviations
of the needle in the two cases would be opposite, the directions
of the gyratory streams of the superior and inferior planets
being opposite for their positions of maximum disturbance.
These laws General Sabine has in fact detected by a discussion of
numerous observations taken at Kew and Hobarton.                 (See
‘  Proceedings  of the  Royal Society,’  vol. x. No. 41, p. 632.)
    41. The facts relating to the movements of the earth's mag
metic poles do not appear to be sufficiently well ascertained to
allow of applying the theory to explain them. Conceive, for
the sake of illustration, that there are two north magnetic poles
at the same distance from the earth's pole, and 180° from each
other, that the currents converging to them are of the same
intensity, and that they have the same uniform movement from
east to west.    On these suppositions it is evident that when the
poles are on the great circle passing through the pole of the
earth and a given place, the Inclination is at a maximum, and
the Declination is changing from east to west. When they
 have passed over 90° the Declination will have gone through a
western maximum, and be on the point of changing from west
to east, because the needle, being equally acted upon by the two
 poles in the new positions, must point exactly between them.
 At the same time the Inclination will be at a minimum. After
 the poles have advanced 90° further, the needle will have gone
 through a maximum eastern Declination, and returned to its
 original position, and the Inclination will again be at a maximum:
 and so on. These hypothetical circumstances are, perhaps, not
 so far different from the actual as to prevent our concluding
 from them that neither the direction nor the amount of the
 motion of the magnetic poles can be inferred with any certainty
 from mere observations of “points of convergence ’’ of the
 horizontal needle—at any rate not with so much certainty as
 the direction of the movement may be inferred from the direc
 tion in which the Declination is changing when it is passing
 through zero at any place, as London or Paris, if at the same
  time the Inclination is near    its  maarimum  at   the same place.
  Now   early observations  at  Paris show that the Declination was
 zero there about the year 1663, and was changing from east
  west, and observations both    at    Paris and London indicate   a to
  constant diminution  of  Inclination from that date, while, accord
  ing to  Hansteen's Isoclinal lines, the Inclination was less    in
 1600 than    in  1700.      may therefore
                            It                   be
                                               inferred that       a
 maximum     ofInclination occurred between those two epochs,

108              Dr. Matthiessen on an Alloy which may                                  be used
clude the use               of them   and make it desirable that,
                                            as standards,
instead of comparing, as heretofore, the conducting powers of
metals, alloys, &c. with that of silver, copper, or, as has lately
been proposed, with mercury”, they should in future be com
pared with an alloy having the properties mentioned above.
   The alloy best adapted for a standard of resistance for
galvanic currents, is that composed of
                   2 parts by weight of gold t,

for on looking at the curve which expresses the conducting
powers of the gold-silver alloysf, we find part of it almost at a
straight line; that is to say, to the alloy containing 50 volumes
per cent. of gold (which is the middle point of the straight line)
one or two per cent. more or less gold may be added without
altering             its
              conducting power       any great extent.        to
     In order      test the first condition,

   With regard to the expense, the 9 grammes alloy cost, drawn
into wire, about £1.4s., but the gold in it is always worth about
15s. ; so that the real expense is very small. Care must, of course,
be taken to prevent the alloy coming in contact with mercury,

that the filtering power of the paper had sensibly decreased; but,
owing to the rapidity of the process, the effect arising from this
cause had not materially interfered with the normal law of
filtration.
    Upon repeating the process, it was found that the velocity of
ascent followed, for the most part, the law expressed by the
general equation (7).
    Hence it would appear that the normal law               that the rate                   is,
of   filtration varies directly       the pressure upon the filter, the

 Cagniard Latour showed.       The translucent globules without
 granular contents gemmate most rapidly; there are more gra
 nulations in proportion as the globule is older, less active, and
 less capable            of gemmation.
    Mitscherlich supposed these globules to burst and discharge
their granules, dispersing seminules in the liquid, which increase
and become globules of ordinary yeast.             Pasteur does not agree
with this.
    It has been usually thought that, in the fermentation of solu
tion of sugar, the ferment, far from being destroyed, is developed
by gemmation; a close examination has shown the author that,
in the fermentation of sugar in the presence of albuminous sub
stances, neither more nor less yeast is produced than when the fer
mentation takes place with pure solution of sugar.

thus this fermentation continues for a long time.
   The nitrogen of the yeast diminishes during fermentation from
two reasons:—first, because the yeast increases in weight during
fermentation by assimilating the elements of sugar, which con
tains no nitrogen; secondly, in consequence of the solubility of
certain nitrogenized principles of the yeast.

that which the sugar could yield.     Under these conditions the
following facts are observed:—
   1st. The action     the yeast of   first exerted    the sugar.
                                                           is

   2nd. The yeast reacts on itself when the sugar has been com
pletely destroyed.
   3rd. The effect produced by the yeast on itself is not pro
portional to the weight of the yeast.
   The author assumes that the globules formed by the fermen
tation of the sugar cannot attain their complete development for
want of sufficient sugar, and that the young globules needing
this nourishment live at the expense of the parent globules,
which produces a secondary fermentation, or the yeast destroys
itself.
   Lastly, M. Pasteur speaks of the application of some of the
results to the composition of fermented liquors.
   Since glycerine and succinic acid are constant products of
the alcoholic fermentation, they ought to be found in wine,
beer, cider, &c. This the author has already shown to be the
CaSC.
   He terminates his memoir by the following passage, contain
ing the fundamental conclusion which he draws from his im
portant researches:—“As to the interpretation of the whole of
                                I
the new facts which have met with in my researches,            think                          I
that whoever considers them    impartially will see that fermentation
is a correlative act of life, and of the organization of globules,
and not of death or the putrefaction of these globules; still less
does      it
       appear to be a phenomenon of contact, where the                                            trans
formation of sugar proceeds in the presence of the ferment                                        with
out yielding anything to                  it,   or   taking anything from               it.”

multiplied by the continual product 1.2.3... n.
 The law which governs the fractional part           of B, was first
given in Schumacher's    Nachrichten, by Thomas Clausen in 1840;
and almost immediately afterwards a demonstration was furnished
by Professor Staudt in Crelle’s Journal, with a reclamation of
priority, supported by a statement of his having many years pre
viously communicated the theorem to Gauss.
   The law is this, that the positive or negative fractional residue
of B, (according as n is odd or even) is made up of the simple
sum of the reciprocals of                             all

                      unity, are contained      2n. The proof, which          in

This theorem, then, of Staudt and Clausen, inter alia, gives a
rule for determining what primes alone enter into the deno
minators of the Bernoullian numbers when expressed as frac
tions in their lowest terms; it enables us to affirm that only
simple powers of primes enter into those denominators, and to
know a priori what those prime factors are.               This note is
intended to supply a law concerning the numerators of the Ber
noullian numbers, which I have not seen stated anywhere, and
which admits of an instantaneous demonstration, to wit, that the
whole of n will appear in the numerator of Bn, save and except
such primes, or the powers of such primes, as we know by the
 Staudt-Clausen law must appear in the denominator.

defect of indirectness and of presupposing a knowledge of the law

the subject of a direct contemplation, but are regarded through
the medium of an alien function, one out of an infinite number,
in which they are as it were latently embodied; and the proof,

XXII.         On Graphical Interpolation. By W. DITTMAR, Assistant
             in the Laboratory of Owens College, Manchester*.

                                tables may also            be employed for
 the  purpose   of  carrying   out  graphical     interpolations.     Let us
 suppose that the corresponding values aloyo, a 1/1, way, ... be
 longing to an unknown function y=f(a) are given by obser
 vation, and that it is required to complete the series of vari
ables.    It is clear that the direct results of observation may be
registered in a graphical table in the manner described above.
For this purpose it is only necessary to draw a straight line, and
to construct on one side of it a scale with a constant unit of
length, the points of which are considered as representatives of
the values of y, while on the other side of the line marks made
opposite to the points yo, y1, y2, ... are taken as symbols of the
respective values of a, i. e. wo, a 1, a2, ... &c. The question now
is, how can the gaps                 on
                             the a-scale     filled       be              up

    If
     a satisfactory result cannot be obtained in this way, it is
best to try whether f(a) can be practically represented by an
expression of the form A+B++Ca”, where A, B, and C signify
                                                                                 -

tained between the two points in the w-scale corresponding to
the numbers          ºf ºt

    From the equations (II.) and (III.) the following method for
 constructing the a-scale may be found:—Combine the observed
 pairs of variables by twos, and find from every combination, with
 the help of equation (III.), a certain Ay, the graphical represen
 tative of which is contained between the two points which in the
 w-scale mean a –Aw and a.           Then construct a rectangular
 system of coordinates, and represent the values of a thus obtained
  (with an arbitrary unit of length) as abscissae, the corresponding
 values of Ay as ordinates, using for the latter that length as unit
 which represents        Ay-lin the y-scale.   Next draw a straight
 line which passes as nearly as possible through the extreme
 points of the ordinates.    The ordinates of this line correspond
 ing respectively to Aar, 2Aw, 3Aw,             ...,
                                           when put together in the
 right order, give the required a scale. In order to obtain exact
 results, it is advisable to choose first such a large value for Aw
 that only a few points of the w-scale are obtained, and to deter
mine the intermediate points by new constructions. As soon as
so many points are determined that two successive intervals do not
differ perceptibly in length, the subdivisions of each interval may
be made equal to one another.       Should the indications of a scale
thus obtained not      agree quite satisfactorily  with the observed
data, it may often be improved by slightly changing the unit of
length used in the construction, and by altering        position with        its
respect  to the  y-scale.     convenient method for
                                A                      doing  this has
been already described.

    If an interpolation of the second degree proves to be insuffi
cient for representing the observations, the series of values given
is divided into several intervals, and each of these is then treated
in the manner described.
   In some cases it will be advisable to represent, not y, but some
function of y like y”, logy, &c., on a scale with equal divisions.
   The advantages which the method of graphical interpolation
described appears to me to possess, as compared with the usual
one of drawing a curve in a rectangular system of coordinates,
are the following:—
    1. All the lines drawn are straight lines; the personal error in
the drawing is therefore reduced to a minimum.
   2. The drawing can be executed with less trouble and greater
 exactitude, and it takes up less space than in the ordinary way.
   3. When the drawing is finished, the value of y belonging to
 any given a may be read off at once, and vice versd.

   WI. Between F and a point # from F towards G, the eolour appears
to vary from the neutral tint to pure blue, while the brightness                                               in

diminishes towards the more refrangible end of the spectrum, the
purity of the colour being apparently the same throughout.
   VII. The theory of colour-blind vision being “dichromic,” is con
firmed by these experiments, the results of which agree with those
obtained already by normal or “trichromic” eyes, if we suppose the
“red” element of colour eliminated, and the “green” and “blue”
elements left as they were, so that the “red-making rays,” though
dimly visible to the dichromic eye, excite the sensation not of red
but of green, or as they call   “yellow.”        it,

takes place when there is no external force like pressure tending to
bring the particles of ice together, but, on the contrary, a force of
torsion is tending to separate them ; and, if respect be had to the
mere point of contact on the two rounded surfaces where the flexible
adhesion is exercised, the force which tends to separate them may
be esteemed very great. The act of regelation cannot be considered
as complete until the junction has become rigid ; and therefore                                                             I
think that the necessity of pressure for it is altogether excluded.
No external pressure can remain (under the circumstances) after the
first rigid contact is broken. All the forces which remain tend to
separate the pieces of ice; yet the first flexible adhesions and                        the                           all

became so dissected at the surfaces as to develope the mechanical
composition of the masses, and to show that they were composed of
parallel layers about the tenth of an inch thick, of greater and lesser
fusibility, which layers appear, from other modes of examination, to
have been horizontal in the ice whilst in the act of formation.  They
had no relation to the position of the blocks in the water of   my ex
periments, or to the direction of gravity, but had a fixed position in
relation to each piece of ice.
                                             ADDENDUM.
   The following method of examining the regelation phenomena above
described may be acceptable.          Take a rather large dish of water at
common temperatures.           Prepare some flat cakes or bars of ice, from
half an inch to an inch thick; render the edges round, and the upper
surface of each piece convex, by holding it against the inside of a
warm saucepan cover, or in any other way. When two of these pieces
are put into the water they will float, having perfect freedom of motion,
and yet only the central part of the upper surface will be above the
fluid; when, therefore, the pieces touch at their edges, the width of
the water-surface above the place of contact may be two, three, or
four inches, and thus the effect of capillary action be entirely removed.
By placing a plate of clean dry wax or spermaceti upon the top of a
plate of ice, the latter may be entirely submerged, and the tendency
to approximation from capillary action converted into a force of
separation.     When two or more of such floating pieces of ice are
brought together by contact at some point under the water, they
adhere ; first with an apparently flexible, and then with a rigid adhe
sion. When five or six pieces are grouped in a contorted shape, as
an S, and one end piece be moved carefully,                                  all
                                                                will move with                             i

                               a
and  in   aninstant become rigid again. As the adhesion                      only               is          by
points, the force applied should not                            powerful

     The following communication was read :—
     “On the Geology of Bolivia and Southern Peru.” By D.
 Forbes, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S. With Notes on the Fossils by Prof.
 Huxley, F.R.S., Sec. G.S., and J. W. Salter, Esq., F.G.S.
     After some observations on the previous researches by others, and
 on the general features of the region, the author proceeded to de
 scribe the Post-tertiary formations of the maritime district.   These
 beds, containing existing species of shells, occur at various heights
 up to 40 feet above the sea-level,       Guano deposits are frequent
 along the coast, and deposits of salt also in raised beaches a little
 above the sea.    The author could not verify Lieut. Freyer's state
 ment of Balani and Milleport being attached high up the side of the
 Morro de Arica, a perpendicular cliff at the water's edge; indeed,
 from the state of old Indian tumuli along the beach, and other cir
 cumstances, the author believes that no perceptible elevation has
 here taken place since the Spanish Conquest, although such an alter
 ation of level has occurred in Chile.   The sand-dunes of the coast,
 and their great mobility during the hot season, were noticed. From
 Mexillones to Arica the coast is steep and rugged, formed of a chain
 of mountains, 3000 feet high, consisting of rocks of the Upper Oolitic
 age.    At Arica the high land recedes, leaving a wide plain formed
 of the débris of the neighbouring mountains; and in the middle of
 this area was observed stratified volcanic tuff contemporaneous with
 the formation of the gravel.
     The saline formations were next treated of as three groups, ac
cording to their height above the sea-level, and were shown to be
much more extensive than generally supposed, extending over the
rainless regions of this coast for more than 550 miles. They are
mostly developed, however, between latitudes 19° and 25° South.
These salines are supposed to have originated in the evaporation of
sea-water confined in them as lagoons by the longitudinal ranges of
hills separating them from the ocean. The nitrate of soda had, in
the author's opinion, resulted from the chemical reactions of sea-salt,
carbonate of lime, and decomposing vegetable matter (both terrestrial
and marine).     The borate of lime, occurring with the nitrate, is
connected with the volcanic conditions of the district, and was pro
duced by fumaroles containing boracic acid.         Where the highest
range of salines extend beyond the rainless region, they are much
modified in the rainy season, and generally take the form of salt
plains encircling salt lakes or swamps.
    The great Bolivian plateau, having an average elevation of 13,000
or 14,000 feet above the sea, consists of great gravel plains formed
by the spaces between the longitudinal ranges of mountains being
filled up by the débris of these mountains.         The most western
of these consists of Oolitic débris with volcanic tuff and scoriae;
it bears the salines above-mentioned, and is nearly destitute of
water. The central range of plains, formed from the disintegration

rise to the great rivers Amazon, &c.      These slates, shales, grau

point reached, 20,000 feet. The problematical fossils known as
Cruziana or Bilobites occur not only in the lower beds, but (with
many other fossils) in the higher part of the series.
    Lastly, the differences between the sections made by M. D'Or
bigny, M. Pissis, and the author were pointed out, though for the
most part difficult of explanation.   D’Orbigny makes the mountain
Illimani to be granite; it is slate according to the author. M.
Pissis describes as carboniferous the beds in which Mr. Forbes found
Silurian fossils, and so on.
    “On  a New Species of Macrauchenia (M. Boliviensis).” By Prof.
T. H.  Huxley,  F.R.S., Sec. G.S. &c.
   Some bones, fully impregnated with metallic copper, which had
been brought up from the mines of Corocoro in Bolivia were sub
mitted to Prof. Huxley for examination.    The mines referred to are
situated on a great fault; and the bones were probably part of a
carcass that had fallen in from the surface,—the copper-bearing
water of the mines having mineralized them. A cervical and a
lumbar vertebra, an astragalus, a scapula, and a tibia show com
plete correspondence in essential characters with those bones of the
great Macrauchenia Patachonica              described by Prof.           Owen in the
Appendix to the ‘Voyage of the Beagle;' but the relative size and
proportions of the vertebra, the tibia, and the astragalus indicate a
distinct species, much smaller and more slender; and in some points
of structure this new form (M. Boliviensis) approaches more nearly
to the recent Auchenidae than to the larger and fossil species.  The
fragments of the cranium show some peculiarities of form, but, on
the whole, it has many resemblances to that of the Vicugna.
   Prof. Huxley pointed out that this slender and small-headed Ma
crauchenia may have been the highland-contemporary of the larger
M. Patachonica ; just as now-a-days the Vicugna prefers the moun
tains, whilst    its
                  larger congener the Guanaco roams over the Pata
gonian plains.

 surface of the cylinder towards which the polariscope was directed.

        ON ELECTRIC            ENDOSMOSE.                  B.Y.    M. C. MATTEUCCI.
   Having recently had occasion to examine into the construction
and operation  of the galvanic batteries used in our telegraph offices,
I have been led to make certain original experiments on the subject
of electric endosmose, a short description of which, as they seem to
throw some light on the true nature of the phenomenon in question,
I beg to lay before the Academy. MM. Porret and Becquerel were
the first who called attention to the fact that a liquid mass, sepa
rated into two compartments by a porous diaphragm, and traversed
by an electric current, appears to be transported in the direction of
that current; that is to say, the level of the liquid is lowered in the
compartment that contains the positive pole, and raised in that which
contains the negative pole.    The determination of the law of this
 phenomenon is due to M. Wiedemann, who proved that the quantity
 of water transported is directly proportional to the intensity of the
current and the electric resistance of the liquid. M. Wiedemann
seems to have regarded this mechanical effect of the current as a
different phenomenon from             electrolytic action; while other phy
                                          its
sicists have considered that the transportation             the liquid was only

electrolytic effects, whether endosmose                produced    be  not, give           or

   The necessary relations among these forces have been                                                             in

most general type of a stress consists of a combination of three
principal pressures or tensions, in directions at right angles to
each other.
    When two of the principal pressures are equal, the third be

that the mechanical effect is that of attraction instead of re
pulsion.   The lines of force in this case do not run between the
bodies, but avoid each other, and are dispersed over space.        In
order to   produce  the effect of  attraction, the stress along   the
lines of gravitating force must be a pressure.

on the existence of a tension in the direction of the lines of force,

that if the force increases towards the        right,  the lines of force

    Hence the lines of force in a part of space where u is uniform,
and where there are no electric currents, must be such as would
result from the theory of “imaginary matter” acting at a di

but the results are identical.

So far as they have been yet examined, the properties of nitro
phenoic acid confirm the idea that it is a true homologue of
nitrobenzoic acid.
     I
     have made an attempt to prepare the original acid, the
phenoic,   of which           I
                     have supposed the above-noticed acid to be
the nitro-derivative. Although a mixture of bichromate of po
tassium and sulphuric acid is without action on benzole, it acts
most energetically on sulphobenzolic acid formed by dissolving
benzole in Nordhausen sulphuric acid.     to a slightly diluted    If
solution of sulphobenzolic acid at about 70° C. minute frag
ments of bichromate of potassium be added, one at a time, and
the action which ensues at each addition be moderated by cooling
the apparatus, an acid distillate will be obtained, on the surface
of which small brilliant crystals, generally accompanied by a few
oily globules, will be found floating. It would seem that the
oily and solid portions of the distillate are alike in composition,
since the analysis of the silver-salts of the two bodies, separated
mechanically as far as possible, gave almost the same numbers.
Of the annexed determinations, I. was made with a silver-salt
prepared from the oily part, and                      II.
                                         with one prepared from the

              following mode of arrangement of the developed expres
    THEsion      of a determinant had presented itself to me as a con

     RECEIVED        a short time ago from Heidelberg the enclosed
        portion of a letter from Prof. Kirchhoff to Prof. Erdmann.
As it gives a later account of Kirchhoff and Bunsen's most im

there announced, or of the experiments by help of which Bunsen
and   It  have shown that the bright bands in the spectrum of a
flame serve as the surest indications of the metals present therein;
I  will take the liberty, in this communication, of informing you
                   I
of the progress have made in the chemical analysis of the solar
atmosphere.

which surrounds a solid nucleus having a still higher tempera

should see in it the bright bands characteristic of the metals

contained in the atmosphere, and from the presence of these
lines should infer that of these various metals. The more intense

so that at first sight it would appear, not only that the latter
ought to be kept constant throughout one and the same experi

 each case.
     On setting both jets in action, however, at different inclina
tions, and comparing the two ripples which they produced, it
was soon found that, however much the radii a and a' of the
circles described by the jets might differ in magnitude, the radii
r and r" of the circles described by the cusps of their ripples were
in   all
       cases nearly equal.    This result      confirmed      theory,     is                   by

  Of these results the first five or six       are less trustworthy than
the rest,-and this for several reasons,        amongst which the follow
ing may be cited:—The rapidity of the rotation renders the de
termination of the position of the cusp more difficult; the proxi
mity of the immersed axis interferes with the clear definition of
the cusp; and lastly, the consequences of a small error in esti
mating the distance of this cusp from the axis increase as this
distance diminishes, since the cusp approaches the axis asympto
tically (art. 21). On the other hand, the rapid diminution of A
shown in the Table, can in some measure be accounted for by
the fact that, in order to avoid disturbing too much the surface
of the water in the bath, it was found necessary, with rapid rota
tions, to use only one jet, and it of course issued at a small angle
towards the horizon, so that the impact between the jet and the
water in the bath was necessarily a very oblique one. But, as
 already mentioned in art. 20, the tendency of this obliquity is to
 diminish the velocity A. There can be no doubt that the rapid
 diminution of X in the Table is to be ascribed chiefly to these
 causes; though it is also worth mentioning that the property of
the wave insisted upon by Weber, i. e. that            its
                                                    velocity diminishes
 as   itsradius increases (see art. 2),  would also tend        produceto
 the effect observed.

order to insert a solid cylinder of ivory about 1 inch long. Pass
ing through the centre of A and parallel to the sides of the glass,
a fine line Aa, an inch long, was scratched on its surface with a
diamond point; and through the extremity a of this line another,
mn, was drawn perpendicular to the former, and graduated on
each side from a into tenths of an inch.     In using this ripple
meter, the plate of glass was held close and parallel to the sur
face of the current, so that the ivory pin, by becoming partially
immersed, might cause a well-defined ripple,b Ac, visible through
the glass; the plate was then turned until A a bisected the angle
                                                     pf course the ratio

gave at once the tangent of the required angle 6.      In this case,
as in that of the rotating jet, a number of secondary ripples are
also visible: after a little practice, however, and when the cur
rent was not too slow (the angle b Ac too obtuse), it was not dif
ficult to estimate, approximately, the value of tan 6 corresponding
to the principal ripple.
   The following Table contains a few of the best results of many
experiments made on streams.        In it the first column gives the
values of tan 6 as read off on the ripple-meter; the second column
shows the corresponding values of the velocity v as indicated in
feet per minute by the current-meter; and the third column
contains the respective values of X, calculated according to the
formula (43), in inches per second.

somewhat with the velocly of the current; but there can be

   In conclusion it may be added that, if desired, more accurate
ripple-meters might easily be devised, and by means of such the
velocities of currents might be determined from the forms of their
ripples with a degree of precision little, if at all, inferior to that
possessed by the methods now in use.         It is from a theoretical
point of view, however, that the relation between waves and rip
ples, which we have endeavoured to establish, promises the great
est interest.    For there can be little doubt that a skilful experi
menter, pursuing the subject in this direction, would greatly
extend our present knowledge with respect to the changes in the
velocity of a current at different points of        surface, and espeits

       N   the ‘Athenaeum’ of the 5th of January, Admiral FitzRoy,
           writing on the subject of the temperature correction of
 siphon barometers, invites attention to an experiment recently
 made by Mr. Negretti.         A siphon barometer was heated to
 about 110° from some lower temperature, when it was found
 that, although the mercury rose in the long or vacuum leg of                                                          the
 siphon,     did not rise, but seemed

     Mr. Jerrard’s function W is the sum of two values of his
function      P;   the substitution by which the second is derived from
the first can only be that which interchanges the two functions
 [agyös] and [ayeS8]; and hence any symmetrical function of
[agyöe] and [ays86] is afunction homotypical with Mr. Jerrard’
   ; such symmetric function is in fact a 6-valued function only.
Indeed it is easy to see that the twelve pentagons correspond
together in pairs, either pentagon of a pair being derived from
the other one by stellation, and the six values of the function in
question corresponding to the six pairs of pentagons respectively.

 to obtain the substance to be used for this purpose in a suf
 ficiently pure and dry state, and secondly, to form a solution
 of it the exact strength of which may be known: for though
 it may appear a very simple operation to dissolve a known weight
 of a certain substance in a given bulk of water or other solvent,
 yet, when this has to be done with such great precision as is
 necessary   in these   cases, it is a tedious and troublesome opera
 tion, and any inaccuracy in the graduation of the standard solu
 tion will render all determinations made with it more or less
 inaccurate.     It is obvious, therefore, that it would be most de
 sirable that the substances which are intended to be used as re
 agents in volumetric analysis should be easily obtained in a pure
 state, and that where considerable time and trouble have been
 expended in graduating solutions of those substances, they should
 not be liable to undergo changes whereby their strength would
 be more or less altered, but that when standard solutions have
 once been made, they might be kept and used for a great num
 ber of determinations.
    The ferrocyanide of potassium fulfils both those conditions;
for it is in general met with in commerce almost chemically
pure, and in a state in which it can at once be employed as a
volumetric reagent; and if at any time it should happen to occur
not quite so pure, it can readily be purified by recrystallization;
and in addition to these important considerations, its solution is
not prone to change, especially if it be not left exposed to the
action of the light.        In this latter respect it has a decided
advantage over several of our most useful volumetric reagents,
viz. the permanganate of potash, the protosalts of iron, sul
phurous acid, &c., which, from their being so prone to undergo
spontaneous decomposition,          must be either freshly prepared,
or the strength of their solutions accurately ascertained every
time they are used, if a day or so has elapsed between each de
termination.
    The employment       of the ferrocyanide of potassium as a volu
metric   reagent  depends   on the following circumstances: viz., that
it is readily   converted into the ferridcyanide of potassium (red
prussiate of potash) under different circumstances, and that the
point where the whole of the former salt has been changed into
the latter may easily be known, either by the use of a diluted
solution of a persalt of iron (which gives with a drop of the mix
ture a blue or green coloration as long as any of the ferrocyanide
remains unchanged) or by some other simple indication. Thus,
for example, when chlorine is brought in contact with the ferro
cyanide of potassium, this change, as is well known, takes place,
which is expressed by the following symbols:—
            2  (Kº, Fe Cy”)+Cl=(K8 Fe? Cy") + KCl.

216           Prof. Davy on  some  further applications  of
    The same occurs, as far as the conversion of the ferrocyanide
into ferridcyanide, when an acidified solution of the former salt
is brought in contact with a solution of the permanganate of
potash, which is instantly decolorized by the reducing action of
the ferrocyanide of potassium, which is thereby converted into
the ferridcyanide, and this decoloration of the permanganate
 continues as long as any of the ferrocyanide remains in the mix
ture.
    Again, if a solution of the ferrocyanide of potassium, acidified
 strongly with either hydrochloric or sulphuric acid, be brought
in contact with a solution of the bichromate of potash, the same
 change of the ferrocyanide into the ferridcyanide immediately
 takes place.
    The first reaction has been long known, and is the means em
 ployed at present for obtaining the ferridcyanide or red prussiate
 of potash for manufacturing and other purposes; the second re
                                                       I
 action has been more recently discovered; but am not aware
 that the third, in the case of the bichromate, is generally known,
 or that the changes which occur in the reaction have been pre
 viously studied.
     From experiments which     I made, it would appear that when a
  solution of  ferrocyanide of potassium, acidified with hydrochloric
 acid, was mixed with one of the bichromate of potash, the follow
 ing reaction was produced, viz. 6(K*Fe Cy”)+KO, 2 Cr 0°
  +7HCl=3(K*Fe? Cy") +4. KCl-H Crº Cl3+7HO; for, amongst
 other facts,   I may observe that when I mixed together solutions
 of the two salts in the proportions corresponding to 6 equiva
 lents of the ferrocyanide of potassium to 1 of the bichromate
 of potash (as indicated in the above formula), acidifying the
 mixture with hydrochloric acid,      I  found that the whole of the
 ferrocyanide was converted into the ferridcyanide, and that any
 quantity less than that proportion of the bichromate of potash
 left more or less of the ferrocyanide unchanged.           The same
 results followed the use of sulphuric acid; and it appears that a
 similar reaction occurs with this acid as with hydrochloric acid,
 with the exception that in this case the 4 equivalents of chloride
 of potassium and the 1 equivalent of sesquichloride of chromium
 are replaced by 4 equivalents of sulphate of potash and 1 of the
 sesquisulphate of chromium.
    The proportion of either acid used, provided there is enough
 to strongly acidify the mixture, does not appear to affect the re
 action; for I obtained precisely the same results where a very       .
large amount of acid was employed as where the quantity neces
sary only to strongly acidify the mixture had been added.
                                        I
    Ön these three reactions which have noticed, may be based

useful determinations, the first, and one of the most important,
of which is the ascertaining the amount of available chlorine in the
chloride of lime or bleaching powder, which is a matter of much
importance in many of the chemical arts, but particularly in
bleaching; for not only does the commercial value of this sub
stance depend on the quantity of available chlorine that it con
tains, which is subject to great variation from exposure to the
 airand other causes, but likewise        the greatest importance is      of

tain 10,000 grains of distilled water when filled up to a certain
mark in the neck, make two standard solutions, the first by
placing in the flask or bottle 1190 (or exactly 1189.97%) grains
 of the purest crystallized ferrocyanide of potassium (yellow
prussiate of potash) reduced to powder, adding distilled water
to dissolve the salt, and when this is effected, filling up with
water to the   mark; and having mixed the solution thoroughly,
place it in a well-stoppered bottle. The second standard solution
is made in the same manner, substituting for the ferrocyanide
1386 (or exactly 18858) grains of bichromate of potash which
has been purified by recrystallization and fused in a crucible at
as low a heat as possible.     Both these solutions will keep un
changed, and will answer for a number of determinations if they
are   preserved    in well-stoppered bottles, and the ferrocyanide
 solution be    kept,   when not in use, excluded from the light.
 Get a burette or alkalimeter capable of holding or delivering
 1000 grains of distilled water, and divided into 100 equal
 divisions; also two small bottles, one capable of delivering 1000
 grains, and the other 500 grains of distilled water when filled
 up to a certain mark on the neck of eacht, which may both be
readily made by filling them with water, emptying them, and
after they have drained for a minute or two, weighing into each
the above weights of distilled water;          what will     or,
                                                          sufficiently       be
accurate for most purposes, pour from the burette into one 100
divisions       distilled water, and into the other 50, and mark
               of
with  a  file where the fluid stands         the neck   in
                                                         each bottle.      of

222                       Prof. Davy on   some   further applications of
    The reaction of the bichromate of potash on the ferrocyanide
  might be employed in the valuation of the ferrocyanide of
 potassium and other ferrocyanides—having previously, in the case
  of those which were insoluble, converted them into the ferro
 cyanide of potassium by boiling them with caustic potash, and
  separating the insoluble oxides by filtration.
    It might also be employed for the valuation of the commercial
 red prussiate of potash, which is now to some extent employed
 as a bleaching agent in calico-printing, and which consists of
 varying quantities of ferro- and ferrid-cyanide of potassium
 together with chloride of potassium.           By ascertaining first how
 much a given quantity of the sample requires of a standard solu
 tion of bichromate of potash to convert the ferrocyanide present
 into ferridcyanide, the per-centage of that substance would be
known; and then by taking another portion of the sample and
 converting the ferridcyanide it contained, by reducing agents,
 such as the sulphites of soda and potash, &c., into the ferrocyanide,
 and finally determining the amount of bichromate necessary to
bring the whole of the ferrocyanide then present into the state
of ferridcyanide, the difference in the two results would indicate
the proportion of ferridcyanide originally present in the sample.
    The last application of ferrocyanide of potassium which shall                          I

                       much extolled for that purpose.           According
to   my experiments, the ferrocyanide                far more convenient

reducing agent than the cyanide, and may                             be
                                                         substituted for                            it

many unquestionable advantages over that salt for this purpose.
Thus the ferrocyanide does not deliquesce and decompose when
exposed       the air, whereas the cyanide rapidly absorbs moisture,

counterpoised watch-glass, and powdering in a warm mortar
some fresh cyanide of potassium, I placed the same quantity of
it in a similar counterpoised watch-glass, and left them both
exposed to the air.       On examining them after four hours’ expo
       I
 sure, found that the former had only gained régth parts of a
grain of moisture, whereas the latter had taken up 3.6 grains,
or sixty times as much moisture under the same circumstances.
After two days’ exposure              I

had only absorbed 1.4 grain.

                                 the latter. Combined with the above
 advantages,     find that the ferrocyanide
                 I                                equally effective
                                                            is            re               in

 venient for the reduction of different combinations of arsenic and
 mercury, which are reduced                 by
                                         with the greatest ease.

 I      made several comparative experiments with the dried ferro
 cyanide and with the cyanide         reducing agents for the sulphuret
                                            as

 arsenical compound with each salt under similar circumstances;
 and   in   almost every case, particularly where the quantities
 operated        on
                were minute,         obtained more satisfactory results
                                      I
 with the dried ferrocyanide than with the cyanide.
     The following were amongst my experiments:—I mixed the
  Tººth    of
            agrain     sulphuret
                        of                  of
                                      arsenic with     grains     the dried
                                                                  3              of
 ferrocyanide, and made          similar experiment, substituting the
                                      a
  same quantity      cyanide; and
                       of                 heating the mixtures
                                                 on                  similar          in
  glass tubes, obtained almost identically fine and characteristic
 rings     of
            metallic arsenic.
 I      then intimately mixed the same quantity               sulphuret     of                   of
  arsenic with 49.9 grains     very finely powdered glass, and taking

mixture, substituting the same quantity of cyanide; on heating
both these mixtures in small reduction tubes,       got the charac         I
teristic metallic rings in both, but better defined in the case of
the ferrocyanide.
     I
     finally took 2.5 grains of the mixture of sulphuret and glass,
containing about Tººth parts of a grain of sulphuret of arsenic,
and treated them in the same manner, using in one case 2.5 grains
of ferrocyanide, and in the other 2.5 grains of cyanide, and
obtained in each case a minute metallic ring, which, however,
was much more distinct and satisfactory where - the ferrocyanide
had been used as the reducing agent.
   The same comparative experiments were made with arsenious
acid, when results similar to those in the case of the sulphuret of
arsenic were obtained.
    The ferrocyanide, therefore, is a most delicate reducing agent
in the case of arsenical compounds, and where very minute quan
tities have to be detected, appears from my experiments to give
more satisfactory results than the cyanide.
    Whether the addition of dried carbonate of soda would improve
the ferrocyanide for some cases of reduction,                          I

Organic Compounds.”                       By Hermann Kopp.
    The author        was the first to observe(in 1841) that, on comparing pairs
of analogous organic compounds, the   same difference in boiling-point
corresponds frequently to the same difference in composition.     This
relation between boiling-point and composition, when first pointed
out, was repeatedly denied, but is now generally admitted.   The con
tinued experiments of the author, as well as of numerous other
inquirers, have since fixed many boiling-points which had hitherto
remained undetermined, and corrected such as had been inaccu
rately observed.   In the present paper the author has collected his
experimental determinations, and has given a survey of        the facts                               all

   The author demonstrates in the next place that in many series of
compounds other than those hitherto considered, the elementary
difference; a C, H, likewise involves a difference of w x 19° in the boil
ing-point. He further shows that on comparing the boiling-points
of the corresponding terms in the several series of homologous sub
stances hitherto considered, many other constant differences in boiling
point are found to correspond to certain differences in composition,
Thus a monobasic acid is found to boil 44° higher than                     ethyl                              its
compound, and 63° higher than                                its
                                          methyl compound; and this con
stant relation holds good even for acids other than those previously
examined, e.g. for the substitution-products             acetic acid. Also      of                                  C,

heated, the coefficient of expansion approaches that of a perfect gas.
The authors hope that these experiments may be continued, and that
the results obtained at greatly increased pressures will prove as

 cerned; but differs from him in maintaining that there is no upper
 series of quartzite and limestone, and that there is no evidence of an
 “upward conformable succession” from the quartzite and limestone
 into the eastern mica-slate or gneiss–the o-called “upper gneiss.”
 The “upper quartzite ” and “upper limestone" the author believes
  to be portions of the quartzite of the country, in some cases separated
  by anticlines and faults and cropping out in the higher ground, and
 in other instances inverted beds with the gneiss brought up by a
  contiguous fault and overhanging them. This latter condition of
  the strata, as well as other cases where the eastern gneiss is brought
 up against the quartzite series, have, according to the author, given
 rise to the supposed “upward conformable succession” above referred
 to.    In some cases where “gneiss’ is said to have been observed
 overlying the quartzite, Professor Nicol has determined that the
 overlying rock is granulite or other eruptive rock, not gneiss.
    The sections described by the author in support of his views of
 the eastern gneiss not overlying the quartzite and limestone, but
 being the same as the gneiss of the west coast, and brought up by a
 powerful fault along a nearly north and south line passing from
 Whiten Head (Loch Erriboll) to Loch Carron and the Sound of Sleat,
 are chiefly those which had been brought forward as affording the
 proofs on which the opposite hypothesis is founded; and in all, the
 author finds irruptions of igneous rocks, and other indications of
 faults and disturbance, depriving them, in his opinion, of                weight              all
 as  evidence    of   regular order

     The following communications were read:—
     1.   “On
           the Geological Structure of the South-west Highlands of
Scotland.” By T. F. Jamieson, Esq.      Communicated by Sir R. I.
Murchison, V.P.G.S.
   In this paper the author attempts to throw light on the relations
of those rocks which figure in geological maps as the mica-schist,
clay-slate, the chlorite-slates, and the quartz-rock of the South-west
ern Highlands, which range N.E. through the middle of Scotland,
forming an important feature in the geology of that country.         An
examination of these rocks, as displayed in Bute and Argyleshire,
has led Mr. Jamieson to believe that, from the quartz-rock of Jura
to the border of the Old Red Sandstone, there is a conformable series
of strata, which, although closely linked together, may be classed
into three distinct groups, namely, 1st, a set of lower grits (or
quartz-rock), many thousand feet thick; 2ndly, a great mass of
thin-bedded slates, 2000 feet or more thick; and 3rdly, a set of
upper grits, with intercalated seams of slate of equal thickness.
Beds of limestone occur here and there sparingly in            the three                  all
divisions; the thickest being deep down         the lower grits. All the
                                                                      in
limestones are thickest towards the west. The siliceous grits also
appear     to   be                              green materials towards the
                                     of an

and lower grits) have        persistent S.W.-N.E. strike, sometimes

with numerous intercalated beds of greenstone, some being of great
thickness.    Mr. Jamieson pointed out that this feature of the di

culloch was in error when he denominated these rocks “chlorite
schist.”
  The probable relationship of the rocks of the Islands of Shuna,
Luing, and Scarba to those of Jura and Bute were then dwelt upon;
the greenstones of Knapdale, &c., and their relation to the sedi
mentary rocks, were described in detail; and the limestones of
the district briefly noticed. As no fossils have hitherto been found,
palaeontological evidence of the age of these rocks is wanting; but
the author, regarding their general resemblance to the quartz-rocks,
limestones, and mica-schists of Sutherlandshire, thinks them to be of
the same date as those rocks of the North-west Highlands.
     2. “On the position of the beds of the Old Red Sandstone in
 the Counties of Forfar and Kincardine, Scotland.”            By the Rev.
 Hugh Mitchell. Communicated by the Secretary.                        -
     In Forfar- and Kincardine-shire, south of the Grampians, the Old
 Red Sandstone is developed in the following series, with local modi
 fications:—1st (at top), Conglomerate; 2nd, grey flagstone with
 intercalated sandstone (about 40 feet thick at Cauterland Den,
 120 feet at Carmylie); 3rd, gritty ferruginous sandstone, with
 occasional thin layers of purplish flagstone.        Of the last, 120 feet
 are seen at Cauterland Den; it occurs also at Ferry Den, &c. The
 flagstone of this third or lowest member of the group yields Ripple
 marks, Rain-prints, Worm-markings,           and Crustacean tracks (of
 several kinds, large and small).       Parka decipiens has been found in
 the lowest grits; and Cephalaspis in the sandstone at Brechin, im
 mediately under the grey flagstones.
     In the second member, namely the grey flags, Fish-remains have
 of late been found more or less abundantly throughout the district,
 together with Crustacean fossils.       Cephalaspis Lyellii, Ichthyodoru
 lites, Acanthodian fishes, Pterygotus, Eurypterus, Kampecaris For
fariensis, Stylonurus Powriensis, Parka decipiens, and vegetable re
 mains are the most characteristic fossils.
     The author pointed out that some few genera of Fish and Crus
 taceans were present both in this zone and in the Upper Silurian
 formation, and that still fewer links existed to connect the fauna of
 the Forfarshire flags with the Old Red Sandstone north of the Gram
 pians, with which it appears to have, in this respect, almost as little
 relation as with the Carboniferous system. With the Old Red of
 Herefordshire these flags appear to have some few fossils in common;
 but of about twenty species found in Forfarshire, only about four
 could be quoted from Herefordshire.
     In conclusion, the author noticed the vast vertical development of
 the whole series, and  its great geographical extent; and particularly
 dwelt   upon  the distinctness   ofthe fauna  of the flagstonesof  Forfar
 shire,     giving good grounds for the treatment            the Old Red
        as as

 P. B. Brodie, M.A., F.G.S.                                   -
     From observations made by himself and others, the author was
 enabled to give the following notes. In the Upper Lias some Corals
 of the genera Thecocyathus and Trochocyathus occur. The Middle
 Lias of Northamptonshire and Somersetshire has yielded a few Corals.
 The uppermost band of the Lower Lias, namely the zone with Am
 monites raricostatus and Hippopodium ponderosum, contains an unde
 scribed Coral at Cheltenham and Honeybourn in Gloucestershire;
 and a Montlivaltia in considerable abundance at Down Hatherly in
 Gloucestershire, at Fenny Compton and Aston Magna in Worcester
 shire, and at Kilsby Tunnel in Northamptonshire.     The middle mem
 bers of the Lower Lias appear to be destitute of Corals. In the zone
 with Ammonites Bucklandi, called also the Lima-beds, Isastrata occurs
 in Warwickshire and Somersetshire. Dr. Wright states that Isastrata
 Murchisoni occurs in the next lowest bed of the Lower Lias, namely
 the White Lias with Ammonites Planorbis, at Street in Somerset ;
 and another Coral has been found in the same zone in Warwick
 shire.     Lastly, in the “Guinea-bed ” at Binton in Warwickshire
 another Coral has been met with.
      The Montlivaltia of the Hippopodium-bed and the Isastraea of the
 Lima-beds appear to have grown over much larger areas in the-
 Liassic Sea than the other Corals here referred to.

  passes over Upper Ludlow rocks and some lower beds of the Old Red
  series, here and there covered by drift, until the Lower Ludlow rock

Ludlow shales, Downton sandstone, and, at the east end of the
tunnel,  by red and mottled marls, grey shales and grits, purple
shales and sandstones, with the Auchenaspis-beds, forming the pas
sage-beds into the Old Red Sandstone, as described in a former
paper (Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. vol. xvi. p. 193).
   In a note, Mr. J. W. Salter, F.G.S., described the great abun

    ON    THE FIBROUS ARRANGEMENT                          OF IRON AND GLASS TUBES,
              [Extract from a Letter from Dr. Debus to Professor Tyndall.]
                                                      Queenwood           College, Feb. 17, 1861.
A      FEW weeks ago Mr. E. brought me a piece of iron tube which
         had been exposed for several years to the action of moist air.
 Nearly the whole of the tube was converted into oxide of iron. This
 suggested certain thoughts, the results of which were new and in
 teresting to me.
    You know, when a piece of glass tube, sealed and filled with water,
 is heated, the tube is cracked, and cracked in a longitudinal direc
 tion. Why is this? Glass tubes are made by taking a piece of hol
 low glass in a viscous state and pulling it at both ends. Now, the
 particles of the glass do not adhere to each other on                   sides                  all
                   the same strength, but
                   in of
 with force
         a                                                      in
                                                  some directions this force
is  stronger,      others weaker.      Under the strain produced            the                   by
 pulling, they arrange themselves                     so
                                                  offer     the pulling force
                                                           as   to           to
the greatest resistance. Therefore the greatest cohesion              the par           of of
ticles   isfound,      in
                     the formed   tube,  parallel    the  length     to
                                                                     the tube,
and the weakest cohesion            direction perpendicular
                                         in a                      this. This          to
explains the cracking             of
                             the tube                 as
                                           mentioned above.
    Mr.       E.
             could not give me exact information              how iron tubesas   to
are made, but              he
                      said they were passed through rollers.          Now,
this  is correct, the particles     iron oughtof      arrange themselves
                                                                     to                                in if
a  similar way      the particles
                     to                  glass tube.

cleavage”. The paper wherein this explanation was given never came
to my hands; and I do not remember that you explained the thing
to me when we had personal intercourse.      The principle alluded to
appears to me to be the true cause of the phenomenon.
   If a plastic mass is exposed to pressure, the particles turn until
they are in such a position as to offer the greatest resistance to the
pressure brought to bear upon them. But that direction wherein
they offer the greatest resistance to pressure is also that where the
cohesion is least. Consequently cleavage ought to take place in a
direction perpendicular to the pressure exerted.

      GENTLEMEN,
   In a communication published in the last Number of the Philoso
phical Magazine, we pointed out the appearance of a well-defined blue
line in the spectrum produced by igniting the evaporated residue of
a deep-well water.     From the circumstance of this line, which is situ
ated somewhat more towards the violet end of the spectrum than the
line Sr 3, not being referred to in the paper of Profs. Kirchhoff and
Bunsen, nor indicated in their beautiful representations of the spectra
of the alkaligenous metals, we were induced to attribute                   pro              its
duction     to
             the probable   existence        previously
                                                   of   a unrecognized   mem
ber   ofthe calcium group        metals. Further experiments, however,
                                        of
have satisfied       us
                    that the blue line       question really belongs        the              to

 period depending on the action of the planet Venus, which Professor
 Hansen has proposed to introduce into the expressions for the
 moon's motions. According to M. Delaunay's calculations (the accu
 racy of which I have at present no intention of disputing) the value of
 the coefficient of the first of these disturbances—that, namely, whose
 period is about 273 years—is nearly the same as that attributed to it
 by the astronomer of Gotha ; but the coefficient of the second, whose
 period is about 240 years (and which is the most important of the
 two, since its coefficient, calculated at first by Professor Hansen at
 23"-2, is according to his account at least 21"'47), ought to be con
 sidered, according to the researches of M. Delaunay, as altogether
                                                                         **
 insensible, if not absolutely nothing.
    This conclusion, which is moreover perfectly in accordance with
 the announcement of the illustrious geometrician Poisson, published
 more than twenty-seven years ago in his memoir of 1833, gives rise
 to several questions of extreme importance, not only, as it seems to
 me, with respect to the perfection of the lunar tables, but also on the
 subject of scientific priority, and even of national honour.           In order
 that the members of the       Academy      may   be able to  judge  of this for
 themselves, it will be sufficient to mention that the principal cor
 rections which the astronomers of the Greenwich Observatory have
 thought it necessary to make in the precious tables of our fellow
 countryman Damoiseau—tables which are so remarkable from the
 fact that they are the first that were constructed from theory alone,
 without recourse to observation,-and the preference which they have
 accorded to the new lunar tables of Professor Hansen, are principally
 founded on the existence (considered by them to be conclusively
 demonstrated) of the two inequalities arising from the action of
 Venus, which M. Delaunay has just calculated.               To this it will be
 sufficient to add that it was on these grounds that the extraordinary
prize of £1000 was allotted to the same Professor by the Lords of
the Admiralty, at the suggestion of the learned director of the Green
wich Observatory, for the really marvellous addition, as Mr. Airy
calls     which  it,   has made        the lunar theory.

                               communicated to the Society cer
  tain      observations, which appeared of interest because they
give some information respecting the chemical composition of the
solar atmosphere, and point the way to further knowledge on
this subject.   These observations led to the conclusion that a
flame whose spectrum consists of bright lines is partially opake
for rays of light of the colour of these lines, whilst it is perfectly
transparent for             all
                       other light.                         In
                                          this statement we find the
explanation       of

brought into flame, produces bright lines coincident with the

A  difference of quality is noticed amongst the rays of light, not
only in respect to the colour, but also in respect to the state of
polarization.   Hence not only have we to distinguish the heating
rays according to the wave-lengths, but we have also to divide
rays of one wave-length into those variously polarized.            we                         If
take into consideration these various kinds of rays of heat, the
conclusions which we had drawn concerning the relation between
the powers of absorption and emission cease to be binding.
  Whether this relation is still found to exist when these variations
are taken into consideration, is a question which has, as yet, not
been decided either by theoretical considerations or by an appeal
to experiment.         I
                    have succeeded in filling up this gap; and                                     I
have found that the proposition concerning the ratio between the
power of emission and the power of absorption remains true,
however different the rays which the bodies emit may be, as long
as the notions of emissive and absorptive powers be confined to
one kind of ray.
                                     I
   The proposition which have discovered may be thus more
precisely defined:—Let a body C be placed behind two screens
S1 and S2, in which two small openings are made. Through these
openings a pencil of rays proceeds from the body C. Of these
rays we consider that portion which corresponds to a given wave
length  \,  and we divide this into two polarized components,
whose planes of polarization are two planes a and b at right
angles to each other, passing through the axis of the pencil of
rays.    Let the intensity of the polarized component a be E
(emissive power).    Now suppose that a pencil of rays, having a
wave-length = A, and polarized in the plane a, falls through the
openings 2 and 1 upon the body C. The fraction of this pencil
which is absorbed by the body C is called A (absorptive power).
Then the
             relation; is independent of the position,                                  size, and
nature of the body C, and is alone determined by the size of the
openings 1 and 2, by the wave-length X, and by the tempera
ture. I will point out the way in which                       I
                                               have proved this pro
position.     Ibegan by considering that bodies are conceivable

    The following              is,

 law  of  angular   currents,     the two currents will repel each other.
In    this case the current            being the moveable one,

repel each other. The combined influence                       the currents      of                                 Pa

250             Prof. Challis on Theories of Magnetism
any two sections of the current attract each other when the current
is passing, is always as the amount of the resistance which opposes
this attraction. The attraction must always exceed the resist
ance, or else there can be no current. What does all this mean
if we do not admit that the sections of the current mutually
attract each other ?
    The same difference of electric state exists in the various sec
tions of the pile itself; for we know that there is always an ex
cess of positive electricity at the one pole, and of negative at the
other, and these electricities must tend to unite through the pile
itself.   But there is opposed to the attractive force of the elec
tricities for uniting, not only the resistance in the pile itself, but
also the electromotive force which decomposes the electricity.
This electromotive force must always exceed the attraction of the
electricities: this must be admitted; for unless the force which
separates the electricities is greater than the attractive force
which tends to unite them, there could be no decomposition of
the electricity, and of course no current.
   In the pile itself there are two forces—one tending to unite
the various sections of the current, and the other tending to
separate them; the latter force being the strongest, the sections
of the current in the pile will mutually repel each other. In the
external conductor which unites the poles of the pile, the latter
force has no existence; hence the various sections of the current
in the conductor are mutually attractive.          By virtue of the
repulsion in the pile and the attraction in the conductor, the
electricity decomposes in the former and unites in the latter; and
this constitutes what we call an electric current.
XXXIX.       On Theories of Magnetism and other Forces, in reply to
   Remarks by Professor Maxwell.           By J. CHALLIs, F.R.S.,
   F.R.A.S., Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Eaperimental
   Philosophy in the University of Cambridge*.
    N   an article on “Molecular Vortices applied to Magnetic
       Phenomena,” contained in the March Number of the Phi
losophical Magazine, Professor Maxwell has made, respecting
certain points of the general physical theory which     I have lately
proposed, some remarks which call for a reply.        I refer chiefly
to two paragraphs in p. 163, the first of which is as follows:—
 “Currents, issuing from the north pole and entering the south
pole of a magnet, or circulating round an electric current, have
the advantage of representing correctly the geometrical arrange
 ment of the lines of force, if we could account for the pheno

                                        and other Forces.                              -        251
mena   of attraction, or for the currents themselves, or explain
their continued existence.”         The generation of such currents                               I
have   explained    on  hydrodynamical      principles in my theories of
galvanism and magnetism, as also in that of electricity. They
are shown to be secondary currents, which are always produced
when a uniform primary current traverses a medium, in which
there is a gradation of density, such as that which must exist
from the top to the bottom of a heavy mass resting on a hori
zontal plane, in order that the force of gravity on the individual
particles may be counteracted. The primary currents are ascribed
exclusively to motions of the aether caused by the rotations of
the earth and of the other bodies of the solar system about their
axes.    As this is a constant cause, the streams are constant.
The retention of an induced state of gradation of density from
end to end, is considered to be the distinctive property of a
magnetized bar. The observed attractions and repulsions are
satisfactorily accounted for by the variation of the fluid pressure
from point to point of space in the secondary currents considered
as instances of steady motion, such variation, together with the
dynamical effect of the currents, producing differences of pres
sure at different points of the surfaces of the atoms of which
the substances attracted or repelled are supposed to consist.
Thus the three explanations which Professor Maxwell considers
to be requisite respecting currents to which the phenomena of
galvanism and magnetism are attributed, are in fact given by
my general theory quite consistently with                        its
                                                      original hypotheses.
    The other paragraph commences thus:—“Undulations issuing
from   a  centre would, according                 to
                                            the calculations       Professor      of
 Challis, produce          an
                           effect similar      attraction
                                                       to      the direction in
of centre.”
   a             I   consider that both central attraction and central
repulsion are accounted for                  by
                                      my calculations. Professor Max
well then adduces the       following   objection:-‘‘Admitting this                              to
 be  true, we know that two series            undulations traversing the
                                                   of
same space       donot combine into one resultant                          as
                                                             two attractions
 do, but produce           effect depending
                            an                               on                   of
                                                                                                 2 as

called q being in this case insignificant.   Now, whatever be the
phases of the several component functions, the non-periodic part
of the square of their sum is equal to the sum of the non-periodic
parts of the squares of the separate functions. In the case of
attractive action, according to the investigation given in the
Mathematical Theory of Attractive Forces contained in the Phi
losophical Magazine for November 1859, the motion of trans
lation depends on the value of q, and on the product of W and
 dà'       But it is easily seen that if W have the form                                    above
assigned, the non-periodic part of the product for the sum of
the terms is the sum of the non-periodic parts of the products
for the component terms taken separately, independently of
their phases.   In short, as we are only concerned with squares
of circular functions, the mutual interferences by difference of
phase do not come under consideration.       On this account the
dynamical effects of two series of undulations from separate
sources, take place independently of each other, and combine
according to the laws of the composition of accelerative forces.
To the additional objection, that, “if the series of undulations be
allowed to proceed, they diverge from each other without any
mutual action,”         I
                   can make no reply, because        do not under        I
stand  it.   can only conclude that

                                    maintain, these are phenomena
which ultimately may receive explanations by means of aetherial
undulations and currents, and therefore ought not to be put in
the same category.
                     I
    As the article have been referring to contains a theory of
magnetic phenomena wholly different from that which              have            I
advanced, it may be worth while to point out a difference in
principle between the fundamental hypotheses of the two theories.
Professor Maxwell assumes the existence of a magnetic medium,
which is not fluid, but “mobile,” and which acts along lines of
magnetic force by stress combined with hydrostatic pressure; in
other words, there is greater pressure in the equatorial, than in
the axial, direction of the magnetic field. To account for this
difference of pressure, it is assumed that “molecular vortices”
circulate about axes parallel to the lines of magnetic force. Why
they are called “molecular” is not expressly stated in this arti
cle; but it may be gathered from other of the author’s writings,
that he conceives the matter of the vortices to consist of mole
cules which by their motions may come into collision, the result
ing dynamic effect depending on the number and frequency of
such collisions.    It is not my intention to criticise these hypo
theses, which have been adduced merely for the sake of remarking
that, as they are of a particular character, and have been framed
apparently with special reference to observed laws of magnetic
phenomena, the results of a mathematical investigation founded
on them can hardly amount to more than an empirical expression
of those laws. After           all
                             that can      done  be this kind    by re               of

    These results might lead us to infer that a satellite which had
 been introduced into the region of instability by the action of a
 resisting medium, must undergo a sudden and not a gradual
 dismemberment.          Before embracing this opinion, however, a few
 modifying circumstances should be considered.                The change in
 the  figure  of the  body   must increase the time of rotation, while
 the diminished size of the orbit calls for a shorter period of re
 volution; and the synchronism of the diurnal and progressive
 movements will be destroyed.           But we may safely assert that
 the effects of the    resisting  medium in producing this change are
 exceedingly small compared with the influence of tidal action in
 keeping the same side of the satellite always turned to                  pri                      its
 mary, especially when the distance from the latter became very
 small. The result              in
                             such cases must be        little different for a                             a

272   Mr. D. Vaughan on the Stability of Satellites in small Orbits,
effecting    a simultaneous               dilapidation    of the entire planetary
structure.
   I have    regarded           it as important to trace the precise manner in
which these sublime catastrophes must take place; not so much
on account of their connexion with the existence of planetary
rings, as for the light which they throw on the nature of
temporary stars.    In an article published in the Supplemental
Number of the Philosophical Magazine for December 1858,                                       I
maintained that these singular displays of stellar brilliancy were
great meteoric displays in the atmospheres, or rather the dormant
photospheres, of dark central bodies of space, as they were tra
versed by the wrecks of dilapidated worlds. . The same theory
has been set forth in my paper presented to the British Associa
tion in 1857; and                I
                       have endeavoured in other publications to
support it with satisfactory proof. But the most conclusive evi
dence on which it depends, is to be derived from the instanta
neous manner in which the attendant of a dark central body
must undergo a total dismemberment, as it explains the sudden
manner in which these celestial curiosities are ushered into exist
ence with       all

But the size of the smallest orbits might fall considerably below
this limit, in consequence of the rupture of many of the frag
 ments at their least distances from the primary, either by the
 attraction of that body, or by the heat evolved when they are
 transformed into blazing meteoric masses.
      The condition which matter must ultimately assume in the
 central zone, where it can no longer exist as one great satellite
 or in a limited number of smaller ones, must depend in some
 degree on the form of the primary planet.                  If this body be an
 oblate spheroid, considerably flattened by rapid rotation, as is
 the case with Saturn, the orbits of the several fragments must
 be subject to apsidal motion, to an extent depending on their
 transverse axes and excentricities.           Accordingly those fragments
 describing the same track will be equally affected by                   and will  it,
 form  a   line which remains unbroken during many revolutions.

is   evident that both must ultimately become circular; and the
 fragmentary host will           length exhibit the nearest approxima

without such a theory it is evident that no general and concur
rent laws or relations can be established between phenomena of
Motion, as distinguished from phenomena of Growth. Attrac
tions (gravic, electric, and magnetic) and Waves (acoustic, optic,
and thermotic) are the motions offered by Physics for explana
tion by mechanical forces, or conditions of pressure.    The con
stitution and combination of bodies are the phenomena of which
Chemics require a similar mechanical interpretation.         These

   6. The special application of this principle is less to pheno
mena than to physical hypotheses.            For as Force is thus
conceived, not as an absolute entity acting upon matter, but
as a condition of the parts of matter itself, and as a condition
determined by the relative masses and distances of these parts,
any valid hypothesis of a force or of a motion to account
for any set of phenomena is thus seen to imply an assertion
as to relative masses and distances which can be more or less
readily submitted to experiment or observation and analysis.
And hypotheses of Forces which, like electric and magnetic
fluids, or “uniform elastic ethers, the sole source of physical
power”,” exist absolutely, and are not merely expressions of facts
of mass- and distance-difference, are by this principle rejected as
unscientific. “Lorsg’une branche de la Physique mathématique

thèse restrictive, elle entre réellement dans une phase nouvelle.

some obscurity of thought to speak of “intrinsic or absolute
inertia.”
   The law of the Composition of Motions is but an extension of
that of Inertia”.    For the compounding of a motion is but the
beginning of another motion; and the change in velocity and
line of motion of the particle due to each force (difference of
pressure) is the same as if the others did not act.
   There seems to be a clearer conception afforded of uniform
and accelerated motion by referring these phenomena, as by this
principle, to their actual physical conditions.
   9. The application of this principle leads to the following
theorem suggestive of an explanation of the apparent effect and
non-effect of the resisting medium on the comets and planets
respectively.
   According as the resultant of a resisting medium passes or
not through the centre of gravity of a revolving body is it an
accelerating force of revolution, or a partially neutralized accele
rating force of rotation.
   If  the medium is uniform, or if—though it varies in density,
according to some such law as that with so great probability
assumed for the solar medium, viz. inversely as the square of the
distance from the central bodyt—the face of the revolving body
is so small that the resultant of the resisting pressures thereon
passes infinitesimally near the centre of gravity of the whole
body, it may be easily proved that such a resultant of resistance
will act as an accelerating force, which, did the body move on a
solid surface, would retard                   its
                                   revolution, but which,            moves                     as

278                        Mr.      J. S.     Stuart Glennie on the
dent that a' will act as an
accelerating force             of rota
tion in the direction 8;
and that this rotation will
be retarded, and a' partly
neutralized by the resist
ance in the direction 8.
   10. In the actual case
of the planets,their masses
and velocities of rotation
are such that the solar medium can be of course conceived, not
as causing, but only as tending slightly to accelerate their
rotations. And a problem is by this theorem suggested of ex
treme interest, but also, in the present state of hydrodynamics,
of extreme difficulty, as to how far this accelerating force of rota
tion is neutralized. The earth’s rotation has been hitherto
considered and proved to be invariable, only in respect of the
action of the sun and moon; and it is to be remembered that
doubts have been thrown on                       its
                                      actual invariability even during
the short period        4000 years; that one-tenth

 and opposite differences of polar pressures on two rigidly con
nected points; the condition of compound Translation and Ro
 tation is unequal and opposite differences of polar pressures on
two rigidly connected points; and the relation between the
former and the latter depends on the distance between the centre
 of gravity of the body and the point of application of the result
ant of such unequal opposite forces.
    12. In explanation of this principle, it will be sufficient to
remark that it is merely an expression of the ideas of a single
force at the centre of gravity, a couple, and a single force not at
the centre of gravity, in terms of the above general physical con
ception of a Force.
    13. The latter paragraph suggests the following general pro
blem:-Given a force which, acting instantaneously at the centre
of gravity of a body of a given mass in a vacuum, gives it a cer
tain velocity: what are the different relations between the velo
city of revolution and that of rotation when the same body is
struck at certain different distances from the centre of gravity,

the first step towards a rational is the discovery of an empirical
law of the rotations, in which such an element as the inclination
of the rotation axis to the plane of revolution (easily calculable
except for the two innermost and two outermost planets) would
evidently be involved.
    Such a law seems pointed to by the regularity of the decrease
 of the rotations, when the angular, instead of the linear velocities
 or times are considered.    The respective angular velocities of
 rotation of the inner  family  are 29811, 26902, 26181, and
 •25879; and of Jupiter and Saturn, 63313 and 59907 re
 spectively.
     15. The attempts            I
                         have made to discover the law of the pla
 netary rotations have had as yet no complete result+.    But the
 following incidental observation with regard to the angular velo
 cities of revolution and the distances may perhaps be worth noting
 towards such a theory of the formation of the system as above
 alluded to.
    By Kepler's third law,
                      P=cDº; whence;              Ol'
                                                        •=&#
 But under this law there might, in comparing successive velo
 cities and distances, be found relations of inequality ad infinitum.
 The actual relations may, however, be thus expressed:—The
 angular velocities of revolution and the distances are in inverse
 geometrical progressions with inverse differences, except the in
 nermost planet of each family.
    To say that the distances are in geometrical progression, each
 nearer planet being half the distance of the next more remotet,
 or that the angular velocities of revolution are in geometrical
 progression, each nearer planet revolving with twice the velocity
 of the next more remote, would be very far from accurate; but
 it seems interesting to observe, as by this law, that when the
 distance of a planet is more than twice that of the next inner,
 its angular velocity   rotationof less than half that
                                           is              the next       of
inner, and vice versd. And that the only exceptions        this rule       to
should    bethe innermost  planet    each family,
                                           of     viz. Mercury  and
Jupiter, appears significant.

 position that the surrounding medium is put into such a state
 that at every point the pressures are different in different direc
 tions, the direction of least pressure being that of the observed
 lines of force, and the difference of greatest and least pressures
 being proportional to the square of the intensity of the force at
 that point.
    Such a state of stress, if assumed to exist in the medium, and
 to be arranged according to the known laws regulating lines of
                                                                                                               .
force, will act upon the magnets, currents, &c. in the field with
precisely the same resultant forces as those calculated on the
ordinary hypothesis of direct action at a distance.         This is true
independently of any particular theory as to the cause of this
state of stress, or the mode in which it can be sustained in the
medium.       We have therefore a satisfactory answer to the ques
tion, “Is there any mechanical hypothesis as to the condition of
the medium indicated by lines of force, by which the observed
resultant forces may be accounted for ?” The answer                  the                            is,

    The second question must be, “What             the mechanical cause  is

     We found that the velocity                   of   the circumference            of   each vortex

     We know that the lines of force are affected by electric cur
rents, and we know the distribution of those lines about a cur
rent; so that from the force we can determine the amount of the
current. Assuming that our explanation of the lines of force
by molecular vortices is correct, why does a particular distribu
tion of vortices indicate an electric current                A satisfactory
answer to this question would lead us a long way towards that
of a very important one, “What is an electric current?”
     I have found great difficulty in conceiving of the existence of
vortices in a medium, side by side, revolving in the same direc
tion about parallel axes. The contiguous portions of consecu
tive vortices must be moving in opposite directions; and it is
difficult to understand how the motion of one part of the medium
can coexist with, and even produce, an opposite motion of a part
in contact with it.

  We have thus determined three quantities, F, G, H, from which
we can find P, Q, and R by considering these latter quantities
as the rates at which the former ones vary. In the paper already
referred to,       I
               have given reasons for considering the quantities
F, G, H as the resolved parts of that which Faraday has conjec
tured to exist, and has called the electrotonic state.  In that
paper    I
        have stated the mathematical relations between this elec
trotonic state and the lines of magnetic force as expressed in
equations (55), and also between the electrotonic state and elec
tromotive force as expressed in equations (58). We must now
endeavour to interpret them from a mechanical point of view
in connexion with our hypothesis.
   We shall in the first place examine the process by which the
lines of force are produced by an electric current.

A B  represent the vortices, and                               let
                                           the small circles separating
the vortices  represent   the layers    particles placed between them,

which    inour hypothesis represent      electricity.
   Now let         an
                 electric current from left         right commence          to                                 in

 malleable.      The addition of 15 per cent. of acid yielded an alloy
 which might be considered as steel. It was very hard, but was
not sufficiently malleable. With 20 per cent. the hardness was
 still greater, but the malleability much less.
    The iron in these experiments was grey iron, and contained a
considerable quantity of graphite, and it was found that with
white iron a different result was obtained.           The experiments
were made in the same         way  as the previous  ones;  it was found
that an alloy was only formed when charcoal dust was added;
otherwise the tungstic acid sintered together, and very little tung
sten combined with the iron.          The alloy obtained with the addi
tion of charcoal had none of the appearance of steel; it was
white on fracture, had the structure of the iron used, and was
imperfectly malleable.
    With an addition of tungstic acid in the proportion of 75 per
cent. no regulus was obtained.           Analogous experiments were
made with the minerals Wolfram and Scheelite, and similar
results were obtained. The manganese present in Wolfram exerted
a considerable influence on the result; and with Scheelite the
lime combines with the silica to form a slag, so that the alloy is
purer.
    It  follows from these experiments, that it is not the carbon
present     in the iron in a state of chemical combination which
reduces the tungstic acid, but that which is mechanically inter
mingled.       From white cast iron no carbon is withdrawn by the
tungstic acid, and accordingly no steel is obtained if charcoal be
not added.
    The waste cast-iron turnings of the workshop may hence be
used for preparing directly a cast steel, to which the tungsten
imparts great hardness; or if the iron does not contain too
much sulphur, phosphorus, or silica, a very useful rough cast
steel may be obtained by fusing it directly with a quantity of
powdered Wolfram proportionate to the per-centage of carbon
which it contains.
    The author determined the carbon in these alloys by three
methods.       In the first, a piece of the alloy was laid upon a fused
cake of chloride of silver, and was left for several days, covered
with distilled water.       In this way the iron gradually dissolved;
and when the decomposition was complete, the charcoal and
tungsten were collected on an asbestos filter, dried and weighed,
and then the carbon determined in the usual way by combustion
with oxide of copper.        In another case the alloy was decomposed
by chloride of copper, and in a third case it was digested with
iodine until the iron was dissolved.         In these cases the carbon
contained in the      alloy amounted to about 1 per cent.
    Experiments to alloy tungsten with other metals were also

not  homogeneous;       the individual particles could           distinctly               be
seen.      In general      was also found that

                                              to   a
amorphous became crystalline.       Similar results were obtained
by  using the high temperature           stoneware furnace, which
                                                        of   a

ably protected platinum crucibles, and heated for periods varying
from eighteen     seventy-two hours.

                                     to   a
result was confirmed; part had sublimed      fine crystallimelaminæ.

hydrogen, and found that they had the same per-centage com
position, WO”. They must therefore be regarded as two iso
meric modifications of the same acid, of which the yellow is
formed both in the moist and in the dry way, but in the latter
case only at a low temperature; while the green variety is only
formed in the dry way and at a high temperature.        The latter
he proposes to call pyrotungstic acid, in antithesis to Scheibler's
acid”, which is metatungstic acid.   Including the ordinary acid,
there are therefore three varieties.
   Bernoulli has made a new determination of the equivalent of
tungsten, both by oxidizing tungsten, and by reducing tungstic
acid.   He obtained results varying within very narrow limits,
which lead to the number 93.4 as that of the equivalent.
Dumas had obtained the number 92+.
   Bernoulli finally discusses the formula of the natural tung
states, and attempts to show that the two modifications of
tungstic acid also occur in nature.      He adduces a great many
analyses of Wolfram.      Most of them contain a certain quantity
of lime and magnesia, which he considers accidental constituents.
But in most cases a niobic acid is present—in the tungsten from
Zinnwald          l’l
               per cent. ; this is to be regarded as replacing part
of the tungstic acid, with which it is therefore isomorphous.
   The author finally describes the mode of analysing the tung
sten minerals.
   Engaged in investigating the methods of working up the pla
tinum residues for the Russian Government, Deville and Debray
had occasion to examine the different methods of preparing
oxygen on a large scale.         They find<U+017F> that sulphate of zinc,
which, as a waste product, is now so plentiful, furnishes an eco
nomical source of this gas. When calcined in an earthen vessel,
it is converted into light white oxide, which, when the sulphate
is pure, may be used for painting. The temperature required
for  itsdecomposition does not exceed that necessary for binoxide
of  manganese.      The other products            the decomposition are

a cooler which condenses the water, and then through a washer
of a special form. In this way pure and inodorous gas is ob
tained, and a solution of sulphurous acid, which may be changed
either into sulphite or hyposulphite of soda, or may be used in
the sulphuric acid chambers.     The expense of oxygen prepared
by this plan is very small; for the method consists essentially in
abstracting oxygen from the atmosphere. Even if the sulphurous
acid were not utilized, sulphuric acid would still be the cheapest

Riche's monochlorinated acetone, and with chloride of pro
pionyle.
   Monohydrochloric glycide combines directly with fuming hy
drochloric acid to form dihydrochloric glycide, C*H*Cl*: this body
may also be formed by acting on hydrochloric glycide with pen
tachloride of phosphorus, an action which gives rise to the forma
tion of trihydrochloric glycerine,

and this, decomposed by potash, loses hydrochloric acid, and the
new body is formed,
                       C6H5 Cl3–HCl–C6H4CI2.
This body is identical with what Berthelot has called epibrom
hydrine. It is metameric with bichlorinated propylene, and
with Geuther's chloride of acroleine.                Similar compounds con
taining bromine and iodine were also obtained.
   By the action of ammonia on bihydrochloric glycide a base is
formed, which the author considers identical with that obtained
by the action of ammonia on terbromide of allyle.
   Hydrochloric glycide unites directly with the oxyacids to form
a glyceric  ether, containing an equivalent of oxyacid and of hy
dracid.   Thus,

   By the action of water, hydrochloric glycide fixes two equi

are transformed into mixed glyceric ethers, containing an equi

  When these bodies are treated with potash, hydrochloric acid is
  removed, and the resultant compound, ethylglycide, is a glycide
  containing the alcohol radical in the place of an equivalent of
  hydrogen:—

                    ethylglycerine.
     Ethylglycide is a mobile liquid boiling at 128°. When treated
  with hydrochloric acid, it yields the compoundCº Hº (C*H*)ClO4.
  If the compound hydrochloric amylglycerine be treated with
  ethylate of soda, ethylamylglycerine is formed. Thus,                             -

  The glyceric ethers containing two equivalents of the same acid
  are only a particular case of this reaction.
     When hydrochloric glycide is acted upon by hydrosulphate of
  sulphide of potassium, a compound is obtained analogous to
  mercaptan,
             C6H5C1024-         KSHS-KCl + C6H6                    S2 O2.

    A second   mercaptan in this series is doubtless formed by the
  action of dihydrochloric glycide on hydrosulphate of sulphide of
  potassium, and which would have the formula C*H*S*.

      the year 1850 Professor Hofmann placed at my disposal
  IN upwards  of 10 lbs. of the seleniferous deposit from the
  sulphuric acid manufactory at Tilkerode in the Hartz Mountains,
  for the purpose of extracting from it the selenium, which was
  afterwards employed in an investigation upon the selenocyanidest.
  Some residues which were left in the purification of the crude
  selenium, and which from their reactions appeared to contain
  tellurium, were collected together and placed aside for examina
  tion at a more convenient opportunity. They remained unnoticed
  until the beginning of the present year, whem, requiring some
  tellurium for experimental purposes,     attempted      I

302         Mr. W. Crookes                   on the existence          of a          new Element,
strongly-marked line which might lead to the identification of
either of these elements, it was not until      had in vain tried                I
numerous chemical methods for isolating the tellurium which                                                       I
supposed to be present, that the method of spectrum-analysis was
used. A portion of the residue, introduced into a blue gas-flame,
gave abundant evidence of selenium; but as the alternate light
and dark bands due to this element became fainter, and was                                             I
expecting the appearance of the somewhat similar, but closer,
bands of tellurium, suddenly a bright green line flashed into view
and as quickly disappeared.    An isolated green line in this por
tion of the spectrum was new to me.        had become intimately       I
acquainted with the appearances of most of the artificial spectra
during many years’ investigation, and had never before met with
a similar line to             this; and as from the chemical processes through
which this residue had passed the elements which could possibly
be present were limited to a few, it became of interest to discover
which of them occasioned this green line.
    After numerous experiments,                        I
                                          have been led to the conclu
sion that it is caused by the presence of a new element belong
ing to the sulphur group; but, unfortunately, the quantity of
material upon which                     I
                             have been able to experiment has been
so  small,               I

  apparatus by myself and many friends. Not a trace of such a line
  is shown by either of them in the green part of the spectrum,
  Antimony, arsenic, and osmium, in fact, giving continuous spectra,
  in which every colour is visible. The remaining elements, sele
  nium and tellurium, might almost be dismissed unchallenged,
                          I
  inasmuch as was first led to the examination by finding that it
  was not either of these. Nevertheless I have, as stated at the
  commencement of this paper, repeatedly examined their spectra,
  and find no trace of such a line, the alternate light and dark
  bands in the almost continuous spectra of selenium and tellurium
  forming in fact so strong a contrast to the one single green ray
  of the new substance, that the latter may readily be detected in
  the presence of an enormous excess of either of the former.
         In
        order to remove any remaining doubt which there might
  be as to the green line being due to any of the elements men
 tioned in the above list,                    I
                               have, moreover, specially examined the
  spectra produced by each of these bodies in detail, either in their
  elementary state, or in their most important compounds.         Many
 of them give rise to spectra of great and characteristic beauty,
 but none give anything like the green line; nor, in fact, is there
 any artificial spectrum, except that of sodium, which equals it in
  simplicity.
     There still may be urged the possibility of    being compound             its         a

       In the Phimgota Valley (a continuation of the great Kangra or
     Palum Valley) the drift consists of sand and shingle with boulders of
     gneiss, schist, porphyry, and trap, from 6 inches to 5 feet in diameter.
     Some of the boulders, having a red vitreous glaze, occur in irregular
     beds. This moraine-like drift lies on the tertiary beds, which, here
     dipping gently towards the plains, gradually become vertical, and
     are succeeded by variegated compact sandstones, gradually inclining
     away from the plains; next come various slates, at a high angle; and
     gneissic rocks    lie
                        immediately over them.

  On the Altered Rocks of the W.estern and Central Highlands.           307
 of Scotland coloured according to the new classification, and by
 numerous sections.      Everywhere throughout this tract it could be
 proved that an older gneiss, which the authors called “Laurentian,”
 was overlain unconformably by red Cambrian sandstones; these again
 unconformably by quartz-rocks, limestones, and a gneissose and
 schistose series of strata, as previously shown in the typical district of
 Assynt. From the base of these quartz-rocks a perfect conformable
 sequence was shown to exist upward into the gneissose rocks, which
is not obliterated by granite or any similar rock.
    The tract between the Atlantic and the Great Glen consists,
 according to the authors, of a series of convoluted folds of the upper
gneissose rocks, until, along the line of the Great Glen, the under
lying quartzose series is brought up on an anticlinal axis. A pro
longation of this axis probably exists along part of the west coast of
Islay and Jura, two islands which exhibit a grand development of
the lower or quartzose portion of the altered Silurian rocks of the
Highlands.
   From the line of the Great Glen north-eastward to the Highland
border, the country was explained as consisting of a great series of
anticlinal and synclinal curves, whereby the same series of altered
rocks which occurs on the north-west is repeated upon itself.          One
synclinal runs in a N.E. and S.W. direction across Loch Leven.
The anticlinal of quartzose rocks that rises from under it to the S.E.
spreads over the Breadalbane Forest to the Glen Lyon Mountains,
where it sinks below the upper gneissose strata with their associated
limestones.     Ben Lawers occupies the synclinal formed by these
upper strata; and the limestones and quartz-rock come up again in
another anticlinal axis corresponding with the direction of Loch
Tay. The continuity of these lines of axis was traced both to the
N.E. and S.W.
   It thus appeared that the crystalline rocks of the Highlands are
capable of reduction to order; that the same curves and folds could
be traced in them as in their less altered equivalents of the South of
Scotland; and that in what had hitherto appeared as little else than
a hopeless chaos, there yet reigned a regular and beautiful simplicity.
   In conclusion, Sir Roderick       Murchison vindicated the accuracy
of his   published  sections in the N.W. of Sutherland, which had
been   approved   after personal inspection by Professors Ramsay and
Harkness; and he gave detailed reasons for disbelieving the accu
racy of the sections recently put forth by Prof. Nicol, which were
intended as corrections of his own.          He concluded by affirming
that, through the aid of Mr. Geikie, the proofs of the truthful
ness of his own sections, showing a conformable ascending order
from the quartz-rocks and limestones into crystalline and micaceous
rocks, had now been extended over such large areas that there could
no longer be any misgivings on the subject.

V.P.G.S., and A. Geikie, Esq., F.G.S.
   Allusion was, in the first place, made to the early opinions of
Hutton and Macculloch, who regarded the gneissic and schistose
rocks of the Highlands as stratified. Mr. Darwin's views of the na
ture of the “foliation” of gneiss and schist were then referred to :
and it was insisted that this condition was not to be found in the
rocks of the Highlands,-the so-called “foliation ” which the late
Mr. D. Sharpe had described in 1846 as characterizing the crystal
line rocks of that country being, according to the authors, really
mineralized stratification.     It was then pointed out that, as Prof.
Sedgwick had previously insisted on the wide difference between
“foliated” or “schistose” and “cleaved” or “slaty” rocks, and as
Prof. Ramsay had in 1840 recognized interlaminated quartz as being
parallel to stratification in the Isle of Arran, “foliation” should be
regarded as coincident with stratification, and not with cleavage, in
the Scottish Highlands.
   After some observations on the occurrence of cleavage in slates
at Dunkeld, Easdale, Ballahulish, and near the Spittal of Glenshee,
the authors stated their belief that            the “foliation  all   the cry          ”   of

  geologists to regard them as occupying an extremely low position
  among the sedimentary series, and to apply to them the Wernerian
  term “primitive.”     Many of Macculloch's descriptions, however,
  show that this assumed low position is not the true place of this
 gneiss among the sedimentary rocks which make up the Highlands
 of Scotland.
     In a section from the southern flank of the Grampians to Loch
 Earn (and in other sections, from Loch Earn to Loch Tay, from
 Dunkeld to Blair Athol, in the Ben y Gloe Mountains, in Glen
 Shee, &c.), there is seen a sequence which indicates that this gneiss
 is the highest portion of the series of rocks, with underlying quartz
 rock and limestone.
     In the county of Donegal, Ireland, a like sequence is seen. A
 section from Inishowen Head to Malin Head, along the east side of
 Loch Foyle, presents us with gneissose rocks above limestone and
 quartz-rocks, exactly as in Scotland.        In no portion of Scotland
 south of the Caledonian    Canal,  nor in the North of Ireland, did the
 author recognize any trace of the “fundamental gneiss.”
    March   6, 1861.-Leonard Horner, Esq., President, in the Chair.
    The following communications were read:—
     1. “On the Succession of Beds in the Hastings Sand in the
 Northern portion of the Wealden Area.” By F. Drew, Esq., F.G.S.,
 of the Geological Survey of Great Britain.
    Having first referred to the division of the Wealden beds by former
 authors into the “Weald Clay,” the “Hastings Sand,” and the
 “Ashburnham Beds,” and the subdivision of the “Hastings Sand” by
 Dr. Mantell into “Horsted Sands,” “Tilgate Beds,” and “Worth
 Sands,” and having defined the district under notice as lying be
 tween and in the neighbourhood of the towns of Tenterden, Cran
 brook, Tunbridge, Tunbridge Wells, East Grinstead, and Horsham,
 Mr. Drew proceeded to describe, first, the several beds in the meri
dian and vicinity of Tunbridge Wells.         The Weald Clay is at least
600 feet thick in this district, and is underlain by sands and sand
stones, termed by the author the “Tunbridge Wells Sand,” on ac
count of its being well exposed there. This subdivision is about
 180 feet thick, and was described in detail,      an important feature
being the “rock-sand,” or massive sandstone forming the picturesque
natural rocks of the neighbourhood.        The shales and clays under
lying these sands form the “Wadhurst Clay” of the author, and are
at places 160 feet thick. This subdivision has yielded much iron
stone in former times.       It is underlain by other sand and sand
stones, more than 250 feet thick, also yielding ironstone.        These
are termed “Ashdown Sand” by Mr. Drew on account of their
forming the heights of Ashdown Forest.
    Eastward of the meridian of Tunbridge Wells Mr. Drew has found

the same sequence of beds, and he believes a similar succession to
occur around Battle and Hastings.         Westward of Tunbridge Wells
as far as East    Grinstead,    the same beds occur, but beyond that
the Weald    Clay and  Tunbridge     Wells Sand alone are exposed; and
the latter is here divided into   upper and lower beds by shale and clay
(termed “Grinstead      Clay  ”  by the author), which thicken westward
to 50 feet and more.       It is the “Lower Tunbridge Wells Sand”
that forms natural rocks near Grinstead. Near Horsham the Weald
Clay contains, at about 120 feet from its base, bands of stone known
as the “Horsham Stone,” used for roofing and paving.
   The author then explained at large the grounds on which he
proposed to replace Dr. Mantell's term “Horsted Sands” by “Upper
Tunbridge Wells Sand,” that of “Worth Sands” by “Lower Tun
bridge Wells Sand,” and that of “Tilgate Beds” by “Wadhurst
Clay,” and his reason for proposing the name of “Ashdown " for
the next lowest bed of the “Hastings Sand.”
   The paper concluded with a description of some of the chief litho
logical characters of the clays and sandstones of the Wealden area
under notice.

    It will be seen that, up to six pairs, the numbers in the fifth column,
expressing the force of the current in grains at the poles of the needle,
 vary very nearly in the same ratio as the tangents of the angles of
deflection on the tangent galvanometer reduced to a comparable form
in the sixth column. With twelve pairs, however, the weight re
quired to balance the current is 49.5, or very nearly 50 grains;
whereas, according to the tangent galvanometer, it should not have
 exceeded 40 grains.           Reflecting on this anomaly, the writer could
 only arrive at the conclusion that the needle, surrounded by a very
powerful current in such a large coil, ceased to act as a permanent
 magnet, and was temporarily charged with a higher magnetism                                      in
 duced by the current itself.               Subsequent experiments completely
 confirmed this conclusion; and he was led to examine the subject
more minutely by observing that the needle, after being several times
subjected to the action of the current from twelve pairs, appeared to
 have lost its permanent magnetism; for he afterwards found re
peatedly that when the index was brought back by successive
 increments of weight to 40°, the smallest possible additional weight
 sent it back to zero. Before taking out the needle to ascertain
 this, he submitted it a second time to the action of six and twelve
 pairs, with the following results:—

 originally it supported 22:50 and 49-50 grains respectively. The
needle was then taken out, and was found to have almost entirely

now only with the greatest precaution that it lifted 2 grains. But

The writer had therefore little doubt that, if not merely demagnetized,
but formed of soft iron, the needle, when placed in a favourable
position, would turn with a force proportional to the square of the
current; whereas it plainly appears from Table               long                                   I.,

with a force which        exceeds the estimated amount by 47 grains,
whereas the soft iron needle,       under the same current force, falls
short of the calculated amount by 11:4 grains. The last effect is
probably attributable to the fact that, as the needle approaches satu
ration, the law of the squares gradually merges into the law of
simple proportion.        The writer regrets that he had not at com
mand sufficient battery power to put this point to the test of decisive
experiments, but hopes to do so shortly with a Daniell battery of 50
or 100 elements. In the meantime the results above given, having
been arrived at with great care, and amply confirmed by experiments
several times repeated, appear to establish very conclusively the
following principles:—
     1. A permanently magnetized steel needle, suspended          in the
middle of a galvanometer coil, is deflected with a force simply pro
portional to the quantity of current transmitted, so long as the
current force which acts upon it is not sufficient to impart tempo
rarily a higher magnetism than that which it permanently possesses.
Beyond this point, the deflective force exerted on the magnetized
steel needle increases in a somewhat higher ratio than the current,
and therefore the accuracy of any form of galvanometer can be
trusted only within certain limits of current force and of length and
proximity of coil.
     2. A pure soft iron needle, suspended at an angle of about 40° to
 the direction of the current (the angle varying according to the
 shape of the needle), is deflected with a force which, within certain
 limits of current power, is very exactly proportional to the squares
 of the quantities of current. Beyond these limits the deflective force
 exerted on the needle increases in some constantly diminishing ratio
 lower than that of the squares of the current.
     3. The action of the current in deflecting a magnetic needle is
 precisely the same action, and follows the same law, as that which
 it exerts in magnetizing a bar of soft iron. The amount of magnetism
 actually imparted to a bar or needle of soft iron is directly propor
 tional to the quantity of current; for the force with which a soft iron
  needle is deflected under different currents is not proportional to its
 temporary magnetism in each case, but to the product of its mag
  netism multiplied by the force of the current.       By increasing the
  force of the current, two effects are produced; in the first place, the
  magnetism of the needle is increased in the same proportion; and
  secondly, the increased current acting upon this increased magnetism
  deflects the needle with a force proportional to the product of the
  two, or in other words, proportional to the square of the actual
  quantity of current.
      lt only remains to add the results of two series of experiments,
  showing the very striking difference between the deflective forces
  exerted upon the two needles at different angles of inclination.
  Table III. shows the increasing weights required to balance the
  needles at angles successively diminished by 10°; Table IV. exhibits
   the effect produced by successive additions of weights, equivalent to
   a force of ten grains acting at the poles of the needles.     In both

cases   the battery power employed was twelve small Grove's, but the
current declined, in the course of the experiments, from 47° to 45°
on the tangent galvanometer, which accounts for the fact that the
maximum weights supported are less than in the earlier experiments

   It will be observed from Table III. that a very small weight was
sufficient to throw back the steel needle to 80°, and that, on the
contrary, it is from 90° to 70° that the soft iron needle sustains
itself with comparatively the greatest power, requiring very nearly
double the weight which suffices for the steel needle to balance it at
the latter angle.   When reduced to 40°, however, the smallest pos
sible additional weight throws back the iron needle to zero, and in
every case it was necessary to move it aside with the finger to nearly
that angle, before it would exhibit the slightest action under the
influence of the current, or, in other words, any perceptible trace of
longitudinal magnetization.     In fact, being laterally magnetized
when hanging in a vertical position, it necessarily offered a certain
resistance to deflection.
   On taking out the steel needle after these experiments, it was
found to have retained  itsoriginal magnetism unimpaired.

News’ of the 20th of October last, because in my anxiety to admit
 of any one testing the accuracy of my results, I had described how
the process might be conducted with what is generally sold as pure
acid, but which, if properly tested, is rarely free from arsenic.
   During these last experiments, it occurred to me to distil the sands
with a second and a third dose of acid, and in most cases I have
found the yield of arsenic and antimony to be much greater, say from
two to five times, in the second distillate than in the first; and in
some I have found the third distillate to give more than the first,
but in others less.
   These results induce me to say that, before a sand could be pro
nounced not to contain any arsenic or antimony, it should be distilled
to dryness with at least three distinct doses of acid, each distillate
being tested carefully in the manner described in my former com
munication.

NOTE ON A MODIFICATION     THE APPARATUS EMPLOYED FOR,
                               OF
  oNE of AMPERE's FUNDAMENTAL ExPERIMENTS IN ELECTRo
  DYNAMICS.  BY PROFESSOR, TAIT.
   My attention was recalled by Principal Forbes's note* (read to the
Royal Society of Edinburgh on January 7), to his request that I should
at leisure try to repeat Ampère's experiment for the mutual repulsion
of two parts of the same straight conductor, by means of an apparatus
which he had procured for the Natural Philosophy Collection in the
University.     Some days later I tried the experiment, but found that,
on account of the narrowness of the troughs of mercury, it was im
possible to prevent the capillary forces from driving the floating wire
to the sides of the vessel.    I therefore constructed an apparatus in
which the troughs were two inches wide, the arms of the float being
also at that distance apart.    Making the experiment according to
Ampère's method with this arrangement, I found one small Grove’s
cell sufficient to produce a steady motion of the float from the poles
of the pile; in fact, the only difficulty in repeating the experiment
lies in obtaining a perfectly clean mercurial surface.
    Two objections have been raised against Ampère's interpretation
 of this experiment, one of which is intimately connected with the
 subject of Principal Forbes's note.     This  is, the difficultyof  ascer
 taining exactly what takes place where    a   voltaic current passes from
 one conducting body      toanother of  different material. It  is  known

that thermal and thermo-electric effects generally accompany such a
passage. To get rid of this source of uncertainty, I have repeated
Ampère's experiment in a form which excludes it entirely. In this
form of the experiment the polar conductors and the float form one
continuous metallic mass with the mercury in the troughs, the float
being formed of glass tube filled with mercury, with           extremities                         its
slightly curved downwards           nearly          so   as

  The change of the plane of polarization by diffraction                                                           conducts
us by another road to the determination of the same                                                                question,
Several years ago Mr. Stokes furnished a mathematical proof
that the plane of polarization must be changed by diffraction,
Toubts have, however, justly been entertained as to the accuracy
of his conclusions, because he only succeeded in solving the
problem of diffraction imperfectly; and have therefore sought                       I
the complete solution of the problem by other methods, which                                                                   I
have found particularly applicable in the theory of elasticity.
    When an undulation passes through an opening in a solid
 plane, waves proceed from the opening on both sides of                                                                       the

      The experiments that have hitherto been tried leave this
  question still undecided; for while Stokes, from experiments
  made with glass gratings, found that the plane of polarization is
  rendered more horizontal, Holtzmann, from experiments made
  with a smoke-grating, came to the opposite conclusion.              In order

  riments with gratings of various kinds.
      By means of a heliostat and collecting lens, introduce apor          I
  tion of the sun’s rays into a chamber.            At some distance from
  the focus of the first lens a smaller lens receives the rays, and
  transmits them, almost parallel, through a polarizing Nicol's
   prism, which is fastened in a tube to a vertical circular arc. An
  index with a vernier gives the angle which the plane of polariza
   tion of the transmitted light makes with the vertical line. At
   the distance of about 7 metres the light falls on a vertical gra
   ting, which is fastened to a small plate in the middle of a hori
   zontal circular arc, which is provided with a moveable horizontal
   telescope.    Before the object-glass is placed a doubly-refracting
   prism of rock-crystal, which divides the polarized pencil into
  two, polarized perpendicularly to each other. This prism can
  be turned about the axis of the telescope.            In general, therefore,
  two horizontal bands of       light of unequal     brightness  will be seen
  in the telescope; but by turning the Nicol's prism or the doubly
  refracting crystal about             its
                                       axis, the intensity         these two     of
  images can      berendered    equal.
      The experiments were generally conducted                follows:—The as
  Nicol's prism was turned                     direction that the plane
                                       of in                                                      theof
                                      such               a
  polarization made         angle
                            an        45° with the vertical line, and
  telescope was    so  placed that           its
                                         vertical thread passed through
                                                                                           lay
                                                                                                 to thebe
  the two illuminating points, while the horizontal thread
  tween the two horizontal bands              diffracted light. When
                                                    of
 telescope was turned through the angle                            8,
                                                       both bands, owing
 the    position  of the   rock-crystal,  were                   of
                                                      equal intensity.     The
 telescope was then put back into                        its
                                                 original position, and the
 Nicol's prism was turned into such position that- one       a              the            of
 images entirely disappeared.
    If   the Nicol's prism required              turned through the angle
                                                    to   be
8    (or 8+90°     or 8+180°), the plane            polarization must have

 been turned through the same angle, provided that the light has
 not been elliptically polarized               by
                                         diffraction; and             positive,if8    be
 the   plane of  polarization    has been rendered more horizontal.

                                   the grating entirely cover the
object-glass, as was always the case in the above experiments,
the upper diffracted image will be too bright,   And if this image
be polarized horizontally, 8 will be found too great; if vertically,
too small. To render the experiment perfect, it is therefere neces
sary to turn the rock-crystal through an angle of 180°, and take
the mean of the two values of 8 so obtained.      If this precaution
be  neglected,  very considerable errors may   be introduced, espe
cially when smoke-gratings are employed, and                       I
                                                       imagine it is
this that has misled Holtzmann.       He  observed, in the case of a
smoke-grating, that for a diffraction of 20° there was a very con
                      .
siderable difference in the brightness of the horizontal and verti
cally-polarized images.    This is nearly always so with gratings
of this description: the upper or the lower image appears the
brightest, without reference to the position of the plane of polari
zation. With a perfectly accurate grating, M. Holtzmann would
not have been able to distinguish the slight difference that really
does exist.
    My first experiments were made with a gold grating (1000
bars to the Paris inch).   Light polarized at an angle of 45°
with the vertical, when diffracted with this grating, gave two
images, of which neither could be made entirely to disappear for
any position of the             ; and this was still more evident
when the grating was placed obliquely. The diffracted light must
therefore either have been elliptically polarized, or have been partly
converted into ordinary light.        That the former was the case,
I inferred from the fact that    elliptically-polarized   light could be
                                                                                     If,
converted by diffraction into circularly and plane-polarized.
for example,  I  passed light polarized          the angle through
                                                   at                      a         a
Fresnel's  parallelopiped,   whose reflecting   surfaces made the angle
45° with the    vertical,  the angle     could
                                          a             be   so
                                                        chosen that one
image   in the telescope could        made entirely
                                     be                   disappear, or,
                                                                  to
on  the other  hand,   so that the two   images,             on
                                                       turning   the rock
crystal, always retained the same intensity.
   By measurements made           inthis manner,       convinced myself
                                                         I
that the   phenomenon       is essentially   the same                  as
                                                              that which
accompanies the ordinary reflexion           light from polished metal
                                              of
surfaces, and that the effect           the diffracted light
                                        of                         imper       is
ceptible in  comparison with that reflected from the edges.
I    now provided myself with various smoke-gratings.             Polished
glass surfaces were smoked with burning camphor, and then
                                                                   a fix
treated with   a few drops   of   oil  turpentine

   With these gratings      no 5,

mean results for them all.
     When the grating was perpendicular              the incident ray, and  to
on  the side       of   the glass towards the telescope,    was the case                  8, as

Holtzmann’s            experiments,    found the angle

the plane     polarization was turned, extraordinarily small, and
                  of

fraction (65°). The plane       polarization    of
                                               the incident light                of

   The mean result for 8=65° was
                                               S=    1°    52'.
The plane        polarization therefore had become very slightly
                   of

These results agree neither with Holtzmann’s experiments, nor
with the conclusions that seem           follow from theory.         think,

however, they can         explained
                                 be      follows.
   When the light first passes through the glass and then through
the grating, the circumstances are almost the same
                                                                                                            as as

encounters the grating                    in
                                the substance       the glass,      may     of                                             be
concluded from the fact that there             reflexion               no

takes place within the substance           the glass, and the diffracted

it is broken, there will be a current through C in the same direc
tion as the primary   current.
   We may now perceive that induced currents are produced
when the electricity yields to the electromotive force,—this force,
however, still existing when the formation of a sensible current
is prevented by the resistance of the circuit.
   The electromotive force, of which the components are P, Q, R,
arises from the action between the vortices and the interposed
particles, when the velocity of rotation is altered in any part of
the field.    It corresponds to the pressure on the axle of a
wheel in a machine when the velocity of the driving wheel is           in
creased or diminished. .
   The electrotonie state, whose components are F, G, H, is
what the electromotive force would be if the currents, &c. to
which the lines of force are due, instead of arriving at their actual
state by degrees, had started instantaneously from rest with their
actual values.   It corresponds to the impulse which would act on
the axle of a wheel in a machine if the actual velocity were sud
denly given to the driving wheel, the machine being previously
at rest.
    If the
         machine were suddenly stopped by stopping the driving
wheel, each wheel would receive an impulse equal and opposite
to that which it received when the machine was set in motion.
  This impulse may be calculated for any part of a system of
mechanism, and may be called the reduced momentum of the
machine for that point.   In the varied motion of the machine,
the actual force on any part arising from the variation of motion
may be found by differentiating the reduced momentum with
respect to the time, just as we have found that the electromotive
force may be deduced from the electrotonic state by the same
process.
   Having found the relation between the velocities of the vor
tices and the electromotive forces when the centres of the vortices
are at rest, we must extend our theory to the case of a fluid
medium containing vortices, and subject to             all

electromotive force depending on the motion of the body, may
be made simpler by supposing the field of magnetic force uni

nation of phenomena.      Previous to such an attempt, it is thought
advisable to enunciate these principles in their most general form,
and give them merely experimental illustration.
   The principles to be set forth in this paper will lead me to
remark on the physical theories recently published in this Journal
by Prof. Challis and Prof. Maxwell.      It will be found that as my
theory refers attractions to differential conditions of stress and
strain, of pressure and tension, among elastic bodies, it agrees
rather with the molecular theory of the latter, than with the hy
drodynamical theory of the former; that the point of funda
mental difference from both is in the conception offered of
Matter; and that on this point my theory is a development of
the views to which experiment has led Mr. Faraday.
   17. (I.) Atoms are mutually determining centres of pressure.
   18.     If
           this idea of an atom, as a body of any size, acting and
reacting on another similar body by the pressure of the con
tinued, infinitesimal, but similar particles of which each centre
is an aggregate, be clearly conceived, it may be expressed in
many different forms.                    I
                            have, for instance, in the introductory
paper spoken of a body thus conceived as a Centre of Lines of
Pressure, or an Elastic System with a centre of resistance.       But
here, more clearly to express the idea in contrast with the fun
damental hypotheses of Prof. Challis, an atom may be defined
as a centre   of an emanating elastic aether, the pressure of which
is directly  as the mass of                       its
                                   centre, and the form       which de                          of
             on                         surrounding atoms.      Thus,

          venture to offer this conception of atoms, not as a mere
hypothesis, but as a fundamental scientific principle.      For there
is this involved in it—that as a phenomenon is scientifically ex
plained only when, and so far as, it is shown to be determined
by other phenomena, the conception of Matter itself must be
relative, and     parts   its
                           conceived      mutually determined.

ton's opposition to which is implied in his Regula Tertia Philo
sophandi.               -
   No less clear is it that the postulate of two different kinds of
matter, one with the qualities of inertia and elasticity, the other
without the second of these qualities, is opposed by the very
terms, not only of the third rule, “Qualitates corporum quae
intendi et remittinequeunt, quaeque corporibus omnibus compe
tunt in quibus experimentainstituere licet, pro qualitatibus cor
porum universorum habendae sunt,” but by the terms of the
first rule also, “causas rerum naturalium non plures admitti
debere, quam quae et vera sint et earum phaenomenis expli
candis sufficiant.”
    22. Consider, secondly, how such hypotheses are judged by
the modern principles of Metaphysics.        For it is evident that
the theories of every science must ultimately be judged by the
results of a science, Téxym texvöv kal étriotium étruatmutºv,
which, defining the conditions of knowledge, gives canons for
the criticism of hypotheses.           As this is no place for a metaphy
       discussion,             let        say that the theory          the rela              of of

                   found that, under certain circumstances, mono
\D   brominated  ethylene, C*H*Br (bromide of vinyle), parted with
hydrobromic acid and became converted into acetylene, C*H*, the
 gas discovered by Edmund Davy and investigated by Berthelotif.
 He was led to investigate this deportment more minutely, and
having tried the action of monobrominated ethylene on amylate
of sodium, has found in it a mode of preparing this gas.
   About 45 grammes of brominated ethylene were heated in a
closed vessel with amylate of sodium. An abundant precipitate
of bromide of sodium was formed, and the mass became liquid
from the regenerated amylic alcohol. The vessel was then care
fully cooled down in a freezing mixture and opened, when
about 4 litres of a gas escaped, which, agitated with an ammo
niacal solution of chloride of copper, gave an abundant red pre
cipitate. When this precipitate was treated with dilute hydro
chloric acid, it gave off about a litre of a colourless gas with a
peculiar odour, and which burned with a very fuliginous flame.
The analysis of this gas, and                  its
                                  combination with copper, left no
doubt that     was

 member of the series, allylene, C*H*.   The action is quite ana
 logous to that in the former case: the gas is passed into an am
 moniacal solution of copper, with which it forms a voluminous
 flocculent precipitate. This is decomposed, when heated, with
 the formation of    reddish flame; with concentrated acids it dis

   Allylene is best obtained from this precipitate by the action
of dilute aqueous hydrochloric acid, from which, when heat is
applied, there is given off a colourless gas of a strong and dis
agreeable odour, but less so than that of acetylene.       It burns
with a fuliginous flame, and precipitates silver and mercury salts,
the former grey and the latter white. These compounds are
analogous to the copper compound, and, like       are very unstable.         it,

body which offers any considerable resistance,         for instance,                as,                           a

        unsymmetrical Six-valued Function          of sia:  Letters,       375
as is number and space of the other two. Syntax and Groups
are each of them only special branches of Tactic.              I  shall on an
other occasion give reasons to show that the doctrine of groups
may be treated as the arithmetic of ordinal numbers.                      With
respect to the twelve varieties of the A or B aggregates, they
may be obtained from the one given by combining the substitu
tions corresponding to the six permutations of the three consti
tuents of one nome, as 7, 8, 9, with the permutation of any two
constituents of another, as 5, 6. But           I  have said enough for
my present purpose, which is to point out the boundless un
trodden regions of thought in the sphere of order, and especially
in the department of syntaa, which remain to be expressed, mapped
out, and brought under cultivation. The difficulty indeed is not
to find material, of which there is a superabundance, but to dis
cover the proper and principal centres of speculation that may
serve to reduce the theory into a manageable compass.
   I put on record (as a Christmas offering on the altar of science)
for the benefit of those studying the theory of groups, or com
pound permutations (to which the prize shortly to be adjudicated
by the Institute of France for the most important addition to the
...Y
subject may tend to give a new impulse), and with an eye to the
                and algebraical verities with which, as a constant of
reason, we may confidently anticipate it is pregnant, an exhaust
ive table of the monosynthematic         aggregates of the trinomial
triads that are contained in a system of three triliteral nomes.

   From these experiments, it follows that the mean value of
&# is 0.0237,         that of      gº E 0.0375;            so that when the gal
vanic and terrestrial currents pass             in opposite directions, the
polarization of the buried metal plates is greater than when they
pass in the same direction.
   Immediately on the removal of the cell, the effect of the gal
vanic polarization was greater by two or three divisions of the
galvanometer scale than it was after the lapse of 1 minute 30
seconds; and after that period the effect still continued gra
dually to diminish.       In order to exhibit the law of this diminu
tion  I subjoin the following Table:—

galvanometer caused by the terrestrial current was read off at
19:2 divisions.                       -
  The above experiments disclose nothing at variance with the
known laws of galvanism; but it nevertheless appeared to me
advisable to make them known, as they afford a simple expla
nation of certain phenomena which Professor Thomson has de
scribedº, and which he seems to attribute to entirely different

moon is the most marked.
    b. About aphelion.     The law consists of two nearly equal minima
near the  upper   and lower transits: of the two intermediate maxima,
that near the moonset is the most marked.
    c. Thus the law about the winter solstice is inverted about the
summer solstice, and the one law passes into the other at the epochs
of the equinoxes, ea actly as for the solar diurnal variation.
    6th. For the moon on the equator going south.
    a. About perihelion.     The lunar diurnal law consists of two
nearly equal maxima near the superior and inferior transits ; of the
two intermediate minima, the moonset minimum is by far the most
marked.
    b. About aphelion.    The law consists of two nearly equal minima
near the superior and inferior transits; of the two intermediate
maxima, that near moonrise is by far the most marked.
   e. In this case also the laws for the solstices are the opposite of
each other, and the one law passes into the other near the epochs of
the equinoxes.
    7th. For the moon furthest south.
   a. About perihelion.     The lunar diurnal law consists of maxima
near the upper and lower transits, that at the upper transit being by
far the most marked: of the intermediate minima, that near moon
set is the greater.
   b. About aphelion.      The law consists of two minima, the most
marked at the inferior transit, the other about three hours before the
superior transit; and of two equal maxima, one near moonrise, the
other near the superior transit, but varying little till 3 hours before
the inferior passage.
 . c. In this instance the inversion is not so complete as in the other
cases; this, it is believed, will be found to be due to the fact that the
change from one law to the other takes place after the vernal and
before the autumnal equinox; so that in the means for six months,
from which the above conclusions are drawn, the lunations following
the law a are combined with those belonging to b.

the most marked.                                -
   b. About aphelion.     The law consists of two minima at the infe
rior and superior transits; and of two maxima, the greatest at moon
set, the other between the meridians of 16" and 21*; between these
points there is an inflexion constituting a slight minimum.
   c. In this case also the opposition of the laws is sufficiently well
marked; the only divergence from opposition being that due to the
minor minimum about the meridian of 19", due, it is believed, as
noted 7th c, to the partial combination of opposite laws in the
aphelion half-year.

ence to the moon's declination for any given period of the year, con
sists chiefly in the difference of the relative values of the maxima and
minima, the differences of epochs being small. Thus for perihelion,
the moon furthest north, the principal maximum occurs at the infe
rior passage; the moon on the equator going south, the two maxima
are nearly equal; the moon furthest south, the maximum at the
superior passage is by far the greatest; on the equator going north,
the two maxima are again nearly equal; and so on for other epochs.
    10th. The moon's action is chiefly, if not wholly, dependent on
the position of the sun, or (which is the same thing) on the position
of the earth relatively to the sun; and the law of the lunar action at
the magnetic equator resembles in some points that for the solar
action at the same epochs. Thus about aphelion there is a minimum
of easterly (maximum of westerly) declination produced by the lunar
action, as well as by the solar action, for these two bodies near the
superior meridian; whereas about perihelion both actions for the
sun and moon near the superior meridian produce marima of easterly
declination.    A like analogy holds for near the epochs of sun
rise and moonrise.

   Before describing the experiment performed on tourmaline, it may
be well to state what result the theory of exchanges would lead us to
expect when this mineral is heated, and we shall perceive at the same
time the importance of the experiment with tourmaline as a test of
the theory.    When a suitable piece of tourmaline, with         faces cut                                      its

    The light from the transparent portions was therefore partially

I    HAVE     been studying for some time the causes               the different              of
      qualities     sound; and
                         of           found that those differences depended
                                                as
                                                I
 principally upon the number and intensity              the harmonic sounds   of
 accompanying the fundamental one,             was obliged     I investigate the             to
 forms    ofelastic vibrations performed                                by
                                                  different sounding bodies.
 Among such vibrations, the form            which     not yet exactly known,
                                                              of             is

 pose that his assertion relates only                          to
                                              the motions which remain after
 the impulse             of
                     the bow has ceased.        At least, myself found the             I
 motion very regular         long                 applied near one end
                                                                                                                of of

 string,      the regular way commonly followed
               in                                                players      the           by
 violin.   I   used       method
                              a         observing very similar
                                                    of                   that                           to              of
 Lissajoux. Already, without the assistance              any instruments, one     of
  can see easily that      string moved
                                  a            the bow vibrates    by  one plane                       in
  only—the same plane           which the string itself and the hairs
                                          in                                                                            of

   the bow are situated. This plane was horizontal in my experi
   ments.     The string was powdered with starch, and strongly illumi
   nated. One of the little grains of starch, looking like a bright point,
  was observed by a vertical microscope, the object lens of which was
  fixed to one of the branches of a tuning-fork.              The fork, making 120
  vibrations in the    second,   was   placed    between the branches of a horse
  shoe electro-magnet, which was magnetized by an interrupted electric
  current, the number of interruptions being itself 120 in the second.
  In that way the fork was kept vibrating for as long a time as I de
  sired. The lens of the microscope vibrated in a direction parallel to
  the string, and therefore perpendicular to its vibrations. The string
  I used was the second string of a violin, answering to the note A,
  tuned a little higher than common, to 480 vibrations, and therefore
  it performed four vibrations for every one of the tuning-fork.                  Look
  ing through the microscope, I observed the grain of starch describing
  an illuminated curved line, the horizontal abscissae of which corre
  sponded to the deviations of the tuning-fork, and the vertical ordinates
  to the deviations of the string.          I found it a matter of importance to
  use a violin of most perfect construction, and                               I
                                                               was fortunate in get
  ting a very fine instrument of Guadanini for these experiments. On
  the common instruments of inferior quality I could not keep the curve
  constante nough for numbering the little indentures which I shall
  describe afterwards, although the general character of the curve was
 the same on       allthe instruments         tried the curve used
                                                   I             :             move               to            by
 jerks along the line         abscissae; and every jerk was accompanied by
                                of of
a    scratching noise         the bow. On the contrary, with the Italian
 instrument, and after some practice, got                   Icurve completely qui
                                                                          a
 escent     as long        as
                        the bow moved             one  direction,
                                                        in           the sound being -
 very pure and free from scratching.

because there the horizontal abscissae are not proportional to the time

it meet together, and that the whole is seen in perspective from a
great distance; thus it had the real appearance of the curve, as repre
sented in two different positions in fig. 8. If the number of vibra

ON A METHOD OF TAKING WAPOUR-DENSITIES               TEMPERA         AT LOW
   TUREs. BY DR. LYON PLAYFAIR, C.B., F.R.S., AND J. A. WANK
   LYN, F.R.S.E.
  The authors refer to Regnault's experiments, which have shown
that aqueous vapour in the atmosphere has the same vapour-density
at ordinary temperatures as aqueous vapour above 100° C.; and
they bring forward fresh experiments upon alcohol and ether to show
that when mixed with hydrogen these vapours preserve their normal
density at 20° or 30°C, below the boiling-points of the liquids, and
 infer generally that vapours, when partially saturating a permanent
 gas, retain their normal densities at low temperatures.
    From their researches the authors deduce the consequence—re
markable, but quite in harmony with theory—that permanent gases
have the property of rendering vapour truly gaseous. Stated in
more precise terms, the proposition maintained by the authors                                      is,
“The presence         permanent gas affects

 . The authors anticipate that admixture with a permanent gas may
serve as a kind of reagent to distinguish between cases of unusually
high expansion-coefficient in a vapour, and cases where chemical
alteration takes place.   It will also be possible, by the employment
of a  permanent  gas, to obtain vapour-densities of compounds which
                                                                      -

     In experimenting upon substances which may be                                               heated above the
boiling-point, the authors employ Gay-Lussac's process for taking
the specific gravity of vapours. A slight modification, however, is
necessary.   Previous to the introduction of the bulb containing the
weighed substance, dry hydrogen is introduced into the graduated
tube and measured with                             all

       The computed densities (87890, &c.) set off as ordinates to
    the temperatures, show a trend without any appearance of curva
    ture. The straight line seems to pass exactly through the points
    of the second and fifth and sixth. Assuming it to pass through
    the second and sixth, we have
•83140–74.238–108902: 74°08–48°03–26° 05:: 74238:217-24,
    and 74:08+217-24–291°32=y.        This line gives unity volume
    at –1°30, hence k=292.62=y—t when volume equal unity,
    and the equation is (291°32—t) vº–292.62.       The differences
    between the observed temperatures and those computed from the
    observed volumes by this equation are given in the last column.
       § 14. This equatiºn answers well to the observations of M.
    Pierre above 10°; also to those of M. Muncke (St. Peters
    burgh Memoirs) above the same temperature; but in both the
    trend of the points below this lies in a line inclined to that of
    the equation.    The divergence is the greatest in M. Pierre's. In
    neither is it a general convexity, but distinely the contour shows
    two lines diverging from about 15° to 20° C. This is most
    distinct in M. Muncke's observations.              I
                                                  have computed them

414       Mr.      J. J. Waterston       on a Law          of Liquid       Earpansion.
     The followingis an extract from note-book of the experiments:—
     “Theobservations on pure distilled water could only be made up
to 305°F., in consequence of the glass being corroded and becoming
opake above that temperature. At the higher temperatures, five
tubes were employed with water having #5 of carbonate of soda in
solution.  Two only of these five were sufficiently transparent up
to 413°. But on examining them next day, gºth of the volume of
liquid was absorbed. This allowed for.
   “The expansion of the solution rather less than pure water. The
corrosion of the glass began immediately above the surface of the
liquid. The vapour was computed from formula, assuming the law
of vapour-density maintained.”
   Note F. § 6.—M. Muncke and M. Pierre have employed the general
formula 1 + A*- 1 +aa’--ba"--ca”, &c. to represent their observa
tions, and have computed the constants for each series. They have
also sought, by means of the roots of this equation, to find points of
maximum density of each liquid beyond the range of their observa
tions. Thus M. Pierre, at p. 358, vol. xv. Ann. de Chim., expresses
himself as     follows:–       “.... puisque l'équation
les racines doivent donner la température de ce maximum, a ses deux
                                                                       **)     a:
                                                                                         =0, dont
racines imaginaires.”
     I
     have traced graphically the curve of the equation and of the ob
servations, and find that its course through them is similar to fig. 8,
interlacing at the fixed points, and departing altogether from the line
of observation beyond the extreme points to which it is bound down.
The positive and negative differences at the loops sometimes amount
to # degree. A conic section may be drawn to represent almost per
fectly a series of observations if the range is not great. The hyperbola
answers well, and can be simply applied as the increasing rate of ex
pansion adapts itself to the curve, referred to an asymptote parallel
to the axis of temperature.

 LXII.     On a peculiar Acid (Dianic Acid)       met  with in the Group
    of  Tantalum and Niobium compounds.            By Professor F. von
    Kobe LL*.
Bº         G engaged in preparing a new edition of my “Minera
         logical Tables,”    I  was anxious, among other matters, to
arrive at as distinct chemical characters as possible for the tan
talates and niobates with which we are familiar; and after various
experiments,      I  came to the conviction that in several of these
compounds there exists an acid different from the true tantalic
acid which occurs in the tantalite from Kimito, and also from
the niobic acid met with in the niobite from Bodenmais.
    As from the previous labours of MM. Rose, Hermann,
Wöhler, and others we are aware that in testing for these acids
the one is very liable to be mistaken for the other, inasmuch as
the tests give more or less various indications according to the
manner of treating the substances and the quality of the reagents
themselves,     I   have endeavoured in the first place to avert any
possible error arising from those causes by conducting the whole
                                                          I
of the assays in precisely the same manner, which now proceed
to describe in detail.
    1.5 grim. of each assay was fused in a silver crucible with 12
grims. of hydrate of potash, and the mass, which melted quietly,
was maintained for seven minutes longer in a state of fusion; hot
water was then added till the fluid amounted to 20 cubic inches,
and when cold it was filtered. The filtrate was acidulated with
hydrochloric acid, then neutralized with ammonia, the precipitate
allowed to subside, and the liquor poured off; after this, the
precipitate, which was frequently coloured by manganese, was
 shaken with caustic ammonia and filtered.        I had taken somewhat
more ammonia than would have been             required  to remove from
the precipitate an amount of 10 per cent. of tungstic acid.           By

 sought to impart to the non-colouring tantalic and hyponiobic
 acids the quality of becoming coloured by an addition of tungstic
 acid, and then endeavoured to ascertain how far an acid thus
 mixed was to be purified by ammonia, the process which                    fol         I
 lowed in my original experiments.            Iprepared tungstate of pot
 ash of a determined strength, and mixed it with a lye of tantalic
 acid in such proportions that 84 parts of tantalic acid were united
 to 16 parts of tungstic acid, corresponding, as it were, to a pot
 ash solution of a tantalite that consisted of tantalic and tungstic
 acids only. The mixture was divided into two portions (by
 means of a graduated glass), and precipitated with hydrochloric
 acid. The precipitate of one portion was decanted and filtered,
 and a tinfoil filter, one inch long in the side, being filled there
 with, it was boiled for three minutes in 1 cubic inch of hydro
 chloric acid as described above; 13 cubic inch of water was
 added, and it was filtered. The filtrate was greenish yellow;
 on adding 1 cubic inch more water the fluid was yellowish, the
 precipitate was not dissolved, and after the lapse of twenty
 four hours the fluid which was poured               off

the hue   of  the filtrate. The    hyponiobic    acid was little dissolved

boundary being the limit of a contour, or of two or more contours.
The excess above unity of the number of the contours which
form the boundary of a close is the break of contour for such
close; in the case of a close bounded by a single contour, the
break of contour is zero.

           followingnotes and deductions are the result of a
THEcareful     examination of the Drift deposits of Western
Canada, undertaken during the last three or four summers in an
unsuccessful search for marine post-tertiary fossils, such as occur
so abundantly in many parts of Eastern Canada and throughout
the New England States.      The district more especially investi.
gated extends from the Bay of Quinté westward to the mouth of
the Saugeen on Lake Huron, and includes the line of country
lying along, and immediately within, the outcrop of the Lauren
tian rocks north of that region.     Detached observations have
been  made, moreover,  at various points on the islands and north
shore of Lake Huron; and also beyond the limits of the province,
as in the district south of Lake Ontario, in Michigan, and along
the southern shore of Lake Superior.
   The notes recorded here are arranged under two sections, of
which the first comprises a collection of data, and the second a
corresponding series of deductions.
                                § 1. Data.
    1. The first point observable, with regard to our Drift deposits,
 is the very evident fact that the rock floor on which these accu
 mulations are spread had been extensively denuded prior to their
 deposition upon   it.   They cover thus       undulating and more
                                                   an
or   less broken surface; and their thickness, consequently, apart
from the denudation       towhich they have been themselves sub
jected,   isexceedingly variable.
  2.   The lowest of these deposits appear         to
                                              consist        of

 greyish clays, with thin layers     yellowish
                                      of                or
                                                 light-coloured clay

in places.    This deposit is often laminated horizontally, and is
generally very calcareous.    It appears also to be free from north
ern or  large crystalline boulders. Pebbles of limestone and other
fossiliferous rock, mixed with some small pebbles of water-worn
gneiss, occur abundantly in it in many localities; but northern
boulders, properly so called, are either absent or exceedingly rare.
Amongst the localities in which these lower and boulder-free clay
deposits are of marked occurrence, the district around Toronto

occur apparently in deposits of the same kind and age.
    I have discovered freshwater shells, under the conditions de
scribed above, in beds of stratified Drift consisting of coarse
gravel filled with pebbles of gneiss and other northern rocks, on
the Kingston road, about two miles east of Belleville, at an ele
vation, by rough measurement, of about 40 feet above the pre
sent level of Lake Ontario.        These belong to Planorbis trivolvis,
or to some closely related species.        Other examples of the same
shell were obtained from fine      gravel in oblique stratification, near
the   village  of Orillia, at a height of about 18 feet above the level
of Lake Couchiching. This lake is about 120 feet higher than
Lake Huron, and about 700 feet above the sea. Pieces of na
creous shell (belonging to a species of Unio 7) were also found
in gravel, in the vicinity of Barrie, at an estimated height of
about 30 feet above Lake Simcoe.           I have found lacustrine and
terrestrial shells in many other places; but these I omit from men
tion, as the shells occurred on the sites of ancient swamps, in
gullies, or in flat lands adjacent to running streams, or in other
doubtful situations in which they may have been deposited by
freshets and other agencies of comparatively recent date.
    Mr. R. Bell, of the Geological Survey of Canada, has added
greatly to our knowledge of the above localities, in a paper pub
lished in the ‘Canadian Naturalist” for February of this year
 (1861). Amongst other spots in which he has discovered fresh
water shells, the environs of Collingwood and Owen Sound may
be cited.      At the former, examples of Planorbis trivolvis, asso
ciated with several species of Helia, were found by him at an ele
vation of 78 feet above Lake Huron.              Specimens of Melania
conica have been obtained, according to Mr. Bell, from another
spot in this locality.       Dr. Benjamin Workman of Toronto, has
also communicated the discovery of examples of a Melania and
 Unio ellipsis, on the high banks of the Don, about 30 feet above
the lake.      These may have been deposited by the river, however,
when     flowing  at a higher level; but they were covered, accord
ing to Dr. Workman, by a considerable deposit of sand.
    The upper deposits of the Drift period are separable with
 difficulty in many places from those of more recent age. As the
 one period merged gradually into the other, this must necessarily
be the case. Among the more recent deposits of Western Canada,
however, our river “flats” may be more especially cited, as those
of the Grand River, filled with the remains of land mollusca.
Also, the closely-similar deposits of the ancient bed of the
 Niagara, so high above the present level of that river; together
with the shell-marls and calcareous tufas of our lakes and
streams; and our deposits of bog-iron ore and iron ochres.

                              § 2. Deductions.
    The following deductions         appear to flow naturally from the
observations    recorded   above:–
    1.  A general depression      of the land, at the commencement of
the Drift   period,   must have taken place to such an extent as to
admit of the deposition of the lower clays.              These latter were
evidently derived from the limestones and other Silurian and
Devonian strata lying beneath and around them. Hence their
generally calcareous nature.          Their derivation from this source
is proved, moreover, by the pebbles of Trenton limestone and
other fossiliferous rocks which they frequently contain. Exten
sive denudation must thus have occurred both immediately prior
to and during the deposition of these clays; but it may be
questioned whether the bolder contours offered by the denuded
rocks, such as the escarpment that sweeps from the Niagara
river to Cabot’s Head on Lake Huron, were not produced during
the first uprise of the palaeozoic strata from the earlier seas in
which their materials were accumulated, ages before the period
now under discussion.          It appears, at least, to be a well-admitted
point, that these rocks had been elevated into dry land before
the deposition of the higher formations in the south and west.
    2. After the deposition of the lower Drift clays, a sudden and
abrupt change in the character of the sediments took place. A
striking example of this may be seen in the natural sections
about Hogg's Hollow, a few miles north of Toronto.                       The
change in question must have been effected by a still further de
pression of the country, bringing the higher lands and gneissoid
strata of the north within the influence of the waves, and yielding
the sands, gravels, and boulders of the upper Drift accumulations.
    This depression permitted an invasion and broad extension
southwards of the ice-covered Arctic seas, the true cause, in all
probability, of the cold of this epoch.          The depression must have
exceeded 1500 feet, since northern boulders are found at that
height above the sea on the Collingwood escarpment.                      The
gneissoid boulders there met with must at least have traversed
the basin of Georgian Bay; but the glacial striae which also occur
there may have been produced by the action of ice origina
ting at the spot itself: the three or four distinct sets of             striae
observed at this locality, however, do not radiate from any fixed
point, but run in the usual north and south direction, some being
a little east and others a little west of north%.
   3. At the close of this second series of phenomena, a gradual

 uprise of the land appears to have taken place, and a vast area,
 extending over and around our present lake-basins, then became
 converted into a freshwater sea.            This probably found its out
 let to the ocean      through     what is now the broad valley of the
 Mississippi.     Its waters stood at a great elevation above the
 waters of our    present   lakes, and were gradually lowered to these
 levels  by  physical  changes    in the surrounding country, and more
 especially by the depression of a higher region lying to the east.
 During this gradual fall and retrocession of the great lake-waters,
 the upper layers of the Drift were re-sorted, mixed with newer
 sediments, and thrown up here and there into secondary ridges;
 and the remarkable terraces which form so salient a feature in
 the general aspect of our lake shores and intervening districts,
 were then in chief part produced.            The escarped faces of these
 Drift  terraces, it should be   observed,   always   front the present lake
 basins, and thus look in some places towards the north, and in
 others towards the south, &c., according to the direction of the
nearest shores.       This would necessarily arise if they were pro
 duced, as here imagined, by a gradual lowering of the waters,
with intervening periods of repose.              The shells of freshwater
mollusca buried in the modified Drift, at various levels above
the existing lake-waters, and in localities so far apart—for these
shells have been found throughout the region south of the lakes,
in addition to the localities mentioned in this paper—prove                              in
contestably the former expansion and union of our lakes, or, in
other words, the presence in this part of Western America, of a
widely-extended freshwater sea covering an enormous area. A
curious circumstance, and one of great significance in its bear
ings on this question, is the fact that                        all

     A   solution of permanganate of potash evidently contains two
  colours,    red and blue, forming by their union the magnificent
  violet tint so characteristic of that salt.        When a little chloride
  of sodium is added to a solution of sulphate of copper, chloride
  of copper is formed by double decomposition, and the liquid as
  sumes a pure green colour.           Permanganate of potash carefully
  added to this compound changes it to a fine bright blue.               The
  red tint is neutralized by the green, and the visible blue remains.
  The experiment can also be performed by substituting the chlo
  ride of copper for the sulphate.          When the chloride, free from
  acid, is dissolved in water, the solution has a pale blue tint, and
  the addition of one drop of the permanganate causes a very dark
  blue shade.       If a little acid be introduced into the copper salt,
  and the permanganate added as before, a similar effect is pro
  duced, but in about half an hour the pure blue disappears and
  the solution becomes green.            The acid in this instance first
  changes the blue colour of the chloride into green, and subse
  quently decomposes the permanganate, and thus by destroying
  the red which was neutralized by the green, as well as the blue
  which remained intact, the original green tint becomes apparent.
      When permanganate of potash is cautiously added to a solu
  tion of the bichromate of the same basé, a bright-red liquid is
  produced.       The solutions, however, must be dilute, and carefully
  managed.        The yellow in the bichromate forms a green with
  the blue in the permangamate, which, neutralized by the red in
  both salts, would form a colourless solution, did not an excess of
  the latter tint prevail.
      Most chemists must have observed that, in the estimation of
  iron by means of permanganate of potash, the last drop, which
  shows that the reaction is complete, imparts a rose-red to the
  liquid, differing somewhat from the bluish pink of the perman
   ganate.     The pale yellow of the perchloride of iron has combined
  with the blue of the permanganate, and the resulting green, not
   sufficiently powerful to destroy the whole of the red, has left a
  portion of it visible.
      M. Terreil estimates copper by the same reagent. The cu
  preous salt is deoxidized by sulphite of ammonia, the sulphurous
  acid expelled by ebullition, and permanganate of potash added
  until the whole is converted into the protoxide.            The difference
  of tint which the last     drop  of permanganate     imparts to this liquid
  and to that      containing   the iron   salt, is very apparent.    In the
  case of the copper solution it is nearly blue; in the iron, pinkish
  red. These facts are not without their significance in qualitative
  analysis.      Gibbsº informs us that the beautiful test for manga

    If the plate be illuminated perpendicularly, but observed very
 obliquely though perpendicularly to the line, the phenomena are
 the same as in the first case, the light reflected from the finest
 extremity of the line being still polarized in the direction of the
 line itself.
    If the plate be kept in the same position as in the last case,
 but the source of light be brought nearer to the eyepiece, so that
 the plate is both observed and illuminated obliquely and nearly
 in the same direction, the polarization of the bright line is much
 increased, not only the fine end polarizing the light parallel to
 itself, but the same species of polarization being observed towards
 the thicker part of the line where the light was formerly polarized
 in the opposite direction, and even where the light was previously
unaffected.
   The distinct polarizing power of single lines traced on a silver
surface having been thus demonstrated, it was easily foreseen that
the same property would be possessed by the innumerable striae
produced on metallic surfaces by rubbing them with a body
covered with some hard substance reduced to a fine powder; and
it was anticipated that the large number of these lines would
compensate for the want of brilliancy in each individually, so
that the phenomena would be visible without the need of a
microscope.
   On a silver surface, a straight striated band about 2
centims. broad was accordingly traced by means of a ruler and
a piece of cork charged with emery*.      The striated band thus
produced exhibits in the most striking manner, on account of
the intensity of the light reflected, the phenomena of polariza
 tion before observed in the case of single lines.
    If the striated band be placed under the microscope and illu
 minated obliquely, innumerable lines are observed of different
 degrees of brightness and of various colours, due no doubt to
 accidental phenomena of diffraction and interference: nearly                    all
these lines polarize the light      their own direction, some
                                      in                           the      of
thicker ones, however, produce the opposite effect.

                   connected with the Polarization                        of Light.                 441
shaded from the      direct rays by means of a small screen, the
striated band will  appear  illuminated throughout the entire arc,
and the reflected  light  may   be observed directly by means of an
analyser, which causes it to appear alternately more or less bright.
   The polarization thus produced does not seem to depend on
the nature of the metal of which the plate is formed.           Gold,
platinum, copper, steel, brass, speculum metal, aluminium, tin,
&c., have been substituted for silver; and        these metals, when     all
suitably striated, have presented the same phenomena without
sensible difference, except with regard        the colour     the light
                                                                    to                   of

     should mention here that the striated bands on silver and
copper and some other metals are very brilliant when they have
recently been made, but that they diminish                intensity            in                    on
account       of

   A  second glass plate, B, was covered with silver-leaf, opake
like the former, except for rays of more than a certain degree of

blue colour.               I
                 am persuaded that this silver-leaf contained a
small quantity of gold.

    Lastly,   fourth layer

feebler,  but still quite sensible and polarized as before.     On
being viewed with the microscope, it was found that the number
of furrows that penetrated entirely through the metal was much
greater than before; but that the polarization of the dispersed
light was still due solely to those striae which were merely super
ficial, and consequently were less than riºrra millim.deep,    such
i.
being the thickness of the silver, as estimated by the coloured
        of iodide, which terminated in the middle of the first dark
 1110.
   A  general view of the results just described maturally leads
one to anticipate that light may suffer changes of the same nature
as that above described when it traverses extremely fine slits.
The experiments, with a description of which am about to close                  I
this. memoir, prove that this is the case, and that under these
circumstances also phenomena                            are produced                 closely related            to
the preceding.

 polarization; but we shall see directly that there are circum
 stances hard      reconcile with this explanation.
                          to
    The first trials were made with         slit whose edges were
                                                                a                                                   of
 brass; steel, copper, and, lastly, silver were substituted for this
 metal: the phenomenon was but little modified, and that                                                       in
 way which               by
                      means agreed with the polarizing power
                               no                                                                                   of a
 these different metals.     Silver, for example, which      itself has                          by
 but little polarizing  power, polarizes almost completely the light
 which traverses               a    very narrow         slit   of   which       it    forms the sides.

446     On Phenomena    connected with the Polarization of Light.
    Moreover, in reducing the thickness of the sides so as to
render them mere edges, the phenomenon is equally produced,
and it then becomes difficult to imagine the existence of reflexions
sufficiently numerous to cause the observed effect.                   -
    Bodies of the most dissimilar nature, so disposed as to present
a narrow slit, give rise to the same phenomenon,       provided the
sides of the slit be well  polished.   Flint, glass, obsidian, ivory,
fluor-spar, have in this respect afforded almost the same result.
    Having observed that the edges of the slit require to be well
polished, which agrees with the theory that the polarization is
due to repeated reflexions, the effect of removing this cause of
polarization was tried, the edges of the slit being covered with
lampblack.      Under these circumstances the polarization was
entirely destroyed, and the idea of repeated reflexions seemed
thus to be confirmed, only, however, to be again overthrown;
since on restoring the polish of one side only, the other being
still covered with lampblack, the polarization reappeared         di
stinctly, and in this case the existence of repeated reflexions
seemed impossible.     This experiment, taken in conjunction with
the preceding, seems to show that there is some particular cause
for the phenomenon.                                                 -
   In order to throw some light on this subject, the attempt was
made to examine the phenomenon when the light undergoes
total reflexion from the sides of the slit, such reflexion having,
as is well known, no polarizing effect.
   After several unsuccessful attempts, no better method was
discovered than that of observing the edge of a soap-bubble
formed in a straight tube.     Under these circumstances the soap
bubble forms a very thin film of liquid at the centre, perpendi
cular to the axis of the tube, and terminated by two opposite
concave menisci.     Placing this under the microscope and illu
minating it properly, it was easy to distinguish through the walls
of the tube a bright line, formed by the light that had traversed
the film, either directly, or having undergone none but total
reflexions from its sides.
   When the bubble was thick, the light thus transmitted exhi
bited no sensible polarization; but when the bubble was suffi
ciently thin to give rise to coloured rings by reflexion, par
tial polarization was invariably found present in the bright line,
the plane of polarization being, as before, perpendicular to the
direction of the slit. This observation was repeated in various
ways, and always with the same result.
   Finally, the slits in the thin layers of gold and silver men
tioned above, were examined with regard to the above phenomena.
   Leaves of beaten gold were at first examined with the micro
scope; they presented numerous rents and slits that offered no

particular characteristics;    but in some of the leaves, especially
in their thicker    parts,   natural fissures were discovered ex
                                        tº:
tremely marrow, certainly less than gºod millim. across, which
were clearly polarized, especially          their narrowest ends, the
plane of polarization being, as before, perpendicular to the direc
tion of the slit. These polarized slits are rather rare in gold
             I
leaf; and never found them in the thinner and more transpa
rent parts, but only in those whose thickness cannot be much
less than rºot millim.       This property seems to indicate that
the  phenomenon    is only  produced  when the layers have a certain
thickness, below which it is insensible.
   The same conclusion was come to on observing the thin layers
of silver already mentioned.       In fact layers C and D, which
were excessively thin and transparent,        exhibited no sensible
polarization even in their finest slits; while the somewhat thicker
and more opake layer         A, whose thickness amounted to             riº
millim., exhibited the phenomenon in a remarkable manner, an
with certain curious peculiarities. Some of the narrowest of the
lines which penetrated through the entire thickness of the metal
were polarized, some partially, others almost totally, the plane
of polarization being still perpendicular to their length. On
employing solar light, the phenomenon of coloured light appeared
in conjunction with that of polarization; for on observing the
polarized lines with a doubly-refracting prism, the two images
appeared   in certain cases of complementary colours.

                have now communicated the principal facts which
I have discovered relatively to the polarization,

millims. long), the sensible flexions produced originally by the
mirrors and the levers supported by the cylinders, the necessity
of soldering the latter in the middle, and lastly the complication
of the calculations necessary to reduce the observations, are so
many sources of inconvenience and error.
   The following are, however, the results of these experiments:
M. Kirchhoff found for yellow brass the value 0.387, for tem
pered steel 0.294; these numbers are, it will be seen, decidedly
greater than 4, while # is very nearly equal to their mean value.
M. Kirchhoff passes somewhat lightly over the former of these
results, while he attaches great importance to the second : tem
pered steel appears to him to be a body eminently isotropic,
while yellow brass is neither sufficiently homogeneous nor en
tirely free from the secondary effect before spoken                                       of.
   We have already done justice        the latter observation, which

 454       Mr. T. Tate  on a new Electrometer     for measuring
     When the machine was in a higher state of action, 20 revolu
 tions, in 60 seconds, produced a discharge of 1:06 cubic inch;
 and upon repeating the experiment the discharge was found to
 be 1.04 cubic inch.
     Within certain limits, the quantity of liquid discharged is not
 sensibly affected by the diameter of the tube G.E, or by the
 distance of the cup from the nozzle G: other things being the
  same, the diameter of the tube may vary from ºths to gºths of
  an inch; and the distance of the cup from the nozzle may vary
 from 2+ to 2% inches without sensibly affecting the amount of
 discharge.     In like manner, slight variations in the diameter of
 the jar produced little or no sensible alteration in the amount of
 the liquid discharged.
     At the commencement of the operation, the columns of liquid
 being in equilibrium, the electrical action has simply to over
 come the cohesion of the particles of the liquid for one another;
 but as the process goes on, the water being more and more dis
 charged, the equilibrium of the columns is destroyed, and the
 resistance to the discharge increases, so that, with the same elec
 tric force, the rate of discharge of the water becomes less and
 less; but when the section of the jar is considerable, and the
 volume of the liquid displaced does not exceed a certain limit,
 the velocity with which the liquid is discharged is nearly uniform.
     The following experimental results show that, for equal quan
 tities of water discharged (the machine being in a fived state of
 action), the product of the number of revolutions by the correspond
 ing time is (approacimately) a constant quantity.

    The following experiment was made when the machine was in
a different state of action.
                             Eageriment   II.
    24 revolutions of the machine, performed in 80 seconds, pro
duced a discharge of '72 cubic inch of water; and 33 revolutions,
in 60 seconds, produced the same amount of discharge.
    In this case 24 x 80= 1920, and 33 × 60 = 1980.

  10 revolutions, performed in 50 seconds, produced                                         a discharge
of 41; and 20 revolutions, in 25 seconds, produced                                              nearly the
same discharge.
  Here 10 × 50=20                       x 25 = 500.
   Now, assuming that the quantity of electricity generated is in
proportion to the number of revolutions of the machine, then it
follows that a certain quantity of electricity, acting for 50
seconds, produces the same (or nearly the same) discharge as a
double quantity of electricity acting for half the time; and so
on, similarly to the results of the other experiments.

and e, for the quantity generated in ti seconds, then for equal

        On the Dispersion of different Liquids by Electrical Action.
    The siphon-electrometer       enables us to determine the rate at
which electrical charges will disperse different liquids.              The
liquid to be examined being placed in the jar A B, and the siphon
being brought to act in the usual manner, the discharge pro
duced by a given number of revolutions of the machine in a
given time is determined; and having previously found the
amount of pure water discharged by the same number of revolu
tions performed in the same time, we are enabled to estimate the
dispersiveness of the particular liquid, as compared with that of
pure water, under the same electrical action. In this manner,
saturated solutions of chloride of sodium, carbonate of soda, and
other salts were examined; and it was found that, under the same
electrical action, the volumes of the liquid discharged were in the
inverse ratio of their specific gravities.       It will be observed that
these    liquids  are        all
                          good  conductors      electricity.  of
                                                              But the case
is  very different with respect       liquids which are imperfect con
                                                to

                of                  turpentine, fixed oils, and alcohol.
                                              as
     In twenty revolutions per minute the discharge             pure water   of
was about three-fourths                  of
                                   cubic inch
                                           a       whereas with the same
electrical action only about one-fourth             cubic inch  of ;
                                                                   turpen
                                                                   a              of
tine was discharged, and not more than one-tenth                 cubic inch ofa
of   fixed oil.    Under the same electrical action, the volume                                of
 alcohol discharged did not exceed one-fifth                           of
                                                         cubic inch. Nowa
 although the specific gravities         these liquids are less than that
                                                    of
is of
     water, yet their dispersiveness, under the same electrical action,
    considerably less than that         water.     of

On the Action of Nitrous Acid upon Nitrophenylenediamine.                                 459
undergo, indeed, the transformation, which he has already proved for
so many derivatives of ammonia, with the greatest facility.
   On passing a current of nitrous acid into a moderately concen
trated solution of the nitrate of the base, the liquid becomes slightly
warm, and deposits on cooling a considerable quantity of brilliant
white needles, the purification of which presents no difficulty: spa
ringly soluble in cold, readily soluble in boiling water, the new com
  ound requires only to be once or twice recrystallized.    Thus puri
fied, this substance forms long prismatic crystals, frequently inter
laced, white as long as they are in the solution, but assuming a
slightly yellowish tint when dried, and especially when exposed to
 100°: they are readily soluble both in alcohol and in ether. The
new body exhibits a distinctly acid reaction; it dissolves on applica
tion of a gentle heat in potassa and in ammonia, without, however,
neutralizing the alkaline character of these liquids; it also dissolves
in the alkaline carbonates, but without expelling their carbonic acid.
The new acid fuses at 211°C., and sublimes at a somewhat higher
temperature, with partial decomposition.      The sublimate consists of
small prismatic crystals.
   Analysis proves this substance to contain
                                        C, H, N, O,
a formula which is confirmed by the analysis                         of a silver-compound,

                                                   that, under the influence
of nitrous acid, nitrophenylenediamine exchanges three molecules of
hydrogen for one molecule of nitrogen, three molecules of water
being eliminated.

  solution is without the least effect. The latter experiment appeared
  of some interest; for if the action of nitrous acid, in a second phase
  of the process, had assumed the form so frequently observed by Piria
  and others, it might have led to the formation of the diatomic nitro
  phenylene-alcohol, according to the equation

     It deserves to be noticed that nitrophenylenediamine, although
  derived from two molecules of ammonia, is nevertheless a decidedly
  monacid base.    Gottlieb's analyses of the chloride, nitrate, and sul
  phate left scarcely a doubt on this point.   However, as some of the
  natural  bases, quinine  for instance, are capable of combining with
                                             I

  to confirm Gottlieb's observations by some additional experiments.
  The crystals deposited on cooling from a solution of nitrophenylene
  diamine in concentrated hydrochloric acid, were washed with the
  same liquid and dried in vacuo over lime.

  November 28.-The Rev. Dr. Donaldson read           paper “On the                  a
Origin and proper value    the word   ‘Argument.’”
                                            of
  The author first investigated the etymology and meaning         the                                      of
Latin verb arguo, and                   its
                         participle argutus. He showed that arguo
was   corruption
      a             argruo   of   gruo; that gruo (in argruo, ingruo,
                                                 =       ad
congruo) ought        compared with Kpow, which means “to dash
                            to    be
one thing against another,” especially for the purpose                   making                   of            a
shrill, ringing noise; that arguo         means “to knock     something     for the
purpose      making
             of          ring,   it  testing its soundness,” hence “to test,
                                              or
examine, and prove anything;              and that argutus signifies “made
                                                    ”                                                           to
ring,” hence “making            distinct, shrill noise,”
                                        a                       “tested and put     or
to the  proof.”    Accordingly       argumentum     means     quod  arguit, “that  id
which makes        substance
                       a         ring,    which   sounds,  examines,    tests, and
proves it.”
  It  was then shown that these meanings were not only borne out
by the classical usage          the word, but also by the technical appli
                                        of

 English poets, that the established meanings of the word “argu

 (2) a process of reasoning or controversy made up of such proofs;
 (3) the subject matter of any discourse, writing, or picture. And he
 maintained that the second of these meanings ought to be excluded
from scientific language.

 it was    made, he returned with the conviction that the observation
  was    trustworthy,    and that a new planet had been discovered
  (Comptes Rendus, January 2, 1860, p. 40).
     M. Lescarbault had long conceived the idea of detecting inferior
  planets by watching the sun's disk for transits, and in 1858 he put
  his project into execution. He was in possession of a good telescope
  of 33 inches aperture and 5 feet focal length, mounted with an alti
  tude and azimuth movement, and provided with a finder magnifying
  6 times. The power of the eyepiece employed in the observations
  of March 26 was 150. Not being furnished with a position-circle,
 he adopted the following means of obtaining angular measurements.
  The eyepiece of the telescope and the eyepiece of the finder each
 had at its focus two wires crossing at right angles, and the wires of
 the latter were so adjusted that a star seen at their intersection was
 seen at the same time at the intersection of the wires of the telescope.
 There were also in the eyepiece of the finder two wires parallel to,
                                     6 of,
 and on opposite sides           each cross-wire, and distant by about 16'.
A    circular card about        inches      diameter, and graduated

 the tube, about the axis               of
                                   the finder.       cross-wire       the telescope

previous year he had seen two new bodies pass before the sun in dif
ferent directions and with different velocities.       The larger was about
3" in diameter, and the smaller from 1" to 1"-25. Both appeared
perfectly round.      Sometimes the smaller preceded, and at other
times the larger.      The greatest observed interval between them was
1' 16": at times they were very near each other. Their passage
occupied a few hours.        Both appeared as black as Mercury on the
sun, and had a sharp round form, which, however, especially in the
smaller, was difficult to distinguish.”       Schumacher considered it his

L-verse of X, and may be written LX by those who prefer to avoid
the mathematical symbol.
   The attachment of the sign of inherent quantity to the symbols of
relation is the removal of a difficulty which, so long as it lasted, pre
vented any satisfactory treatment of the syllogism.    There is nothing
more in            X..

                                    except  only   the attachment of the
idea of quantity to the combination of the relation.
   When X is related to Y and Y to Z, a relation of X to Z follows:
and the relation of X to Z is compounded of the relations of X to Y
and Y to Z. And this is syllogism.         Accordingly every syllogism
has its inference  really formed in the first figure, with both premises
affirmative.   For  example,     LX and       Y.               Y.

     He gave rapid sketch
                   a                      of

ing the same alphabet, especially Latin.
    7. The way in which Latin proper names are spelt in Greek, and
vice versd.
. . 8. The traditions of pronunciation preserved  in modern Greek.
    He concluded that, on the whole, the method of Erasmus ap
proached more nearly to the ancient pronunciation than that of
Reuchlin.
   “But,” he proceeded, “when we consider the untrustworthiness
of each of these sources of evidence taken singly, and when moreover
we find them often in conflict with one another, it cannot be ex
pected that the result should be very certain or very satisfactory.
There are also other considerations which enhance the difficulty of
the inquiry. As there were very marked dialectic varieties in Greece,
so there may have been local variations even in Attica itself.
    “The pronunciation, too, changed from time to time. Plato gives
us proof of this in the ‘Cratylus.’”
    After quoting several instances, and showing that great changes
both in pronunciation and spelling had taken place in modern lan
guages, French, Spanish, and English, “it would,” he said, “be
hopeless to attempt to determine the pronunciation of any language
by a reference to      its
                        orthography         time when both were perpe

began to pronounce Greek, not with the modern Greek, but with
the Latin accent.   The reasons were:—
   1. Teachers speaking the modern Greek were no longer required,
so the tradition was not kept up.
   2. It saved much trouble to pronounce both languages with the
same accentuation.
   3. The Greek accent perpetually clashes with quantity;                                                     the
Latin much more rarely; never, indeed,       that syllable which    in                             of
the  quantity    most marked—the
                        is        penultima.

      REWSTER and         Haidinger    have described a remarkable property
         possessed by certain crystalline surfaces, of reflecting, besides
the ray normally polarized in the plane of incidence and reflexion,
another ray, polarized perpendicularly to that plane, and differing
from the former in being coloured—a property rendered more con
spicuous by the fact that the colour of the ray so polarized abnormally
is either complementary               to,   or
                                        least quite distinct from the colour

the capillary passage, so as to convert the liquid into vapour, and
thus change it into a state in which it would probably not be subject
to the laws which at first had caused its infiltration.
   I  have constructed an apparatus, the principal object of which was
to  connect,  by a porous plate of fine close-grained sandstone, on the
one end a closed space in which the tension of vapour measured by
a manometer was 1% atmosphere, and on the other a space in direct
communication with the air, half-filled with water, which soon
reached the boiling-point, but where the pressure could not exceed
that of the atmosphere.
   Although the thickness of the interposed plate was only 2 centi
metres, the apparatus showed that the water is not driven back by
the counterpressure of vapour; the difference of pressure on the two
sides of the plate does not prevent the liquid from passing from the
relatively cold region towards the relatively hot one, by a sort of
capillary process, favoured by the rapid evaporation and drying of the
latter.
   The effects of this apparatus, which I cannot explain in detail,
will manifestly be materially augmented by increasing the thickness
of the porous plate, and working with vapour at a higher temperature.
   But even these results prove that capillarity, acting in conjunction
with gravity, can, in spite of very powerful internal counterpressures,
force water from the superficial and cold regions of the globe to the
deep and heated parts, where, in consequence of the temperature and
pressure which it acquires, the vapour becomes susceptible of pro
ducing great mechanical and chemical effects”.             Do not the prece
ding experiments thus touch the fundamental points of the mecha
nism of volcanos, and of the other phenomena generally attributed
to the development of vapours in the interior of the globe, espe
cially earthquakes, the formation of certain thermal springs, the fill
ing metalliferous veins, as well as to various cases of the metamorphism
of rocks? Without excluding the primitive water generally supposed
to be incorporated in the internal melted masses, do not the same
experiments show that infiltrations from the surface may also be
operative, so that the deeper parts of the globe would be in a daily
state of giving and taking, and that by a most simple process,
although very different from the mechanism of the siphon and of
ordinary springs? A slow, continuous, and regular phenomenon
would thus become the cause of sudden and violent manifestations,
like explosions and ruptures of equilibrium.–Comptes Rendus, Janu
ary 28, 1861.
   * It is known that water penetrates into the pores of most rocks, espe
cially those belonging to the stratified formations, as is shown by the water
which they generally contain in nature.     Bischoff has long called the atten
tion of geologists to this fact. Although the granite on which the sedi
mentary rocks rest is usually very impermeable, it has been traversed in
many places by injections of eruptive rocks.     Among the latter there are
some, like the trachytes, so porous that they might well be particularly sus
pected of establishing a permanent capillary communication between the
water of the surface and the heated masses which form the base of this
kind of column.

LXXI.       On the Reflexion of Light at the Boundary of two Isotropic
                 Transparent Media.     By L. LoRENz*.
     AMIN,   as is well known, discovered that Fresnel's formulae
       for the intensity of the rays reflected and refracted at the
boundary of two isotropic transparent media do not perfectly
agree with experiment, the difference being very considerable
when the angle of incidence approaches to the angle of polariza
tion. Cauchy had already proved that, under these circum
stances, waves must be produced with longitudinal vibrations;
and having assumed that these waves were absorbed very rapidly
 (though not instantaneously, since in that case he would have
returned to the formulae of Fresnel), he now introduced a cor
rection into the formulae which caused them to agree with ex
periment.
    All calculations, however, which have hitherto been made
concerning the reflexion and refraction of light, have proceeded
on the hypothesis of an instantaneous passage from one medium
to the other, and a consequent instantaneous change of the

     In this way we have a new means of testing the theory, sinc
this requires that the thickness in question should be small and
positive. The calculation from Jamin’s experiments shows that
this is actually the case, though, as might be expected, no great.
degree of exactness can be thus attained in the determination
of these quantities.      I  have found that the thickness of the layers
in the case of the bodies experimented on lies between in and
rag of the length of a wave.
     f  appears, therefore, that the result of Jamin’s experiments
can be completely explained on the simple supposition of an          ex
ceedingly thin stratum of intermediate layers in which there is
a gradual change of refractive power, a supposition which we
have obviously more        right to make than to omit.

 Lº         A, B, C   be fixed points; it is required to investigate
          the nature of the surface, the locus of a point P such that

 where A, u, v are given coefficients; the equation depends, it is
 clear, on the ratios only of these quantities.
      The surface is easily seen to be of the fourth order; it is ob
 viously symmetrical in regard to the plane ABC; and the section
 by this plane, or say the principal section, is a curve of the fourth
 order, the locus of a point M such that
                        AAM+ABM-H vCM=0.
      The curve is considered incidentally by Mr. Salmon, p. 125
 of his ‘Higher Plane Curves;’ and he has remarked that the two
 circular points at infinity are double points on the curve, which
 is therefore of the eighth class. Moreover, that there are two
 double foci, since at each of these circular points there are two
 tangents, each tangent of the one pair intersecting a tangent of
 the other pair in a double focus; hence, further, that there are

in a circle with A, B, C, and which are such that, selecting any
three at pleasure of the points A, B, C, D, the equation of the
curve is in respect to such three points of the same form as it is

    By increasing the pressure to some extent, considerable quan
tities of carbonic acid may be readily solidified      About 150
cubic centims. of liquid ammonia are introduced into an inverted
bell-jar provided with a collar, on which a plate , rforated with
two apertures is hermetically fitted. In the central aperture there
is a tube closed at one end and reaching to the bottom of the
jar; the other aperture serves to connect the apparatus with the
air-pump.    The carbonic acid is produced by heating dried bi
carbonate of soda to redness in a copper flask.   This flask is con
nected with the tube dipping in the liquid ammonia, and also
with a small air-manometer.       All the air having been expelled
 from the apparatus, and the temperature of the liquid ammonia
 reduced to near solidification, the flask is heated until the mano
 meter indicates a pressure of 3 to 4 atmospheres.           Crystals of
 carbonic acid soon      begin   to form on the inside of the tube,
 and in half an hour about 25 grammes of solid carbonic acid
 are obtained, forming a thick layer on the inside of the tube
 which dips in the liquid ammonia.
    This solid carbonic acid is a colourless mass, as transparent as
glass; it may be detached from the tube by touching it with a
glass rod, and is seen to consist of small cubical crystals.           Ex
posed to the air, these crystals slowly evaporate without leaving
any residue; they may be placed on the hand without producing
any sensation either of heat or of cold; they can be scarcely
seized between the fingers.         Mixed with ether and exposed to

a modified manrer.
   In a porcelaire tube placed vertically, a series of alternate layers
of alumina and <U+017F>quartz were arranged, the alumina being at the
bottom, and thus quartz at the top; fluoride of silicon was then
passed throughothe tube at a white heat.         In this way the fluo
ride of silicon meeting alumina was decomposed, and staurotide
formed; but the fluoride of aluminium which was formed at the
same time was decomposed on coming in contact with the layer
of quartz, with the formation also of staurotide and regeneration
of fluoride of silicon. The same process followed with               the                           all
successive  layers;        so

    Besides this there was formed at the same time another body
of analogous properties, but possessing a greater viscosity. . It
 boils at 275° to 285° under the pressure of 10 millims. ; it has
the composition C9H2997, and is derived from three molecules
of glycerine with elimination of two molecules of water. . It is
analogous to triethylenic alcohol in the series of condensed

       the crude product from which these bodies were obtained,
there were several chlorine compounds which distilled at the
ordinary atmospheric pressure, and were separated by fractional
distillation. . A portion of this, boiling between 230° and 270°,
which chiefly consisted of hydrochlorate and dihydrochlorate of
pyroglycerine, was treated with potash, by which chloride of
potassium was formed, and a body obtained which, on purifica
tion and analysis, was found to have the composition

It is metameric with glycide, the existence        of which has been
placed out of doubt by Reboul's researches”.           Lourenço names
it pyroglycide; it  stands in the same relation to pyroglycerine
that glycide does to glycerine, being formed from it by the eli
mination of water.

    There is another way of obtaining these polyglyceric alcohols,
which throws some light on their formation. When glycerine
was heated, and the part collected which distilled between 130°
and 266°, and this portion treated with ether, an insoluble residue
was left.    This body gave distillates up to 300°, under a pres
sure of 10 millims, consisting of pyroglyceric alcohols.          It is
highly probable that in this decomposition, glycerine losing
one molecule of water forms glycide, and this combining with
one, two, or three equivalents of glycerine, forms polyglyceric
compounds; just as oxide of ethylene, in acting upon one, two,
or three equivalents of glycol, forms polyethylenic alcohols.
   Lourenço points out that the formation of these polyethylenic
alcohols suggests a plausible explanation of the formation of the
different modifications of metaphosphoric        acid,  which are   ob

         Graham's metaphosphate of soda acts like glycide or oxide of
         ethylene, and by successive condensations gives rise to the differ

  The action of strong potash on butyryle is very energetic;
butyrate of potash is formed as well as a substance of a pleasant
odour, which has the composition of the ketone of butyric acid,
but in properties appears to be quite different.
   Martius+ has published an investigation on the cyanides of the
metals associated with platinum. In their preparation he used
the residues obtained from the manufacture of Russian platinum.
The method of separating the metals which he adopted is a com
bination of several methods, and presents some interesting points.
   The residues were finely powdered, and the larger grains of
osmium-iridium separated by decantation.              The residue having
been dried and heated, was fused with a mixture of lead and oxide
of lead, by which                 all
                           the silicates and other similar impurities
passed into the slag, and        lead regulus was obtained containing
                                             a
 all the platinum metals.        When this was treated with diluted
nitric acid, residue was left consisting principally
                 a                                             iridium and               of
osmium-iridium.         The latter was    separated      decantation.     To   by

some osmic acid was formed, which volatilized, and was collected
in   a  well-cooled receiver.      The residue and the iridium were
then mixed with          equal weight

   By digesting this precipitate with baryta water, oxide     copper                           of

   Osmiocyanide of Potassium, Os Cy, 2 KCy-F3HO.—This salt
was prepared by adding cyanideof potassium to a solution of osmic
acid, evaporating to dryness, and heating to redness in a covered
crucible. On dissolving out the mass in a small quantity of
water and crystallizing, the salt was obtained in fine yellow
laminae, which belong to the dimetric system, like the ferrocya
mide of potassium: the osmiocyanide of potassium, besides being
analogous in composition and crystalline form to this salt, has
the still closer resemblance that it exhibits (as a special investi
gation by Kobell showed) the same abnormities in             optical                     its

LXXIV.    On Phenomena which may be traced to the Presence            of
    a Medium pervading all Space. By DANIEL WAUGHAN.
IF inthe  permanent change which seems to have been detected
         the revolution of Encke's comet be not sufficient to
establish the doctrine of a space-pervading aether, it may afford
reasonable motives for examining other indications of the im
pediments of such a fluid to celestial motion.     The direct        in
formation which can be obtained on this subject is at present very
limited and uncertain. The approximate investigations hitherto
given by mathematicians of the cause of the perturbation of the
planets, necessarily overlook many slight effects of their mutual
attraction; and we are thus prevented from discovering the un
periodical changes which a small resistance to their movements
might occasion.      In addition  to this, we are incommoded by the
want of observations made      during   very long periods of time; for
these are as necessary in tracing the course of remote physical
events, as an extensive base-line is in determining the distances
of the fixed stars. But by investigating the necessary conse
quence of a resisting medium, and testing the result by a com
parison with observed facts, we may be enabled to base our con
clusions respecting this important question on evidence no less
satisfactory than that which has already served to establish many
of the received doctrines of physical science.
   As there has prevailed among some astronomers an impression,
not unwholly unfounded, in regard to a modification which the
sun's attractive power is supposed to experience from the emis
sion of his light, it seems advisable to give special attention to
cases in which the central body is not luminous; and certain
phenomena, observed in the secondary systems and in the dark
systems of space, afford evidence not vitiated by any effects which
light might be expected to produce.         In my communication in
the   Philosophical   Magazine     for last April,           I
                                                       showed that a
satellite impeded   by the resistance of a medium would, by an im
perceptibly slow diminution of          its
                                          orbit,    finally introduced

   The theory which ascribes the sun's light to the incessant

fall of meteors to his surface, and which have controverted in
my article in the Philosophical Magazine for December 1858,
appears to have been suggested by the recently discovered rela
tion between heat and mechanical energy.          From this it may be
estimated that a pound  of solid   matter,  falling  to the sun from
a distance of 35,000,000 miles, is capable of generating at
his surface an amount of heat about 4000 times as great as
could be developed by the combustion of a pound of coal in
oxygen gas.    But the large amount of heat arising from the
combustion of hydrogen, and other facts and principles con
nected with thermal agencies, give support to the opinion that
the development of heat must be proportional to the intensity
of the chemical forces by which it is produced; and these must
be commensurate     with the degree of elasticity between the
elements concerned in the calorific or the illuminating action. We
have therefore no grounds for supposing that the accession of
temperature imparted to the solar orb by the fall of a body,
even from an infinite distance, is necessarily greater than that
originating from the chemical action of an equal amount of
matter, the elements of which were so elastic as to diffuse them
selves into space, in opposition to the attractive power of suns
and planets.   If the undulatory theory of light be admitted,
the medium which conveys it with nearly a million times the
rapidity of sound, must have a modulus of elasticity almost
1,000,000,000,000 times as great as that of common air.            But
though not regarding the aether which gives birth to solar light as
so inconceivably elastic, we may safely presume that no matter is
better adapted for sustaining the great fountain of brilliancy by
energetic chemical action, than that whose particles are asso
ciated with forces sufficiently powerful to cause             diffusion  its
through universal space.

                      meteors     far more frequent and more con

 512        Mr. D.       Waughan on Phenomena which may be traced
    The definite information which Arago was enabled to furnish
 respecting the sun by means of his polariscope, has recently
 received an important accession from the labours of Bunsen and
 Kirchhoff.    A comparison of the spectrum of the sun with that
 of various metallic vapours in a state of incandescence, enabled
 these chemists to show that potassium, sodium, calcium, and
 other elements widely diffused on our globe, enter into the com
 position of the solar atmosphere.       Their observations proved,
 however, that these substances, while abundant in the sun's en
 velope, instead of being concerned in producing his light, only
 exerted a negative influence—absorbing certain rays, and causing
 dark lines to replace the bright ones peculiar to their luminous
vapours. It is therefore evident that the light from the vapours
of the elements alluded to must be overpowered by the rays
emanating from some other source.           Professor Kirchhoff has
embraced the opinion that the solid globe of the sun must have
a far higher temperature and a greater illuminating power than
his atmosphere; but the observations with Arago’s polariscope
have afforded positive evidence that solar light does not emanate
from an incandescent solid or liquid body. It appears more
philosophical to conclude that the light of our great luminary
originates, not from the vapours discoverable in          atmosphere,               its
but from      more subtle aethereal medium combined with them,
              a
                   far greater illuminating power.

before the natural term of their existence.   This difficulty will,
however, disappear when the effects of    planetary attraction in
condensing the medium are taken into consideration. How far
observation of primary or secondary worlds give evidence of un
periodical changes in our system has not been yet determined
with positive certainty. The constant acceleration of the moon's
orbital velocity, during the past 2000 years, has been traced by
Laplace to a periodical change in the eccentricity of the earth's
orbits.    But an error in his investigations being lately pointed
out by Mr. Adams, there appears to be some definite ground for
regarding the lunar orbit as subject to a very slow permanent
diminution, which, after some allowance for the effects of tidal
action, we may consider as depending, to some extent, on the
resistance of a medium. The great oblateness which Arago and
Sir William Herschel assign to Mars would indicate that the
time of         its
              rotation has been considerably lengthened, since the
remote period         whichat    was moulded into

76°54 years.    This would seem to favour the idea of a perma
ment diminution    of the orbit; and I understand that I)e Wico
regards the movements of his own comet as indicative of a similar
result from the widely diffused aether. But the information on
this subject hitherto deemed worthy of the most confidence, has
been derived from the successive returns of Encke's comet. The
advantages which this body affords for such inquiries depend
chiefly on the moderate eccentricity of    orbit and the position     its
                                 nearly perpendicular
of of
   the transverse axis, which                     is        the line                       to
   the sun’s  progressive  motion. This   arrangement     must give
a more decided  preponderance     the perihelion resistance,
                                                    to        which
has the greatest influence    diminishing the size
                                             in         the orbit.                    of
   As shooting stars are now regarded     small bodies describing  as
very elongated ellipses around the sun, they seem calculated                                              to
furnish perhaps the most satisfactory means        testing the per           of
fection        of
           the celestial vacuum.     Supposing these bodies                                          to    be

                                       their orbits will have   ten                                  a

progressive motion.     From the same cause the planes        which                             in
they move will have their intersections confined for the most
part       very limited range, and will also exhibit, though

by taking one element out of each mome) will be 27, and these
27 may be grouped together into 9 synthemes (each syntheme
consisting of 3 of the triads in question, which together include
between them             all

 matician and a good linguist—a rare combination.        The Memoirs
 and Treatises in the German and Italian languages, as well as those
 in the French and Latin, have been completely mastered and ana
lysed: and some account is given even of a dissertation in the Rus
 sian language.    Of those works which are difficult of access to the
English student, a more copious account is given; and throughout
 the whole history, “numerous remarks, criticisms, and corrections
are suggested relative to the various treatises and memoirs which are
 analysed.    The writer trusts that it will not be supposed that he
 undervalues the labours of the eminent mathematicians in whose
works he ventures occasionally to indicate inaccuracies or imperfec
tions, but that his aim has been to remove difficulties which might
perplex a student” (Preface).      We would specially point out the
last  chapter  in the book  (pp. 505–530) as deserving attention in

of any department of science, when that history is presented with
accuracy and completeness,” we congratulate him on having pro
duced a History which so well merits this character of “accuracy
and completeness; ” and we sincerely hope that the success of his
present contribution to scientific history may induce him to carry out
the intention expressed in the conclusion of his Preface, viz. “to
undertake a similar survey of some other department of science.”

reference to the Question whether Plants assimilate free or uncom
bined Nitrogen.”       By          J.

   After referring to the earlier history of the subject, and especially
to the conclusion of De Saussure, that plants derive their nitrogen
from the nitrogenous compounds of the soil and the small amount of
ammonia which he found to exist in the atmosphere, the Authors
preface the discussion of their own experiments on the sources of the
nitrogen of plants, by a consideration of the most prominent facts
established by their own investigations concerning the amount of
nitrogen yielded by different crops over a given area of land, and of
the relation of these to certain measured, or known sources of               it.

ammonia by passing through sulphuric acid, and then over pumice
stone saturated with sulphuric acid.          It then passed through a solu
tion of carbonate of      soda  before entering   the apparatus enclosing the
plant, and it passed out again through sulphuric acid.
      Carbonic acid, evolved from marble by measured quantities of
hydrochloric acid, was passed daily into the apparatus, after passing,
with the air, through the sulphuric acid and the carbonate of soda
solution.
      The enclosing apparatus consisted of a large glass shade, resting in
 a   groove   filled with mercury, in a slate or glazed earthenware stand,
 upon which the pan, with the pot of soil, &c., was placed. Tubes
 passed under the shade, for the ingress and the egress of air, for the
 supply of water to the plants, and, in some cases, for the withdrawal
 of the water which condensed within the shade. In other cases, the
 condensed water was removed by means of a special arrangement.
      One advantage of the apparatus adopted was, that the washed air
 was forced, instead of being aspirated, through the enclosing vessel.
 The pressure upon it was thus not only very small, and the danger
 from breakage, therefore, also small, but it was exerted upon the
  inside instead of the outside of the shade; hence, any leakage would
  be from the inside outwards, so that there was no danger of unwashed
  air gaining access to the plants.
       The conditions of atmosphere were proved to be adapted for
  healthy growth, by growing plants under exactly the same circum
   stances, but in a garden soil.       The conditions of the artificial soil
   were shown to be suitable for the purpose, by the fact that plants
   grown in such soil, and in the artificial conditions of atmosphere,
   developed luxuriantly, if only manured with substances supplying
   combined nitrogen.
       Passing to the subjects of collateral inquiry, the first question con
 . sidered was, whether        plants growing under the conditions stated
                                                              in air

 go on simultaneously according to the depth of the cell; and the
 once outer cells may gradually pass from the state in which the
 sunlight is the greater reducing agent to that in which the carbon
 matter becomes the greater.                                             -
    4. The great reducing power operating in those parts of the plant
 where ozone is most likely, if at all, to be evolved, seems unfavour
 able to the oxidation of nitrogen; that is under circumstances in
 which carbon-matter is not oxidized, but on the contrary, carbonic
 acid reduced. And where beyond the influence of the direct rays of
 the sun, the cells seem to supply an abundance of more easily oxi
 dized carbon-matter, available for oxidation should free oxygen or
 ozone be present. On the assumption that nitrates are available as
 a direct source of nitrogen to plants, if it were admitted that nitrogen
 is oxidated within the plant, it must be supposed (as in the case of
 carbon) that there are conditions under which the oxygen compound
 of nitrogen may be reduced within the organism, and that there are
 others in which the reverse action, namely, the oxidation of nitrogen,
 can take place.
    5. So great is the reducing power of certain carbon-compounds of
 vegetable matter, that when the growing process has ceased, and                                   all
 the free oxygen        the cells has been consumed, water

question of assimilation, however, but a very small proportion of the
total organic matter is submitted to decomposing actions apart from
those associated with growth, and this for a comparatively-short
period of time, at the termination of which the organic form is
retained, and therefore but very little carbon is lost.        It would
appear, then, that in experiments on assimilation no fear need be
entertained of any serious error arising from the evolution of free
nitrogen in the decomposition of the nitrogenous organic matter
necessarily involved, so long as it is subjected to the ordinary
process of germination, and exhaustion to supply materials for
growth.      On the other hand, the facts adduced afford a probable
explanation of any small loss of nitrogen which may occur when
 seeds have not grown, or when leaves, or other dead matters, have
suffered partial decomposition.     They also point out an objection to
the   application of nitrogenous organic manure in such experiments.
    Although there can be no doubt of the evolution of hydrogen
 during the decomposition of organic matter under certain conditions,
and although it has long been admitted that nascent hydrogen may,
under certain circumstances, combine with gaseous nitrogen and form
ammonia—nevertheless, from considerations stated at length in the
paper, the Authors infer that there need be little apprehension of
error in the results of their experiments, arising from an unaccounted
 supply of ammonia, formed under the influence of nascent hydrogen
 given off in the decomposition of the organic matter involved.
    Turning to their direct experiments on the question of the assi
 milation of free nitrogen, the Authors first consider whether such
assimilation would be most likely to take place when the plant had
no other supply of combined nitrogen than that contained in the
seed sown, or when supplied with a limited amount of combined
nitrogen, or with an excess of combined nitrogen 7 And again—
whether at an early stage of growth, at the most active stage, or
when the plant was approaching maturity? Combinations of these
several circumstances might give a number of special conditions, in
perhaps only one of which assimilation of free nitrogen might take
place, in case it could in any.
    It is hardly to be supposed that free nitrogen would be assimilated
if an excess of combined nitrogen were at the disposal of the plant.
It is obvious, however, that a wide range of conditions would be ex
perimentally provided, if in some instances plants were supplied with
no more combined nitrogen than that contained in the seed, in others
brought to a given stage of growth by means of limited extraneous
supplies of combined nitrogen, and in others supplied with combined
nitrogen in a more liberal measure.       It has been sought to provide
these conditions in the experiments under consideration.
    In the selection of plants, it was sought to take such as would
be adapted to the artificial conditions of temperature, moisture, &c.
involved in the experiment, and also such as were of importance in
an agricultural point of view—to have representatives, moreover, of
the two great Natural Families, the Graminaceae and the Leguminosae,

 which seem to differ so widely in their relations to the combined
 nitrogen supplied within the soil—and finally, to have some of the
 same descriptions as those experimented upon by M. Boussingault,
 and M. G. Wille, with such discordant results.
    Thirteen experiments were made (4 in 1857 and 9 in 1858), in
 which the plants were supplied with no other combined nitrogen
 than that contained in the original seed.           In 12 of the cases pre
 pared soil was the matrix, and in the remaining one prepared
 pumice.                     -                  -                  -
    Of 9    experiments with Graminaceous plants, 1 with wheat and 2
 with barley were made in 1857. In one of the experiments with
 barley there was again of 0:0016, and in the other of 0.0026 gramme
 bf nitrogen. In only two cases of the experiments with cereals in
  1858, was there any gain of nitrogen indicated; and in both it
 amounted to only a small fraction of a milligramme.             Indeed, in no
 one of the cases, in either 1857 or 1858, was there more mitrogen in
 the plants themselves, than in the seed sown. A gain was indicated
 only when the nitrogen in the soil and pot—which together weighed
 about 1500 grammes—was brought into the calculation.                  Moreover,
 the gain only exceeded 1 milligramme in the case of the experiments
 of 1857, when slate, instead of glazed earthenware stands were used as
 the lute vessels; and there was some reason to believe that the gain
 indicated was due to this circumstance.          In none of the other cases
 was the gain more than would be expected from error in analysis.
    The result was then, that in no one case of these experiments was
 there any such gain of nitrogen as could lead to the supposition that
Jree nitrogen had been assimilated. The plants had, however, vege
 tated for several months, had in most cases more than trebled the
 carbon of the seed, and had obviously been limited in their growth
 for want of a supply of available nitrogen in some form.            During this
 long period they were surrounded by an atmosphere containing free
 nitrogen; and their cells were penetrated by fluid saturated with that
 element.      It may be further mentioned, that many - of the plants
 formed    glumes  and paleae for seed.
    It is to be observed that the results of these experiments with
 cereals go to confirm those of M. Boussingault.                     -
    The Leguminous plants experimented upon did not grow so
 healthily under the artificial conditions as did the cereals.         Still, in all

 was provided beyond that contained           the original seed, the carbon
in   the vegetable matter produced was much greater than that               in  the
 seed—in one instance more than          3times greater.       In   no case, how
 ever, was there any indication         of
                                         assimilation    of free nitrogen, any
 more than there had been         by
                                   the Graminaceous plants grown under
 similar circumstances.
    One experiment was made with buckwheat, supplied with                  no other
 combined nitrogen than that contained           in
                                                  the seed.    The result gave

of combined nitrogen present in relation to that supplied, throughout
the experiments, it may be inferred, as well that there was no evolu

assimilation of it; but it cannot hence be concluded that there would
be no such evolution if an excess of combined nitrogen were supplied.
    The results of a number of experiments, in which the plants were
 supplied with more or less of combined nitrogen, in the form of am
 monia-salts, or of nitrates, are recorded. Ten were with Cereals;

                                   case
actorily explained by reference to the hitherto quantitatively deter
 mined supplies of combined nitrogen.
     The results and conclusions hitherto recorded by different experi
 menters on the question whether plants assimilate free or uncom
 bined nitrogen, are very conflicting.
     The conditions provided in the experiments of the Authors on this
 question were found to be quite consistent with the healthy develop
 ment of various Graminaceous Plants, but not so much so for that of
 the Leguminous Plants experimented upon.
    It is not probable that, under the circumstances of the experiments
 on assimilation, there would be any supply to the plants of an unac
 counted quantity of combined nitrogen, due to the influence either
 of ozone, or of nascent hydrogen.
    It is not probable that there would be a loss of any of the com
 bined nitrogen involved in an experiment on assimilation, due to the
 evolution of free nitrogen in the decomposition of organic matter,
excepting in certain cases when it might be presupposed.
    It is not probable that there would be any loss due to the evolu
tion of free nitrogen from the nitrogenous constituents of the plants
during growth.
    In numerous experiments with Graminaceous plants, under a wide
range of conditions of growth, in no case was there any evidence of
 an assimilation of free nitrogen.
    In experiments with Leguminous plants the growth was less satis
factory, and the range of conditions was, therefore, more limited.
But the results with these plants, so far as they go, do not indicate
any assimilation of free nitrogen.     It is desirable that the evidence
of further experiments with such plants, under conditions of more
healthy growth, should be obtained.
   Results obtained with some other plants, are in the same sense as
those with Graminaceous and Leguminous ones, in regard to the
question of the assimilation of free nitrogen.
    In view of the evidence afforded of the non-assimilation of free
nitrogen by plants, it is very desirable that the several actual or
possible sources whence they may derive combined nitrogen should
be more fully investigated, both qualitatively and quantitatively.
  If   it be established that plants do not assimilate free or uncom
bined nitrogen, the source of the large amount of combined nitrogen
known to exist on the surface of the globe, and in the atmosphere,
still awaits a satisfactory explanation.

 known as the “quadrantal” deviation, shows, that while in wood
 built steam-ships it seldom exceeds 1° or 14°, it rises in iron-built
ships from 13° to 6° and 7°; the Liverpool Compass-Committee
recording even a point of the compass.
   The chief characteristics of the quadrantal deviation, as developed
in this investigation, are—
    1. That it has invariably a positive sign, causing an easterly
deviation in the N.E. and S.W. quadrants; and a westerly deviation
in the S.E. and N.W. quadrants.
    2. Its amount does not appear to depend on the size, or mass of
 the vessel, or direction when building; or on the existence of iron
beams.
   3. That a gradual decrease in amount has occurred, after the
lapse of a number of years, in nearly every vessel that has been
observed.
   4. That the value remains unchanged in sign and amount, on
changes of geographic position.
   5. That a value not exceeding 4°, and ranging between that
amount and 2°, may be assumed to represent the average or normal
amount in vessels of all sizes.
   Numerous examples are given in support of these propositions, as
also of the uniformity of the amount of quadrantal deviation when
determined in various parts of the ship; and, assuming the normal

534                            Royal Society    —
magnetism of the hull or machinery predominates; and it is inferred,
especially from the example of the ‘Royal Charter,’ that large qua
drantal deviation and fluctuating sub-permanent magnetism (due to
 hull alone) are co-existent, and give rise to conditions of compass
 disturbance which are beyond prediction, and which have hitherto
baffled inquiry and given a complexion to theoretical deductions
varying as regarded from different points of view.
    In order to examine the change which the original magnetism of
 an iron ship undergoes after launching, a series of compass observa
 tions were made in the steam-ship ‘Great Eastern’ prior to her quit
 ting the River Thames in 1859, and subsequently at Portland, Holy
 head, and Southampton”—at the three first-named places within
 short periods of time of each other.
    The results, from an Admiralty Standard Compass placed in a
 position the least subject to influence from local masses of iron, were
 as follows:–In the first five days, from Deptford to Portland, the
 ship's force had diminished from 0-585 to 0-480 [the earth's force
 = 1.000], or nearly one-fifth ; representing a decrease in the “semi
 circular” deviation from 35° 50' to 28°45'; the direction of the
 force, or neutral points, approaching the fore-and-aft line by 10°,
 or changing from 47° on the starboard bow to 37°.
    At the expiration of the next six weeks, the ship in the interim
 having made the passage to Holyhead, the ship's force diminished
from 0.480 to 0-390, or about one-sixth, corresponding to a decrease
 of “semicircular” deviation from 28° 45' to 23° 0', the direction of
 the force changing from 37° to 32°.
    At Southampton, in June 1860, or nearly eight months after the
     eriments made at Holyhead, the force had further diminished
from 0-390 to 0-235, or by one-half, corresponding to a decrease in
the “semicircular” deviation from 23° 0' to 13° 30'; whilst the
 direction of the force approached the fore-and-aft line 25°, or from
 32° to 7°; the quadrantal deviation remaining nearly constant
 [+44°] the whole time included in the various observations.
    The unvarying tendency of the direction of the ship's force in the
 “Great Eastern’ to assume a fore-and-aft line, supports the view that
time, with the vibrations and concussions due to sea service, leads to
a distribution of the magnetic lines, of the nature of a stable equili
brium depending on the average of the inducing forces to which the
ship is exposed; the respective sections of the hull having north and
south polarity, being separated by lines approximating more nearly
a horizontal plane and vertical axis through the body of the ship;
instead of the inclined axis and equatorial plane of separation due to
the magnetic dip of the locality, and divergence from the magnetic
meridian, of the hull while building.

Eastern’          is,

hull, suchas the rudder, funnel, fastenings of deck houses, &c., is of
a magnetic character differing from the hull of the ship, proximity to
any such should be avoided, and, as far as possible, the compass
should be so placed that they may act as correctors of the general
magnetism of the hull.                                          -
   As most compasses are affected by the magnetism of the ship to
an amount depending on their elevation, and the direction of the ship
in building, the disturbances will be large comparatively, except in
those vessels built head east or west.

and ship's force and direction of the various classes of vessels are

   1. “On a Collection of Fossil Plants from the Nagpur Territory,
Central India.”   By Sir C. Bunbury, Bart., F.R.S., F.G.S. &c.
   The specimens examined by the author were collected by the Rev.
Messrs. S. Hislop and R. Hunter, and presented to the Geological
Society in 1854 and since.      The vegetable remains described in
this paper are :-1. Glossopteris Browniana, var. Australasica, Ad.
Brongn. G. Browniana, var. Indica, Ad. Brongn. By much the most
abundant plant in the collection.    2. G. musaefolia, sp. nov. 3. G.
leptoneura. 4. G. stricta, sp. n. 5. Pecopteris, sp. 6. Cladophle

Indica, sp. n.  12. Vertebraria (?). Different from the true Verte
braria, and probably roots.     13. Knorria (?).    14. Stigmaria (?).
15. Part of a stem, somewhat Sigillarian in appearance.      16. Yuc

   2.    “On   the Age   of   the Fossiliferous thin-bedded Sandstones and
Coal-beds      of
               the Province    Nagpur, Central India.” By the Rev.
                                  of
Stephen Hislop. Communicated                by
                                       the President.
   The author first pointed out the places near the city      Nagpur
                                                                   of
where the plant-bearing sandstone has been best studied.     He next
noticed the carbonaceous shales underlying thick sandstones,      the   at
foot    of
        the Mahádewa Hills and the coal-seams     Barkoi, near Umret,
                                                       of
 80 miles and more N.W.       Nagpur; and pointed out their relation
                                of
ship    to
         the plant-bearing  sandstone near Nagpur,      shown as  the   by
Glossopteris and other fossils found    each locality.

  On       some   Reptilian Remains from North-western Bengal.                                                537
   At Mangali, between 50 and 60 miles S. of Nagpur, dark red
sandstones are found, rich in Estheria, and containing remains of
Plants, Ganoid Fishes, and Reptiles (Brachyops laticeps, Owen).
These beds Mr. Hislop thinks to be of the same age as those of Nag
pur and Chanda. Still further S. (170 miles from Nagpur), at Kotá,
there are (under thick sandstones) limestones and shales, containing
fishes of the genera Aºchmodus and Lepidotus, Teleosaurian remains,
Coprolites, fossil Insects, Cypride, and Estheria, with obscure plant
remains.    These beds are also regarded by the author as equi
valent in  age to the plant-bearing sandstones of Nagpur ; whilst the
sandstone above them may be equal to the sandstone of the Mahá
dewas; and the red clay beneath them may be the same as that of
Maledi 30 miles off (to the N.E.), where    Ceratodus teeth and Co
prolites have been found in abundance.
   Mr. Hislop then compared in detail, 1. the fossil flora of the coal
fields of New South Wales with that of Central India; 2. the fossil
plants of Western Bengal with those of Central India; and 3. the
fossil fauna of these two regions; and came to the conclusion that,
 on the whole, they probably represent the Jurassic (or possibly the
Triassic) period, at                 all
                          events some portion     the Lower Mesozoic        of

    municated by Sir R. I. Murchison, V.P.G.S.
        This paper gave the geological results of three years' exploration
    of the British Territories in North America along the frontier-line
    of the United States, and westward from Lake Superior to the Pacific
    Ocean.
        It began by showing that the central portion of North America is
    a great triangular plateau, bounded by the Rocky Mountains,
    Alleghanies, and Laurentian axis, stretching from Canada to the Arctic
    Ocean, and divided into two slopes by a watershed that nearly follows
    the political boundary-line, and throws the drainage to the Gulf of
    Mexico and the Arctic Ocean. The northern part of this plateau
   has a slope, from the Rocky Mountains to the eastern or Laurentian
   axis, of six feet in the mile, but is broken by steppes, which exhibit
   lines of ancient denudation at three different levels: the lowest is
   of freshwater origin; the next belongs to the Drift-deposits; and the
   highest is the great Prairie-level of undenuded Cretaceous strata.
   This plateau has once been complete to the eastern axis, but is now
   incomplete along            its
                              eastern edge, the soft strata having been removed
 in     the region      Lake Winipeg.

America.” By Dr. A. Gesner, F.G.S.
   After some observations on the differences between volcanic uplifts
of the land and the slow upward and downward shiftings produced
by changes in the position of great parallel areas during long periods
of time, the author proceeds to enumerate evidences of local eleva
tion and subsidence that he has observed along the coast from the
northern part of Labrador to New Jersey.
   In the south-eastern part of New Jersey, at Nantucket, Martha's
Vineyard, and Portland, submergence of the land is proceeding,
locally at the rate of probably four feet in sixty years.   In New
Brunswick, at St. John's the land has been elevated; at the Great
Manan Island and the Great Tantaman Marsh there has been sub
sidence.    At Bathurst and on the opposite coast of Lower Canada
the land seems to be rising.  In Nova Scotia, near the Bay of Fundy
and Mines Basin there is subsidence; on the southern side, however,
there are signs of elevation.    The sea rapidly encroaches upon
Louisberg in Cape Breton; and in Prince Edward's Island, also, at
 Cascumpec, submergence of the land is taking place.

              ON   THE THEORY OF CYLINDRICAL CONDENSERS.
                          BY M. J. M. GAUGAIN.
I       HAVE in a former note*     called attention to the fact that it is very
       difficult to analyse the phenomena of condensation produced in
submarine telegraphic cables, the gutta percha which envelopes them
being only imperfectly non-conducting, so that there is at one and the
same time propagation by conductibility and condensation.             To study
the latter phenomenon by itself, I substituted for gutta percha                             di
electrics, which isolate much more perfectly; I employed for this
purpose gum-lac and air; with gum-lac the absorption is very small,
with air it is nothing, or altogether imperceptible.
    The laws which I have succeeded in establishing are very simple,
and may be of some practical utility, since they afford a solution of
the different questions which relate to electric condensation in sub
                             of is,
merged cables; it        however, from philosophical point

‘ON   THE PRODUCTION OF GRAPHITE BY THE DECOMPOSITION                              OF
           CYANOGEN COMPOUNDS.   BY DR. P. PAULI.
     The mother-liquors obtained from the evaporation of a solution of
the so-called black ash are now commercially worked for caustic
alkali. These liquors contain the following compounds: —
     1. Chiefly hydrate of soda.
     2. Some quantity of carbonate of soda.
     3. Several sulphur compounds of sodium: viz. sulphide of sodium,
hyposulphite of soda, sulphite of soda, and sulphate of soda.
     4. Sulphide of iron held in solution by the sulphide of sodium.
     5. Chloride of sodium.
     6. Several cyanogen compounds of sodium, and especially ferro
 cyanide of sodium.
     These liquors are evaporated in large cast-iron pots, and in order
 to destroy or oxidize the sulphides of sodium and iron, as also the
 cyanogen compounds, an equivalent quantity of soda-saltpetre is
 added. All the oxidable sulphur compounds, together with the
 small quantity of sulphide of iron, are changed to sulphate of soda
 and peroxide of iron by the nitrate of soda in the boiling liquor, at a
 temperature not below 260° to 270°F. The cyanogen compounds,
 on the other hand, are not decomposed by the nitre until the
 liquor begins to pass from the watery into the dry fusion, and the
 uncombined water of the hydrate of soda has been driven off. When
 the whole mass of alkali (generally about four tons) reaches a low red
 heat, a regular evolution of gas is observed: this is evidently owing
 to the oxygen produced by the decomposition of the nitrate, and to
 the nitrogen from the decomposition of the cyanides; at the same
 time a plentiful liberation of graphite is observed, covering the whole
  surface of the liquor with a bright layer of graphite.        This liberation
  of graphite is still more plainly seen if no nitre be added to the liquor
  at first, or only so much as is sufficient to oxidize the sulphur com
  pounds: but if a few pounds of nitrate of soda be added when the
  water has been driven off, and the mass is allowed to become red-hot,
  a violent reaction takes place, and a large quantity of graphite is set
  free. This sudden liberation of graphite proves that this substance
  cannot be derived from the cast iron of the pot in which the fusion
  is made. So violent is the evolution of gas, that a complete cloud
  of fine particles of caustic soda is carried up into the air, rendering
  it almost impossible to remain in the neighbourhood of the operation.
  In this way   all  the cyanogen compounds are completely decomposed,

  few hours falls     to the bottom    ofthe pot.    If  the right quantity        of a
   saltpetre has been added,      a  colourless mass      offused caustic soda
   remains; but   if   too large  an  amount  of  nitre has been added, the
   liquor becomes coloured deep green, owing         to the formation       man

 and when washed with water and hydrochloric acid, it appears in
the form of an extremely fine bright powder.          If allowed to swim
on the top of the almost red-hot fused soda, the graphite is oxidized
gradually, and after the lapse of about three or four hours it alto
gether disappears.       Heated in a platinum crucible by itself it is                                                in

a battery   is discharged through a column of water, three-eighths of
the   charge  remain on the battery, but that two-thirteenths remain
when the     discharge  is effected through a metallic wire; and from
this I concluded that the electricity of the battery is discharged in a
successive manner (Pogg. Ann. vol. liii. p. 14. “Lehre von der Rei
bungselectricität,” $634).
    Since then I have always assumed that the spark accompanying
the discharge consists of several sparks; and the discharge of an elec
trified body, of several individual discharges, which I have called par
 tial discharges. By this assumption Wheatstone's and many other
 electrical experiments have become capable of explanation.

   When water is preserved from contact with solid bodies by placing
it in a mixture which has the same density, and which does not form
aqueous mixtures, its congelation may be materially retarded. Water
placed in a mixture of chloroform and oil (the best is oil of sweet
almonds) takes the form of perfect globules, and remains at rest in
the interior of the mixture.   If this mixture be cooled, the water in
this condition             scarcely ever freezes at                0°C.;       its   temperature sinks
to—6°, -10° before this change takes place. Globules have    this                                          in

examine this analogy more closely, and endeavour to show that it is
not superficial, but extends into numerous details. I attempt to show
that this particular case of freezing gives a suitable explanation of
the general phenomena, as well as of the accidental peculiarities of
hailstones: I attempt to show that these aqueous globules may also
be cooled below 0° in the atmosphere; that they can then freeze and
unite just as in the mixture of chloroform and oil, and that the grains
of ice thus formed, increased by the condensation of atmospheric
vapour on their surface, may be hailstones.—Comptes            Rendus,

 ON AN APPARATUS        FOR EXPERIMENTS ON RESPIRATION AND
        PERSPIRATION IN THE PHYSIOLOGICAL INSTITUTE AT MUNICH.
        BY PROFESSOR PETTENKOFER.
    In order to determine the quantities of carbonic acid and of water
 which are eliminated through the skin and lungs, numerous methods
 have been proposed, and the processes and results of Scharling.

 others, are well known to every physiologist and chemist.                    The

proportion as it sinks, and in this way is obtained a continuous cur
rent of air through the doors of the iron room towards the suction
cylinders.   But the air cannot reach the suction cylinder without
first passing through a continuously acting measuring apparatus.
For this purpose the author selected a large gas-meter, of such dimen
sions that 3000 English cubic feet could be measured with                                       it in an
hour.
    In order to investigate a portion of the air entering by the aper
tures in the door and any accidental leakages in the apparatus,
as well as of the air flowing towards the gas-meter, and to calcu
late from the observed difference in the proportion of water and car
bonic acid the quantities which had entered from the apparatus,
there are two aspirators, each of which simultaneously withdraws an
equal quantity of air. The water of the air is absorbed by sulphuric
acid and weighed, and the carbonic acid is determined by allowing
the air to pass in fine bubbles through a determinate quantity of
lime-water of known strength, and the strength of the lime-water
finally determined by means of dilute oxalic acid.
   In order to take a specimen of the air remaining in the saloon, a
forcing and suction pump is connected with the outlet pipe, by which
flasks holding 6 or 8 litres may be filled with air, and the quantity
of carbonic acid determined by means of lime-water.                   The same
pump serves to determine at any time the variations in the carbonic
acid during the progress of an experiment. There is an arrangement
by which test-quantities of any amount may be taken out without
causing any loss in measuring the whole current.              For this purpose
a flask is connected     air-tight    with the   pump,     and by continuous
pumping       its
               air     completely

tion cylinders of the apparatus, and simultaneously the apparatus for
analysis of the air, were at work, a weighed candle was lighted in
the saloon from without, and, before the experiment terminated,
again extinguished from without and weighed.
    The carbonic acid formed by combustion of the candle must be
partially contained in the air which had passed through the large
gas-meter, and partly in that contained in the saloon. The carbonic
acid in the air which had passed through the gas-meter was deter
mined by allowing a continually equal proportion (about 100 cubic
centims. in a minute) of the current from the saloon to the gas-meter
to bubble through lime-water.         The carbonic-acid of the air remain
ing in the saloon was determined, after mixing the different layers
of air well together, by filling two or three vessels of 6 to 8 litres
capacity, determining by lime-water, and calculating this upon the
known capacity of the saloon. It is only after these flasks have been
filled that the saloon may be entered to take out the candle and
weigh   it.
    Since the air which passed into the gas-meter, and that which
remains     inthe saloon, contained not only the carbonic acid formed
in   the experiment,    but that already contained      the air       passed
