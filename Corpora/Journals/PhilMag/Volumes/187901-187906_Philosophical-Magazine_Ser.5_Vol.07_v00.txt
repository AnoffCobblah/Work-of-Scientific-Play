not admit the universal correctness of that assumption: it is
certainly not true for gases which, like chlorine, strongly ab

containing chlorine behaves, in respect of                           its

  The attempt to polarize palladium with chlorine by electro
lysis of hydrochloric acid had to be given up as useless.                          Even
chlorine gas introduced from without into the gas element
attacked the palladium and browned both the metal and the
liquid after a time; while in the electrolysis the attack com
menced immediately and with violence, and a coating of pal
ladium-black was at once driven off.
   Ethylene and carbonic oxide gas, into which the tube con

        after introducing the ethylene,                    I found the values

   On continually agitating the liquid with fresh quantities                            of

   When the carbon electrodes at which the electrolysis had
taken place were left in position, their difference of tension in
comparison with pure carbon diminished only slowly and im
perfectly.      The carbon at which hydrogen had been evolved
showed      still, after twenty-four hours, tension-differences
against pure carbon amounting to about 0:6 D, while that at
which oxygen had been evolved showed about 0:3D. Evi
dently, however, further chemical changes had taken place in
the carbons:—in the negative, probably reductions of metallic
oxides mixed with it in spite of            the purification  all  had un                it

here speak of the electromotive force excited by a gas, but
have simply to do with the electromotive action of a liquid,
which increases with the degree of concentration of the liquid.
   The solubility of sulphuretted hydrogen in water is similar
to that of chlorine; but it behaves otherwise to platinum and
palladium than to retort-carbon.      The latter, again, occurs
only as a body immersed in a solution, by which it is the more
intensely electrically excited the more concentrated the solu
tion. Platinum and palladium are already strongly excited by
the first quantities of gas; they evidently draw it from the
liquid to condense it in or upon themselves.
   The rest of the gases which have been taken into considera
tion are but little soluble in water. Of course, in the usual
form of the gas battery, something even of these must at first
                                                                              .
be dissolved in the conducting liquid in order to become
active ; but the quantity is too inconsiderable to cause the so
lution to act on the conducting plate essentially otherwise
than the liquid which has absorbed no gas at           In these
cases something else must come into play to generate a differ
ence of tension—namely, either an affinity (or, generally, an
action of molecular forces by which the gases incorporate
themselves with the metal plate), or the action of an electro
lyzing current which either drives the gases into the metal or
condenses them upon          surface.    its

and that by closing the circuit for only a few seconds. The
action of hydrogen that had penetrated through the palladium
was very soon perceptible; the plate b also became positive on
 its  reverse side.     The experiment cannot            long continued;

showed no difference of tension.             now covered over one of

the tubes with     a yellow-glass     bell,  and        the daylight fall
upon both tubes.        .Certainly the action         the chlorine upon
the hydrogen       of the water was now much more vigorous                                            in

less applicable, since otherwise the affinity            the hydrogen

    In amplification of a letter wrote to “Nature’ on the 17th
of December 1877, and which was published on the 4th of
January, 1878,                   I
                      now intend to prove that such a state of
stress as Mr.   Stoney's  theory requires would exist under the
assumed conditions.       My   letter contains a proposed applica
tion of Clausius’ investigation for finding the conducting
power of a gas, as published in the Philosophical Magazine,
vol. xxiii. 4th series.   Mr. Stoney, in a paper read before the
Royal Dublin Society on Monday, the 18th of February, 1878,
 #.      Mag. Dec. 1878, p. 401] has obtained results some
what like those obtained by my method by applying a method
similar to one he originally employed.
        I
      may first observe that the only way in which a state of
other than uniform stress can exist in a gas is by the distribu
tion of the mean velocities, and number of molecules, bein
different in different directions, or, as Mr. Stoney has
it,
                                                                                                      ...i

by Mr. Stoney's investigation (Scientific Transactions of the

of the velocities in the gas between two large parallel surfaces
at uniform unequal temperatures.       He has shown that it tends
towards a distribution which would be represented by two
streams of unpolarized gas moving in opposite directions across
the layer.    N.ow the actual                is never exactly this,

                    K=P—p=piu; +psu;.
   In order that there be no accumulation                            of gas at either sur
face, we must evidently have
                                    plu1=p2*13.
If V  and V: be the total mean squares of the velocities of
agitation, Wl-vº-Hui, W.H. v.--už, and the quantity of heat
transferred is
                           Q=k(p,\ºul-p;Väu"),
k being, as before, the coefficient by which the vis vira of
translation has to be multiplied in order to get the total energy
of the gas.
   From these we easily obtain
                           K =piu;(ul + us),
                           Q=kpiu,(Wl-Wl);

     We  have besides p, + psap, where p is the density of the
gas.    Hence there are six equations between the six unknowns,
                             p1;    p.2, t'1, t'2, tº 1;     ti2;
and in order to eliminate them and obtain an equation between
K  and Q, it is necessary to make one further assumption.                              I
assume, then, that u1=Avi and us=Xv, so that Wl-(A*4-1)u?
and V:=(A*4-1)u;.               I
                         assume this because, if the streams
did not interfere with one another at all, we should have
                                                  1

so   that,   if X*4-1=a”,    we should have
                           a”=6 and a-2.5 q. p.
Our equations then become

                     ...   Q=kRa”(ui-us).
From these we can eliminate                       ui,   u,   pi,   ps; and putting

case    of the spheroidal   drops on liquids.
    That   by  this formula K varies nearly as Q, and not as Q”,
is not to be wondered at, because in the first place the for
mula only professes to represent an approximation to the true
state of affairs, and in the second place it is only at distances
and pressures at which the ordinary laws of conduction of heat
cease to apply that it professes even approximately to repre
sent it.
     The whole of these investigations are unsatisfactory to this
extent—that       I  have been unable, from a consideration of the
 molecular encounters themselves, to discover what is the actual
 distribution of velocities even in the simple case of two parallel
 surfaces.     This is hardly to be wondered at; for the problem
is extremely complicated, and evidently depends upon the
 undecided point in molecular physics, namely the proportion
 of the molecules encountering in a given direction that are
 thrown off in the various other directions. We might very
 well assume, with Maxwell, that they are uniformly distributed
 in every direction after the encounter; but even this does not
 simplify the question sufficiently to bring it within my present

   III.  The Electric Light.       By W. H. PREECE, Memb. Inst.
     C.E., V. P.    Soc. T. E.,  Electrician General Post-Office, &c."
 1.             theory of the electric   light cannot be brought abso
     THElutely      within the domain of     quantitative mathematics,
 for the reason that we do not yet know the exact relation that
  exists between the production of heat and the emission of light
 with a given current; but we know sufficient to predicate that
  what is true for the production of heat is equally true for the
  production of light beyond certain limits.
     The work done in a battery, or any source of current-elec
  tricity, is expended outside the battery in a closed circuit in
 the form of heat. When this heat acquires a certain tempe
  rature per unit mass, we have light. If the heat be confined
  to a mass of metal wire like platinum, we have light by in
  candescence; if it be expended in the transference of minute
  particles of incandescent matter like carbon across an air-space,
  we have the electric arc. The exact relations between current,
  heat, temperature, mass, and light have yet to be determined
  by experiment.
      2. The arc is thus    a form of energy developed in one point

of a circuit, which is the exact equivalent of another form of
energy expended in another point of the circuit.      Thus, if we
produce light by a galvanic battery, it is the equivalent of
chemical work done in the battery.           it be produced by a         If
dynamo-machine driven      by  a steam-engine, it is the equiva
lent of coal consumed in the furnace. The object to be at
tained in any economical utilization of this energy is to con
vert the greatest possible portion of it into light.
   3. Now the relations that exist between the work done, the
current flowing, the resistances present, and the heat deve
loped are easily demonstrated.      The work done (W) in any
circuit varies directly with the electromotive force (E) in that
circuit, and with the quantity of electricity (Q) that passes
                  it,

Therefore, substituting these two values                                 in   the above equation,
we get

   The locus of plane-polarized light may be investigated
without reference to the condition of the rest of the light, by

    n figs. 6, 7, and 8 the points through which short straight
lines are drawn are points at which the light is plane-polarized;
and the short straight lines through them show the direction
of polarization at the points. The dotted lines connecting
these points are loci of plane-polarized light.      The centres
about which small circles are drawn are points at which the
light is circularly polarized; and in fig. 6 the dotted lines
connecting these circles are loci of circularly polarized light.
The signs within the circles indicate the direction of rotation
of the aether; see (21).

obtain the intensity of the light at any point as follows:—
                         the major axis is cos 3 cost, and that
                                                                      <U+017F>ºfº
along the minor axis is sin 3 sin t , so that the vibration in
the direction of the plane of polarization of the analyzer is
              cos   (p/–a)       cos &   cost–sin (p’–2) sin    3 sin t.
  Hence,        if I   is the intensity of the light after passing the

  The appearance of the light after passing an analyzer

more readily by an inspection of the figures, which show                       its
state before passing.

   When the incident light is elliptically polarized, the spots
will move round the curves M(0); but the rate and appearance
will vary (see figs. 3, 4, and 7). For on the circles of M(p)
the major axis of the ellipse preserves a constant direction in
space, since p + 2 =0; but on the circles of M(-p) the major
axis rotates uniformly in space with an angular velocity double
that of the radius, since p-a = 0. Hence in those portions
of M(0) which are near the circles of M(p), the change in the
                                                            |.
direction of the vibration will be slow; so that in this part
the spot will be elongated, and will move more rapidly
the analyzer is rotated: but in the parts of M(0) near the
circles of M(–p), the change in the direction of the vibra
tion will be rapid ; so that in these parts the spot will be
shortened, and will move more slowly than the analyzer is
rotated.
   When the incident light is plane-polarized (see figs. 5
and 8), the slow-changing parts of M(0) have combined to
form the inner and outer circles of the figure and the diame
ters SS and TT. Along these lines the direction of vibra
tion has no change, but remains constantly the same as
that of the incident light; but on the middle circle of the
figure, and on corresponding circles, the direction of vibration
rotates uniformly with a velocity double that of the radius.
Hence on the latter circles there will be spots moving uni
formly round with a velocity double that of the analyzer;
but on the other parts of the figure there will be no spots.
However, when the spots on the latter circles reach the
diameters, then the former circles and the diameters will    -
become black.
   If  the light is not monochromatic, these appearances will
not be so distinctly seen, as the absence of one colour will not
occur exactly in the same place as the absence of another,
since the position of the isomorphal and isoclinal lines de
pends upon the value of a, and this will differ for different
colours. But the position of diameters which give plane
polarized light in figs. 5 and 8, is not dependent on the value
of a ; and hence with any light this cross will always appear
uncoloured, being black when the upper and lower Nicols are
crossed, and in full light when they are parallel.
   If   a is constant, the isomorphals and isoclinals become
straight lines from the centre, and the state of the polariza
tion may be conveniently represented by taking a series of
points in a circle round the centre, and drawing about each
point the ellipse of polarization at that point. The ellipse
 will show the polarization along the radius on which it lies.

rotation of N1 the equality of intensity of o, and o, restored.
These two positions of N gave the relative intensity of the
illumination of o, in the first and in the second case.

apertures had, in a previous investigation", been demonstrated
as actually existing, the present investigation needed only to
be directed to the proportionality of the illumination in o.
to $

already highly probable, an exact agreement, within the limits

    c. The shape and size of this dark space do not vary with the
 distance separating the poles, nor (or only very slightly) with altera
 tion of battery-power, nor with intensity of spark. When the
 power is great the brilliancy of the unoccupied parts of the tube
 overpowers the dark space, rendering it difficult of observation;
 but, on careful scrutiny, it may still be seen unchanged in size; nor
does it alter even when, with a very faint spark, it is scarcely
 visible.    On still further reduction of the power it fades entirely
away, but without change of form.
    The author describes numerous experiments, devised to ascertain
 if this visible layer of molecular disturbance is identical with the
 invisible layer of molecular pressure or stress, the investigation of
which has occupied him for some years.

point.      Inside the luminous boundary a focus of dark violet light
can be seen converging, and, as the rays diverge on the other side
of the focus, spreading beyond the margin of the dark space—the
whole appearance being strikingly similar to the rays of the sun
reflected from a concave mirror through a foggy atmosphere.
     Green Phosphorescent Light of Molecular Impact.—At very high
exhaustions the dark space becomes so large that it fills the tube.
Careful scrutiny still shows the presence of the dark violet focus;
and the part of the glass on which fall the rays diverging from this
focus shows a sharply defined spot of greenish-yellow light. On
still further exhaustion, and especially if the cup is made positive,
the whole bulb becomes beautifully illuminated with greenish-yellow  -
 phosphorescent light.
     This greenish-yellow phosphorescence, characteristic of high ex
 haustions, is frequently spoken of in the paper. It must be remem
 bered, however, that the particular colour is due to the special kind
of soft German glass used.            Other kinds of glass phosphoresce
 in a different colour. The phosphorescence takes place only under
 the influence of the negative pole. At an exhaustion of 4M* no
 light other than this is seen in the apparatus. At 0.9M the phos
 phorescence is about at its maximum.                When the exhaustion
 reaches 0.15 M, the spark has a difficulty in passing, and the green
 light appears occasionally in flashes only. At 0-06 M the vacuum
 is almost non-conductive; and a spark can be forced through only
  by increasing the intensity of the coil and well insulating the tube
 and wires leading to            Beyond that exhaustion nothing has been

light is produced by a mica or quartz screen; and the more fluo
rescent the material the better the luminosity.    Here the consi
deration arises that the greenish-yellow light is an effect of the
 direct impact of the molecules in the same electrical state on the
 surface of the glass. The shadows are not optical, but are mole
 cular shadows, revealed only by an ordinary illuminating effect;
 this is proved by the sharpness of the shadow when projected from
a wide pole.

strong shadow on the plate.

62                Mr. W. Crookes on the Illumination of
    Magnetic Deflection of Lines of Molecular Force.—With this ap
 paratus another phenomenon was investigated.                  It is found that
 the stream of molecules whose impact on the glass occasions evo
 lution of light is very sensitive to magnetic influence; and by bring
 ing one pole of an electromagnet, or even of a small permanent
 magnet, near, the shadow can be twisted to the right or to the left.
    When the little indicator was "placed entirely within the mole
 cular shadow no movement was produced. As soon, however, as
an adjacent electromagnet was excited, the shadow was twisted half
 off the indicator, which immediately rotated with great speed.
    The Trajectory of Molecules.—The amount of deflection of the
stream of molecules forming a shadow is in proportion to the mag
netic power employed.
    The trajectory of the molecules forming the shadow is curved
when under the magnetic influence: the action of the magnet is to
twist the trajectory of the molecules round in a direction at an
angle to their free path, and to a greater extent as they are nearer
the magnet, the direction of twist being that of the electric current
passing round the electromagnet.
    Laws of Magnetic Deflection.—An apparatus was constructed so
that the deflection of a spot of light was used instead of that of a
shadow, a horseshoe magnet being placed underneath the negative
pole to deflect the trajectory.        The action of the north pole being                              .
to give the line of molecules a spiral twist one way, and that of
the south pole being to twist it the other way, the two poles side
by side compel the line to move in a straight line up or down,
along a plane at right angles to the plane of the magnet and a line
joining    its
             poles.
    The ray      molecules does not appear

ºl    on  the molecules, we perceive that their trajectory
                                                                        a

curved at low exhaustions, and gets flatter as the exhaustion         in
creases.      A flatter trajectory corresponds to a higher velocity.
This may arise from one of two conditions: either the initial im
pulse given by the negative pole is stronger, or the resisting medium
is rarer. The latter is probably the true one. The molecules
which produce the green phosphorescence must be looked upon as
in a state differing from those arrested by frequent collisions.
The latter impede the velocity of the free molecules and allow
longer time for magnetism to act on them ; for, although the de
 flecting force of magnetism might be expected to increase with the
 velocity of the molecules, Prof. Stokes has pointed out that it
 would have to increase as the square of the velocity, in order that
 the deflection should be as great at high as at low velocities.
      Comparing the free molecules to cannon-balls, the magnetic
 pull to the earth's gravitation, and the electrical excitation of the
 negative pole to the explosion of the powder in the gun, the tra
 jectory will be flat when no gravitation acts, and curved when
 under the influence of gravitation.         It is also much curved when
 the ball passes through a dense resisting medium ; it is less curved
 when the resisting medium gets rarer; and, as already shown,
 intensifying the induction spark, equivalent to increasing the
 charge of powder, gives greater initial velocity, and therefore
  flattens the trajectory.     The parallelism is still closer if we com
  pare the evolution of light seen when the shot strikes the target,
 with the phosphorescence on the glass screen from molecular
  impacts.
      Focus of Heat of Molecular Impact.—The author finally describes
  an apparatus in which he shows that great heat is evolved when
  the concentrated focus of rays from a nearly hemispherical alumi
  nium cup is deflected sideways, to the walls of the glass tube, by a
  magnet.      By using a somewhat larger hemisphere, and allowing
   the negative focus to fall on a strip of platinum-foil, the heat rises
   to the melting-point of platinum.
       An Ultra-gaseous State of Matter.—The paper concludes with
   some theoretical speculations on the state in which the matter
   exists in these highly-exhausted vessels.      The modern idea of the
   gaseous state is based upon the supposition that a given space
   contains millions of millions of molecules in rapid movement in all
   directions, each having millions of encounters in a second. In
    such a case, the length of the mean free path of the molecules is
   exceedingly small as compared with the dimensions of the vessel,
   and the properties which constitute the ordinary gaseous state of
    matter, which depend upon constant collisions, are observed.       But
    by great rarefaction the free path is made so long that the hits in
    a given time may be disregarded in comparison with the misses, in
    which case the average molecule is allowed to obey   its   own motions
  or     laws without interference; andif     the mean free path is   com
    parable
          to                        the vessel, the properties which con

                 the dimensions
     stitute gaseity are reduced   a   minimum, and the matter becomes
          to

                                       in     which the very decided but

   Rays of Molecular Light.—In speaking of a ray of molecular
light the author has been guided more by a desire for conciseness
of expression than by a wish to advance a novel theory. But he
believes that the comparison, under these special circumstances, is
strictly correct, and that he is as well entitled to speak of a ray of
molecular or emissive light when         presence               its

 more scientific method has obtained. Excellent as many of these
 observations were, furnishing, as in Howard's case, the elements of
 climate, they were still isolated; for while they recorded weather
 changes, it was only at the particular localities where they were ob
served.     For real advancement a network of stations was requisite:
to   organize such a network was clearly out of the power of isolated
observers; only large Associations could undertake a work of the
kind; and even under the auspices of an old-established association,
 such an undertaking might lack the necessary stability in order
to carry it out to a useful end. Governments alone could really
grapple with such an extensive subject as is presented to us in me
teorology; and this has been accomplished by both the American
and Indian Governments.         In India many important questions,
bearing in no small degree on the welfare and even the lives of the
inhabitants, have arisen in consequence of the widespread calamities
with which the peninsula has been visited, particularly the recent
famines.     To such questions Mr. Blanford, the Meteorological
Reporter to the Government of India, has directed his most sedu
lous attention, and has sought to elucidate the links of the chain of
causation which led to and culminated in the famine of 1876. Two
of these links have been ascertained—one to consist of the failure
of rainfall in the western and southern provinces, where the staple
vegetation was withered to the condition of hay under an ever
cloudless sky, the other of a superabundant outpour over the Bur
mese peninsula and the Bay of Bengal of the rain withheld from
the Provinces, which overcharged the Irawadi and caused those dis
astrous floods that washed away and drowned the rice crops: thus
the famine was brought about by a failure and an excess of rainfall—
the failure being largely attributable to the prevalence of northerly
and north-westerly land winds, and the excess to a vapour-laden
current from the south-west, which, recurving cyclonically around
the Bay of Bengal, discharged its burden over the Bay and on the
south-east coast of the peninsula.
    This second report of the Department of Indian Meteorology is
an admirable specimen of the work effected by the Indian Govern
ment.

  3. “On the Distribution of Boulders by other Agencies than that

  The author is of opinion that if boulders had been distributed by
floating ice they should now be accumulated “in certain parallel and
quasi-concentric lines.” This he does not find to be the case in
Sweden and North Russia, where the distribution is irregular.
From the mode of distribution he infers that the boulders must have
been uniformly distributed in the ice blocks, whereas they ought to
have been most abundant at the base. The boulders are not con
nected with existing ravines, and the author does not see how ice
can move on a plain.     He has never seen a glacier-moraine, but
thinks that these boulders are not like the blocks in moraines. In
Siberia, Portugal, and Rio Janeiro the author has seen solid nuclei
in decomposed granite. Such boulders, as he notices, may be left
after decomposition of a once flowing molten mass, of which they
have formed a part or in which they have been entangled.

     “I  propose in this memorandum to remove this objection [namely,
the objection to the hypothesis of the original fluidity of the planets
on the ground of the exceptional magnitude of the oblateness of the
planet Mars] by showing that geometers have not handled the pro
blem of spheroids in such a general way as could be wished.” And
after having indicated the method he employs, he says:–“This
calculation, made by the usual methods (that is to say, by employing
Laplace's functions and neglecting quantities of the second order),

 apparatus is discharged, every thing returns to the initial state:
 the liquid which had descended in the tube of the inner vessel rises
again; and that which had risen in the tube of the outer case re
 descends.      We must therefore conclude that the internal capacity
and the external volume increase during the charge of a Leyden jar.

which can be made to this conclusion.
    (1) The effect cannot be attributed to a rise of temperature,
since the discharge causes it to disappear immediately instead of
increasing        it.

of turns of the coil; the resistance increases, and the intensity is
diminished.   The opposite effect is produced if the intensity of the
current diminishes.
   By suitably regulating the force of the antagonizing spring, the
electromagnet, the distribution of the wire upon the bobbin, and
the curvature of the divider, we can render the system astatic; and
then the apparatus gives a mathematically constant current.
   In practice we can maintain the intensity of the current between
two limits fixed beforehand, and as close as we will.
   From an industrial point of view, the apparatus can be applied
to electrotyping, to the incandescence of wires of platinum or
iridium (to prevent their fusion), and, if the problem should one
day receive       its

suing without intermission the study of the Tertiary plants dis
covered in divers countries till then unexplored (for example, the
Isle of Wight, Greenland, &c.), he laboured incessantly, adding
some general features to the magnificent work to a sketch of which
we here limit ourselves.
   Let us first place ourselves in Switzerland, where, as we know,
the various freshwater formations belong to the three horizons of
the Miocene.      The Tertiary flora of Switzerland comprised at
least 3000 species of plants.     It was consequently much richer
                                                                       }                                                     4
and more varied than even that of the most favoured countries of
the south of Europe; and we must go into tropical regions—to
Jamaica, for instance, and to Bahia—to see at the present time
such an abundance and diversity of forms.        Assembled at that
time within the little territory of Switzerland, those plants are
now disseminated into       parts    the world; but

   In the Pliocene flora the tropical types have totally disappeared;
but a few subtropical species are still found. The plants of the
warm region predominate; those of the temperate zone continue
to increase in number.          The American character remains very
marked.                                     -
   Finally, in the Quaternary flora the subtropical species and
those of the warm region have entirely disappeared, even in Italy.
Most of the plants are identical with those now living in the same
regions.     Some exotic and extinct types, however, are found in                                                     it,

on the diffusion of cane-sugar, as well as the analogous experiments
of Voit, show such wide deviations from the theory that the cal
culation of them according to the formulae derived from it has no
meaning.
   Further, the experiments instituted by Johannisjanz, after the
prism method described by Kundt, are considered, of which the
formal differences from the theory do not appear to be great; yet
the coefficient of diffusion of common salt through water, calcu
lated from them, namely 0.45, is too little by more than half.
From the determinations made by Fick upon the same salt, the
values 0-94 for 15° and 1:13 for 20° temperature are deduced for
this coefficient; and these values agree with Graham's experiments,
as well as with some to be subsequently published.
   The great errors by which the results obtained by optical methods
are affected proceed from the fact that the hypothesis on which
those methods are based, viz. that a horizontal beam of light which
falls upon a vertical plane bounding a diffusing liquid remains
horizontal during                      its
                            passage through the liquid,         incorrect.                      is

that the fragments of the metal were soldered together at places,
under the influence of a partial softening: these numbers therefore
include a portion of the heat of fusion.
   4. The heat of fusion of gallium can be easily determined.        By
introducing some crystals into the superfused gallium, the whole
of the metal crystallizes rapidly. At 13°           thus found +19.14      I
and +19:08, mean +19:11, for the unit of weight.
   This number remains sensibly the same for every temperature
between 30° and zero, on account of the specific heats of the liquid
and the solid being nearly identical.    Referred to the atomic weight,
it becomes 1:33   calory.
   5. It will be observed that the two specific heats of gallium, taken
near the same temperature, are nearly identical.       Mercury presents
the same  peculiarity,    specific  its
                                   heat being, according   Regnault:-                        to
                          0.0319 between –40° and    78°;                 –
                          0-0333 between zero and 100°.
It   isthe same with the other metals. Thus the specific heat                                                        of
melted lead between 350° and 400°, according                        Person 0-040,      to

XI.  Investigations on the Nature of Spectra (1. Theory;
  2. Spectra of Mired Gases).  By EILHARD WIEDEMANN".
   CE the       path-opening            investigations    of Bunsen            and
SINKirchhoff    the spectra of incandescent gases have been
subjected to a more searching elaboration ; and it has been re
peatedly endeavoured to ascertain theoretically the reasons for
the occurrence of line and band spectra, to discover relations
between the individual lines which compose them, as well as
to explain the variations which they undergo through pressure
and change of temperature.
   As, however, the physicists in question mostly enter more
closely only into particular points, and but cursorily touch
upon the causes for the spectral lines without bringing them
into connexion with other data resulting from the mechanical
theory of gases,  I have tried, partly in continuation of their
considerations, to form for myself a theory of spectral pheno
mena, which should be useful in enabling me to get, first of
all, fixed points for a series of experimental investigations, the
first part of which   Itake leave to communicate supplementary
to the above   theory.
                                  THEORY.
   According to the kinetic theory of gases, the individual mo
lecules contained in them move rapidly in                all
                                                directions.  As
Stefan and Van der Waals have inferred from the experiments

78           M. E. Wiedemann's Investigations on
forces exist to distances which are great in comparison with
the dimensions of the molecules themselves.          At very minute
distances, however, the molecules must repel one another,
since otherwise there would be no reason for the recoil of the
particles after each collision. These repulsions probably pro
ceed from the envelopes of aether surrounding the molecules
of the bodies, and must diminish more rapidly with increase
of distance than the attractive forces. The rotation and oscil
lation of the individual atoms in the molecule about a common
centre of gravity, which take place in addition to the transla
tory motions, lead, at a sufficiently elevated temperature, to
the division of the molecules into their atoms.       These rotatory
and    oscillatory   motions are periodic,  and must also call forth
periodic vibrations in the surrounding luminiferous aethe
    Line Spectra.-Let a rarefied gas be heated to the highest
possible temperature; we can then assume that the individual
 molecules are decomposed into their atoms.          On the collision
 of  these,  oscillatory  motions  only will occur, since, according
 to the  experiments     of Kundt and   Warburg   on the specific heat
 of mercury vapour, as well as the theoretic reflections of Max
 well, Watson, and Boltzmann, in monatomic molecules the vis
 viva of the motions of rotation is nil.         The spectra which
 make their appearance with these elevated temperatures con
 sist of separate bright lines, the cause of which we have
 accordingly to seek in the oscillatory motion of the atoms,
 since they also occur with the vapours of mercury and cad
 mium, which are regarded as monatomic.             .
    Let the    gas  be so much rarefied that the time which elapses
 between two collisions is very great in comparison with that
 during which the particles are within their reciprocal spheres
 of action ; then, with the motions of the individual aether par
 ticles, at first with small amplitudes, a limited number of rays
 will be emitted of a different vibration-period, whose wave
 lengths will depend on the special arrangement of the aether
 among the atoms.         If the elongations become greater, say by
 our raising the temperature of the gas, and with it the vis vira
 of each of the colliding atoms, then to these fundamental        vi
 brations certain harmonic ones will be added, the vibration
  period of which, again, will depend on the arrangement of the
  aether and the forces in action between it and the material
atoms.
   That many of the individual lines in the observed spectra
may be regarded as really harmonics of a fundamental vibra
tion, Lecoq de Boisbaudran, Stoney, Soret, and others have
proved by careful calculations. Above         all
                                           must the intensity

of the higher harmonic vibrations, to which the more-refran
gible rays correspond, increase with the augmentation of the
amplitude; and in fact Lecoq de Boisbaudran finds that, in
the nitrogen-spectrum, at a higher temperature the blue lines,
corresponding to the double octave of certain vibrations, come
out, at a lower the red and yellow, as a fifth of the same vibra
tions. Similarly, lithium chloride in the flame of the Bunsen
burner shows a very bright red and a very faint orange line;
before the blowpipe the latter increases in brightness much
more than the former, though without becoming equal to it;

disturbance of the vibratory motion can occur in the place in
question; at other times sudden changes of phase appear, by
which the vibrations are altered in a quite indeterminate
manner. Hence that difference of phases up to which inter
ferences are still observable gives a measure for the time
during which a regular motion takes place at the luminous
point. The source of light is formed of the great number of
atoms or molecules which                  the vicinity
                                                 lie   in  that point.            of

between two collisions.       But this period, for the different mo

they show (as was first remarked by Lecoq de Boisbaudran)
the same groups of lines, only in different places in the spec
trum.      Hence they are composed of the same harmonic
tions of different fundamentals; therefore the configurations
of the envelopes enclosing the material atoms, or the forces
acting upon these, must be similar.              A displacement of the
lines corresponding to one another in the spectra in question
from the red towards the violet signifies, cateris paribus, an
increase of the attractive force of the atoms upon the aether
 envelopes enclosing them.
    Band Spectra.-If we consider gases which are composed
not of single atoms but of molecules, we shall then often have
to investigate not the spectra of emission, but of absorption,
 since at the temperatures at which those gases begin to be
luminous their molecules are already broken up. Whether
the molecules be composed of homogeneous or heterogeneous
 atoms, the spectra will always be conditioned by the rotatory
 or oscillatory motions either of the entire molecules or of the
 atoms in them or the aether envelopes enclosing the latter;
 hence they will possess a corresponding character. Thus,
 with simple gases at low temperatures the so-called band
 spectra appear, quite analogously to which the spectra of com
 binations are composed.         Both consist of broad bands of light,
 which    upon   closer examination prove to be formed of bright
 and dark lines. So it is with nitrogen, and with carbonic
                      I
 acid; just so, as have repeatedly convinced myself, do the
 haloid compounds of the metals of the alkaline earths, and
  similarly also those of mercury (conf. the experiments of Mr.
  Pierce in a memoir that will shortly appear).
     We will inquire first whether these spectra are to be attri

  calculate approximately by means of the mechanical theory of
  gases.    Let m be the mass of a molecule, u the velocity of

                          º
 by  J. Moser. Lockyer likewise refers the different spectra of the same
 body to differently complicated complexes, of atoms.         The question
 whether to the same elements only one (a line spectrum) or a plurality
 of spectra (of lines and          can belong, can be decided in favour of
 the latter view by Willner's last experiments, as well as by Lockyer's
 investigations on the absorption-spectra of differently heated vapours.

different lines can be recognized as characterizing the band
spectra.
   The assumption, however, that the band spectra are gene
rated by rotatory motions", is opposed by the consideration
that,      if
          when the temperature is raised the light emitted by
gases always consists of rays of the same wave-length, the
molecular diameter must increase proportionally to the abso
lute velocity, or to the root of the absolute temperature, since
only then could the number of rotations remain invariable.               In
all other cases the lines must             displaced            be
                                                      towards the red                                               or
the violet, according          the molecular diameter increases with
                                              as
rising temperature more                less quickly than the velocity

all the spectrum-experiments hitherto made.

forces conditioning in these the vibrations of the aether are
of an intrinsically different nature from those in the mole
cules built up out of the atoms of the same elements; but when

lecules of the elements composing them are similar, the general
appearance of the spectra             both will also be the same,
even if the individual lines in them do not coincide.     Thus it
is with the absorption-spectra of iodine vapour, vapour of bro
mine, and the vapour of monochloride of iodine closely                         in
vestigated by Roscoe and Thorpe.        In like manner must com
pounds of                composition also furnish similar spectra
—as, for example, the haloid compounds of the earth-metals,
mercury, &c.
    If we can succeed in determining for the band spectra of
the elements or compounds the fundamental vibrations, and if
the motions are conditioned by the forces in action between
the atoms, we must be able to determine these in absolute and
relative measure from the absolute weight and mutual distances
 of the atoms, which are at any rate determinable by the newer
 theory of gases.    Intimations for such investigations we find
 in the    dºmen.       which, according to Mitscherlich's, Leco

                M. E. Wiedemann's Investigations on
whose great capacity of reaction indicates that their molecules
are        broken up, almost constantly show line spectra. That
different substances at the same temperature possess different
kinds of spectra we might also be inclined to infer from the
fact that in the same Geissler tube, which contains at the
same time hydrogen and nitrogen, the nitrogen bands appear
together with the hydrogen-lines.      This inference, however,
is not absolutely  correct, since, as we shall subsequently see,
in a mixture of gases the passage of electricity is brought
about with different degrees of facility by the molecules of
different substances. .
  In complete accordance with this are the results obtained
by M. Wüllner, who found, when he caused discharges to pass
through gases at a determined pressure, that now line and
now band spectra appeared, according as the equalization of
the electricities ensued as a tuft or a spark. The latter ex
tended to only a few, the former to great number of particles.
As in general at each discharge of a definite collecting-appa
ratus with an equal charge an equal quantity of electricity
passes, the temperature in the spark must be much higher
than in the tuft; hence in the spark discharge a breaking-up
of the molecules into their parts is much more probable than
in the tuft discharge".      Moreover the behaviour of mercury
vapour proves that a band spectrum is not constantly com
bined with the tuft discharge, nor a line spectrum with the
spark discharge.          If
                        mercury is introduced into wide tubes,
and heated, and the discharge of the induction-coil passed
through, the luminous particles of mercury              fill
                                                   the entire tube;
and  yet  itshows  only  the line spectrum.    Sodium behaves              in
just the same manner.
   Disagreeing with the views we have now unfolded, some
have supposed that the differences between band and line
spectra could      explained
                     be               by

                              the Nature          of Spectra.              89
    Displacement of the Spectra in Solutions.—I am inclined to
attribute, at least in part, to chemical influences those dis
placements which the absorption-streaks of various materials
undergo according to the substance in which they are dis
solved—especially in the case of organic colouring matters,
the quickly commencing decomposition of which in solutions
indicates the chemical influence of the solvents.         The influ
ence of the dispersion of the solvent may be checked, since
solutions, for instance, of potassio-chromic oxalate in water
and in glycerine show the absorption-streak in exactly the
same place in the spectrum, although the dispersions of these                   -
two substances are sensibly different.
     The question, finally, which has lately been repeatedly dis
cussed, of the difference of the spectra, both of emission and
                         º:
absorption, of one and the same substance under different
conditions (H. W. Vogel and                       J.
                                       Moser), it appears to me may
be solved thus               the above considerations are true):-
Within the molecules of any chemical compound, which are
 withdrawn from the influence of the molecules in their vici
 nity, perfectly definite vibrations take place, conditioning
 completely determined spectra; but as soon as these molecules
 come nearer to one another, or, in liquids or solids, form more
 complex (multiple) molecules, or, finally, in solutions are               in
 fluenced also by the action of another substance, the spectra
 may change their appearance.         That two different substances
         perfectly identical spectra is thinkable only when the
#. orces acting between
                   -       the atoms in their molecules are iden
 tical.
     It is my intention to test by experiments, and pursue fur
 ther, the views which have now been unfolded, and which very
 well explain a great number of the facts that have hitherto
 been observed.       But for this, it is before                all
                                                    things necessary
to    examine the spectra under completely determined condi
  tions   oftemperature and pressure.
     The most convenient means for the production            elevated of
temperatures,   such               as
                         are necessary     call forth gas-spectra,

    The tubes were then fixed insulated and horizontal in an
air-bath of iron, 16 centims. deep, 11 centims. wide, and 14
centims. long, by means of glass tubes which passed through
the two side walls of the bath. The front and back walls of
the bath were formed of plates of mica; and another mica
plate served as a cover.                }.
                                     heating was effected by a gas
burner    placed   beneath.    The  progress   of the phenomena was
examined both during the heating and especially during the
cooling. The temperatures were measured by an ordinary
thermometer placed immediately on the Geissler tube.
    For the examination of the spectra either a Bunsen spec
trum-apparatus or a Browning direct-vision spectroscope was
used.     To the former, in the place of the hair cross in the ob
serving-telescope, a slit-diaphragm was applied, in order to
blind off certain portions of the spectrum.
    A middle-sized Ruhmkorff induction-apparatus served as
 the source of electricity,             its
                                   primary current being furnished

nitrogen-lines are distinctly seen, and the lines of mercury
become more feebly luminous.       At 130° the mercury-lines
at the negative electrode are less bright than in the positive
luminous sphere.     First at 100° do traces of the nitrogen

Very hot spark discharges even might exert similar actions.
But we cannot hence infer that the hydrogen itself vanishes
or is transformed into a material of another nature.
   The above-described phenomena might result from several
causes.  (1) The vaporized mercury may crowd the other
gases out of the hotter portions of the tube into the colder, so
that     its
        own vapour alone       found     the path   isthe spark.      in                 of

the adjustment without much loss of time and with simple ap
paratus.                                             -
   The adjustment, as the following consideration will show,
can be made on each line of the spectrum without any appa
ratus whatever. The only requirement is that the prism should
be movable.
   Suppose the rays which fall on the prism to be either con
vergent or divergent; then, after their passage through the
prism they will seem either to converge to or diverge from a
point, which is the secondary focus: as the prism is turned, so
as to change the first angle of incidence, the secondary focus
will change.         If
                   the rays are strictly parallel, then, whatever
be the   position of the prism, the focus will not be altered.
This, then, is a delicate test for ascertaining whether rays
proceeding from the collimator are parallel or not. It remains
to be shown how it can be converted into a rapid method to
put the collimator into the right adjustment.

                                                  of
parallel are the rays. The following system            consecutive                   of
approximation will therefore give the desired result.

           Adjusting the Collimator of a Spectroscope.                   97
until the line in question, either dark or bright, is distinctly
Seen.
   2. Move the prism into position B, and focus the collimator
until the same line is distinctly seen.
   3. Repeat the operation, always focusing the telescope
when the prism is in position A, and the collimator when the
prism is in position B. After three or four trials no change
of focus is required; both collimator and telescope will then
be adjusted for parallel rays.       I   find that it is by no means
necessary to work much out of the position of minimum de
viation in order to gain a delicate adjustment.             If the adjust
ment is made in the centre of the          field, then  I usually  put the
telescope into such a position that the line, when the prism is
placed at maximum deviation, should just be out of the field
of view; this gives quite a sufficient change of focus if the
rays are not parallel on entering the prism.
   The following measurements, which were purposely made
without special care, will show the accuracy of which the me
thod is capable. The sliding tube of the collimator was divided
into millimetres. Two different adjustments for the sodium
line, made in the way described above, gave the readings 5-0
and 4-0.    The prism was now turned round so as to deflect
the  ray to the other side.    Two adjustments now gave 4-1 and
5-0.      e mean of the four readings is 4.5.            The adjustment
was then made according to the well-known method of first
focusing the telescope on a distant object and focusing the col
limator to the telescope afterwards: the reading was 4-2.               As
the focal length of the collimator was 300 millimetres, the two
results differ only by a thousandth part of the focal length.
Whether this difference is due to errors of observation, or
whether it is produced by a difference in the focus of the yel

with a little precaution, the method can be adapted to the

study of the achromatism of a lens.
   I  have assumed that the faces of the prism are perfectly
plane.    Practically it is difficult to get a prism in                this
 condition is  accurately   fulfilled  ;   and it   may    be   questioned
whether the curvature of the prism may not seriously interfere
 with the accuracy of the method.            To this reply:-

of the prism are plane. . It is by no means evident that parallel

troduced by the curvature of the prism is very small. One
prism, which        I know     to be exceptionally bad, gave a                      differ
ence    of a half per cent. in the focal length of the collimator.
It   is not the change of focus introduced by the curvature of
the prism which makes the method inaccurate when the prism
is bad, but the difference in the change of focus in the two
  ositions of the prism. This is one of the reasons why it is
   tter to take the two positions of the prism not too far away
from minimum deviation. The small displacement of the
prism will only introduce a small variation in the focal length
due to the curvature of the faces.

with magnets floating vertically and subjected to the attraction
of a superposed magnet. The object of this paper is to present
accurate diagrams of the configurations formed by the floating
magnets, and to give the laws ruling these configurations,
with some notices of the peculiarities of these forms. At the
same time       I
              will show how neatly these experiments illustrate
several phenomena in the molecular structure of matter.
   The Diagrams.-These diagrams show the configurations
formed by numbers of magnets extending from two to twenty.
They were obtained as follows:—The number of needles form
ing a configuration were floated in a bowl filled to           brim with its
water. The eye-ends          the needles, which protruded

              Configurations formed                  by   Floating Magnets.        99
board   Idrew a black disk. The centres of these disks I joined
by lines, in order to bring before the eye the contours of the
configurations.   After the diagrams of the configurations had
been obtained in this way, they were placed at a fixed distance
from the camera ; and photo-engravings were thus made, of
about one half the sizes of the original prints.
   The Morphological Laws of the Configurations.—The confi
gurations made by the floating magnets form well-marked
groups or classes, which may be designated in order as pri
mary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary, &c. The stable confi
gurations of one class form the nuclei to the succeeding
Ones.
   Looking at the diagrams, the reader will see that figures 2
to 8a inclusive form the primaries.     Figure 8b begins the
secondaries, for it is the hexagon with 2 for nucleus.  Confi
gurations 8b, 8c, 9, 10b, 10a, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18a,
18b, and 19 a are secondaries, having respectively for nuclei
the primaries 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5 a, 6a, 7, 7, 7, 8a, 8 a.
The configuration 10b is not found in the diagrams; it is the
same as the 10 which forms the nucleus of 20, only the two
central lateral needles are further removed outward from the
vertical axis of the figure 10.
    The group of 19 b begins the tertiaries. Of these          do not          I
give diagrams, but indicate their structure by giving the num
bers of the secondaries forming their nuclei, and then give the
numbers of needles grouped around these nuclei. Thus, the
structure of the configuration formed of 47 needles is indicated
by 47 = (18+14)+15; which means that 47 needles form a
                                                                                   14 by

   The reader has seen that         given number
                                            a           magnets may          of

               more different     configurations.    Thus five mag

             configurations formed by Floating Magnets.
                  Six magnets give 6a and 6b. With eight
magnets we obtain three configurations, 8a, 8b, and 8 c. Now
the different configurations formed of the same number of
magnets always                different degrees of stability. Vibra
tion of the less stable forms (produced by alternately lifting
and lowering the superposed magnet) sends them into the
                   Thus, 5b on vibration rearranges itself into 5a,
                                                                                  103
stable forms.
6b into    6a,  and 8c or 8b into 8a. With the configurations
of   higher   classes (the tertiaries, quaternaries, &c.), even a
 knock on the table is sufficient to cause the needles of the un
stable configuration to move to positions of stable equilibrium.
    On looking at the diagrams, it will be observed that onl
 the stable primaries form the nuclei of the secondaries; and,
 moreover, those primaries which are not dimorphous, like 2,
 3, 4, and 7, serve as nuclei to more than one secondary. Thus,
 2 is the nucleus of 8a, 8b, 8c, 9, and 10b ; 3 is the nucleus
 of 10a and 11; and 7 is the nucleus to 16, 17, and 18; while
 each of the other stable and dimorphous primaries, 5 a, 6a, and
 8a, appears only once as nucleus, respectively to 14, 15, and
 18b.       is same power of the most stable nuclei to resist out
 side stress is shown in the configurations of the tertiary and
 quaternary classes, where the secondary 11 appears as nucleus
 to 21, 22, 23, and 24. The secondary 18 a persists in even a
  more marked manner as a nucleus. This 18 a has the contour
  of that very stable 7 (the only configuration possible with 7
  magnets) which forms           its
                                 nucleus.   Among the tertiaries                     18

serve to explain and illustrate the phenomena, on the assump

similarly take place among repelling and attracting points
situate in space of three dimensions.

configuration can be transported, and may thus serve in illus
tration of a moving molecule as set forth in the kinetic
theory of gases. It is interesting to watch the mutual actions
of two or more approaching configurations, and to observe
the motions in the exterior and in the contour of a suspended

gutta-percha-covered wire with the zinc of the next cell. The
                                          j
space between the coppers and zincs is filled with sand satu
rated with weak solution of zinc sulphate; and zinc filings are
mixed with the upper layers of sand to reduce any copper
sulphate that might diffuse upwards.        The cells are mounted
in an ebonite stand. With this arrangement and the copper
iron ring described beforef, it is quite easy to get decided de
flections of about 3 centims. in air, copper negative to iron.
After admission of the hydrogen sulphide the deflections are
considerably greater, copper being now the positive metal.
   As copper is negative to             in water and positive to it
in  hydrochloric  acid,  a ring  was made of these metals similar
in size to the copper-iron one. Here the deflection obtained
was about 4 centims. in air, copper negative. Hydrochloric
acid gas was caused to flow into the case; and after a few
oscillations the negatively electrified needle crossed zero and
turned towards copper, the deflection gradually increasing to
1.5 centim. The flow of gas was then stopped; and the deflec
tion slowly decreased.       In four hours after, it had fallen to 1
millim. It then began to increase; but the admission of fresh
hydrochloric acid gas caused it to diminish, a phenomenon the
explanation of which is not clear. The reversal of the poten
tial of these metals, on the admission of the gas, however, was
quite decided.    The experiment was not repeated, as the cor
roding action of the acid was destructive to the apparatus.
The ratio of differences of potential given by these deflections
is,    course, rough,
      of                       as
                           the apparatus    not adapted for exact

tric potential by contact of dissimilar substances is attributed
to the nature of the gas or atmosphere surrounding them.       It
is probably so only in so far as such gas produces, by conden
sation, a film of itself on the surfaces of the substances in
question.
   In experiments where the difference of potential of a metal
and a liquid in contact is the subject of investigation, the
arrangement is probably analogous to a two-fluid cell with
plates of the same kind of metal, i. e. the metal under exami
nation—one of the fluids in the supposed cell being that in
contact with the metal, and the other being the film of mois
ture &c. condensed on the metal.
   Slight variations in the nature of this film, due perhaps to
the remains of whatever may have been used for cleaning the
metal, or to such vapours as might be present in the atmo
sphere of the laboratory, would produce corresponding varia
tions in the amount of difference of potential observed—just
as a small quantity of hydrogen-sulphide in            atmosphere                           the
surrounding the copper and iron          contact reverses the relain
tive potentials           of
                     these metals.  This would     doubt account,                      no
    least partially, for the discrepancies
byat
                                              the results obtained        by

different experiments with the same liquid and metal.

112                 Mr.W. W. Jacques                        on the Effect              of the Motion of the
balls, and their velocity measured with the anemometer.      The
estimates of density have been made from the velocity of mo
tion.   Now the experiments of Professor Tyndall have shown
that currents of air of varying density form one of the chief
obstacles to the propagation of sound-waves.      The author, in
repeating these experiments in a somewhat modified form,
found that such currents of air not only decrease the intensity
of a sound-wave, as Professor Tyndall has shown, but that
they actually modify       form, and             its

the auditorium found a period of half an hour's duration when
the sound was not so plain as it had been before, or was after.

later than the period of interruption of the ventilation ; but

118                 Professors Perry and Ayrton on the Music
receive much cultivation.     Even with the experience of sound
the ear has  gained  during  the last four hundred years, how
very few people are there sufficiently educated to have their
feelings excited through music in answer to the emotions of
                                                                      all

instantaneous education the ear      the eye receives which en

nates.   Similarly, the emotions produced by the play of
colours in a fine sunset, by the rolling of the waves on the sea
shore, by the rhythmic motion of a large engine or of a long
pendulum, by the tracing out of the combined harmonic curves,
which have now become well known to all who have heard
lectures on vibrating bodies, seem to be quite different from
one another, and from the emotions produced by sound.
   We have therefore tried to make a machine which to the
emotions produced by a combination of colour, a mass in
motion, and by motion in curved paths, would bear the same
                         iii
relationship as a musical instrument to music. We have not
ventured to give our machine a name, since the name of the
                                                    º
instrument           be that of the art; and although we have
a name for exciting emotion by sound (music), we lack names
both for the art of exciting emotion by colour, and by moving
bodies.
   Many instruments have                     been devised for combining
together two harmonic motions; but as the conception of using
such machines as emotion-exciters has never been present in
ºº
the designers’ minds, the performances of these instruments,
although very beautiful, are necessarily of a comparatively ele
mentary nature. The most important of these machines,                                                      all   of

whereas at any other place it is such that, acting like a cam
or tappet, it gives pure harmonic motion to a slider kept press
ing on the roller, and only capable of radial motion. Such a
sliding piece, resting any where between K and C, receives one
complete harmonic motion during one revolution of the roller;
if it rests anywhere between G and K, it completes two pure
harmonic motions during a revolution, three between
                               J,

G, four between F and           five between H and F, and six

     j,
sliding piece is made to rest on places nearer the circular sec
tion, where of course there is no up and down motion of the
sliding piece.
   Every section, therefore, of the roller has a curved outline,
of        the construction is easy.    Thus suppose we want the
section which will  give a slider five complete harmonic swings
in one revolution of the roller. Make the    angle A O B (fig. 2)
equal to one fifth of four right angles; describe the circular
arc A B with O as centre and radius OA equal to R+r,
where R is the radius of each of the three circular parts of the
roller H,       J,
             K, and r the radius of the small friction-wheel on
the end of the sliding piece; make B D equal to half the
maximum swing we wish the slider to receive.          Then with
centre B and radius B D describe the semicircle 159, which
divide into any number of equal parts (eight in the figure), and
let fall perpendiculars 22, 33, 44, &c. from the points of sub
division on to the diameter D B 9, meeting it in the numbered
points. With 0 as centre, describe a circular arc through
each of these numbered points in DB.           Divide the angle
A O B into twice the number of equal parts into which               i.
semicircle 159 was divided. Then draw a curve 1 CD through
the intersections of the first arc and first radius, the second
arc and second radius, &c.     Finally, draw a great many equal
circles with radius r, the centres being in the curve; then the
envelope        DEF
                  (fig. 3) is one fifth of the whole curved sec
tion we wish the curved roller to possess; and a template of
tin may be made to be used in the construction of the roller.
It will be found advisable to construct four templates for each
division of the roller, since, although a section of the har
monic surface described by the centre of the little friction
wheel formed by a plane passing through the axis of the large
roller in a straight line, such a section of the actual surface on
which the little wheel rests will be curved in consequence of
r,     radius, not being infinitely small. Our large roller was

           of                 itwould have been much better     it, if

124       Professors Perry and Ayrton on the Music
rods moved in circular grooves; and the result would be that
not only could we alter the amplitude of any one of the com
ponent harmonic vibrations by moving a slider along the
rod, but we could also alter the phase by giving the rod a cir
cular motion. To do this, however, satisfactorily would have
required either the employment of a much larger roller, so that
the slowest vibration of a slider occurred four or five times
during one revolution of the roller, or else a change in the
arrangement. In the illustration (fig. 1) the glass plate, for
simplicity is shown merely kept in position by the four cords;
but in reality it moved in a horizontal frame which again slid
in a vertical one, so that any lateral motion at right angles to
the plane of the glass was impossible.
   The reason why there is necessarily a considerable dis
tance between the sets of fixed and moved pulleys is in order
that a longitudinal motion of the slider shall not alter the mean
horizontal or vertical position of the spot on the glass.       At
first we had the cords much longer than shown in the figure;
but then, even after great care had been taken in endeavouring
to obtain inextensible cords, some stretching was found to take
place in practice; consequently we were compelled to deter
mine experimentally what was the greatest length of cord that
could be used without the stretching interfering with the ac
curacy of the motion ; and this length was the one employed
in the actual apparatus.
   The ingenious way in which a number of pulleys are made
to give the sum of their motions to the extremity of a cord
was suggested to us by the arrangement employed in Sir W.
Thomson's tide-calculating machine; but it is possible that in
our new machine we shall adopt a totally different plan, and one
which we think is new.     If  the two extremities of a long rigid
rod have   parallel motions  perpendicular  to the rod, the middle
of the rod has a motion    equal to half the sum of the extremi
ties. Thus the parallel motions of two, four, or 2" points may
be compounded.       Similarly for the three points, one third of
the sum of parallel motions is obtained from the centre of a
rigid triangular piece of which the points are the corners; so
that by bars and frames of simple construction it is easy to
get the sum of the parallel motions of any number of pieces.
   We think the roller-plane has much to recommend it; but
a series of little cranks may be better.    Let a number of par
allel shafts, having their bearings near their ends on two sides
of a trough-shaped metal frame, receive from a system of
spur-wheels near their centres relative velocities 1, 2, 3,
&c.    Let A (fig. 13) be either end of any shaft, B being the
corresponding bearing ; and     let  there be          to

AMºº         the most remarkable, and at first sight the most

         inexplicable,
                     of the heterogeneous class of reactions
known as   catalyses are the decompositions   undergone by hy
drogen peroxide in contact with certain substances.     But on
further examination these phenomena afford us the means of
explaining and differentiating a considerable number of similar
reactions and of effecting a classification of them.      As is
well known, hydrogen peroxide, although one of the least
stable of well-defined compounds when in the concentrated
form, becomes when diluted, especially in the presence of acids,
much less subject to decomposition.
    A solution of peroxide of hydrogen, sufficiently dilute to
remain unaffected for a considerable time when mixed with
dilute solution of sodic hydrate, may be used effectively in the
                     ...
preparation of the peroxides of several metals.                 to a solu      If
tion of a cobalt salt, sodic hydrate and then hydrogen peroxide
be added in the cold, the hydrate of cobalt at first precipitated
becomes rapidly                      and a hydrated peroxide of vari
able composition is produced.            Almost immediately a rapid
evolution of     oxygen  takes    place;  and before long the whole of
the excess of     peroxide   of  hydrogen    is decomposed, the cobalt
peroxide, however, remaining unchanged. Under similar cir
cumstances salts of lead and manganese give the same reac
tion, namely the formation of a                             peroxide and
the   decomposition     of the excess of    hydrogen    peroxide.    With
copper the effects are somewhat different: on the addition of
the hydroxyl the suspended blue hydrate of copper assumes a
transient yellowish-red colour, but almost immediately resumes
as its
     original appearance, while the evolution           oxygen proceeds

sical. Chemical catalyses are those which consist of a true
chemical action; and are distinct from ordinary chemical
actions only in this, that one of the bodies remains in the
same state after the action as it was before it.
   According to this view of catalysis and of the constitution
of oxides, we retain the old terms protoxide, oride, and per
oride (distinct from acid anhydride) with somewhat different
meanings.     Oxide of copper (CuO) is no longer the protoxide
but the oxide;    the unknown yellow body is the hydrated per
oxide, while Cu, O is the protoxide. In like manner the oxygen
atoms which in peroxides are held with the least affinity may
be called the peroxygen atoms, and those which are the last
to leave the compound may be called the protowygen atoms.
This nomenclature is distinct from the ordinary one founded
upon the use of the suffixes “ic” and “ous,” and of nume
rical prefixes, and need in no way interfere with        Being                        it.
founded  strictly  upon the chemical behaviour   the compounds         of

sesses evident advantages; but the other terms have important
uses, and might with advantage        retained   the majority

June 1875. They were           two kinds, differing

clined at small normal angles on each other, it is often difficult
to discriminate the faces lying in a particular zone, as the
   reater number of the determinations have to be made with
  aces which offer no images or such as are very confused, and
which can be measured only by the method of maximum illu
mination.
    The figures 1 and 2 represent the same forms as those
already given in the Journal of the Chemical Society.              Fig. 3
exhibits the forms which exist on the crystals obtained from the
 French and the juniper oils, together with some other forms,
of which the existence on some of the crystals is probable,
 though no reliable measurements could be obtained from them.
The crystals rapidly lose by exposure such lustre as they have
 when fresh—apparently in consequence of evaporation taking
place at ordinary temperatures, as evinced by a faint odour
perceptible even while a little crystal is exposed on the go
niometer.

 sorts arearranged incolumns,—the first column consisting of the
 calculated angles as given in the earlier communication to the

     There          is   a    difficulty, however, attendant                           on   the use     of   these

high temperatures; and on this occasion we wish to explain
this difficulty and how it has been overcome.
    The difficulty arises from the fact that, at temperatures very
little above 100°C., a mixture of pure permanganate of potash
and caustic potash evolves oxygen gas.          This fact we have
very carefully ascertained, both by noting the diminution in
oxidizing-power which the solution shows after being heated
to 180° in the oil-bath, and by actually collecting and mea
suring the oxygen gas which was evolved during the heating
in the oil-bath. The gas is evolved very freely at tempera
tures even below 140°C.; and the numerical results accord
very fairly with this equation:—
         2(KMnO,)+2(KHO)=2(K, MnO,)+H, 0+0.
Here, as will be observed, the permanganate of potash is re
presented as losing one fifth of  active oxygen, and yielding
                                                           its
manganate           of potash.
  It  has long been known that      very elevated temperatures,
                                                           at
at temperatures bordering       low redness, permanganate
                                                     on                                       of
potash   parts with oxygen and forms manganate        potash—                    of
that,    point
         in       fact,  these elevated temperatures manga
                          of              at

                                             can stop the evolution
in   amost convenient manner.           We mix some hydrated bin
oxide    ofmanganese with the permanganate and alkali; and

THIS
   nine contain an account of the Speaking                                     Telephone, the tenth
is devoted to the Talking Phonograph, and the last three to the
.
“other novelties,” viz. Quadruple Telegraph, Electric Call Bells,
and the Electric Light. The subjects comprised in this list are at
  resent matters of general interest; and a book which gives a good
      of information respecting them will doubtless obtain a large
number of readers. The printing and general appearance of the
book are much in its favour.     The illustrations, which are nume
rous, are well execued, and will help the reader to form a distinct
conception of the objects they represent.
   It will be observed that the largest part of the volume is devoted
to the telephone. The reason of this we may state in the author's
words:—“The question as to whom we are indebted for the tele
phone is one which, in consequence of the conflicting statements
                                                                     is,

diaphragms are precisely alike, and, in place of a membrane, consist
of small disks of thin iron plate. The vibrations of the one plate
induce magneto-electric currents, which vary the force of the mag
net at the other end of the circuit and thereby produce correspond
ing vibrations in the other plate. The peculiarity of this form of
the instrument is that           action    its reciprocal; either end may
                                                                 is                                                           be

sounds telegraphically as herein described” (p. 215).           Thirdly. It
must be borne in mind that Mr. Prescott           distinctly advocates Mr.
Gray's claim. This, indeed, is clear from what has been already
said; and if further confirmation were needed, it would be found, for
example, in the notes on p. 71 and p. 73, and in the passage at the
end of chapter v. on p. 217: he by no means keeps to the attitude
of a candid inquirer, which he appears to assume in his preface.
On this side of the Atlantic we shall be very much surprised if Mr.
Bell's claims to priority of invention are successfully contested;
still the matter is one which must be adjudicated in the United
States.
   Of the remaining parts of the volume there is not much to say.
They seem to us by no means well drawn up.              From time to time
the composition is very slovenly.       In the contents there are both
excess and defect.       For instance, in the chapter on the Electric
Light a good deal is said which the reader might be presumed to
know, while the parts relating to “novelties” are cut very short.
 In several cases elaborate figures are given marked with half the
letters of the alphabet, and plainly designed to accompany detailed
explanations; the explanations, however, are not there (figs. 202,
203, and 207 are instances).       Another very serious fault—and the
more serious as the book deals in part with evidence—is the way in
which documents are quoted and extracts made from other writers.
It is never easy, and sometimes impossible to tell whether an ex
tract is given verbatim, and even where it begins and where it ends.
Still, with all its faults, the book is one of considerable interest, and
will doubtless find many readers.

Patrick  Doyle,   Esq., C.E. (Communicated       by  the Rev. T. Wiltshire,
M.A., F.L.S., F.G.S.)
   The tin-ore of the Malayan peninsula is obtained from “stream
works” in an alluvial plain extending between a range of granitic
mountains and the sea. The author describes the mines of the
district of Larut Perak.       The ore is got in open workings at an
average depth of about 10 feet.        The tin-bearing stratum has an
average   thickness of 487 feet; it is overlain by stratified sand and
clay, and rests upon either porcelain-clay or, sometimes, a sandstone.
The ore varies from a fine sand, near the sea, to a coarse gravel,
near the mountains, and is mixed with quartz, felspar, mica, and
schorl. The author is of opinion that the stratum of ore has been
derived from the granite of the mountain-range (in which it still
occurs in veins) by denudation, and under conditions which still
exist, though in a modified form.

   3. “Notes on the Consolidated Beach at Pernambuco.”        By    C.              J.
Hawkshaw, Esq., M.A., F.G.S.
   The consolidated beach at Pernambuco, which has already at
tracted considerable notice, is a ridge of sandstone from 25 to 75
yards wide, and, as shown by borings made under the author's
direction, from 10 to 13 feet thick. The landward or higher edge
is nearly at the spring-tide high-water level; and it slopes seaward,
the river (with a depth of 28 feet at low water 60 feet from the
rock) flowing along the former face.     The rise and fall of spring
tides is 7 feet.  Beneath the above rock is a stratum of sand with
shells and stones about 8 feet thick, and then a second layer of
sandstone rock.
   The consolidated beach is cemented by carbonate of lime, which
the author considers to have been deposited by the action of water
percolating through the rock, probably when the level of the land
differed somewhat from what it is at present.    He thinks it possible
that this and other similar beaches on the Brazilian coast may mark
periods of repose in the slow vertical movements                 which the coast has
undergone.

                NOTE ON ELECTROMAGNETS IN TELEGRAPHY.

                                            stated:—“On telephonic
     circuits the reduction in current-strength is nearly inversely
proportional to the pitch of the sound,” &c. This is only true for
a constant electromotive force.      Thus it would be correct for a
battery telephone. The strength of very rapid currents from a
battery through an electromagnet is nearly inversely proportional
to the rapidity.    But in an electromagnetic telephone, although the
electromotive impulse produced by a semivibration of the iron disk
of the sending telephone is constant for           all
                                             pitches, provided the am

   ON TWO NEW FLUORESCENT             SUBSTANCES.            BY E. LOMMEL.
  From Dr. Th. Schuchardt, of Görlitz, I received, some time since,                        .
two new fluorescent substances, the examination of which (by the
method   I
         have previously described) gave the following results.
   1. Anthracene-Blue.—The          deep-blue etheric solution fluoresces
intensely olive-green.        The absorption-spectrum shows four dark
bands, the darkest parts of which are situated at 36, 55, 69, and
86, respectively, of Bunsen's scale, and a darkening of the violet
end, commencing a little before H, while the blue and the greater
part of the violet appear almost unaffected. Of the absorption
bands the second and the third (55 and 69) are by far the most
intense and about equal in intensity; then follows, in the order
of intensity, the rather feeble first (36); and last comes the still
feebler fourth (86). The spectrum of the light of fluorescence
begins faint at 27, distinct at 30, and extends distinct as far
as 70, faint as far as 74.          It shows three maxima, at 40, 52,
and 63, separated by two very clearly marked minima (at 45
and 57), and hence appears to consist of three bright bands—
one red, one orange-yellow, and one green-yellow—of               which the
middle one a little exceeds the others in brightness.              The fluo
rescence-spectrum projected upon the liquid commences faintly at
47, and shows two very bright fluorescence-bands corresponding to
the two most intense absorption-bands, divided by a tolerably dark
interspace, and strongly distinguished from one another by their
different colouring; namely, the first is entirely orange-coloured,
the second yellow-green.          A third, but much fainter, brownish
olive-green-coloured maximum at 86 corresponds to the fourth
absorption-band; the first, on the contrary, has no part in the
fluorescence. In the blue and the violet, from F to shortly before
 H, the fluorescence is very slight, olive-green to reddish, and
 scarcely perceptible; only just before H does it again become more
intense, and extends with an olive-greenish tone into the ultra
violet.    We have here, therefore, a fluorescing substance, with
 which the blue and the greater part of the violet rays evert only an
 eartraordinarily feeble, while the orange-yellow and yellow-green rays
 evert a very intense excitant action.       Ifwe excite with homogeneous
light, descending gradually to continually less refrangibility, we
 observe that the entire fluorescence-spectrum is excited by               the  all
 rays down        58—by the ray 58, for example, not merely the por
               30 to  58, but also the more refrangible from               58
 tion from             to                                                  70.  to

 The   rays below 58, however,           not excite the yellow-green part
of  the light    offluorescence (58      70), but only the red and orange
 coloured   part,  but this also  entirely   for example, we excite with
                                             :                   if

 seen; light which has passed through three red glasses, and only
 reaches  to   50, excites still very distinctly       up   to
                                                          57.   Accordingly

 rule, and the second, more refrangible,           excited only

terized by the absorption-band 55 and orange-yellow fluorescence
(30 to 57), the other by the absorption-band 69 and yellow-green
fluorescence (57 to 70)t.
     2. Bisulphobichloranthracenous Acid.—The faintly brownish
 yellow-coloured etheric solution presents no absorption-bands, but
only a slight absorption of the blue and a stronger of the violet rays.
 It fluoresces at its surfaces a very beautiful blue, from its interior
greenish. The spectrum of its fluorescence-light extends from 30
to 162, (therefore to the violet end), and shows four maxima—viz.
 between 70 and 80, at 109, 131, and 150, of which the first three
 appear about equally intense, the last somewhat less so.     Between
 these maxima are feebly marked minima to be perceived at about
 98, 117, and 140.     The fluorescent spectrum commences (faintly)
 at about F, and extends, with an olive-greenish tone of colour and
 slight intensity of light, up to abont 150, here almost suddenly-be

certain length, which becomes heated to a temperature which can
be estimated in different ways. The deflection of the compass is
observed when it has become stationary.    The wire is then replaced
by a thinner one, of which the length is varied until the compass
gives the same deflection as before; the rest of the circuit remains
unchanged. The resistance of the stout and long and that of the
short and thin wire are evidently equal, and the quantities of heat
evolved in their interiors are the same.
   Operating thus with two platinum wires taken from the same
sample, one of them 0-62 millim. in diameter and 538.7 millims. in
length, and the other of 0-31 millim. diameter and 77.7 millims.
length, the same deflection was obtained. The ratio of the two ra
diation-surfaces is therefore
                                              2 × 53S-7

The radiation per unit of surface of the thin wire was therefore 14
times as much as that of the thick wire (neglecting the heat taken
away by contact of the air).
   On the other hand, the thick wire was raised to a temperature
much below red heat                        (it
                          did not char wood), while the thin wire

               ON ELECTROCHEMICAL          ACTIONS UNDER PRESSURE.
                                     BY A. BOUVET.
  In  a series of about fifty experiments, each lasting several hours,
and  during  which              I
                     have been able to produce with extreme facility
pressures of 100, 200, 300 atmospheres, &c.,         constantly recog    I
nized the existence of the two following laws:—
   (1) The decomposition of water by a current is independent of
the pressure;
   (2) The quantity of electricity necessary for decomposing one
and the same weight of water is sensibly the same, whatever may
be the pressure at which the decomposition is effected.
  I  have ascertained by experiment that the mechanical theory of
heat perfectly accounts for these two laws. Thus, by taking ad
vantage of the fact that gases produced in the midst of water are
obtained at a sensibly fixed temperature,                       I
                                                verified the formula
which represents the work expended for the compression of gases
without         change of       temperature:–

of but short duration, and varies in intensity throughout. On
the other hand the introduction of an electro-magnetic main
tenance (as in Helmholtz's vowel experiments) somewhat
complicates the apparatus.         For many purposes extreme
purity and constancy of pitch are not important; and thus an

may say that silences as investigated by the ear occur at
loops, and that the maximum sound is found at nodes; but in
Savart's papers the silences are identified with nodes.           More
over the               is not one of words merely; for Savart con
siders that (apart from the effects of obstacles) the silences
are to be found at distances from the wall which are even
multiples of the quarter wave-length. A large part of his
work is thus an endeavour to bring the facts into accordance
with a mistaken theoretical view.
   When the median plane is parallel to the wall, the obstruction
presented by the head displaces considerably the positions of
the silences.    In his first paper Savart proposes to add 27
mm. to the measured           distances between the external ear
nearer to the wall and the wall itself, in order to take account
of the interval between the external ear and the sentient ap
paratus.    In the case of the ear further from the wall a similar
distance is to be subtracted.               I
                                     am at a loss to understand how
the situation of the sentient apparatus can be supposed to be an
element in the question at all.        Every thing must surely de
pend upon whether there is or is not a variation of pressure at
the outer end of the ear-passage.          In the second paper Sa
vart takes (as it appears to me) a further step in the wrong
direction.    He states that the positions of the silences are the
same, whether they be observed with the ear nearer to the
wall, or with the ear further from                   it,
                                            and draws the conclusion
that the  part       of

be situated at the surface       of a sphere whose circumference
is moderate     in comparison with the wave-length, the phase
(which is the element on which the phenomena under con
sideration principally depend) at a distance is approximately
the same as if the source were moved outward from the surface
through a distance equal to half the radius, and the sphere
were removed altogether. By the theorem of reciprocity,
 § 294, it follows that in the case of reflection of plane waves
there is a silence at the point on the surface of the sphere
 nearest the wall when, not this point itself, but another fur
ther from the centre by half the radius, is distant from the
wall by an odd multiple of the quarter wave-length, provided
that the distance between the sphere and wall be not too small
a multiple of the radius. Instead therefore of adding with
 Savart 27 mm., or 77 mm., to the observed distances in the
expectation of so arriving at even multiples of the quarter
wave-length, we ought rather to subtract some such distance
as 50 mm. in the expectation of arriving at odd multiples of
the same quantity.

first paper  :-

      rom a theoretical point of view, it appeared to me highly
improbable that the silences for the two ears should occur in
the same position of the head, except perhaps in the case of a

                    Lord Rayleigh's Acoustical Observations.                                           153
particular wave-length equal to about three diameters; and
laboratory experiments with steadily maintained tones had
made me familiar with the phenomenon of sounds apparently
transferring themselves from one ear to the other when the
head is moved ; but                 I
                          thought it desirable to try a few experi
ments in the   open  air especially directed to the examination of
this point.
   The source of sound was a lamp-chimney and hydrogen
flame, as described above, of pitch e' flat, so that the quarter
wave-length was about eleven inches.          The apparatus was
placed at distances varying from about 18 to 50            in front                    É.
of a tolerably flat wall; and the observer, with one ear stopped,
investigated the positions of the silences, holding the middle
plane of his head parallel to the wall. Although the positions
of the silences were not very well defined, presumably in con
sequence of unequal amplitudes of the superposed vibrations,
the most inattentive observer could not fail to notice that
it was necessary to move the head considerably in order to
pass from a place where the sound was a minimum for one
ear to a place where it was a minimum for the other ear.   We
may therefore conclude that Savart's statement is not generally
true, and that the views which he has founded upon it have
no sufficient claim upon our acceptance.
   When the median plane of the head is perpendicular to the
wall, the silences are observed at distances which are odd                                        multi
ples of the quarter wave-length, agreeably with theory.

   The observations were made by moving the burner to and fro
in front of the board, until the positions were found in which the
flame was least disturbed by the sound; and it will be seen from
the results that these positions were very well defined.      The
distances between the board and the orifice of the burner was
then taken with a pair of dividers, and measured on a scale

when the wind first comes on, the vibrations in the two
halves are similar, as is evidenced by the greater loudness ;
but the opposition of phase is rapidly established, usually in a
fraction of a second of time. As a system with two degrees
of freedom, the compound pipe is capable of two distinct
modes of vibration, in one of which the vibrations of the
component pipes are in the same phase, and in the other in
opposite phases.          Why the action of the wind should maintain
the latter mode of vibration to the exclusion of the former
has not hitherto been explained ; but the fact remains that

   In the experiments that have tried, the pipes were blown
from a bellows provided with a special regulator, and the
pitches of the various notes were determined by counting the
beats for 20 seconds between them and a somewhat sharper
note on a harmonium.            Sometimes the blown ends of the
pipes were near together, and sometimes (in the case of open
pipes) the unblown ends ; but during the course of an experi
ment the positions of the pipes were not altered. In order
to prevent a pipe speaking,       I placed some cotton wool over the
wind-way, and sometimes inserted a stopper; so that the pitch
of the pipe as a resonator was entirely altered. The following
are the details of some of the observations:—
   I. Sept. 23. Open metal pipes about 2 feet long, one of
them provided with an adjustable paper slider for modifying
the pitch. Blown ends near one another; unblown ends distant.
              Beats per second with harmonium-note.

 So that the note given by both pipes together is decidedly
sharper than those of the separate pipes.
    II.  Sept. 23. Same pipes as in           I.    Unblown ends near
one another ; blown ends distant.

 the notes of the single pipes.

mutual influence was very small, being insufficient to prevent
the formation of slow and pretty steady beats of about four
seconds' period.  This experiment shows that the mutual                                      in

   The theory of the vibrations of uniform and uniformly
stretched flexible circular membranes, vibrating in vacuo, has
been known for many yearsf.           In practice deviations from
such theoretical results are to be expected, if only in con
sequence of the reaction of the air, which must operate with
considerable force on a vibrating body exposing so large a
surface in proportion to                     its        kettledrums,

160                Lord Rayleigh's Acoustical Observations.
are liable to be puzzled in attempting to analyze compound
sounds of such complication and irregularity.       The following
results, however, are believed to be trustworthy.
   The principal tone corresponds to mode (1); the tone cor
responding to (2) is about a fifth higher; that of mode (3)
is about a major seventh above the principal tone ; the tone of
mode (4) is a little higher again, forming an imperfect oc
tave with the principal tone.    For the corresponding modes
of a uniform membrane     vibrating  in vacuo, the theoretical                                              in
tervals are those represented  by  the ratios 1:34, 1-66, 1-83, or
about a fourth, a major sixth, and an interval nearly midway
between a major and a minor seventh, respectively.
     Inexperimenting on this subject it is important to bear in
mind that the system of tones is really double, and that                                                    its
components coincide only            the supposition

the form of the shell is nearly hemispherical. During the ex
            the pitch of the principal tone was about 120                                                       vi

wooden          him.  such as is used for harmonicons, the head
being covered with cotton-wool tied on with string.                For
the graver tones the thickness of the cotton wool may with
advantage be greater than for higher tones.
     Iam not in a position to decide the question as to the
function of the shell; but                           I
                                 think it at least doubtful whether
it introduces  any   really  advantageous   modification into the re
lations of the component tones.          It is possible that       ad                                     its
vantage lies rather       obstructing the flow that would other

    A  fine point of light was obtained from a fragment of a
silvered bead attached to the string with wax, and illuminated
                                            º
by a suitably placed candle, and was observed in the direction
of the length of the string through an extemporized telescope.
In this way there could be no mistake as to the actual plane
of vibration, or uncertainty as to the direction of the wind
over the string.         The path of the point of light was seen to
be nearly rectilinear and vertical,                   that the vibration
is across the wind. Sometimes the             path   was sensibly elliptic
with the    major    axis vertical.

    When a string is stretched across the slit at the bottom of a
slightly open window, there is usually some difficulty in de
termining the actual direction of the wind where it plays upon
the string.      On a still night, and with a regular                  the
sound is sometimes steady for a           long  time,  but it is wonder
fully sensitive to the slightest changes in the draught. On
one occasion it was found impossible to open a distant door so
slightly as not to stop the sound, which would revive in a few
seconds after the door was closed again.               A piece of paper
no   larger   than the hand thrown          upon   the fire (which was
burning without flame) altered the draught sufficiently to stop
the sound until the heated air due to its combustion had
passed up the chimney.           It is the irregularity, and not, as has
       asserted,  the insufficient intensity, of the wind which pre
                                                                           .

                               .
       describes a method of readily constructing very high
electrical resistances.

ends of the line are provided with the means of                      elec
trical connexion; ...] the whole is varnished: by this means a
resistance of two million ohms was obtained; and it was found
to be constant under varying potential. This method of con
structing resistances is                 to in Maxwell's ‘Electricity’
(p. 392); but      I  do not know that it has received the exami
nation it deserves, or that it has come into general use. Having
need of resistances of over 100 million ohms,             I have made a
few on Mr. Phillips's plan, ranging from 26,000 ohms to
96,000,000 ohms (which are fairly satisfactory), and one or two

much greater (which do not conduct according to Ohm's law,
but with a resistance diminishing as the electromotive force
increases).   A short description of these may perhaps save a
little trouble to others who desire tolerably constant high re
sistances.
   All my resistances are ruled on strips of patent plate glass
which has been finished with fine emery, but has not been
polished. The strips are twelve inches long, and, except in the
cases specified below, about half an inch wide. One or more
  arallel lines are ruled on each strip, terminating at either end
in a small area covered with graphite from the pencil. The
strip of glass, first heated over a spirit-lamp, is varnished with
shellac varnish, excepting only these small terminal areas,
which are surrounded by a small cup of paraffin-wax to con
tain mercury to make                à.
                                necessary connexions. To secure
better insulation, feet of paraffin or of glass covered with pa
raffin are attached on the underside at the ends of the strip
to support it from the table. Before varnishing, each strip was
marked with a distinguishing letter. The strips marked g, h, s, a,
           i.
and b were ruled with a BB pencil, the remainder with a HHH.
    These resistances appear to be not quite constant, but to
vary slightly with time, the maximum variation in four months
being              in excess of per cent. In every case they
were examined under varying potential to ascertain if they
obeyed Ohm's law.           With the exception of f, described
           to all
below,        were satisfactory       this respect.

 appears      diminish  slightly    the temperature
                                         as            rises; but this
conclusion rests          single

 regarded as uncertain.
    The values of the resistances were determined with            dif                  a
 ferential galvanometer, each coil having         resistance   a3500                  of
ohms,      bythe well-known method          dividing battery-cur

metric method; No. 2. The Electrometer Method; No. 3. The
Heat Method; No. 4. The Electrodynamometer Method.
                No. 1. The Galvanometric Method.
   With a galvanometer of small resistance and of large radius,
it is necessary to bring the deflection to the neighbourhood of
45° by means of a shunt of very small resistance.     The errors
increase when the deflections exceed 45° in a divided circuit;
and by the use of a shunt of small resistance, any error in the
measurement of this small resistance multiplies the whole ob
servation by this error.
   By the use of a cosine galvanometer which devised in                    I
1871, and published in the “American Journal of Science’
for that year, the use of shunts can be modified; but there are

difficulties, from the dip of the needle and from want of accu
racy in graduations of      circle which measures the deflection
of the moving coil from the vertical plane.
    In practice it is very inconvenient to find a suitable shunt
which will answer for a wide range of experiments, and diffe
rent shunts have to be used.                 the heating of the
shunt multiplies the observations by an error. In short, by
the use of a shunt method, we measure a large quantity by
observations upon a hundredth or a thousandth part of itself,
and proceed from a small quantity to a large one, which is a
fundamentally defective method.
                No. 2. The Electrometer Method.
   By means of a suitable electrometer, the difference of po
tential of two points in a closed circuit can be measured; and
from this the electromotive force in volts can be estimated.

   By the use of the law that the heat developed in a circuit
is expressed by H=C*Rt, where C is current in Webers, R=
resistance, t = time, we can deduce C by measuring the rise of
temperature of a given volume of water. Measurements of
temperature are especially fraught with difficulties on account
of conduction, radiation, and errors of thermometers, beside
consuming time in waiting for the proper conditions for a
given experiment.

   The principle of Weber's electrodynamometer is well known.
The electric current passes down one wire of the bifilar sus
pension of a movable coil and up the other, and then through
fixed coils surrounding the movable coil. Maxwell, in his

   The measurements with the Wilde machine were made with
an electrodynamometer similar to that described in Maxwell's
‘Electricity and Magnetism.’                   It was constructed on the
Helmholtz-Gaugain             principle, and had a resistance of 58.9
ohms.         A shunt of 1 ohm had to be employed; and the                      in
strument was also coupled in multiple arc to avoid the length
ening of the bifilar suspension.

    I   add a few data in regard to the dimensions of these ma

which were generously placed at my disposal.
    The Gramme Machine.—This machine weighs about 2700
pounds, stands 30" high. is 40” long and 34" wide. It is
driven by a pulley 15" in diameter.                      The armature moves
with very little friction. The field-of-force coils are flat; and

there are four of these, each about 10" long, 3}" deep, and
22" wide. The armature resistance is 0.129 ohm, the field
resistance 0:212 ohm, thus making .341 ohm for the total
                     'i.
internal resistance.        The total weight of wire in the machine
is 483    pounds;      or the weight of wire is nearly 18 per cent. of
the total weight of the machine.
     Siemens                 or Heffner-von-Altenek         Machine, built
by the Siemens Brothers.-This machine is 61" in length, 28"
 in breadth, and 12" in height. The armature is nearly 34”
 long and 94" external diameter. It is formed by winding 98
 pounds of two insulated wires longitudinally, and in eight                                        di

 hollow cylinder is a hollow stationary cylinder of cast iron,
 supported by bearings that pass through the brass cylinder.
 The commutator has eight                          which are eight sector
 shaped sheets of brass, insulated from but attached to the face
 of a plate which is outside of one of the bearings of the brass
 cylinder. Two collectors or brushes trail upon and press
 against these sectors: these brushes have a bearing so exten
 sive as to short-circuit or bridge over the edge of two sectors.
 The spark of the commutator is quite insignificant.              This ma
 chine differs from             othersall    this respect—the armature

rate of speed would have increased, to a certain extent, the cur
rents produced by the Siemens and the Gramme machines; on
the other hand, more horse-power would have been necessary
to attain this increased speed. The Wilde machine requires
more horse-power to run it as the resistance of the outside
circuit increases.     This is due to the construction of the ma
chine, and is not the case with the Siemens and the Gramme
machine. A certain proportion between the resistance of the
machine and that of the outside circuit is undoubtedly best
for greatest efficiency of dynamoelectric machines; and a cer
tain velocity is necessary to attain the greatest efficiency.

 Theoretically the Siemens machine should give the best
 results. At the time of my experiments the Siemens machine
 suffered the disadvantage of being run at a less rate of speed
 than the other machines.
     I hope to pursue these tests under conditions resulting from
 higher speed.      Generally speaking, that machine is the best
 which gives the greatest efficiency at low rates of speed ; for
 the necessity of high speed introduces much that is detrimental
 to the locality of the machine and to the machine itself. At
 the present time alternating machines are coming into notice
 again, in connexion with electric lighting; and a suitable elec
 trodynamometer is desirable in the measurement of the current
 produced by these machines.          The instrument which         I have
 tested above seems to fulfil the proper conditions.
     My thanks are due to the officers of the station for their
  generous assistance and free disposal of the resources of their
 electrical department.

    On account of the interest presented by the question whether
this property does not belong to gases in general, we resolved
to repeat the experiments once more with the most powerful
currents and, in              all
                         other respects, under the most favourable
conditions; and we have now succeeded                        verifying the          in

The outer tin-plate tube was enclosed                   six large coils -   in                              of

Bunsen cells could be sent.
   For the experiment some bisulphide          carbon was poured          of
into the iron tube, and the air expelled     the carbon-bisulphide    by
vapour already forming         the ordinary temperature.

As soon      the entire tube had acquired the temperature

other end extinguished the pencil. The current of the 64 ele
ments was now sent through the coils, when the field was
distinctly brightened. The brightening was still more consi
derable when, after the closing of the current, the front Nicol
was rotated to darkness and the current then reversed by a-
commutator.
   The rotation of the polarization-plane took place, as was to
be expected, in the direction in which the  -
                                               positive current
went   through  the coils.
   In order to find out whether the observed rotation might
not be entirely or in part produced by the glass plates that
closed the ends of the tube, the sulphide-of-carbon vapour was
expelled, and the empty tube again heated and observed.                  On
closing the current there was in fact shown a very slight rota
tion proceeding from the glass plates; but                    amount was      its
essentially less than when the experiment was made with sul

nearest         the plates) were put out

 so far from the glass plates that their influence upon the latter
could only          extremely slight.

   Postscript.—Since the publication of the foregoing experi
ments we have further improved the apparatus employed, by
giving to the iron tube (a a in the figure) a length of 2-4
metres.    The glass plates d d were now so far from the ends
of the six coils that, on closing a current from 70 large Bun
sen elements, they did not produce any perceptible rotation.
A repetition of the experiments with bisulphide-of-carbon
vapour gave now also an evident rotation of the plane of pola
rization.
                  we succeeded in observing the electromag

able to observe any rotation.         will not omit to remark
that, apart from employing very high pressures, another way
presents itself of making the observations for the investigation
of the rotation in air—with polarized sunlight, which with
the aid of heliotropes in the direction of the earth's magnetic
meridian is sent through a long stretch of the atmosphere.

THEformethods
       obtaining the formulae employed in determining the
 indices of a form in the rhombohedral system from the mea
 sured angles, or, conversely, the angles from the given indices,
 are, though elegant, difficult and perplexing.      It occurred to
 me that  they  might be easily obtained  by  means of the anhar
monic ratio of four poles in a zone applied to three known
poles in one of the planes of symmetry, and a fourth pole
whose position and indices can be directly connected with the
poles of the form to be determined. This method brings out
in a prominent manner the relation (2); a relation to be found
     be all
in     the books, but    disguised and
                           so                      so

rhombohedral crystal, together with
the poles P of a form {h k l; to be
determined. The poles rare {100},

are {2,11} and {011} respectively.
Let P be (hkl),             P, P,          the    corre
sponding faces repeated over O b                l,ar

P,  (khl). Let Q, R, ºr be the intersections of the pairs of
zones [PP, [Obj, [PP,) [Ob/l, [OP] [bb, respectively.
Then the indices of Q are (2h, k+l, k+l), of R (h+k, h4-k,
2l), and of T (2h—k—l, –h-H2k—l, —h—k+2l.)

    F.R.S.*
      R. FITZGERALD           appears to have overlooked the fact
         that my paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Society,
1874, “On the Surface Forces caused by Evaporation and
Condensation,” was published more than a year before Mr.
Crookes published any account of the radiometer; otherwise
he certainly would not have fallen into the error of supposing
      I
that had concluded that the motion of the arms of the radio
meter was mainly due to evaporation and condensation.            That
such actions cannot explain continuous motion is at once ob
vious. But then Mr. Fitzgerald fails to notice that on the first
page of my paper an experiment is described which proves this
very point; and he also fails to notice that         the phenomena          all
I  have considered      any way  in

                                                                 on

it—and that the force does not arise from the difference in
temperature in the two opposite plates, but from the difference
in temperature of the two surfaces of the same plate.
        It appears,           then, that such a separating force as that assumed
by Mr. Fitzgerald would not explain the phenomena in ques
tion, and therefore that these phenomena afford us no ground
for assuming the existence of such a force. Any reason there
may be for assuming such a force must therefore come out of
some hypothesis as to the constitution of gas ; and in this
respect the result of Mr. Fitzgerald's investigation is not very
conclusive.
    Adopting the hypothesis of Clausius, Mr. Fitzgerald's rea
                                                                                º

 soning leads him to the conclusion that there is no such separa
 ting force (see the bottom of page 22). Instead, however, of ac
 cepting the conclusion, Mr.                   concludes that Clausius
 is wrong :—“It seems certain that the hypothetical distribution
 Clausius assumed is not at           adequate      so to all

heat communicated, the inequality would depend on the diver
gence of the lines of flow—although my explanation, so far as
it went, was quite consistent with such a necessity.
   The importance of this divergence became clearer to me in
November 1877; and                        I
                           had no sooner recognized it than                                     I
perceived a general connexion between the phenomena in
question and other phenomena of gases, particularly that of
transpiration, or diffusion through porous plugs.     I did not
then publish any account of the theoretical investigation, be
cause the theory indicated the existence of other phenomena
beyond those already known, and                          I
                                      wished to verify these                                   in
dications of the theory  by experiment.
   These experiments have occupied considerable time; but
they are now completed, and their result is (1) to verify the
theoretical revelations as to the existence of a class of very
marked and important phenomena which were, so far as                                            I
know, previously unsuspected, (2) to establish certain general

and those of the radiometer,         (3) to afford an absolute

    It might conceivably appear that direct audition could only
occur under conditions of a special character, and therefore
extremely rarely, since the hearer is almost always surrounded
by reflecting surfaces, amongst which, of course, the earth
must be reckoned.
    Figure 1 exhibits the aspect of the human head from above,
fi  and f, being the surfaces of the pinnae. They make with
one another an angle 23.        Hence it is easily perceived that
according to the position which the source of sound occupies
in the horizon of the hearer, the following cases may be dis
tinguished with respect to binaural audition.
    1. The source of sound may be situated within the angle
Dºn C. The hearer then hears directly with both ears; and ac
cordingly, there exists a direct binaural audition extending
through the angle DnC, which is equal to 23.
    2. The source of sound may be situated within one of the
angles An D and Bn C. The hearer then hears directly with
one ear only, whilst the other ear hears only indirectly in almost
every case, on account of a scattering of the sound, analogous
to the scattering of rays of light. In consequence a mixed binau
                                          i.
ral audition occurs, and extends, irrespective of the region in
which both ears hear directly, through        angle (An D + Bn C),
which is equal to (360–43).
    3. The source of sound may be situated within the angle
An B. The hearer in that case evidently hears only indi
rectly with both ears; accordingly indirect binaural audition
occurs, and extends through the angle An B, which is equal to
    The 360 degrees of the entire circle within which the source
of sound   is situated are therefore  disposed as  follows:—
       28 degrees in a region of direct binaural audition;
                                    mixed
    360–43

giving the necessary sum of 360 degrees.
    The angle 3 differs naturally in different individuals, and
 has been diminished particularly in the female sex by the
effect of the head-dresses worn for a long period.         That this
 operates prejudicially on the hearing, at least in so far as it
diminishes the extent of the direct binaural audition, may be
 inferred from what has already been said. It will be in the
                             º
sequel more narrowly examined.          It is self-evident that the
range both of the direct and of the indirect monaural audition
extends to 180 degrees.
    If the front part of the head is to offer to the sound-rays on
their   way  to the ears no            of such a nature as to    di

minish their quantity, it will be necessary that the pinnae of
the ears should form tangent planes to the sides of the head.
This is in reality approximately the case.
   Further, to fulfil the condition that no sound coming from
the front shall be heard indirectly only, it is necessary that the
surfaces of the pinnae of the ears should not, when produced,
intersect in front of the apex of the nose, n (figure 1); for
in that case no sound-ray proceeding from the space included
between the produced surfaces and the face could enter either
ear directly.
   Every portion of the pinnae which reflects into the auditory
meatus a sound-ray that falls upon it may be called, with re
spect to the direction of this sound-ray, an effective element of
the pinna. The sum of                           all
                                       the effective elements for sound
rays   in any given direction constitutes, for that direction, the
effective surface        the pinna.

this fact, the following reasons might               assigned :—     be
   First, the law         symmetry. This reason, however,
                          of                                            open                           is

          of                       of a

metry.
     Secondly.       The beneficial provision                        of   nature which endows

                               of Binaural Audition.                                     185
man with organs in reserve.         This ground is also not un
assailable, since indeed it is nature which permits mankind to be
overtaken by disease which, on account of the close connexion
between the double organ, almost invariably attacks both or
gans. So, usually, blindness attacks both eyes, deafness both
ears, excepting always the comparatively few cases in which
the imprudence of men, or accident, has destroyed one of the
two similar organs.
    Thirdly. A certain faculty, perhaps, which man acquires
from the possession of two ears, and therefore by hearing with
two ears. We arrive at the conjecture that this may be the case
by bringing into comparison two analogous facts in acoustics
and optics:—that, in many cases at least, the place in which
the source of sound is situated may be tolerably correctly
judged of from the sensation of the sound ; and that man ac
 quires a special faculty by the possession of two eyes, which,
 as is known, affords him a perception of distance.
    Now it will be shown in the sequel, that the power which
 man acquires in certain cases by hearing with two ears, con
 sists in the faculty of discriminating the direction in which the
 source of sound is situated.
    On the other hand, the distance of the source of sound can
 only be estimated approximately from the relative intensity of
 the sensation of sound, if the source of sound be known ; for
 then the distance at which the source of sound is situated can
 be empirically determined from the difference between the
 perceived intensity and the known absolute intensity, or that
 which the source of sound would have in the immediate
 neighbourhood.      In this manner, the distance of an enemy is
 inferred in warfare from the intensity of the cannonading,
 or the distance of a carriage from the loudness of           rum                 its
 bling.

source, as in the preceding examples of the wagon, the chain,
&c., will therefore be looked out for by the eyes alone only so
long as the power of drawing a judgment as to the direction
is lacking to the ear. From the impressions which the sound
coming in a direction now known makes upon the ears, the ears
learn at last to recognize the direction in which the source of
sound is situated, without needing the further assistance of
the eyes. Thus every one always looks for the source of sound
straight in front in the line of sight whenever the impressions
on both ears possess equal intensity.      A coincident result
may be deduced from equation (2), in which if = i, we have                           i

    5. In the theory of Binaural Audition developed in the pre
       i.
ceding paragraphs, it has been tacitly assumed throughout
that        source of sound should be situated in that plane (usu
ally horizontal) in which the line of sight and the line joining
the middle points of the two pinnae are situated.        This is not,
however, always the case; for while the line of sight may be
horizontal, the source of sound may be situated above or below
the imaginary horizontal plane,           Hence it is necessary to
enlarge the theory of binaural audition in this respect.           In
figure 6, which is drawn in so-called parallel perspective, let
                                                f,
A A' be the horizontal line of sight; then or a d g c, and         fi
or a de b are the effective surfaces of the pinnae, each enclo
sing the angle B between it and the line of sight. Let the
plane d k be a prolongation of one of these planes,     f.    Lastly,
let a M be the direction of    any  ray of sound (the position being
a  general    one) whose   projections  are M” a   upon the vertical
plane d k, and M'a upon the horizontal plane a q. Then to
                        .
reckon the rays of sound (assumed parallel to one another)
which meet the surfaces fi and f, in the given direction de
fined now by the angle y vertically, and by the angle a hori
zontally, we must            as measures of the number of those
rays the cross sections which can be led orthogonally through
the two quadrangular prisms which have respectively for their
bases the surfaces fi and    f,  and whose long edges are parallel
to the direction of the rays of sound a M.
    These cross sections, which may be drawn upon one common
Fºe
         perpendicular to the direction of the rays of sound, may
     regarded    as the projections of the surfaces fi and f, upon
that plane.      And since the area of the projection of a plane
figure is equal to the product of the area of that figure into
the cosine of the angle included between the plane of the figure
and the plane of projection, we shall be able to find the areas
of the cross sections, provided we first know the angles wi and
w; which the direction of the rays of sound makes with the
surfaces fi and f, respectively. Now the plane taken normally
to the direction of the rays of sound is the plane in which the

this angle becomes the better will the hearing be, since in the

or by what we know from practical experience, that in the case
of hearing a sound coming from above or below, we are able to
estimate, from the relative intensities with which the sound is
perceived in the two ears, the azimuth of the rays of sound as
                                                         -
projected upon the plane of best hearing.
   This explains the method which we pursue to discover the
position of a source of sound whose situation is unknown, and
which consists in a motion of the head.
   For example, to find a source of sound situated anywhere
above, we have only to turn the head about a vertical axis until
F.
we hear equally with both ears and with the greatest total                                          in
tensity. Then the line of sight coincides         the horizontal    .#
            of the direction of the sound. The head must then
    turned  upwards   about a horizontal axis at right angles to
the line of  sight, as long as the intensity of the sensation
increases.
    When this reaches              its
                               maximum, and         equally great for
                                                                    is
both ears, then the source                    of
                                     sound must        situated     the  be                  in
line  of sight.
    And here we must remark             the essential importance
                                                    on                                               of
the actual conditions—that the ears and eyes, being alike at
tached     tothe head, share                  its
                                     movements, and that they are
situated      almost the same height above the ground.

   The third column contains the numbers which ought to be
 constant if the theory were accurate.              The fourth column con
tains numbers                       on the    hypothesis   that the conducti
vity varies inversely as the absolute temperature increased by
 some constant, say by 126.               These numbers agree with one
another rather better than those in the preceding column;
but still there is a regular divergence perceptible between the
hypothesis and the experimental results, especially at high
temperatures.
    The results at the higher temperatures, however, do not
 seem to have been regarded by Principal Forbes as equally
 dependable; for he gives an empirical formula for the con
 ductivity at any Centigrade temperature t which does not
 agree very closely with the experimental results at high tem
 peratures, saying,       “I  have assumed that the most trustworthy
 part of the observational curves are those between the actual
 temperatures of 40° and 160°, and that within moderate limits

experimental investigations of Mr. Crookes; for if the en
closure containing the cooling body be gradually exhausted
of air, so that a progressively diminishes, a discontinuity,
in the direction of a sudden increase in the rate of cooling,
would probably arise at the instant when the average free
path of the molecules was long enough to reach from the
surface of the cooling body to that of the enclosure.   And it
is probable that for exhaustions higher than this the law of
 cooling is different, and in                       all

 served to decrease regularly, though slowly, and in a manner
 which has an obvious relation to the corresponding number in

Scientific Memoirs ; being experimental Contributions to a Knowledge
    of Radiant Energy. By John WILLIAM DRAPER, M.D., LL.D.,
    &c. &c. New York: Harper and Brothers. 1878 (8vo, pp. 473).
          DRAPER here brings together the scattered memoirs and
DR.      essays that he has written during the past forty years on
subjects connected with Radiation and Radiant Energy. They are
thirty in number, and for the most part are simply reprints; but
in a few cases the original memoirs are condensed, and in one or
two cases the article here given is the substance of a considerable
number of detached articles.          Most of them have already appeared
 in our pages; the earliest of them, on subjects relating to Photo
graphy, appeared in 1840.                      “I
                                       have endeavoured,” the author tells
us, “to reproduce these memoirs as they were originally published.
When considerations of conciseness have obliged me to be con
tented with an abstract, it has always been so stated, and the place
where the original may be found has been given. Sometimes, the
circumstances seeming to call for                          it,
                                             additional matter has been                                 in

 title     Notes,         or         parentheses” (p. x).

the same enclosure.

    Now it may be said with very little qualification that what is here
attributed to M. Kirchhoff is to be found distinctly stated in the first
memoir in the volume before us, which was published by Dr. Draper
in 1847. By experimenting with a strip of platinum heated by the
transmission of a current whose force could be regulated, he ascer
tained that the temperature at which red rays are first radiated is
 977°Fahr.       He also ascertained that platinum, brass, antimony,
 gas-carbon, and lead became incandescent at the same time with
 the iron barrel in which they were gradually heated, and that the
 apparent exceptions presented by chalk, marble, and fluor-spar
 were due to phosphorescence.          By raising the temperature of the
 platinum wire and analyzing with a prism the light emitted, he
 proved that the length of                         its
                                    spectrum gradually increased with the
 temperature until         2130° Fahr. the full spectrum                daylight

Natural History.              After his settling in Australia he followed his
bent in Geology,  and got an insight into the general structure of
the eastern mountain-ranges  and of the strata flanking them on the
east; and he was one of the first to recognize the gold-drifts and
auriferous rocks.    The relative position and age of the Coal
measures    there he also studied; and he philosophically concluded
that certain plant-remains in the Australian coal did not neces
sarily give it a Jurassic age, or remove it from the Palaeozoic series,
because they resembled, or even were identical with, a fossil plant
found in the Oolites of Yorkshire. The persistence of many low
organisms, the wide extent and long-continued emigration of suc
cessions of similar creatures, as well as other considerations, strongly
supported the veteran observer in his discussions with those who
would draw equally definite demarcations for the extinct faunae and
florae of Britain and for those of                    its
                                        antipodes. Of this and many

scribed  in which corresponding structure, sometimes coupled with
a similar mineral constitution, may be met with.            Difficulties
attending the determination of the origin of some clastic rocks were
also pointed out, and the value of certain structural characters in
their diagnosis were mentioned.        Assumptions as to the origin of
some  fragmentary   rocks were shown to be undemonstrable in certain
cases, although such assumptions        often carried much probability
with them. The resemblances presented by devitrified rhyolitic
rocks, felstones, and felspathic grits were dwelt upon at some length.
The paper included a short structural classification of the con
stituents of rocks.
  2. “Distribution of the Serpentine and associated Rocks, with
their Metallic Ores, in Newfoundland.” By Alexander Murray, Esq.,
C.M.G., F.G.S.
   The author stated that no extensive display of serpentine is
known in the Laurentian series in Newfoundland; nor is the existence
of crystalline limestone of that age, with which serpentine is often
associated, as yet well established.      The Intermediate or Huronian
system is singularly barren in lime, magnesian minerals, and mica,
lime occurring almost exclusively as intersecting calcareous veins.

of n and C, show that the method adopted in my former paper on
Magnetic Reflection, in the ‘Proceedings of the Royal Society’ for
1876, No. 176, is justified, and that it is legitimate to consider an
incident plane-polarized ray as composed of two oppositely circu
larly polarized rays, each of which is reflected according to its own
laws. From these                      I

ON THE WELOCITY OF VERY LOUD SOUNDS.    BY WILLIAM W.
  JACQUES, FELLOW of THE JOHNs HoPKINS UNIVERSITY.
  It is very well known that the velocity of a musical sound                                                         is,
within very wide limits, sensibly independent           intensity                         of    its
and   of    its

  A    consideration       the theory
                                of         the propagationof          musical                  of   a
sound, too, shows that for sounds such               we ordinarily hear,   as                                        in

   When, however, we come                           to

considerable error that has been introduced into the most impor
tant measurement of this quantity.
   The experiments were made at the United-States Arsenal in
Watertown, Mass.
   The method used was an automatic measurement of the velocity
at different distances (varying from 10 to 110 feet) from the mouth
of the cannon, by means of a series of membranes” electrically
connected with a chronograph.
   In the midst of a large level field was placed a six-pound brass
field-piece.    In the rear of this, at distances of 10, 30, 50, 70, 90,
and 110 feet from the mouth of the cannon, were placed the mem
branes, elevated about 3 feet above the ground.           These membranes
consisted each of a hoop 9 inches in diameter, over which was
stretched a sheet of thin rubber. To the centre of the membrane,
and on the side towards the cannon, was attached a very small
shelf of polished brass. Upon this rested one end of a delicate
steel spring, the other end being fixed to an independent support.
   The wire that brought the current of electricity from the chro
nograph-house was connected with the spring; and from the shelf
a second wire returned to the chronograph.               When the spring
rested upon the shelf the circuit was closed; the passage of the
sound-wave, however, would move the membrane, and break the
circuit, causing a register on the chronograph. When the spring
fell it rested upon a contact-point, from which a wire ran to the
next membrane of the series; so that the circuit, immediately after
being broken at the first membrane, was made again through the

and the temperatures read off from thermometers placed at each
membrane.
   The experiment was many times repeated with the membranes
interchanged, with different velocities and parts of the chronograph
cylinder, and with other precautions, to prevent possible errors,
but always with the same result.       It was found that immediately
in the rear of the cannon the velocity of sound was less than at a
distance, but that going further and further from the cannon the
velocity of sound rose to a maximum considerably above the ordinary
velocity, and then fell gradually to about the velocity usually received.
    In order to determine whether the first low velocities were due,
as was supposed, to the retarding influence of the bodily motion of
the air around the cannon, it was pointed at right angles to its
first position, when it was found that the maximum velocity came
nearer to the cannon.      Had the cannon been turned in the direc
tion of the line of membranes, the retardation would probably have
become an acceleration.     The experiment was, however, of course
impracticable.    That this apparent retardation was not due to the
difference in time of action of the membranes (due to a variation
of the force of the wave) is evident both from the very slight force
required in either case, and from the fact that the variation noticed
is in the wrong direction.
   The charge of powder was considerably varied; and the heaviest
charges, of course, caused the greatest deviation from the ordinary
velocity.
  The successive series of experiments, owing to differences in the
charge and in the loading, gave different values of the velocity at
any one place; but the facts above stated always remained the
same.
        Accordingly
                 each series represents the condition of things better

of the best series.

cannon, the second the values of the corresponding velocities in
the rear of the cannon when the charge was one and a half pounds,
the third when the charge was reduced to half a pound, and the

pole of the magnet of a Weber's magnetometer was submitted to
the simultaneous action of the south pole (surrounded by the coil)
of a telephone A and the south pole of a magnet; these two
instruments were placed so that the bar of the magnetometer was
in equilibrium between them.               A second telephone, B, was in
communication with A.             The movements of the mirror of the
magnetometer were observed by the ordinary method of reflection
of the divisions of a rule in the field of a telescope.
   A pressure exerted upon the plate of B permitted a slight dis
placement of the magnet to be ascertained; but the movement was
too small to be measured; its direction was always that which the
theory caused to be foreseen.
   Vibrations of the Plate.—Some attempts were made to determine
the vibrations of the plate.          The first method employed consisted
in  transmitting     the vibrations to a gas-flame.          For this purpose
the wide-mouthed bell of the        telephone    was  replaced by a cylindrical
one of small     capacity.     A   cork,   pierced   with two holes through
which    passed  two kneed tubes of       glass, bounded within the cylinder
a sort of little chamber       comprised      between the front face of the
vibrating plate and the hind face of the cork.               The illuminating
gas entered through the first tube, and issued, forming a small
flame, at the extremity of the tapering second tube; so that the
whole constituted something analogous to the manometric capsules
which M. König places upon the pipes.
   Every vibration of the plate is betrayed by a movement of the
flame when the induced currents employed are those produced by
a small Dubois-Reymond           coil, even when the exterior coil is at 2
centims. from the       extremity    of the inducing coil.       The currents
produced by the voice in a second telephone cause no variation in
the height of the flame.
   The result was equally negative when a small mirror was borne
on a kneed lever with its end resting on the vibrating plate.                  A
ray of light reflected by the mirror did not appear to be displaced
under the influence of the vibrations produced by the voice.
   Finally,    Itried to produce coloured rings between the vibrating
plate and a lens placed upon               For this verythin piece
                                           it.                 a            glass      of
 (Deckglaschen) was placed upon the vibrating plate,                     contact  in
with the slightly convex lower face                   of
                                                    lens.  aThe sounds were
transmitted        by
                    the instrument, although weakened. The coloured
rings were observed through             telescope furnished with
                                           a                           reticule.  a

have    very different temperatures do not work well, I desired to
put the matter to the test by direct experiment.                One of the   in
struments was left during several hours exposed to a temperature
of –18°, while the other passed the same time in an enclosure
heated to 40°C.        The two instruments, put in communication,
transmitted    speech  perfectly.
    As soon as the telephone was employed on the telegraph-lines,
the action was remarked which is exerted upon the instrument by
the currents used to work the Morse apparatus, and passing in
wires near that which connects the two telephones.                  This action
is attributable to an induction-phenomenon,                to a deflection, or
perhaps to both causes combined.               I  have tried directlv at what
distance an intermittent current can produce an induced current
appreciable with the telephone.
    Two copper wires, perfectly insulated, were stretched parallel
over a length of 15.2 metres, and at distances varying between 15,
35, and 45 centimetres.        One of the wires ioined the pile and the
manipulator with the receiver of a Morse apparatus: the earth-line
was formed by the gas-pipes.            The two extremities of the other
wire communicated directly with the telephone.                     The current
employed produced a deflection of 60° on a telegraph-compass.
Under these conditions all the motions of the manipulator were
                               I
 distinctly perceived; and am persuaded that a telegraphist would
have understood the signs produced by the manipulator, even when
the distance between the two wires was 45 centimetres.
     It may hence be concluded, therefore, that on telegraph-lines
 the noise heard in the telephone when a message traverses a neigh
 bouring wire may be attributed, at least in part, to induced currents.
 This experiment may have a certain interest in the lecture-room,
 to show at what distance an induced current can be produced. In
 this respect the telephone is much more sensitive than the galva
 nometer.—Bibliothèque Universelle. Archives des Sciences Physiques

         In
        the  preceding     portion   we have stated that the ether must
 possess enormous elasticity and very little density.                  This                                    is

 228                 Mr. E. H. Cook on the Eristence of
 a different view : thus Sir John Herschel says, “though we
 suppose the ethereal molecules to possess inertia, we cannot
 suppose them affected by the force of gravitation.”    this be                                   If
 the case, this hypothetical medium has no analogue in nature;
                                                                      º,
 it is a substance of which we can form no notion, as it is im
 possible to conceive a body possessing moving force but no
 weight.    Are we not inventing too much when we endow a
 hypothetical substance with impossible properties? It is curious
 to observe how the same philosopher, in                arguments
 against the corpuscular theory, says, “This is one of the many
 weak points of the theory. It runs counter to the only ana
 logy which the observation of nature furnishes” ". Yet eight
 pages further on he endows the ether with a property which
 causes it to be like no other substance in nature I Again, if
                          .
 the ether has no density, it is not necessary for us to assume it
 to possess a high elasticity; for any value given to the elasti

 fact, the equation has no meaning if r, e, or d=0. We have
 thus arrrived at these conclusions:—first, if we suppose the
 ether possesses          we ought to find an increase in re
 fracting power near large masses; and, secondly, if we suppose
 the ether to be unaffected by gravitation, then it is a body
 which bears no resemblance to any other body we know                                                    of.

        Another experiment which seems difficult of explanation is
      that it is impossible to cause the electric discharge to occur in
      a perfect vacuum.     Ether is present in this case also; yet this
      ether is unable to transmit the electricity.                Whatever this
      electricity may be, it is certainly something which is much
      like light and heat, it is therefore probably molecular motion
      of some kind.                    If
                                molecular motion, our ether ought to be
      able to transmit it; as it does not do so we are left to choose
      between two alternatives—either to say electricity is not due
      to molecular motion, or that no substance of the nature of
      ether is present.        Evidence seems to be accumulating to show
      that electricity is due to molecular motion; and we must there
      fore conclude that no ether is present.

   Probably a more exhaustive survey will reveal other and
greater difficulties; but these will be sufficient to show that the
acceptance of the theory is beset with difficulties and makes
such great calls upon our imaginations that it behoves the
least sceptical                  to “pause and consider.”

assume the existence of an all-pervading ether? The particles
of ordinary matter are small enough, and can, nay do, vibrate

to transmit the waves of light? Substituting for the lumini

indirect manner.                    For instance, the greater the atomic weight
of the substance the greater ought to be the refractive power
or the less the velocity in the body.     Unfortunately, how
ever, this rule cannot be generally applied, because of other
conditions which prevent the free motion of the molecule.
But we know that in the gaseous condition the molecules are
less hampered than in the liquid and solid states; the refrac
tive indices of gases ought therefore to exhibit some increase
with the density. The following are the indices of refraction
and densities of the five simple gases:—

                 feel sure that, if continuous for an indefinite
period, a pressure far less than this would be sufficient to pro
duce an indefinite change of form), but because, from the
nature of the case, any such slow and gradual yielding could
not be detected, both on account of the warmth of the testing
room and the small range of motion allowed by the machine,
while the pressure at which the ice began to yield by the con
tinuous formation of small cracks could be comparatively
easily determined with sufficient approach to accuracy.

so that    it would require
                          a pressure of over 9 miles of ice to
force a  glacier en masse through and out of the Lake of
Geneva.   Compare   this with the observed modulus, and further
comment is superfluous.
   Having thus proved that, in the case of the Lake of Geneva,
the theory of glacial erosion is inadmissible, it may be well to
show what is the very largest lake-basin that could possibly
be scooped out by a glacier.    To this end     both and 3=5°,                   let

IN      an investigation published in this Journalf      expressed                   I
       the opinion that by the electric spark, independently of
 the temperature of a mixture of gases, certain particles are
.rendered luminous, and that the luminosity is not a direct
 consequence of a great rise of temperature, like the brightness
 of incandescent solids, for instance, or that of sodium vapour
 in a gas-flame.              I
                       have, on that account, compared the phe
 nomenon in    question   to the phenomena of fluorescence.
     New experiments have confirmed this view, and yielded the
 result, that a gas may become luminous, on electricity passing
  through        it,

   The inductorium was excited by two Bunsen elements.          The
calorimetric determinations were carried out in the       following
manner:—First, for 5–10 minutes before the experiment the
course of the thermometer was observed ; then, exactly at the
                                                                                                         j
minute, the primary circuit of the inductorium was closed.
When with the play of the interruptor a sufficient augmentation
of the temperature of the calorimeter had taken place, the cur
rent-circuit was again opened, at a moment which was read off,
and the course of the thermometer followed again durin
5–10 minutes.       From the rise of temperature which
taken place, corrected in the well-known manner, and from
                                  #.
the number of the discharges, counted on the strip of paper
of the marker, the quantity of heat generated at each single
discharge in the capillary tube could be calculated. From
this, and from the                 of the capillary tube, the tem
perature of the gas can be approximately ascertained, pro
vided that            its
                 specific heat does not alter much with the tem
perature.

for separate investigations. Meanwhile so much is even now
evident, that the different spectra in the parts of different

different temperatures of the gases, but depend essentially
upon the amounts of electricity the passage of which condi

   28. To obtain experimental results suitable for applying
equation (25), one would have to observe temperatures very
accurately, over a considerable range of temperature, on a rod
in vacuo with a highly radiating surface.    Principal Forbes's
experiments were      made  allair; and,      shows, convection
                                                in                 as   he

   A simple modification of their method of           tempe

                   Suggestions      for future Experiment.
     29.   In any experiments which may  be conducted in vacuo
there will probably be some difficulty with the radiating sur
face of the rods, which should be the same for all.     Silvering
has only one objection; but that is fatal—viz. that it diminishes
the radiation-constant so much that the heat flows down the
rod almost as if it were a slab; moreover the convection effect
of    residual   air cannot be neglected in comparison with the radi
ation with so great impunity as if the surface were lampblacked.
A coating of Brunswick black would probably be perpetu
ally spoiling the vacuum.     A close layer of thin paper
Forbes) seems a very good method, or perhaps a close
                                                                                     {.
spiral of very thin cotton thread wound over the rod; but it
cannot be said that the law of cooling in such cases is so well
known as it is for a metallic or blackened surface.     Probably
a coating of stove-blacklead would be the best.
   Any such covering would, of course, necessitate fixed ther
moelectric joints, say very fine wires passed into or through
the rod at certain accurately measured and equal intervals.
The electromotive force generated at each joint would be mea
sured directly by a compensation arrangement—the arbitrary
readings so obtained being reduced to Centigrade tempera
tures afterwards, either by direct experimental comparison, or
by calculation from the following formula,

   The rays reflected at the wall W will therefore reach both
ears so long as this is the case with the direct rays.
   We have then obtained the following measures for reckon
ing the rays of sound which reach the left and right pinnae-
respectively :—
      (1) for direct rays, the expressions
                   f'sin (a+3) and f'sin (3–2);
      (2) for indirect rays reflected at the wall W,
             fsin [2%—a +3] and f'sin [–24 + 2 +3].
Consequently we have, as a measure for the total number of
rays of sound which reach the left and right pinnae respectively,
the expressions

reflea-ion, provided we neglect the possible conduction of sound
 through solid bodies.
    Whether that operation puts us in a position to form a
judgment concerning the direction in which the source of
 sound is situated, will be seen from what follows.
    Let A A' in figure 9 be the line of sight,  and    the effec                 fi            f,
 tive surfaces of the pinnae for rays of sound turned by                                                       re
flexion at the surface W from the direction S into the direction
s, a the angle which the rays of sound make with the line                                                      of
sight before reflexion, and 2, the angle they make after                                                       re
flexion.   Then it is readily seen that, since neither of the sur
faces of the pinnae can be directly reached by the rays S, the
hearer will receive an impression identical with that which he
would receive if the source of sound were situated in front to
the left in the direction of the reflected rays s.    Now it fol
lows from figure 9 that
                              $= a, +y                 and        a   = b +y,

to this point.
    The cause of this, however, lies in the particular circum
stances which unconsciously influence the estimate of the di
rection. The most important of these circumstances are:—
    (1) Trains of thought suggesting a certain direction as
being that in which a source of sound is constantly situated.
    To give one single example:—Suppose while walking along
 a road a person hears himself called by name, he will most
 naturally conjecture that the person calling is behind him; and
 conjectures thus, not only for the reason that he does not see
 the speaker in front of him, but also specially because the very
 purpose of so calling is usually to bring to a standstill the
 person called, so that he may be more easily overtaken.
     (2) A certain indistinctness which generally characterizes
                                                                                              .
 the indirect perceptions of sound. This arises from the cir
 cumstance that the indirect sensations of sound are nothin
 less than a whole series of echoes following one another,
  more or less running into one another, producing a lengthen
 ing-out of every single element of sound, so that the last
  echoes of one element of a sound may coincide with the first
  echoes of the element immediately following                             it.
     Thus, for example,           hearing sounds which come from
                                   in

   From what has been said, it might readily be imagined that
a direct perception of sound can be discriminated from an in
direct one more readily in the cases where the sound produced
by the sonorous body is a familiar one.
   Thus, for example, by the action of an echo, the familiar

racters are somewhat different. We find by experience that
the single ear does not sum up the impressions received from
the two sources, but that the conceptions evoked by the im
pressions received in the ears from the one source of sound are
separate from those evoked by the corresponding impressions
received from the other source of sound, so that the presence
of two separate sources of sound is known right well.
    This severing of the separate perceptions of sound becomes,
however, more difficult the more nearly the sources of sound
resemble one another.
    But that the ear is accustomed to such an analysis of the
 sensations, and that                by

flexion alone.     Then following the assumptions previously
made, on summing up the indirect and direct effects, we ob
tain from equation (3),
                      tan a =  * +pi–p, tan  &;
                               *1 + pi-H pa
and hence by calculation we can find the angle within the
region of direct binaural hearing in which the source of sound
is erroneously imagined to lie.
    The angle a becomes equal to the angle & when p1 and ps
become simultaneously zero, or indeed when ps-0, which
may be stated as follows:—If a source of sound be situated in
the region of mired binaural hearing, we seek it always in front
of us, and in the direction of a line drawn through the surface
of the pinna on which the direct rays do not fall, provided
either that the indirect rays are of null intensity, or that they
reach the other pinna only.
    Again, if the indirect effects were known as such, and were
separated from the direct effects, as occurs already in the theory
of indirect binaural audition, a means of making an exact
estimate of the direction of a source of sound would still be
wanting ; but still it is possible by experience to perceive that
the source of sound is situated in one of the two regions of mired
 hearing, from the circumstance that only one ear is reached by
 direct rays, and the other is reached by none but indirect rays.
    It is situated, therefore, in the region of mixed hearing,
 respectively on the left and right sides, when direct rays enter
 only the left ear or only the right ear, and when none but in
 direct rays enter the left ear or the right ear respectively.
    Moreover, in the case of mixed binaural hearing, it is pos
sible to determine the region only, but not the direction, in
 which the source of sound is situated.

    The whole 360° of the region of binaural hearing divides
 itself into three portions:—in front, the region of direct hear
 ing ; at the two sides, the regions of mixed hearing; and at the
 back, the region of indirect hearing.
    Under favourable circumstances, and without moving the
 head, we are, in consequence of our binaural hearing, able to
 decide from the sensations of sound in which region of hearing
 the source of sound is situated.

intensity with which a sound is perceived for the various
positions of the head.
   The circumstances adduced in the first three points may be
regarded as the advantages, those in the last three as the dis
advantages entailed by relatively increasing the value of the
angle 3.
   #. In conclusion let us finally draw attention to the fact
that estimates of direction may be made in many cases in
which, according to the preceding theory, the faculty of so
 doing is strictly wanting to the organs of hearing. Without
entering further upon the circumstances involved by this ap
parent difficulty, be it simply remarked that often the most
inconsiderable and apparently unimportant things are accus
tomed to suggest a particular position as that of the spot in
which the source of sound is situated, so that then this power
 of finding the direction is falsely ascribed to the ear.
   Just in this manner, as estimations of depth or distance
can theoretically be made by one eye in a very defective wa
only, and yet are again and again easily made owing to mani
fold circumstances which stand in no             connexion what    #.
ever with the faculty of adjustment of the eye, so also estima
tions of direction of sounds are made by the aid of other cir
cumstances without recourse to the particular faculties of the
ear.
  Moreover, the more excitable the imagination of man                                              is,

are the values of the current proportional to the tangent of
the deflection. With a single coi<U+017F> this is not the case. By
increasing the number of coils and suitably placing them, the
magnetic field may be rendered more uniform.
   In reading the deflection, either a divided circle or a tele
scope and scale are used.   With the divided circle the deflec
tion may be as great as 45", but not more, or else the instru
ment would not be sensitive to changes in the current. The
use of telescope and scale necessitates much smaller deflec
tions. To regulate the strength of the current, shunts of small
resistance often have to be used, and render the proportion of
the current through the instrument doubtful.

THEelectricity
      fact that metals had a different
               was discovered by Sir                     Humphry Davy in
1821 t, although the idea of resistance as a property of a con
ductor was not introduced until the publication of Ohm's law in
1827, in which a resistance was first regarded as a magnitude.
Now a magnitude necessarily implies a unit of measurement;
but the earlier writers merely contented themselves with re
ducing by calculation the resistance of                   parts        hetero all               of      a
geneous circuit into          given length
                                       a            some given part of     that                              of
circuit;      so
               that  they   generally    spoke                          of
                                                      the resistance “as the
reduced length               of
                         the conductor.”
   The next step was naturally             refer these “reduced lengths.”
                                                      to

therefore though tdesirable by the Committee of the British
Association, when appointed in 1861 to consider the question
of the selection of electrical units, that they should decide on
some system not only independent of any particular material,
but also of such a nature that every simple equation connecting
the absolute measurements of force, work, electric and mag
netic quantity, current, resistance, and electromotive force
should be independent of numerical coefficients.
  But there are, as is well known, six fundamental equations
connecting these six quantities—

one equation in fact more than is necessary to produce a single
system of units.    The consequence is that one or other of #.
two similar equations,  Nos.1 and 2, connecting electric or mag

by rejecting No. 1, then 2, 4, 3, 5, 6 determine the electro
magnetic units of magnetic pole, current, quantity, resistance,
and electromotive force.       The names “electrostatic ’’ and
“electromagnetic ’’ refer of course only to the fundamental
conception of the two systems, and do not in any way imply
that in these systems the electricity must be in rest or
motion: thus, for example, we may have an electrostatic unit of
current.

Electromagnetic     to the Electrostatic Unit of Electric Quantity. 281
a current in a given time was made by Faraday"; but being
measured in arbitrary units, as the absolute system was not
then developed, Faraday's comparison gave no indication of
the value of v.
    There are several ways of measuring this value. The first
numerical determination was made, in 1856, by Messrs. Weber
and Kohlrausch f ; and their method was founded on the
measurement        of the same quantity of electricity, first in
electrostatic and then in electromagnetic units.             The result
they obtained was 310.7 million metres per second.
       ut as the quantity they measured electrostatically was prac
tically the amount discharged in a finite time by a Leyden jar
previously electrified to a fixed difference of potentials, and
the amount measured electromagnetically was the instan
taneous discharge of the same Leyden jar electrified to the
same difference of potentials, it is probable that the result of
the first of these measurements and consequent value of v ob
tained was, on account of the electric absorption    -      of the glass,
rather too     large.
    The next determination of the value of v was made by Sir
 W. Thomson in 1868 f, who measured the same electro
 motive force electrostatically with his absolute electrometer,
 and electromagnetically by determining with an electro
 dynamometer the electromagnetic value of the current sent
 by this electromotive force through a known resistance.             The
 mean of eleven sets of experiments, from which the highest
 value obtained was 292 and the lowest 275, gave a result of
 282.5 million metres per second.
      In the preceding method two forces had to be separately
 measured, one by means of an electrometer, and the other
 with an electrodynamometer; but Prof. Clerk Maxwell, about
 the same time, carried out a method by means of which
 these two forces were made to balance one another, so that
 the ratio of the electrostatic and electromagnetic measures of
 the same electromotive force was obtained without previously
 ascertaining the value of each. The highest of the twelve
 most accurate results was 294, and the lowest 284, and the
 mean for v 288 million metres per second.                In both these
 methods     it was necessary to know the absolute resistance of a
 certain coil employed.
     It  will be observed that even the highest values obtained
 by either Sir Wm. Thomson or Prof. C. Maxwell were lower

  than the velocity of light, which is about 300 million metres per
  second, and their mean value far lower.
     In 1872 a redetermination of the value of v was made by
  Mr. Dugald McKichan, in Sir Wm. Thomson's laboratory",
  using the same method that Sir William had previously em
   loyed; but as certain improvements had since 1867 been
 introduced into the absolute electrometer, the results now ob
                                º
 tained were more accurate.       The mean value on this occasion
 was 293 million metres     per  second,  still, however, being much
 lower than the   velocity  of light. . It is important, however, to
 notice that some           values obtained were as high as 300
 million metres, although these are again balanced by others as
 low as 290 million metres per second.

   When, therefore, Professor Perry and myself, in 1877, took
up the question experimentally, it could not be said that the
ascertained value of v was equal to the velocity of light,
although Professor Clerk Maxwell's electromagnetic theory
required the identity for     corroboration.  its
   n  fact the best experiments seemed       show that was, for          to                     v
some reason, less than the accepted velocity         light.   The                      of
question therefore arose, was Professor Clerk Maxwell's theory
incomplete,       or
                was    that the accepted velocity       light was                           of
     high,       or             it it      previously   employed
too            was     that the methods
                            might     improved on, and more

accurately by loss of charge.     It would be possible, by dis
charging through a delicate tangent-galvanometer, or some form
of absolute electrodynamometer, the charge of an air-condenser
many times per second, to determine the electrostatic value of
the current so produced ; and as the electrostatic value of the
current is known from the number of discharges per second,
from the geometrical dimensions, and the difference of poten
tials to which the plates are charged, we should have a fairly
accurate means, but one hitherto unemployed for determining v.
    But it appeared, for the following reasons, to Mr. Perry
and myself             #.
                   the method best suited for the accurate deter
 mination of v was one that had also not been previously em
 ployed, and which consisted in measuring the capacity of an
 air-condenser (1) electromagnetically by the swing of the
 needle of a ballistic galvanometer, and (2) electrostatically by
 the measurement of the linear dimensions of the condenser.

leads to an equation involving only the square root of a resist

the square root of that error would be introduced into the
answer, whereas in                    all
                        the methods previously employed the
 error     inwas directly proportional

Phillips, Rutley, and C. Ward have also advanced this special branch
of geology. In fact the application of the microscope seems to be
an essential element of petrological research, as it has afforded of
late years more precise information        concerning the mineral      consti
tution and minute structure of rocks, than it was possible to acquire
by the older methods of research.
    It is true that most manuals of geology contain descriptions and
 classifications of rocks; but few English works have been specially
 devoted to their study. Of these Pinkerton, Macculloch, the trans
 lations of Cotta and Jannetaz are well known ; with these excep
 tions, comparatively little has been done in this country to supply
 elementary instruction in the systematic study of rocks, although
 several good manuals have recently been published on the Continent.
 To remedy this deficiency, Mr. Rutley has prepared the above text
 book for the guidance of students in this branch of science.
    Having specially devoted himself to this subject, and being fully
 conversant with the works of foreign and British authors, he has
 more or less plentifully interwoven original ideas and observations
with the information derived from these sources, in the general treat
 ment of the different subjects.
    The work is divided into two parts. The first, or rudiments of
petrology, comprises the nature of rocks, their origin and struc
ture, mode of occurrence, the collecting and arrangement of them,
the method of preparing sections of rock for microscopic investi
gation, followed by descriptions of the form, chemical composition,
 megascopic and microscopic characters of the chief rock-forming
minerals, upon the identification of which the determination of the
 precise character of a rock is necessarily based.         The second part,
or   descriptive  petrology,   contains the classification of rocks, in which
 the author to some extent deviates from that commonly adopted.
 The two principal divisions are the Eruptive and Sedimentary,
 the former being again divided into two classes—the vitreous and
the crystalline.      Besides careful descriptions of the various rocks,
 the author has    prepared     some suggestive and useful Tables (partly
 after the manner of Senft), showing a scheme of deviations of cer
 tain rocks, as Granite, Trachyte, Diorite, Basalt.              -
     Limited to some extent as to space, which necessarily requires
 that certain portions of the subject should be treated with brevity,
 Mr. Rutley has nevertheless produced a very useful manual of
petrology, in which the various parts are clearly and concisely
described; so that by a careful study of the book, assisted by the
examination of the chief rock-forming minerals, and supplemented
by some field-work, the student will be enabled to master this
somewhat difficult branch of geological science.

Dingle, and especially of one containing numerous red- and green
sandstone pebbles, which enclose fossils of Upper-Ludlow forms,
and   lying above the so-called “Bastard Limestone.”          From the
arrangement of the beds the authors believe that they may have
been deposited against a bank or sloping surface of Wenlock shale;
and they state that the great majority of the pebbles in the con
glomerate are quite unlike any rock known in the district, but
closely resemble the Upper-Ludlow beds of Kendal and Central
Wales.     The authors discuss the origin of the pebbles, and suggest
“the probable extension of the Ludlow beds under Lancashire as the
most likely source from which they can have been derived.”
    2. “On a New Group of Pre-Cambrian Rocks (the Arvonian) in
 Pembrokeshire.”      By Henry Hicks, M.D., F.G.S. With an Ap
 pendix on their Microscopic Structure, by T. Davies, Esq., F.G.S.
    In some new areas of Pre-Cambrian rocks, discovered by the
 author last summer in Pembrokeshire, some rocks of a character
 hitherto unrecognized in this country were made out. As they were
 found to hold there, and subsequently also in other areas, a very
 definite stratigraphical position, with a vertical thickness of several
 thousand feet, they have been separated by the author from the
 other Pre-Cambrian groups under the distinctive name of Arvo
 nian. They were also found to occupy an intermediate position
 between the Dimetian and Pebidian formations, and at all points,
 so far as could be made out, appeared to be separated from each of
 those formations by stratigraphical breaks.      The new areas where
 they are chiefly exposed are situated some few miles to the north
 of Haverfordwest, where they form ridges running in a direction
 from N.E. to S.W. They occupy an average width of about a mile,
 attain at some points to a height of nearly 600 feet, and together
 have a length of over nine miles. The rocks are flanked by Pebi
 dian and Cambrian beds along their N.W. borders; and on the S.E.
 Silurian rocks have been brought against them by faults. In general
 appearance, as well as in their more minute lithological characters,
 they are easily distinguished from any of the rocks hitherto de
 scribed by the author as characteristic of the Dimetian and Pebidian
 groups in Pembrokeshire.        They are, however, so closely allied to
 some of the true “halleflinta” rocks of Sweden, that it seems to the
 author and Mr. Davies that this is the name that should be applied
 to them in a petrological sense.     In external aspect and in their
 splintery fracture they resemble a hornstone. Under the microscope
 they are seen to consist mainly of a crypto-crystalline ground-mass,
 which, when examined with a high objective, is resolved into grains
 of quartz, with an insterstitial ingredient having but little action
 on polarized light, but which presumably is felsite. There are also
 numerous nests and fissure-like groups of quartz-grains disseminated
 throughout; and sometimes angular fragments, distinct in size and
 shape, are enclosed.     These nests and fissure-like groupings are
 frequently encircled also with bands of a fibrous chalcedony, the
structure of which is well exhibited with polarized light; and a
 rude parallelism, suggestive either of an incipient foliation or of

         On the Pre-Cambrian       Rocks   of Caernarvonshire.     293
stratification, is thereby given to the rock. The author and Mr.
Davies believe the origin of the rock to have been a sedimentary one.
   3. “On the Pre-Cambrian (Dimetian, Arvonian, and Pebidian)
Rocks of Caernarvonshire and Anglesey.”        By Henry Hicks, M.D.,
F.G.S. With an Appendix on their Microscopic Structure, by the
Rev. Prof. T. G. Bonney, M.A., F.R.S., F.G.S.
   In this paper the author gave the results of some further re
searches made in Caernarvonshire and Anglesey since his previous
communication to the Society on Dec. 5, 1877. A brief statement
of some of the results was read at the last meeting of the British
Association in Dublin; but much additional evidence was now
brought forward, besides many important facts obtained since by
microscopical examination of the rocks. Concerning the areas de
scribed in his former paper much additional information was given,
and the boundary in one case greatly extended.       This new area lies
to the west of Moel Tryfaen, and includes now, in addition to the
central or quartz-felsite ridge, the whole of the rocks marked in the
Survey maps as altered Cambrian, extending as far west as Glynllifen.
Many of the large masses in South-west Caernarvonshire and the
Llyn promontory, hitherto supposed to be intrusive rocks of Silurian
or Post-Silurian age, were discovered, during these researches, to be
of Pre-Cambrian age, and conclusive evidence obtained that the so
called altered Cambrian rocks there, and in Anglesey, were also of
that age.    In these various areas the three Pre-Cambrian forma
tions found in Pembrokeshire were recognized by having similar
lithological characters, and by holding almost identical stratigra
phical positions in their relations to one another.      Dimetian rocks
were recognized at Twt Hill, Rhos Hirwani, near Ffestiniog, and in
the so-called granitic ridge in Anglesey; Arvonian rocks between
Caernarvon and Menai Bridge, in the Eifl. Range, Nevin Mountain,
 and near Ty Croes in Anglesey, &c. &c.; Pebidian rocks to the
 east of Glynllifen, Bangor, at the lower part of the Llyn promontory,
 and in many places in Anglesey.       Some notes on the section near
Ty Croes by Prof. Bonney accompanied the paper, in addition to an
appendix by him on the microscopic examination of rock speci
mens from each of the areas examined.
   4.   “On the Quartz-felsite and Associated Rocks at the       base   of
the Cambrian Series in North-western Caernarvonshire.”           By the
Rev. Prof. T. G. Bonney, M.A., F.R.S., F.G.S.
   The great masses of quartz-felsite (or quartz-porphyry) which
occur in the vicinity of Bangor, Caernarvon, and Llyn Padarn are
coloured in the Survey map as intrusive, and in the memoir regarded
as most probably the result of an extreme metamorphosis        of the
lower beds of the Cambrian series.
   The author showed that these quartz-felsites exhibited, in places,
all the characteristics of true igneous rocks—flow—structure, fissile
structure, and the more ordinary structure of rhyolitic rocks; that
they were, in one place, at least, associated with masses of agglome
rate, and in another parted by a band of comparatively unaltered slate.
   He also showed that in several places there succeeded a grit
formed of fragments of       it, that larger fragments      ofperfectly

characteristic structure, associated with others of a more slaggy and
scoriaceous      type, occurred repeatedly in the overlying beds up to
the base of the Cambrian, described by Prof. Hughes and Dr. Hicks,
the felsite pebbles in which come from the same source.
    Lastly, he showed that the signs of metamorphism and apparent
“melting down” asserted to be visible on the sides of Llynn Padarn,
proved, on microscopic examination, to be mainly superficial.
Hence he maintained that these rocks were rhyolitic lava-flows of
Pre-Cambrian age.
    5. “On the Metamorphic Series between Twt Hill, Caernarvon,
and Port Dinorwic.”          By the Rev. Prof. T. G. Bonney, M.A., F.R.S.,
F.G.S., and F. T. S. Houghton, Esq., B.A.
    In the Geological-Survey map this district is coloured as “intru
sive felsite,” together with those spoken of in the last paper. It
was asserted to be probably metamorphic rock by Prof. Hughes and
Dr. Hicks in a communication made to the Society last year; and
the first author confirmed that view by microscopic examination of
a specimen collected by them.           The authors had during the past
autumn more minutely examined the district, and found:—(1) that
the general character of the series was that of a metamorphic one ;
(2) that the rocks of granitoid aspect were associated with well
marked beds of conglomerate; (3) that this series extended up to a
little beyond Port Dinorwic, where the quartz-felsite set in. The
paper described the microscopic structure of some of the rocks; and
the author expressed the opinion that the more granitoid specimens
were probably the results of alterations of felspathic grits.

as  clearly  as one of the Saxony perlites.     Some of the other felstones
of the   Glyder     Fawr show numerous spherulites. These felstones
have been determined by the Survey to be lavas of Bala age.

   2. “The Gold-leads of Nova Scotia.”         By Henry S. Poole, Esq.,
M.A., F.G.S., Government Inspector of Mines.
    The author remarked upon the peculiarity        that the gold-leads
of Nova Scotia are generally conformable with the beds in which
they occur, whence Dr. Sterry Hunt and others have come to the
conclusion that these auriferous quartz veins are interstratified with
the argillaceous rocks of the district.     With this view he does not
 agree.    He classified the leads in these groups according to their
 relations to the containing rocks, and detailed the results of mining
 experience in the district, as showing the leads to be true veins by
 the following characters:—1. Irregularity of planes of contact
 between slate and quartz; 2. The crushed state of the slate on some
 foot-walls; 3. Irregularity of mineral contents; 4. The termination
 of the leads; 5. The effects of contemporary dislocations; 6. The
 influence of strings and offshoots on the richness of leads.       The
 author further treated of the relative age of the leads and granite,
 and combated the view that the granites are of metamorphic origin,
which he stated to be disproved by a study of the lines of contact.
He also noticed the effects of glaciation on the leads, and the
occurrence of gold in Carboniferous conglomerate.

          ON THE DIFFUSION         OF LIQUIDS.   BY J. STEFAN.
          memoir contains the calculation of Graham's experiments,
THIS  which were published in the ‘Philosophical Transactions,’ 1861,
p. 183. To commence the experiment, on the top of 100 cub. centims.
 of a salt-solution in a cylindrical vessel 700 cub. centims. of
 water was poured. After a fixed time the liquid was, by means of
 a fine siphon, drawn off at the top in portions of 50 cub. centims.
 each, and the salt-content of each of the fourteen upper layers
 separately, the two lowermost together, determined.        The amount
of salt contained in the original solution was always 10 grams.
    The solution, corresponding to this arrangement of the experi
ment, of the differential equation constructed by Fourier for cal
culating the propagation of heat through conductors, and applied
by Fick to the representation of the laws of diffusion, can be
effected in two ways:—First, in the form of periodic series.       This
form is ill-suited to the discussion of the experiments, since, except
in a few cases, very many terms of the series must be taken for
the calculation.                                              -
    The second method of solution is used in the form of definite
integrals; and for them proper Tables are calculated. The heads

of these Tables contain the salt-contents of the respective layers in
the diffusion-vessel for a series of values of a number dependent
on the coefficient and the duration of the diffusion.      Given these
two  quantities, the corresponding   distribution of the salt is found
in the Tables.
   Conversely, with the aid of these Tables, the value of the diffusion
coefficient belonging to each salt-content of a layer as given by
Graham can be found, and we can recognize, according to the
nature of the accordance or deviation of the coefficients resulting
from the data of one and the same experiment, whether the experi
ment is in harmony with the theory or not.
   Diffusion-processes are very easily disturbed by currents pro
duced in the liquid by differences of temperature, so that the upper
layers receive too much, and the deeper layers too little salt. The
results of Graham's experiments, however, may be more faulty still,
and in the same direction, in consequence of those currents which
can hardly be avoided when the liquid is drawn out with the siphon.
We must therefore, even assuming that the theory accurately re
presents the processes of diffusion, be prepared to expect considerable
differences between observation and calculation.      Such differences
occur in many cases; but there are also cases in which the devia
tions are very slight.   The following series give instances of the
close approximation that may exist between observation and
calculation:—

  The motion of diffusion has two properties in common with
wave-motion, which follow from the linear form of the differential
equations determining the laws of these motions. The first is the
superposition of the diffusion-currents       which start from different
parts of the liquid ; the second is the complete reflection which
the diffusion-currents  undergo at the boundaries of the liquid.
Both properties can with great advantage be made use of in the
calculation of Tables.  The memoir contains also a formula, based
on them, which permits the diffusion-coefficient to be calculated in
a very simple way from a combination of the salt-contents of the
individual layers.

  mena of rarefied gases, the electricity is conducted to the gas en
 closed in a glass tube through metal wires fused into the tube.
 Since the metals are very likely to exert an influence upon the
 phenomena,       I have tried the insertion of a liquid between the
 metal and the    gas,  in order, to some extent, to form liquid electrodes.
     A  glass  tube twice bent at right angles contained in its wider
 parts fused-in platinum wires and concentrated sulphuric acid, the
 latter rising one centimetre above the wires. The tube was joined
 by fusion to a mercury air-pump, the drying-vessel of which was
 filled with solid phosphoric acid.
     The gases contained in the tube and the pump having been so
 far rarefied that an induction-current could pass through, the
 platinum wires were connected with the poles of a Ruhmkorff                                                 in
 ductorium, which, excited by four Bunsens, gave a striking-distance
 of 71 millims. and a deflection of 50 scale-divisions on a mirror
 compass.       (A constant current of 0.00035 Siemens-Daniell unit
 gave, on the same compass, with the same spirals, a deflection of
  100 scale-divisions.       The value of the 50 scale-divisions of the
 momentary current, calculated from the duration of a vibration of
 the damped magnet and from                      its
                                          logarithmic decrement, amounted
to   0-000013 S.-D. unit.)

With the aid of the spectral apparatus with four prisms lent me
by M. Kirchhoff, I determined the lines according to Kirchhoff's
plate, according to which

                             O,                O,          O,         O,           O.

The intensity of O, is the greatest; then follow 0, and O, and
last O. and O. The lines are sharp towards the red end of the
spectrum, fading towards the violet.            Their wave-lengths agree
best with those    given  by  M.   Vogel;   only   he did not observe O,
perhaps because the pressure of the gas was not sufficient. Plücker's
lines O., and Os are probably mercury-lines.
   Contrary to Mr. Schuster's latest statement,          find the spectrum         I

                                                  find this identity in the
hydrogen also, and in the nitrogen only an intensifying of two of

                                      at at     pole, because the ponder

    The immobility or permanence of the common surface thus
modified is explained by the fact that each opening in the film of
extraneous liquid is immediately closed by the molecular forces;
the surface-tension of the pure liquid in the opening is greater
than that of the rest of the film contaminated by contact with
the extraneous liquid.        The extraneous film may also consist
of a solid body, provided that it be not completely solid, but to
some extent mobile. This follows from the above-described
(under 5) phenomena and properties of the common surfaces
of liquids and solid bodies (compare Wiedemann's Annalen,

solution is 5-58 mgr., of albumen 2:40 mgr., and of a ten
per-cent. solution of tannic acid 2.88 mgr.
   With organic fluid substances like albumen and solution of
tannic acid, a thin membrane of the fixed substance seems to
form on the surface of the air-bubbles; for they show angular
protuberances, and the surface becomes less mobile; this im
mobile membrane promotes the durability of the emulsion. A
  ermanent froth of this kind made with white of egg is well
 snown in the kitchen.
   With very volatile liquids, or such as are easily soluble in
the original aqueous fluid, such as alcohol and ether, the froth
soon subsides; for the film of extraneous liquid on the surface
of the water rapidly disappears, owing either to evaporation
or solution. The froth of beer is broken up by a small quan
tity of ether; for the tension of the common surface of
that substance and air is very slight, and the surface itself
tears under the dispersion of the fluid laminae forming the
foam, in a similar way as in the experiments on the dispersion
of soap-solution over the common surface of          and water,                oil

different parts of the spectrum the sensitiveness of the silver
 compound is materially different, and that consequently the
absorption at different parts cannot be well compared.        The
objection vanishes, however, at once, if ordinary precautions
are taken; and as an illustration           I
                                      will take a case.
   The  absorption  of a violet (cobalt) glass was required to be
registered photographically.       A spectroscope having two
prisms of 62° was judged to give sufficient dispersion; and a
lens was used in the camera of a focal length of about 2 feet.
This gave a spectrum about 4 inches long, including the
visible and invisible radiations. The plate having been placed
in the camera, the top half of the slit was shielded, and sun
light was reflected onto the bottom half for two minutes; the
sunlight was diverted, and the absorbing medium (in this case
violet glass) was placed in front of the slit", the lower half
covered up, and sunlight again reflected onto the top half of
the slit for two minutes more.     The plate was then developed,
and a print taken from the negative.      A scale of shade having
been prepared, the following diagram was drawn from the
measurements made with it.
   The top continuous curve of fig. I. shows the intensity pro

   * When this paper was communicated to the Physical Society, Prof.
Macleod suggested that the absorption of a liquid might be better demon
strated if a wedge-shaped vessel containing it were placed in front of a
longer slit, of which a small image might        i.
                                                produced at the focus of the
collimating lens. This is quite practicable, as Professor Macleod and my
self have found by actual experiment; and if the image of coloured liquid
be corrected by a similar wedge of colourless liquid of nearly the same
specific gravity, there is no inconvenience attaching to   it.

an error, as  it must be remembered that the shades produced
photographically have not the same gradations as the inten
sity of light, as Bunsen and Roscoe first showed.
   Fig. II. shows the absorption of the violet glass, on the pre
sumption that the intensity of the radiations is equal through
out the spectrum, an assumption which is very generally
made.
   I   have   found that it is convenient in taking these spectra
to modify this method.         The absorption produced by potas
sium chromate takes somewhat of a wedge-form, shading off
from darkness in the violet to total transmission at the least
refrangible end of the spectrum.                       If
                                                a dilute solution of this
substance be interposed in each case between the source of
light and the slit for half the time of exposure, we have an
impression of the spectrum the varying intensity of which is
less marked than if such an artifice be not employed.
   I   may here remark incidentally that the passage of light
through an aqueous solution seems to interfere very little
with the intensity of the photograph at the least-refrangible
 end.       I
           had looked for a marked diminution, but have scarcely
 noticed it.
     In photographing these absorption-spectra the source of
 light should be brilliant: sunlight, the image of the incan
 descent points of the electric light, or the oxyhydrogen light,

Lines which in one flash appeared especially bright were not
seen in another flash.      The greater number of               how
ever, gave a different spectrum altogether. In the place of
bright lines a great number of bands were seen; and Prof.
Kundt even distinguishes two different band spectra.
   Mr. John Herschel (Proc. R. S. xvii. p. 61) observed a
variable continuous spectrum crossed by bright lines, which
also had a variable intensity.       He gives the measurements of
two lines, which agree very well with nitrogen-lines.
    M. Laborde (Les Mondes, viii. p. 219) observed some lines,
especially one near E, which sometimes appeared alone.            He
also saw a continuous spectrum.
    Dr. H.Vogel (Pogg. Ann. cxliii. p. 653) describes lines
but in his list  I                                              º:

lines in the  spectrum    of the electric spark taken in atmospheric
air; they do, however, coincide with two bands which have     I
observed in some flashes of lightning, as       I shall show.
    Mr.  J. P. Joule (‘Nature, vol. xvi. p. 161) also observed
some spectra of lightning.          Frequently there was only one
bright line visible, this being coincident with the brightest
nitrogen-line.     At other times there were several bright lines
visible, sometimes with and sometimes without the green
 nitrogen-line.    A continuous spectrum was also observed.
    Mr. H. R. Proctor (“Nature, vol. xvi. pp. 161 & 220) gives
some measurements of lines which do not lay claim to an
accuracy.     He observed also a band spectrum, which he finds
 not to be the band spectrum of nitrogen.
                                                    I
    From conversation with Prof. A. Young, learned that he
also had seen a line spectrum, a band spectrum, and a conti
nuous spectrum."
                                                    I
    During my stay in Colorado last summer, had some good
 opportunities of studying the spectra of lightning.           It was
 my intention to get some reliable measurements of the band
 spectrum which      i.  in common with most observers, have
 seen; and in order to have greater chance of succeeding,            I
 confined myself to one part of the spectrum only. The part          I
 chose extended from X=5000 to X=5800, and covered, there
 fore, most of the yellow and green.          I  used a direct-vision
 spectroscope, with a slit movable by means of a micrometer
 screw. A bright line in the principal focus of the telescope
 formed a fiducial mark.        Under ordinary circumstances, the
 slit is moved until the line to be measured forms a continua
 tion of the bright line which reaches down into the centre of
 the field.   I                                      I
                found, however, that the bands wanted to mea
 sure were   nearly   as broad as the thin glass bar which carries
 the  bright line;  and I used the bar therefore simply as pointer.

The measurements were always made at night; and the spec
troscope was left undisturbed until the following morning,
when the Fraunhofer lines in the neighbourhood were mea
sured, so that the wave-lengths of the measurements could be
interpolated.
   It is of course impossible to put a pointer on a band during
the instantaneous flash; but a succession of flashes allows us to
put the pointer successively nearer and nearer until we see it
in coincidence with the band. In this way several readings
of each band were obtained. The dispersive power of the
i.
spectroscopes was such that, with a higher-power eyepiece than
     one used in this investigation, the nickel-line could be
 seen between the two sodium-lines.    The distance between the
two sodium-lines was such that the two readings of the slit
differed by ten divisions of the micrometer, or one tenth of a
whole revolution.                     I
                     With sunlight can measure easily to the
 tenth part  of the distance between the sodium-lines.       ob   I
tained measurements on three different nights. Unfortunately,
the best nights for the work occurred before the Total Solar
Eclipse, which had taken me out to Colorado.          .   A   desire to
save my eyes prevented me from making as good use of these
nights as   I
            otherwise should have done.

 take any measurements of these lines; but there can hardly be
a doubt as to their position.   I  saw in the part of the spectrum
which   I  was   observing three  bands,          however, did not
always appear together. The measurements reduced to wave
lengths will be given further on. Two measurements of the
bands & and y were obtained, but one only of the band a. The
  reatest difference between the two measurements amounts to
three times the distance      between the sodium-lines.          This
difference must be     partly accounted for    by  the difficulty  of
the observation, partly by the fact that the spectroscope had
only just been unpacked after the journey; and it was found
next day that it was considerably out of adjustment. The
micrometer-screw, also, owing to the heat and dust, had a
considerable backlash; it was taken to pieces next day and
cleaned, which greatly improved      it.

considerably from that of the preceding nights. The lightning
was nearly           all
                    forked lightning; and the bright nitrogen
line came out    very  strongly. The bands were but seldom seen.

   The ordinary spectrum of air, however, contains a band at
5178; so that, as far as mere position is concerned, one might
well be taken for the other. I was, however, under the im
pression that             I
                     had sometimes seen this band without the chief
nitrogen double line 5002–5; and as the yellow band of car
bonic oxide was also apparently present,            stated with consi          f
derable confidence when I first wrote out this paper that          had                                 I
observed the      spectrum   of carbonic oxide. It     was  only  when
I  came to work out the position of the band 8 that began to
have serious doubts as to the accuracy of this conclusion. The

remainders when 31 and 29 are divided by 12; and the deno
minators 220, 157 are the remainders when 974 and 911 are
divided by 377.
   The following example, also taken from the same series,
affords another illustration of the relations connecting the frac
tions:—
      20, 47. 27, 61, 34, 41, 48, 55, 62,                      7
    § 6. The reasoning of § 3 shows that the two properties
are still true in the more general case in which the series con
sists of fractions in their lowest terms, having numerators not
exceeding any given number m and denominators not exceed
ing any given number n, m being of course not greater than n.
For consider only the second property (which includes the
first), and suppose this property to be true for the series of
fractions having numerators not exceeding m and denomina
tors not exceeding m + r. Introduce the fractions having nu
merators not exceeding m and denominators equal to m + r +1;
then, as in § 3, the property is true for        all
                                              the fractions        up    to

the fraction next greater than m + r + 1 in magnitude, and
                                                              777,
the series of fractions greater in magnitude than
                                                           m+r+ 1
                                                                                                     -I
remains unaffected.       Thus if the property is true for denomi
nators not exceeding m + r, it is true for denominators not
exceeding m + r + 1. But it is true for denominators not ex
ceeding m or m + 1, and is therefore true generally.
     If,therefore,     any such series
                             in          those considered         as

 all the fractions   having numerators   exceeding  any given  num

vergent to #, then              aq-bp = +1.      It is a    well-known theorem,
and one given in elementary treatises on algebra, that any
convergent to a fraction is nearer to it than any other
fraction having a less denominator than that of the con
vergent; and the proof" of this includes a proposition proved
in   § 2,     viz. that     *    is nearer to   ; than      any fraction on the
same side of it having a less denominator than b.     But it was
more convenient to establish the result in § 2 independently, for
the sake of completeness, as in any case it must have been
shown that

new, but it is certainly little known.                 I

not exceeding 100, up to ; ; and the ‘Table of Circles' which
accompanies it only extends to 100, and occupies but one page.
The “First Centenary' itself" contains tables for the conver
sion of vulgar fractions into decimals, arranged by denomi
nators instead of in order of magnitude as in the ‘Tabular
Series.’
    § 11. The arguments in the ‘Tabular Series’ of 1823 afford
a beautiful illustration of the properties stated in § 1; and it
is from this work that the examples in § 5 have been taken.
It is very interesting to apply the reasoning of § 4 to groups
of fractions as they stand in this Table ; of course in § 5 it
was convenient to select examples in which only a few frac
tions were involved.      Mr. Goodwyn writes in the preface to
the ‘Tabular Series’ of 1823 (p. iv):—“The Computer would
draw the attention of the curious in such matters to the fol
lowing remarkable property of the fractions which form the
Series: viz. In any three consecutive vulgar fractions in the
table   if the numerators of the eatremes and the denominators
respectively be added together, the sum will form the numerator
 and the denominator of a fraction equal to the mean.”
    On pp. iv-v of the ‘Tabular Series' attached to the ‘First
Centenary' of 1818, Mr. Goodwyn enunciates both properties.
 He explains that the fractions do not form an arithmetical
progression, and proceeds:—“In fact, the law of the increase
is such, that each Fraction exceeds that which immediately
precedes it by a part equal to unity divided by the product of
their two denominators : so that the increment is anything but
 constant.     The law, however, is invariable; and from it a
 ready method is derived for verifying the arrangement of the
 TABULAR, or any similar, SERIES.”
    He then refers to the mode of arrangement of the fractions
 (which are printed zigzag fashion in two columns), and con
 tinues       –“Atthe same time, it serves to illustrate this other
 law in the succession of the terms of the entire Series; namely,
 that the numerator of any Fraction in it is always the same
 aliquot part, or submultiple, of the sum of the numerators of
 the Fractions immediately preceding and immediately following
 it, which         its

 This appeared in the Philosophical Magazine for May 1816,

 specimen of the ‘Tabular Series’ previous to this date.                A

Library contains two copies of each of Mr. Goodwyn's publi
 cations of 1818 and 1823 *, but no copy of the specimen of
 1816.   There is an account of Mr. Goodwyn's works in the
British Association Report on Tables (Bradford, 1873, pp.
31–33), where                    I
                    have erroneously attributed the property
enunciated   by  Mr. Farey to Cauchy. A more complete de

Goodwyn’s ‘Table of Circles’ and ‘Tabular Series of Decimal

                                      .
melting-point               of    iron is about 50 per cent. higher than that of
copper; therefore                          =4 is        the ratio       for the sectional area of
iron to copper.
   This simple treatment of the problem, however, is incom
plete, because it neglects to take three most important factors
into consideration—namely (1) the influence of the rise of
temperature in increasing the electrical resistance of the metal,
(2) the difference between the “thermal capacity” or “specific
heat” of copper and iron, and (3) the fact that, the iron rod
being made several times more massive than the copper rod,
it will require a proportionately greater quantity of heat to
increase         its
              temperature.   These omissions introduce     enor                                   an
mous error in the result.

area of a copper rod in the ratio of 8 to 3.
   This result is an argument in favour of the use of iron as

     GENTLEMEN,
    BEG to submit to your consideration for publication the
     accompanying memorandum of experiments made by me
with the object of determining the correction to be added to
the length of a cylindrical resonant tube to find the true
wave-length, and the velocity of sound in small tubes.
   They give results, as regards the first point, in the main
                                                 º
confirmatory of those already arrived at by Lord Rayleigh
and Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet; but the methods of experi
ment followed by me being different to theirs, the notes may
be of interest.   As regards the second point     am not aware       I
of any experimental results           been published.
                               am, Gentlemen,I

   The first method of experiment adopted by me is applica
ble only to tubes closed at one end, and consists in determin
ing in a tube of indefinite length the positions of the first and
second nodes of a wave excited by a fork held over             mouth,            its
the tube having one end sunk            water, and the water-level
                                                 in
at  the position giving maximum resonance determining the
position      of
                                                                         it of
             the node. The tube used was made             thin brass,
and had        an
               internal diameter        2:08 inches;

LIV.        On the Dissipation                 of Energy.            By Prof. P. G. TAIT.
                  To Sir W. Thomson, F.R.S.
   My DEAR THOMsoN,-
     ADDRESS you as one of the Editors of the Philoso
      phical Magazine, but also specially as the first pro
pounder of the doctrine of the Dissipation of Energy.    I do
so because Prof. Clausius, in the second part of the new
edition of his work on Thermodynamics, has challenged your
claim to the well-known expression for the amount of heat dis
sipated in a non-reversible cycle.  I think that the time has
come for you to speak out on the subject, so as, if possible, to
prevent further unnecessary discussions.
   I shall endeavour, so far as                            I
                                  can, to keep to matters of
scientific importance; but                        I
                             must introduce the subject by a
reference to the comments made by Prof. Clausius upon a
somewhat slipshod passage (§ 178) of my little work on
“Thermodynamics.”      That passage refers to the integral
                                                        dq
to which        I
             believe Rankine first called attention, but which is
essentially connected with your doctrine.
  I  cannot altogether complain of Prof. Clausius's comments,
because      I
            cannot account                     }.
                                 my having called the above                                             in

                                 would be limited only by the
                                electric resistance.
   In venturing to give expression to my thoughts upon this
subject, in my address to the Iron and Steel Institute in March
          stated that a copper rod 3 inches in diameter would
                                                                                               353
be  capable  of transmitting energy to the extent of a thousand
horse-power an hour a distance of 30 miles, there to give
motion to electrodynamic engines, or to produce illumination
sufficient to light up a town with 250,000 candle-power.
   Although this statement was considered by many a bold
one at the time it was made,                      I
                                      now find that a conductor
such as        I
             then described might be able to transmit three or
four times the amount of power then named, and that the
light producible per horse-power was also, according to our

stated.
         more advanced state of knowledge, very much under
   No serious difficulty need be apprehended as to the pro
duction of a current sufficient in amount to fill a conductor
of such large proportions as here indicated. Although it
would perhaps be impossible to construct a single dynamo
electric machine of sufficient power for that purpose, an
number of smaller machines could be easily coupled up bot
for intensity and quantity to produce the desired aggregate
amount.                        -
   A difficulty would, however, arise at the other end, where
the electric energy was to be applied, and where it would
therefore be requisite to have an arrangement for          distri                        its

millim. diameter is attached at one end to an adjusting
screw, B, and at the other to one end of a bell-crank lever,
L, by means of which the pressure is brought to bear upon a
pile of carbon disks, C, placed in a vertical glass tube. The
current enters the instrument at the adjusting-screw B, and,
passing through the wire and bell-crank lever, leaves below
the pile of carbon disks. Its effect is to cause a rise of tem
perature in the steel wire, which, through             expansion,                    its
diminishes the pressure upon the carbon disks, and thus pro

product; and the mother-liquor was mixed with a little alcohol,
which threw down a quantity of oxalate of potash.       Finally
about 500 cub. centims. of   solution, containing the new salts
dissolved in alcohol of 50 to 60 per cent., was obtained. This
solution was evaporated down to a syrup; and at this stage
the exchange of barium for potassium was managed as
follows:–To the syrup 20 grims. of H2OSOs, previously
diluted with about an equal volume of water, was                  SO as             ali.
to decompose the potash-salt. The resulting sulphate of potash
was separated from the new acid by means of 500 cub. centims.
of 84-per-cent alcohol, which dissolved the new acid and left
behind the sulphate of potash.          The alcoholic solution was
mixed with 30 grims. of baryta which had been slaked, a little
more baryta being added so as to render the liquid alkaline.
The alcohol was evaporated off, and the resulting baryta-salt
dried up in the water-bath. After this evaporation to dryness,
the baryta-salt was redissolved in water, and the solution                                            fil

    The correspondence               between the sulphuric acid, sulphate                                 of

360            Messrs. Wanklyn and Cooper on the
baryta, and final      organic acid         will   be    noted.      The    want
of accordance between the quantity of baryta-salt taken and
the quantity required by the equation, as will be understood,
means that the salt was not in a state of absolute dryness.
The correctness of this interpretation was borne out by the
observation that on ignition the acid left no appreciable fixed
residue, viz. 0.774 grm. of the solid acid left, on careful
ignition, 0.002 grm. of ash. The acid was also ascertained to
be free from sulphuric acid.
    Properties of Cyano-propionic Acid-It is an amorphous
solid, brittle at ordinary temperatures, but easily softening on
being heated to 100°C. Its colour is pale brownish yellow,
or straw-colour; in powder it is almost white.
    It is very soluble in water and in strong alcohol. Its
aqueous solution is powerfully acid, both to the taste and to
litmus.    It drives out carbonic acid from carbonates, and neu
 tralizes bases completely.
   The specific gravity of an aqueous solution of the acid con
taining 15-12 per cent. of (C, H.N.O.), 3H2O, is 1:06 at ordi
nary temperatures.      An aqueous solution of one tenth of this
strength, viz. containing 1.512 per cent., forms a lather on
being shaken up, is pleasantly acid to the taste, and is capable
of dissolving metallic magnesium in the cold. In presence of
metallic mercury the action of the magnesium is brisk; and in
the space of twenty-four hours ten cubic centimetres of the
weak acid liquid confined over mercury had evolved almost
the theoretical quantity of hydrogen which the magnesium
was capable of displacing.
    Cyano-propionic acid is attacked when it is sealed up in a
tube with the acid 8-per-cent. bichromate solution and heated
to 100°C. Under these conditions very little oxygen is taken
up and carbonic acid is formed in considerable quantities.
   In alkaline solution, when boiled with permanganate of
potash, it is slowly attacked, and takes up one third of                        its
weight      oxygen. When heated          about 200°C. with great

mass   insoluble in ether and water, but soluble in caustic
potash. On ignition a small quantity of charcoal difficult of
combustion remains. The proportion of such charcoal yielded
by the acid dry at 140°C. is about one sixth of the weight of
the acid. On continuing the application of heat this charcoal
gradually burns away and no residue is left.
   As will be seen presently, most of the salts of cyano-pro
pionic acid are soluble in water, the only exceptions we have
met with being the salts of silver, lead, and peroxide of iron.
Solutions of cyano-propionates give no precipitate with salts
of alumina, copper, and peroxide of mercury.              Those cyano
propionates which are soluble in water are insoluble or very

   Cyano-propionate of Magnesia.-This salt was prepared by
precipitating the baryta-salt                an equivalent of sulphate of

magnesia, separating the sulphate of baryta by filtration, and
evaporating the aqueous solution of the magnesia-salt in the
water-bath.      It is very soluble in water, and on drying at
100° C. forms a jelly, which by very long-continued drying
at 100°C. yields a brittle mass which may be powdered (giving
a white powder).            The powder was analyzed : 0-863 grim.
yielded, on ignition, 0.132 grim. of magnesia, or 9.18 per cent.
of magnesium. The formula (C, H, N MgO,), 3 H, 0 requires
Mg per cent. =8-90.

quantity of water, and then exactly neutralizing the solution

the acid requires exactly the theoretical quantity of bicarbo

 time, forms a brittle straw-coloured mass, non-fusible at
 100° C. The mass was dried at 100° C. till it became con
 stant in weight.      It was then analyzed: 0-813 grm. contained
 0.1044    grim. of calcium,    or Caper cent. = 12.84. The formula
 C, H,CaNO, 2H,0 requires Ca per cent. = 12.99.
    On raising the temperature this salt shows great stability;
 and a short heating to 200° C. drives off hardly 4 per cent.,
 which is less than half an atom, of water.
    The salt is very soluble in water, and on mixing the aqueous
 solution with an equal volume of 84-per-cent. alcohol, gives an
abundant powdery precipitate. No doubt this property might
be taken advantage of to afford a means of purification.

   Danel; 1879. (8vo, pp. 36.)
           paper is divided into four parts. In the first the Author
THIS    states, by way of preliminary, the method of obtaining the
equations to the Acoustic Curves by the use of Lisajous’s Cylinder;
in the second he investigates the properties of the curves as de
scribed on the developed surface of the cylinder; in the third he
discusses the properties of the curves resulting from the projection
of these cylindrical curves on a plane containing the axis—
these projections being, of course, the acoustic curves themselves;
and in the fourth he obtains a method of making models of the
curves as drawn on the cylinder.         His method is merely this:—
He traces the developed curve on cardboard, and cuts it out, leaving
it of a sufficient thickness; he then bends it into the required form
round a wooden cylinder, and gums the edges together; when the
gum is quite dry he removes the cylinder ; and on duly mounting
the cardboard, which retains the cylindrical shape, he has the model
of the curves.
   The substance of the paper is comprised in sixteen theorems, six
relating to the cylindrical curves and ten to their projections. One
of the chief of these theorems, relating to the projections, is the
following:—“There exist in general 2mn—(m+n) intersections,
situated on lines parallel to the axes of w and z; some of these pa
rallels vary when A varies; others remain fixed " (p. 20).       In this
enunciation m is the number of rotations of the cylinder, n the
number of oscillations of the molecule, and A+m the phase at the
beginning of the time. In illustration of this theorem, the author
draws the curves corresponding to ten values of A for m=4 and
n =3, and for m=5 and n=3, i. e. for a fourth and a major sixth.
These curves, though more complicated, correspond, of course, to
those given for the octave, twelfth, and fifth in Lord Rayleigh's
“Treatise on Sound” (vol. i. p. 29), which also would serve to illus

trate the theorem.   On the whole, this is a very elegant paper on
Acoustic  Curves;  it is needless to add that it is the work of an
accomplished mathematician.

THE1. following       communications were read:—
           “Results of a Systematic Survey (in 1878) of the Directions
 and Limits of Dispersion, Mode of Occurrence, and Relation to
Drift–deposits of the Erratic Blocks or Boulders of the West of
 England and East of Wales, including a Revision of many years'
 previous Observations.”      By D. Mackintosh, Esq., F.G.S.
     The author's researches lead him to the following conclusions:—
 Boulders from the North-Criffell range and Lake-district can be
 traced from the Solway Firth to near Bromsgrove (about 200 miles),
 and over an area in greatest breadth (from near Macclesfield to
 Beaumaris) of 90 miles, those from Criffell being particularly
 abundant near Wolverhampton.          Boulders from the Arenig occupy
 a  triangular area limited  by a line drawn northward from Chirk to
 the Dee estuary, and to the S.E. of that town are found as far as
 Birmingham and Bromsgrove. The dispersion of the more distant
 Criffell Boulders would require submergences of from 400 to 1400
 feet; of the Lake-district a little deeper; while the distant dispersion
 of the Arenig Boulders took place at submergences between 800
 and 2000 feet.       The author describes several of the more local
 drifts, and correlates the Lower Boulder-clay of the N.W. with the
 Chalky Boulder-clay of the east of England.       He considers floating
 ice, not land-ice, to have been the agent of dispersion.
     2. “On the Glaciation of the Shetland Isles.” By B. N. Peach,
 Esq., F.G.S., and John Horne, Esq., F.G.S.
     After an account of previous opinion on the subject, the authors
 proceeded to describe the different islands, reviewing in succes
 sion the physical features, geological structure, the direction of
 glaciation, and the various superficial deposits.    From an exami
nation of the numerous striated surfaces, as well as from the dis
 tribution of Boulder-clay and the dispersal of stones in that deposit,
they inferred that during the period of extreme cold Shetland must
have been glaciated by the Scandinavian Mer de Glace, crossing the
islands from the North Sea towards the Atlantic.        In the island of
 Unst, blocks of serpentine and gabbro are found in the Boulder-clay
on the western shores derived from the rock-masses occurring on the
east side of the watershed.       Moreover, on the mainland between
Scalloway and Fitful Head, blocks derived from the Old-Red-Sand
stone formation on the eastern sea-board are abundant in the
Boulder-clay on the west side of the watershed. The relative dis
tribution of these stones in the sections on the west coast is in direct
proportion to the relative areas occupied by the rocks on the east
side of the watershed.      It was likewise pointed out that after the

  368                  Geological Society:—On the
 period of general glaciation Shetland nourished a series of local
 glaciers which radiated from the high grounds, the direction of the
 striae being at variance with the older system, while the morainic
 deposits also differ in character from the Boulder-clay produced by
 the great Mer de Glace.                              -
     The authors described the order of succession in the Old Red
 Sandstone formation in Shetland, and referred to the discovery of an
 abundant series of plant-remains in rocks which have hitherto been
 regarded as forming part of the series of ancient crystalline rocks.
 The plant-remains are identical with those found in the Old-Red
  Sandstone rocks in Caithness, Orkney, and Shetland, from which it
 was inferred that the quartzites and shales in which the fossils are
 imbedded must be classed with this formation.            The authors also
 described the   great  series of contemporaneous     and intrusive igneous
 rocks of Old-Red-Sandstone        age, adducing   evidence in proof of the
 great denudation which has taken place in the members of this for
  mation in Shetland.
     3. “On the Southerly Extension of the Hessle Boulder-clay in
  Lincolnshire.”     By A. J. Jukes-Browne, Esq., B.A., F.G.S.
     The southern boundary of the Hessle Clay has not hitherto been
 satisfactorily determined. The author traces this deposit along the
 border of the flat fen-land in South Lincolnshire, near Burgh, Steeping,
 &c., and the east and west Fen. He concurs with Mr. Searles
 Wood in believing the clay to be the product of shore-ice along a
 coast-line, and that the materials were in great part derived from
 the older “Purple Clay.”        He differs, however, from that author as
 to the correlation of the Hessle series, thinking this more probably
 older than the oldest river-gravels of the S.E. of England.          In an
 appendix a deep-well section at Boston is discussed, and reasons are
 given for assigning the greater part of the beds in this to the Jurassic
 Clays, not to the Glacial.

    The following communications were read:—
    1. “On the Geological Age of the Rocks of the Southern High
 lands of Ireland, generally known as ‘the Dingle Beds” and “Glen
gariff Grits.” By Prof. E. Hull, M.A., F.R.S., F.G.S.
    After reviewing the opinions of previous writers with reference
 to the age of these beds, including those of Hamilton, Griffith,
Murchison, Kelly, Jukes, and the Officers of the Survey, which
showed that great uncertainty has hitherto prevailed, the author
quoted    a passage of the late Prof. Jukes in which he confessedly
left   the determination of the age of these beds open for future
examination ; and he therefore determined to reinvestigate the
question, bringing to bear upon it the knowledge which had since
been acquired of other districts.          For this purpose (and accom
panied by Messrs. O'Kelly and M'Henry) he examined a series of
sections, from the coast of Dingle southwards to Bantry Bay, and,

      Age of “the Dingle Beds” and “Glengariff Grits.”                                                        369
having also carefully examined the field-maps of the Survey                                                    of
those districts, had arrived at the following results:—
    First, that “the Dingle Beds” are perfectly conformable to, and
continuous with, the Upper Silurian Beds of the Dingle promontory.
    Secondly, that they are the representatives of “the Mweelrea
Beds and Salrock Slates” of West Galway and Mayo, the age of
which, as shown by the fossils, is Upper Silurian, and that “the
Dingle Beds” may therefore be regarded as of the age of the Ludlow
Rocks, but unusually developed.        This view was adopted as far back
as 1839 by Sir Richard Griffith.
    Thirdly, that throughout the south of Ireland “the Dingle and
Glengariff Beds” are disconnected from the succeeding conformable
series, consisting of              (c)

the Old Red Sandstone on the south of the South-Wales Coalfield.
This    was found to be a little over 4000 feet.        The thinning-out of
the Old Red Sandstone and Silurian strata, together with the marked
change which takes place correspondingly in the lithological cha
racters of the latter formation on passing from the north to the
south side of the coalfield were taken to indicate an approach to a
shore-line. This shore-line belonged to land which, as shown by the
great thickness of the Devonian beds, could not have extended far
south. It corresponded to Mr. Etheridge's barrier between the Old
Red-Sandstone and Devonian seas. The sandstones with Old-Red
characters, such as the Hangman Grit and the Pickwell-Down
Sandstones, occurring in the Devonian formation were deposited at
intervals when this barrier was submerged to a greater depth than
usual. The Cornstones were stated to thin out to the south along
with the other sedimentary beds of the Old Red Sandstone, and
were regarded as derived from the denudation of previously up
heaved limestones, such as the Bala and Hirnant. The paper con
cluded with a description of the characters of the more interesting
rocks and fossils.                -

       GENTLEMEN,                                     Vienna, March 31, 1870.

THE
  º
       paper by Mr. Walter Baily, in which he refers to a former paper
of his, “The Optical Properties of Starch,” Phil. Mag. for August
1876. This paper having at the time escaped my notice,                I hope
you will now allow me a few remarks on this subject in your
Journal.
    In                    I
        the year 1864 published in Poggendorff's Annalen, vol. cxxiii.,
a    note,   “Ueber das Kreuz, das gewisse organische Körper im
                  Lichte zeigen, und über die Haidinger'schen Farben
   iischel.”    I  there showed that the cross which starch, the crystal
 line  lens,   sections of horn, &c. give in the polarizing microscope
may be explained by a radial structure of doubly refracting mate
rial.
     I proved this also      by experiment, by rotating a sector of mica
between       two    Nicol prisms. Using instead of mica a dichroic
mineral and         only one Nicol, a cross is obtained the alternate
branches of which are differently coloured.              In the same paper
I    made use of this fact for an explanation of Haidinger's brushes.
    At a later period 1 had a mica disk, formed of sixteen sectors, all
identical and cut symmetrically to the optic axes, constructed
by M. Steeg, of Homburg.               This disk showed the cross very well
in the old Nörrenberg apparatus, especially when by a suitable
lens the bounding lines between the different sectors were rendered
a little indistinct,                                               -

   Another way of producing this cross depends on the fact that
glass becomes doubly refracting by pressure.      In pressing, there
fore, a lens against a plate of glass,     the conditions for the crossall
are fulfilled.      little contrivance for this purpose was described

tic candle requiring only a very simple support; the lighting, the
fixing at the desired distance, and the maintenance of the arc at the
two points result spontaneously from the electromagnetic forces,
which take upon themselves the whole of the work. It is moreover
evident that these forces are proportional to the square of the
intensity of the current, and can always be rendered sufficient; it
is only a question of construction. M. Fernet proposed to place
the carbons one in the prolongation of the other, and to take
advantage of their repulsion to separate them.    This repulsion was
but feeble; in the solution proposed by me the action is more
energetic  and becomes efficient.
     When the action of the rectangle is sufficient, the arc, spread out
and driven beyond the points, has the appearance of a gas-flame;
its length is increased.   From this results a greater expenditure of
electromotive  force; and the amount of light is not increased pro
 portionately; for it is known that, if the arc attains a very high
temperature, it does not possess a brightness comparable with that
of the carbon points. But on remarking that the arc was projected
            I
outside, conceived the idea of receiving it upon lime, magnesia, or
zircon, like the oxyhydrogen-flame in the Drummond lamp. The
arc is crushed by this obstacle, keeps a constant length, and, far
from consuming more electromotive force, it saves a notable portion,
because it springs in a highly heated and more conductive space.
On the other hand, the light, instead of disappearing skywards,
where it is useless, is reflected toward the ground; this will permit
the electric lamp to be placed at a great elevation, out of the usual
direction of looking. Besides, the light is altogether changed: it
is no longer violet, but white; it even appears greenish yellow by
contrast and by the augmented intensity of the green lines of the
lime; and, finally (the most valuable result of all), it is at least
three times as intense as without the cap of lime. In truth, that
cap must not rest upon the points; for these will fuse and pene
trate the lime, and the arc will find               its
                                          path inwards and shine                             no
more.     This     defect can easily        be   remedied.

                ON THE ELECTRICALPERFORATION OF GLASS.

     Inconnexion with his experiment described       1866, and with
                                                                in                           a

  A    thin glass plate having upon        ever      small    drop

machine, is perforated at that place, and more readily if the side on
which the drop lies be turned towards the positive electrode.
   A glass plate with bifilar suspension between the electrodes of a
Holtz machine is driven by the discharge toward the negative elec
trode, and, indeed, with more force if the side turned to the positive
electrode is partially coated with stearine.
   Fixed points for an explanation of these facts are found by the
author in the assumption, once previously enunciated, and on that
occasion also advocated by G. Wiedemann, that the air molecules
in the spark's path are affected, in their certainly very energetic
 motions, with a velocity-component directed from the positive to
 the negative electrode, such as was originally attributed by Plücker,
 and after him by Reitlinger, to the positive electricity                                                  itself

 LXI.    On the Thermal Conditions and on the Stratification                    of
    the Antarctic Ice.   By O. FISHER, Clk., M.A., F.G.S."
    IR WYWILLE         THOMSON delivered a lecture at Glas
       gow, November 23, 1876, “On the Condition of the
Antarctic "f. In it he gave a most interesting and graphic
account of observations made during the visit of the ‘Chal
lenger’ to high southern latitudes. Towards the conclusion
of the lecture, the author advanced some speculations about
the probable thickness and physical conditions of the antarctic
ice-cap. There appeared also in the ‘Quarterly Journal of
Science' for January last an article from the pen of Dr. Croll,
which contained certain criticisms upon the conclusions arrived
                 i.
at by Sir Wyville Thomson, and giving reasons why the ice-cap
may be considerably thicker than that philosopher supposes.
   Í  venture to        that there are a few points left in a some
what uncertain state by both these gentlemen, which a little
mathematical treatment, of by no means an abstruse nature,
may assist in clearing up.
   The first of these relates to the limit of thickness which the
effects of temperature might impose on the antarctic ice.
   Dr. Croll remarks that there are but three sources from
which the ice-cap can receive an appreciable amount of heat,
viz. (1) the air above, (2) the earth beneath, (3) the work of
compression and friction.      The last of these he dismisses as                in
considerable, and without doubt rightly so.

382           Mr. O. Fisher             on the      Thermal Conditions and
   Sir Wyville Thomson remarks that “it is not easy to see
why the temperature of the earth's crust, under a widely ex
tended and practically permanent ice-sheet of great thickness,
should ever fall below the freezing-point.”  Our first inquiry
therefore shall be :—
    (1)      If
            a level sheet of            to at
                                rest upon the earth,     upper sur                    its
face  being  maintained          uniform mean    temperature   lower
 than the freezing-point,                  a ice
                             find the thickness beyond which melt
 ing    the lower surface must take place.
        at
   It    assumed that the form
        is                            the ice-cap    permanent;
                                                        of                      is                       so
                                                                 ice,                of
 that we  may   consider that the  masses,  whether     rock                                     is or
 have arrived            at
                    that state      which the  temperature
                                                   in            also
 permanent.      Probably any horizontal movement            the ice,                       in
so  long      as
             the thickness      any place remains unaltered, will
                                             at
only very slightly affect this supposition—because,     there                               if           be
sliding   the parts one over another, ice abstracted
             of                                            hori                                  by

   It is evident that this result will be independent of the
cause which maintains the temperature of the surface (say)
below the average, whether it be a cold climate or an ice
sheet.   We may therefore assume that the rate of increase in
the earth beneath the ice-sheet is go of a degree Fahr. per foot
of descent.
  Let us now suppose that our sheet of ice is throughout
below the melting-temperature, so that the level of that cru
cial temperature          is situated within the rock.                  In this     case the
flow of heat from the earth will pass into the ice unaltered in
amount, because none of it will be arrested and consumed in
melting ice at the junction. The ice will then be under con
ditions which will render it sufficiently amenable to the fol
lowing statement of Fourier:-

parallel infinite planes, whose perpendicular distance is e, and

 however, be recollected that the outward movement of the ice
 is not caused entirely by a horizontal pressure arising from a
 vis a tergo, but that at every place there is a tendency to flow
 outwards towards the unsupported free edge.                 In ordinary
 glaciers the strain thus produced occasionally gives rise to
crevasses.      It seems improbable, therefore, that the horizontal
 pressure should ever exceed the vertical; so that if the latter
 cannot induce melting, neither can the former do so.
             is,

contemplated was that the pressure             one layer upon the nextof

   But it   may be fairly assumed that Mr is greater or less than
Q q, according as N M is greater or less than M. Q. Conse
quently, if the rings supplying the annual strata increase in
width, the velocity of the ice near the surface also increases,
as the pole is approached, and vice versä.
   The permanence of height in the ice-cap must depend upon
the fact, that the resolved part of the annual velocity near the
surface in the vertical direction is equal to the depth of the
annual snowfall. Consequently, for a given path, a widening
of the rings corresponding to a greater velocity would be
consonant with a thinner ice-cap, and a narrowing of them
with a thicker one.
 LXII.    Action of Light upon the Soluble Iodides, with the Out
    lines of a New Method in Actinometry.              By ALBERT R.
    LEEDs, Ph.D.”
 Th;lution,question
                 is
                      as to whether potassium iodide, in dilute so
                    decomposed by free sulphuric acid, has fre
 quently    been    made a matter of controversy.          Schönbein
 contended    that it was not, and, in an acrimonious reply to Prof.
 Fischer (Journ. für
 pugned the     purity      ††       Chem. 1845, xxxiv. p. 492), im
                        of the latter's chemicals. The same ground
 was taken by Houzeau, in a discussion with M. L. Sauvage
 (Comptes Rendus, 1868, lxvii. pp. 633, 714, 1138), the former
 going so far as to state that, when the solutions were a thou
 sand times dilute, no decomposition took place even on pro
 tracted boiling.     These discrepancies appear to have originated
                                               Wi.
 from an oversight of the essential part played by air or oxygen
 in the reaction. This is represented by the general equation
 MI+ HA+0=MA+ H20+I, where                               the basic and
 A the acid    radical,  coefficients  being  omitted. This holds true
 not only of the ordinary mineral acids, but has been verified
 in the three of the organic acids experimented upon–oxalic,
 tartaric, and acetic acids.       In the dark the decomposition    di
 minishes with the increase of dilution, being indeterminable,
 when the dilution has reached the one-thousandth, at the end
 of twelve hours, but plainly recognizable when the dilution
 ji,
 has attained the one four-thousandth at the expiration of five
 days. These figures apply more especially to the potassium
         and sulphuric-acid solutions, upon which very nume
 rous quantitative determinations of the liberated iodine were
 made.     In sunlight the amount of iodine set free increases in
 the same ratio as the increase in surface of exposure to the
                    * Communicated     by the Author.

394           Dr. A. R. Leeds on     the Action of Light
sun's rays, or, in case of solutions exposed in tubes of colour
less glass and of uniform bore, in the same ratio as the increase
Fº
of volume, or the dilution. In the absence of air, no decom
           takes place either in light or darkness.    When the air
  as been entirely removed by a long-continued current of car
bonic acid, the solution may be exposed for days to the sun
without undergoing change.          If the carbonic acid be replaced
by a stream of oxygen, decomposition begins, and, in the case of
potassium-iodide solution a thousand times dilute and exposed
to the sun, may attain to 6 mgrms. of liberated iodine per
hour.
    When these principles had been experimentally established,
they were applied in the first instance to an actinometric
measurement of the solar ray. The solutions were contained
in comparison-tubes, which when filled to the depth of 150
millims. held 100 cubic centims.         In each were placed 1 cubic
centim. of potassium iodide of 10 per cent., 1 cubic centim. of
sulphuric acid, 5 cubic centims. of starch-water, and sufficient
water to make up the volume to 20, 40, 60, 80, or 100 cubic
centims. They were supported on a frame kept normal to
the sun's ray.      The results are summarized in the accom
panying diagram; and it will be noted that the curves of the
 more concentrated are regularly circumscribed by those cor
 responding to the more dilute solutions. The determination
was interrupted at 2 P.M. by the sun's clouding over; but when
resumed two days later, numbers were obtained which intro
 duce no sudden breaks in their appropriate curves.
   In the subsequent experiments the acids employed were some
 prepared with especial care by myself, and of such strength
 that 1 cubic centim. of the sulphuric was equivalent to 25
 cubic centims. of a normal soda solution, 1 cubic centim. of the
hydrochloric to 10:7 cubic centims., and 1 cubic centim. of the
 nitric acid to 12.6 cubic centims. of the normal soda. Similar
 remarks apply to the soluble iodides, of which 1 cubic centim.
 of a 20-per-cent. potassium-iodide solution was used in each
of the subsequent trials, and 1 cubic centim. of solution of the
 remaining iodides, these solutions being chemically equivalent
 to a 10-per-cent, solution of the potassium iodide.        In every
 case 1 cubic centim. of the acid was likewise       employed,   and
 the liquid made up to 100 cubic centims. Advantage was
 taken of an exceptionally brilliant day; and the actinometric
 measurement was repeated with the above reagents, the results
 being as given in the subjoined Table (p. 396). The figures in
 the vertical columns are milligrammes of iodine set free du
 ring each half hour of the day. It having been found that the
 amounts of iodine set free in the absence of starch much ex

 ever, the amount of action upon the soluble iodides, after the
 light of the sun and electric arc have traversed certain ab
 sorbing media, has been studied. The comparison-tubes were
 supported in the centres of tall wide-mouth bottles, so as to be
 surrounded by an equal thickness (3 centims.) of the absorb
 ing medium on every side. Their tops and those of the bottles
were closed in with tinfoil, so as entirely to prevent access of
 light, but admit air. The blue medium was ammoniacal solu
 tion of copper; the yellow, neutral potassium chromate; the
red, fuchsine.       Their strength was adjusted to the point of
equal translucency.

those of the sun.

       LXIII. A      new Theory of Terrestrial Magnetism.
       By   Professors JoHN PERRY and W. E. AYRTON".
                              †.
    N the autumn of 1876, while experimenting on magnetic
     transparency, we designed an                 for testing whether
                                              º
a moving body              a definite electric charge would, like a
current, deflect a magnet. While waiting for the conclusion
of the rains, and the advent of the very dry season which ac
companies a Japanese winter, in order to try our instrument
in conjunction with an ordinary plate-glass electrical machine,
we received the account, published in the Philosophical Maga
zine for September 1876, of the experiments just performed
by Mr. Rowland in the laboratory of Professor Helmholtz,
by which it had been                       shown that a charge of
electricity mechanically moved had the properties of an ordi
nary electric current as far as the deflection of a magnet was
concernedf.
    Until this point was settled, it was unlikely that attention
would be directed to the electromagnetic effects that might
arise from the rotation of a charged body like the earth.
Shortly, however, after the execution of the experiments re
ferred to we attempted (as described in our paper “On Rain
Clouds and Atmospheric Electricity,” which appeared in the
Philosophical Magazine for March 1878) the solution of a new
theory of terrestrial magnetism.           This problem we have
attacked in a variety of ways; and the following solution, to
                                                                                  i.

    The points near the surface of the earth have different linear
 velocities from those in the interior (although            the points                   all
 have the same angular velocity                              of
                                        rotation round the earth's
 axis); therefore,      the earth had       initial electrical charge,

value equal to the potential inside the sphere due to a uniform
distribution of density aw over the surface, and is therefore a

4traw minus the force in direction 2 due to a distribution of at
tracting matter of density now over the surface of the sphere.
   Now it is easy to show that a distribution of attracting

 the writers have failed to realize that the various parts of a
 rotating sphere have relative motions one to the other, of such
 a nature that if some were electrified the others would become
 magnetized.      Their difficulty seems to have arisen from the
 fact that the motion of a particle of a rotating rigid sphere
 consists of a rotation round the axis of the sphere com
bined with a rotation of the particle round                own axis;             its                          so

412             Mr. F. D. Brown on the Maintenance of
Physical Society. Here a small closed vessel containing methyl
acetate is placed in the water the temperature of which is to
                      .
be maintained constant;   this vessel communicates with a ma
nometer containing mercury; and as the vapour-tension of
the methyl acetate increases, the mercury in the manometer
rises, obstructing the flow of gas to the burner in the usual
Way.
     } have
          applied this form of thermostat to a bath of water
used for heating a long column of mercury. The water is con
tained in a vertical copper cylinder 42 inches in length by 6
in diameter; the           is packed with felt on the outside,
and contains within it a second smaller and shorter one open
at both ends, and extending to within about 2 inches of the top
and bottom. By means of a suitable mechanical arrangement,
                                  º
the water is made to flow continuously down the space be
tween the two cylinders and up the inner cylinder; the upper
and lower portions of the
same  temperature.
                                      are thus kept at exactly the
                         The water is heated by allowing it to cir
culate through a copper coil placed over a gas-burner.          Even
when the small vessel of the thermostat is filled with ether,
the tension of which varies much more for a given variation of
temperature than does that of methyl acetate, the temperature
is subject to fluctuations of as much as 0°1, and this indepen
dently of the change which necessarily occurs when the pres        -
sure of the        is altered.
   Gas-regulators are employed perhaps more successfully
where the gas-flame can be applied directly underneath the
bath; for the rise of temperature in the water then follows
more rapidly upon the increase of the flame, the flow of gas
is sooner checked by the mercury, and the tendency to allow
too much heat to be communicated to the water is thereby
lessened.    Still better results are obtained if the thermostat
be  applied  to an outerjacket of water surrounding the bath in
which the observations are made. Both these conditions, how
ever, are generally very difficult to carry out where large
}.uantities of water are of necessity used.

(Journ. Chem. Soc. 1873, p. 458) suggested the use of mix
tures of sulphuric acid and water of different strengths, which,
if the vapour given offis condensed and returned to the mass,
boil constantly at certain given temperatures: here the constant
temperature is afforded by the liquid and not by the vapour,
which is less hot; hence, if the liquid tends to become super
heated, fluctuations in temperature will infallibly occur.   The
great objection to this method is that, when a series of tempe
ratures is required (as, for instance, in the comparison of ther
mometers), great inconvenience and loss of time is incurred by
having frequently to replace the liquid in the apparatus by
another containing a different proportion of sulphuric acid or

    A   series     of temperatures              can be obtained                  with one liquid

method, simple as it appears, is beset with considerable me
chanical difficulties, to surmount which the apparatus described

414         Mr. F. D. Brown on the Maintenance of
connected with the apparatus    X, in which a constant pressure is
kept up. Sufficient mercury is poured into R to fill AB up to
the lower end of H when R is about half full; CD is also filled
with mercury, which is let out by the tap M until the column
PS above the lower end of S S is equal to the difference be
tween the required pressure and that of the atmosphere.                   If
now the air-pump be set to work, a partial vacuum will be
created in X and in the tubes A B and CD, the mercury will
rise in AB until it touches the lower end of H; R is then placed
in such a position that the vertical distance between the lower
end of H and the surface of the mercury in R is equal to P.S.
It is now evident that when the desired pressure is reached
the mercury will close up the orifice of H, thus stopping the
withdrawal of air; while if the pressure is less than that re
quired, more air will enter through the tube SS and bubble up
through the mercury, and thus a more or less constant pressure
will be maintained in X.
   This apparatus suffers from two defects: first, the splash
ing of the mercury as it is sucked up H and then falls down
F.
again, together with the bubbling of air up C D, renders the
           in X slightly variable; secondly, it is only adapted
 or pressures less than that of the atmosphere.
   Meyer's instrument has very recently been modified by Dr.
Otto Schumann and by W. Stadel and E. Hahn (Ann. Chem.
Pharm. vol. cxcv. p. 218); the new form, although capable
of regulating pressures above an atmosphere, apparently with
tolerable accuracy, has a very limited range.
   The apparatus for maintaining constant pressures, which                 I     -
now wish to bring to the notice of the Society, consists of a ma
nometer connected with which is an automatic arrangement for
governing the supply of air. The manometer (fig. 2) consists of
a tube AB having the form and dimensions shown in the figure;
the lateral tube C is connected with the vessel X, in which a
constant pressure is to be kept up; the tube D is connected
with an air-pump or other contrivance for rarefying and com
pressing air. The upper end of the tube A B is closed by an
india-rubber stopper, or, better, by a metal cap, through which
the rod E, passes air-tight; this rod is tipped with platinum
   its                                        joined           by
                                      of of
at     lower end. The lower end           A
                                          B       is         means        of

        is connected with a small piece of steel tube                                         inter
 osed between the end of A B and the india-rubber                                               tube.
  his third connexion with the mercury contained in the mano
meter may of course be made by means of a third (insulated)
rod passing down to the bottom of the wider part of A B or F.
   To fill and adjust the manometer, the tube F is raised to the
same level as A, and mercury is poured in until it just reaches
the wide cylindrical portions of A and F; the rods El, E, are
then moved until the point of El just touches the surface of
the mercury, while that of E, is a fraction of a millimetre
above it.
   Suppose now that F be lowered n millims. and the air
pump be set to work to pump air out at D; further, that K
be connected with one pole P of a battery, and the rods
E1, E, with the other pole N: then it is evident that as long
as the pressure in A, and consequently in X, is greater than
H-n     (where H = the barometric pressure), the current will
pass through the circuit             PKE,
                                      N, whereas when the pressure
is less than         H-nthe current will pass along                    N.            PKE,
Similarly, if F be raised n millims. above A and the pump be
made to compress air into A, as long as the pressure is less
than H+ n, the current will pass along P KE, N.; but when
the pressure becomes greater than H+ n, the current will pass
along   PKE,    N. In order to economize space, the tube A B
is widened out at B; and when it is intended to obtain a
pressure greater than H, the rod E1 is replaced by a long one
reaching down to B; this, of course, is equivalent to lowering
A or raising F nearly the whole length of the scale SS. In
the further description          I
                             shall only consider the case in which
F is lower than A–that             whenis,     pressure less than
                                                       a                                        H

required; the alteration needed for higher pressures will readily
suggest itself.

versing this, passes into the U-shaped condenser C, from
which the condensed liquid runs back into B down the tube
E. The end H of this condenser is connected with the lateral
tube C of the manometer by means of a very small lead pipe;
and thus the liquid can be made to boil under any required
pressure.    The thermometers or other instruments are placed
in the small tubes TT, which are filled with petroleum of high
boiling-point.     Besides water, the best liquids for generating

                           here to express a complete judgment
              work of Sir B. C. Brodie.      This work comprises
a mathematical part, of which we are not competent to judge,
and a chemical part, upon which we have the right of pro
nouncing.    It is with the latter alone that we mean to occupy
º:
ourselves here.

   We may begin by saying that whatever
            pronounced upon the work of Sir B. C. Brodie, that              §§
work appears to us remarkable ; and it is that which has                                             in
duced us to make it known to the French public.
   The application of Algebra to the experimental sciences, the
substitution of “theories,” based upon facts and demonstrated
laws, for “systems” which only rest upon metaphysical hypo
theses, is the end towards which science ought to tend; and if
systems are necessary for the arrangement of phenomena, and
for the discovery of new phenomena in those points where the
progress of science has not yet allowed them to be replaced
by theories, this substitution ought, nevertheless, to be effected
as soon as practicable.
   We will say at once that Sir B. Brodie is unjust in denying
the discoveries which are due to the atomic notation. It is
by means of this notation and the probabilities deduced by it
that a number of syntheses have been effected—such, for ex
ample, as the synthesis of the phenols, those of the acids of the
salicylic series, of secondary and tertiary ammonia compounds,

And, in fact, the action of chlorine on marsh-gas produces
four products of substitution—chloride of methyl CHs Cl;

And this      is, fact, what occurs: each compound monatomic
                    in
alcohol-radical produces three compound free ammonias and
one quaternary ammonium, and these four ammonia derivatives
only.    Finally, from the relations which exist between the de

     Now, since Sir B. C. Brodie rejects every atomic speculation
which would necessarily place a limit to these different addi
tions, his theory shows for each hydrocarbon an indefinite
number of chlorine, bromine, or iodine derivatives, and an
equally indefinite number of alcohols, aldehydes, and acids; it
shows also an indefinite number of compound ammonias for
each alcohol, of amides for each acid, &c. &c.
    We can, in fact, according to the new system of notation,
perform upon the symbol of perchloride of carbon, a”xx", the
same operation that we can perform upon marsh-gas, perchlo
ride of methyl, chloruretted chloride of methyl, and chloro
form themselves. Thence we obtain the following equations:—

426                        M. A. Naquet on               the   Calculus
notation without the speculations   explanatory of the fine iso
mers mentioned above.      Are these speculations, which could
be  perfectly  well rejected even with our existing notation,
out of date and already useless?     I do not think so. They
may become useless one day.      We shall perhaps find in ther
mochemistry the means of explaining these fine isomers, and
applying to them mathematical expressions.       But until then
these speculations  appear  to us useful, because they arrange
facts which would otherwise remain without arrangement;
and they correspond well enough to the actual phenomena to
allow us to determine, notably in the aromatic series, the
number of these fine isomers possible for each term of the
Series.
    Even if we do not take into consideration the extreme dif
ficulty that there is in replacing one notation by another, and
the momentary confusion introduced by it into science, a con
fusion which ought not to be permitted unless the change
offers an undeniable advantage, even if we do not take into
consideration this difficulty, we should oppose the immediate
adoption of Sir B. C. Brodie's notation, because it seems to
us to open the door to a crowd of suppositions more consider
able than those it aims at eliminating, and because, from the
point of view of the arrangement and anticipation of facts, it
does not provide us with the means of dispensing with those
atomic speculations which, without being intimately connected
                                                                                                 B. it,

both including the whole of the known phenomena, should
                                                                                                  i.
lead to different deductions, and present different consequences
which should guide the operator into two distinct paths.
When things occur thus, it is useful to accept the two
theses at once, and since no objective reality is attributed                                                   .
to them until experience has decided (when experience can
decide), both are undeniably useful. Sir B. C. Brodie's
system, by showing the possible decomposition of the whole of
one class of our elements, and by indicating one of the pro
bable cases in which these elements are decomposed (the cases
of binoxide and tetroxide of nitrogen), renders a real rervice
to chemical science, and deserves to be known and studied.
It will deserve this still more, if it be found that in working it
out and perfecting it                its

    Effecting this substitution not in one but in two combined
units of hydrogen, we have :—
    Symbol of two combined units of hydrogen a” (1,1,1,1),
    Symbol of the unit of ammonia ............ a” (V, 1, 1, 1).
    It hence appears that we can effect in the unit of ammonia
three substitutions of x (or of any value of x) for 1, but no
more.     Now ak is the symbol of such a value of X, a fact as
certained by repeated experiments; and the symbols of these
three derivatives    are:—
                           a”v(ak,   1, 1),
                           2°v(ak, ak,    1),

hence the equation
                       32°ico  4-cºv–3ao + 2**v
 expresses not only a result, but the final result of the action

 a*k1*=2*k, a”xv.1°–2°xy; we are therefore at liberty either
 to suppress the symbol 1 or to exhibit it according to our

an    open  fan,  a”v to the same fan folded up.            I have said

                          quickly recognized some very interesting
verifications of my theory in the curious peculiarities mani
fested by those sheets, of which no satisfactory explanation
has, to my knowledge, been yet furnished.                 In order to be
able to continue without hurry the experimental control of
                                                  I
my theoretic deductions, will briefly explain how the prin
ciples of thermodynamics account for the effects in question.
    2. It is known from Savart's observations that, if two veins
of water with equal circular sections are impelled with equal
and opposite velocities, and meet so that their axes coincide,
there is formed, for                    all
                              pressures sufficiently strong,         plane                                  a

     a

434        Prof. G. Van der Mensbrugghe on                               a new     Application
the sheet.   On the other hand, the principles of thermody
namics  require  that the kinetic energy shall diminish, not only
because the concentric rings widen, but moreover because,
precisely on account of the superficial enlargement on the two
faces, the tension and with it the retarding force are more and
more augmented.       This last point follows as a consequence
from my deductions already confirmed by a former series of
experiments, which are described in my recent memoir,
   4. Applying my theory to Savart's plane films,       arrived at                        I
the following                  results:—
     (a) The retarding force due to the augmentation  of poten
tial energy  goes  on  increasing in proportion  as the liquid
travelling over the disk removes further from the axis.
     (b) As we have                               nearly,        being the thickness of the
                                   •=}                       e
film at any point, C a constant, v the velocity at that point, r
the distance from the axis, we conclude that, starting from
the axis, e continually diminishes, since r increases more ra
pidly than v lessens. This gradual diminution of e will cease
when vr no longer sensibly changes; but soon the velocity
decreases faster than r increases, and from that time the thick
ness, must go on increasing by degrees until it attains a
maximum.
   (c) When the velocity shall have become sufficiently reduced,
e may pass   through a series of maxima and minima, so that
there will be formed, for sufficiently strong pressures, a series
*
of circular waves joined to one another by cross striae, which
will give rise to the production of minute drops, taking away
from the outermost zone        transparence and   itsregularity                   its                   of
form.
   (d)     the velocity
            If             the liquid, after the impact, increases
                                           of
in  acertain  ratio, the retarding   force increases       greater                      in    a
ratio—which explains the remarkable fact that the liquid disks
                           less   in   diameter when the charge                   is   increased.

conducted   me,  and  which,    for the most part,    have verified                         I

limited at the equatorial section (I thus name the section the
plane of which passes through the points where the tangent
to the generatrix is vertical).
     I  have, in fact, ascertained that, if the operation is conducted
 with a constant charge, there is never any sudden rising fol
 lowed by the formation of a surface concave upwards; no
 more is there such when the charge, instead of diminishing,
                      i.
 goes on increasing; and, finally, there is none when, from any
 cause whatever,            sheet presents an aperture.
     (b) While the gradual development of potential energy in
  the upper portion of the sheet gives rise to a retarding force,
  there is developed, on the contrary, in the lower portion an
  accelerating force, due not merely to gravity, but also to the
  diminution of the potential energy of the liquid rings, which
  are incessantly narrowing right to the axis.             It is owing to
  the increase of the     velocity  of the liquid that the water-threads,
  after encountering the axis, scatter in little drops.          A Savart
  closed sheet thus presents a striking example of the transfor
  mation of kinetic into potential energy, and of potential energy
  into energy of motion.                                                  -
      (c)  If while the sheet is closed the kinetic energy diminishes,
  either gradually or abruptly, the retarding force arising from
  the increase of potential energy in the upper part increases,
  either continuously or suddenly, and then struggles against
                                         i.
  the accelerating force that animates the lower part of the sheet.
  For this    reason the film is strongly stretched : there is some
  times delineated a projecting                  and immediately after
  wards the sheet      rises,   becoming    concave upwards; but then
  the   retarding   force which dominates the concave portion is
  directed    downward,      like gravity and the accelerating force of
  the lower    part—which        immediately brings back the sheet to
  its  primitive   form,   but with smaller dimensions.
      While Savart generally operated only with charges decreas
  ing in a continuous manner,            I have verified the preceding
   theoretic consequence by abruptly diminishing the charge 10
   centims.     I thus saw, after a few seconds, the singular figure,
   concave upward, formed which so much preoccupied the
   French physicist.
      (d) According to my formula

   and absolute temperature t, the variation d() must vanish with

                                                               in that case the potential
ing force in question above is not augmented then, as in the
general case ; and for this reason the diameter of the sheet
must be greater than usual.
   This curious result of my theory is fully confirmed by Sa
vart's experiments. With an orifice of 3 millims. the aureoled
open sheet had a diameter of 20 centims. when the water was
at 1°3 C. and was impelled by the pressure of 4.885 metres;
while the sheet under the same pressure, but at the tempera
ture of 4°C., had a diameter of 36 centims.-that is to say,
nearly four times the surface.    In my opinion, this consider
able difference simply proceeds  from the potential energy T of
                       0. its

value in water-analysis, in field work, in the valuation of
pharmaceutical extracts precipitable by water (hitherto an un

examination of the atmosphere's impurities, in Eggertz's car

 THE1. “A       Contribution to the History of Mineral       Weins.”   By
 John Arthur Phillips, Esq., F.G.S.              -
    In this paper the author described the phenomena of the depo
 sition of minerals from the water and steam of hot springs, as illus
 trated in the Californian region, referring especially to a great
 “ sulphur bank” in Lake County, to the steamboat springs in the
 State of Nevada, and to the great Comstock lode.          He noticed the
 formation of deposits of silica, both amorphous and crystalline, en
 closing other minerals, especially cinnabar and gold, and in some
 cases forming true mineral veins.          The crystalline silica formed
 contains liquid-cavities, and exhibits the usual characteristics of or
 dinary quartz.    In the great Comstock lode, which is worked for
 gold and silver, the mines have now reached a considerable depth,
  some as much as 2660 feet.      The water in these mines was always
 at a rather high temperature; but now in the deepest mines it issues
 at a temperature of 157°Fahr.            It is estimated that at least
 4,200,000 tons of water are now annually pumped from the workings;

and the author discussed the probable source of this heat, which he
was inclined to regard as a last trace of volcanic activity.

communicated by R. Etheridge, Esq., Jun., F.G.S.
   The author described in detail the various spots at which dia
monds have been found in this locality.        They occur in river-drift,
associated with gold and other gems.       The drifts in the district are
at least six in number.      The oldest is considered by the author to
be  Upper   Miocene or Lower Pliocene; the next Middle Pliocene;
others   Upper    Pliocene, Pleistocene, and Recent.        Between the
Middle and Upper Pliocene flows of basalt lava took place, which
have sealed up much of the older drifts.      Diamonds are found in the
oldest drift and, probably by derivation from                  the newer.  it,   in

dum are also found.        The author then considers the question
whether the diamonds are derived from some               the igneous   of
sedimentary formations (from Upper Silurian            Mesozoic) whichto
have contributed         the drift; and concludes, from
                            to                                  variety           a                  of

                                       1876, Professor Helmholtz

   Unfortunately for me, Helmholtz had already experimented                                                                  on

A THEORETIC AND EXPERIMENTAL               DEMONSTRATION OF THE DE
     FINITION, “THE TEMPERATURE           OF   A BODY IS REPRESENTED
    BY THE LENGTH OF THE THERMAL OSCILLATION OF ITS MO
     LECULEs.” By R. PICTET.
    If  we admit that heat is only the manifestation pure and simple
of the molecular forces with which the constituent particles of
bodies are endowed, we must necessarily admit also that the me
chanical work taken up by the thermal motion must displace the
particles from their position of equilibrium and make them move in
 trajectories of an elliptic form, the amplitude of which will be pro
 portional to the work consumed.
     At absolute zero there is no oscillation, the cohesion is maximum ;
 at a certain temperature, fixed for each body, the oscillation will
 be maximum, and the body, being disaggregated, will dissolve; the
 molecules will be sufficiently apart to be out of the conditions of
 stable equilibrium.
     In this hypothesis absolute contact of material particles is ren
 dered impossible by the action of the aether; for we admit that the
 attraction of matter for the aether does not follow the same law as
 the attraction of matter for matter: for short distances the attrac
 tion of matter for the aether prevails over the attraction of matter
 for itself.
     Under these conditions the repulsive forces are useless; there
  º
 would exist in nature only attractive forces.
     On these bases let us consider the action produced by external
  work supplied to a body supposed at absolute zero. Each molecule
 will begin to vibrate and oscillate from an extreme exterior position
  to another position, an interior limit.       The evident result of this
  molecular motion will be to increase the volume of the body in
                to the mean length of the oscillations of its elementary
  particles.
     The coefficient of dilatation will therefore be in accordance either
  with the number of molecules contained in the body, or with the
  volume in which those molecules are contained, or, lastly, with the
  physical forces involved in thermal motion.
     Now the two following postulates can be admitted:—
      The laws of the attraction of matter for matter are absolutely general
  and wniversal.                                                -
      The phenomena of the disaggregation of bodies are subject to those
  laws.
     These being admitted, let N be the number of molecules con
  tained in unit length of a solid body, l' and l the lengths of oscilla
  tion corresponding to the temperatures t" and t: let a be the coeffi
  cient of dilatation of the solid body. We shall evidently have the
  following equality:—
                                      -   -
                               <U+017F>'s

                                             "ad.
  Now    N   is defined   by the density and atomic weight of the solid
   body.

                                       are;     molecules, calling the density d,         and
 the atomic weight p. If we wish to get the number of the mole
 cules N (that is to say, the number of molecules contained in the
linear unit or the edge of the cube), we have
                                         N-V/;p
     Taking a for the measured lengthening                     between zero and      100°C.,
 we get directly the relation

     Such is the value of the augmentation of the thermal wave
 length when the temperature passes from zero to 100°.
     Now, if the attraction of matter for matter obeys a general law,
 every solid molecule will divide into two or more liquid molecules
 when the oscillations have become equal to a certain maximum,
 constant for all bodies.
     We have therefore to verify two physical laws which are the ne–
 cessary consequence           of these deductions:—
     1st. The higher the fusion-temperature                   of a solid, the shorter must
 the molecular oscillations be.
     2nd. As        the fusion-temperatures           of solids correspond to equal
 lengths   of    oscillation,   the    product     of the oscillation-lengths into the
fusion-temperatures must be a number constant for all solids.
     These two laws are verified with as much exactness as the expe
 rimental determinations of the various elements entering into the
 equations permit.

of dilatation are known with sufficient accuracy:-

    We    may therefore regard the two postulates above indicated as
 correct.
    The temperature is really represented by the length of oscillation
 of the molecules of solid bodies.

ON OZONE AND         THE ELECTRIC EFFLUWIUM.           B.Y. M. BERTHELOT.
    1. The following are some experiments selected from those which
 I have made in the course of my researches upon persulphuric and
 hyperoxygenated acids, experiments the results of which appeared
to me worth making known.
    2. First, of the combination of oxygen with hydrogen.              I  have
found that these two gases, mixed in the proportion of 2 volumes
 of hydrogen to 1 of oxygen, do not combine under the influence
 of the effluvium, even at the end of several hours, either in concen
 tric sealed glass tubes", or in a tube surrounded by a lamellar
 spiral of platinumt and placed over mercury; in my trials the
 tension was nearly that developed across air by sparks of 7 or 8
 centims. length in operating with an induction-coil furnished with
 a condenser. No doubt, by progressively increasing the tensions
up to approximately those which produce disruptive discharges,
 the formation of water would be provoked. But it appeared to
me of interest to prove that that formation does not take place
 with such tensions as the preceding, and under conditions where
the portion of ozone formed is very considerable.
    The resistance of hydrogen to combination under these conditions
is the more remarkable, as they are precisely those under which
oxygen combines with metals, with sulphurous acid, arsenious acid,
iodine, and even with nitrogen, although this last reaction demands
considerably stronger electrical tensions than the others.
    Under these conditions, moreover, the vapour of water is not
decomposed by the effluvium, nor does oxygen combine with water
to form oxygenated water.
    3. These phenomena contrast with those which            I have observed
on carbonic acid. In fact, the oxide of carbon and oxygen, mixed
in a test-tube over mercury in the proportion of two volumes of
the one to one volume of the other, combine under the influence
of similar electric tensions to the preceding. After twelve hours
there remained only 8 per cent. of oxide of carbon and 2 per cent.
of oxygen.      One part of the latter had been absorbed by the mer
cury; and a portion (about 5 hundredths) of the oxide of carbon
had co-operated in the formation of the brown suboxide, C, O.
   This incompleteness of the reaction is not less manifest in the
        *  Annales der Chimie et de Physique, 5 série, t. xii. p. 466.
        #  Ibid. t. x. p. 79.

presence of an excess of oxygen.      For example, on mixing, over
mercury, equal volumes of oxide of carbon and oxygen,         found                 I
after some hours 93 per cent. of the oxide of carbon changed into
carbonic acid, 5 per cent. into suboxide, and 2 per cent. unaltered.
There remained 42 per cent. of free oxygen, including a little ozone.
The presence of an excess of oxygen, therefore, does not determine
the total combination of the oxide of carbon.
   Reciprocally, it does not prevent incipient decomposition of
carbonic acid, as            I
                      have specially ascertained.      Nay, more: in a
mixture of equal volumes of carbonic acid and oxygen              found,        I
after twelve hours, in a system of two concentric tubes, 5 per cent
of the gas decomposed into carbonic oxide and oxygen.         This oxy
gen contained a strong dose of ozone (or of percarbonic acid).
   These results establish the existence of the two opposite reactions
provoked by the effluvium, and consequently that of the chemical
equilibria determined thereby; but it has not been possible to extend
them on both sides to the same limit, on account of the secondary
reactions, such as the formation of the suboxide of carbon and the
absorption of oxygen by mercury.
   4. The decomposition of carbonic acid by the effluvium, effected
in a space free from mercury and oxidable substances, gives rise to
special phenomena worthy of our interest; for they lead one to
suspect the existence of percarbonic acid. In fact, in an experi
ment, after twelve hours of the effluvium acting upon a gas enclosed
in the annular space of the concentric tubes hermetically sealed
which      I
          am accustomed to employ,                I
                                          found 16 hundredth parts of
of carbonic acid decomposed.     The gas which was formed attacked
mercury and oxidable bodies with extreme violence.
     If
      the oxidating portion of this gas were regarded as ozone, the
quantity of that substance would amount to 30 per cent. of the
oxygen liberated in one experiment, and up to 41 per cent. in an
other—enormous proportions, and much higher than those produced
with pure oxygen”.
   It would be very interesting to isolate the oxidating material
formed in this reaction; but when one essays to eliminate the
carbonic acid and the oxide of carbon contained in the preceding
mixture, the oxidating gas is destroyed by the reagents employed,
which does not permit            its
                               isolation. This gas might         equally       be
regarded either     oxygen very rich
