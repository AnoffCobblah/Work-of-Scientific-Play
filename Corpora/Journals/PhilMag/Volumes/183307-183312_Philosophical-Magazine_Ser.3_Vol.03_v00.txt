 I.   Observations  on the Circumstances producing Ignition in
      Charcoal in Atmospheric Temperatures.  By Mr. WILLIAM
      HADFIELD".
       HE spontaneous combustion of charcoal       under certain cir
      cumstances has been long observed, though it has not
 excited the attention which it merits; nor would it now, per
 haps, have possessed much general interest, had it not been
 for the serious consequences which may result from            occur                    its
 rence    some situations.     As large quantities      charcoal are           of
         in in
           gunpowder manufactories and                                                                its
 used                                               other works,     in

2     Mr. W. Hadfield’s             Observations                on the Circumstances
     If 20or 30 cwt. of charcoal, in a state of minute division, be
put together in a heap and left undisturbed, spontaneous com
bustion generally ensues. The fact has been long known; but
no investigation, with the exception of that to which I have
referred, has, to my knowledge, been instituted.
    Spontaneous combustion does not often take place in what
the manufacturers call round charcoal; that is to say, in frag
ments of considerable size; unless when large quantities are
laid together, under which circumstances it is not very un
usual.    In this case the phaenomenon is generally ascribed by
*
the makers to the charcoal not having been sufficiently cooled
after     its
          production. This reason                         is,   no
                                                  doubt, sometimes, but
not  always,  correct. On the       contrary,     have known charcoal,

carefully examined, perceive any indication                  when,            of   it,            at   11

   This charcoal had been made three days before the acci

     These two instances may,             I          should think,            be   accounted for
in   the following manner:—

    Inthe second instance, pressure and friction had still greater
influence. The carter, while      was loading, beat down the char

producing Ignition in Charcoal in Atmospheric Temperatures.           3
  Before    I proceed to an account of my own direct experi
ments,  I  will describe here another instance of spontaneous
combustion which occurred casually. About 2000 lbs. weight
of charcoal were loaded at Cornbrook, in the cart of Messrs.
Williamson and Co., powder-manufacturers of Fernelee,
near Buxton. The charcoal had been made several days be
fore, and had lain freely exposed to the open air.     No indica
tions of combustion could be perceived. After being taken
out of the cart at Fernelee, it was left for the night, and the
next day finely pulverized as a preparation for making gun
powder. It was then thrown into a heap; and no appearance
of a tendency to ignite ensued.       This was on the Saturday
evening; and on Sunday, the building which contained it
was observed to be on fire.      The fire must have commenced
with the  charcoal,  as every  other source of heat was carefully
excluded, on account of the gunpowder manufactory.
   These, and a number of other accidents which have arisen
from the same cause, united with the opportunities which             I
have possessed as a manufacturer of charcoal, have led me to
take particular interest in the subject.
   Colonel Aubert's paper, which        Ihave already alluded to,
and an   abridged  translation of which appeared in Dr. Brew
ster's Journal for April last (1831)*, placed the subject in so
                                   I
striking a point of view, that came to the determination of
making, for my own satisfaction, a few experiments, which            I
shall proceed to describe.
   Exp. 1.-120 pounds of charcoal, slightly pulverized, were
put into a flour-barrel, and a leaden tube, of an inch and a half
in diameter and 14 inches long, inserted in the middle, to hold
a thermometer.      The temperature of the charcoal when put
into the barrel was 60°.     In two days the charcoal acquired
a temperature of 74°; from that time the temperature gradu
ally diminished until, in two days more, it was reduced again
to 60°,-the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere.
This charcoal was rather old, having been made several weeks,
and afterwards freely exposed to the open air.
   Erp. 2.-120 pounds of fresh charcoal, pulverized as before,
were put into the vessel used in the preceding experiment.
The charcoal was then at 70°, and the surrounding air at 62°.
In 24 hours it had acquired a temperature of 90°; in 36 hours,
of 110°; and in 48 hours, of 120°: from this time the tempe
rature fell; and in 48 hours more it was down to 70°, as at the
COIn Inencement.

4.   Mr. W. Hadfield                    on the Spontaneous              Ignition of Charcoal.
     Exp.         3.-The         same quantity
                                of charcoal was taken as in the
foregoing experiments: it was quite fresh, and ground into
coarse powder. In 36 hours the temperature was 130°; it then
gradually declined to 70°, when the experiment was given up.
    From the preceding experiments I was satisfied that spon
taneous combustion would not take place in so small a quan
tity.         I
         therefore determined to make the experiment upon a
larger scale.
   Earp. 4.—10 cwt. of new charcoal was finely ground, and
put into a hogshead, with a thermometer placed, as before,in
a leaden pipe.  Several holes were bored in the sides of the
hogshead to admit the air. The charcoal when ground was
65°; and particular care was taken in examining the charcoal,
to see that it was free from ignition. It was put into the hogs
head at about 10 o'clock in the morning, at night              tempera                 its
ture had risen        90°; the following morning
                              to                           150°; and              to                   in
the afternoon       the second day the thermometer stood
                          of                                        180°.                    at
 I     was surprised       find       to           at
                                     this time that combustion had
taken place             at
                   about five      six inches from the surface, and
                                                or
about the same distance from the leaden pipe which contained
the thermometer, though the temperature,               indicated      the    as                   by
thermometer, was only 180°
                                                     to or
                                       190°.
     t  may perhaps        proper     be
                                       remark, that the combustion
always takes place near          the  surface;to or,     small charcoal      if
 at be
     laid against     wall, the combustion generally begins either
    the surface,      close   or a
                                the wall.    to
    On the 13th                of
                        October 1831, small charcoal was thrown
into      heap, which covered about
          a                                                        10

   feet deep, and contained from two             three tons      weight.
                                                                     to                     in
In 4three    days the  temperature   had increased        90°, though         to                       it
was       first only 57°, being the same
          at                                      that     the air.   Onas        of
the 19th        was 150°; and on the 20th combustion had occur

         in                                                     and the                it;
fire  was,         to   all
                   appearance, effectually extinguished; yet          the                         on
21st      was again observed              burning    to      be

   The last experiment was the most satisfactory one which
has ever come under my notice. The charcoal had been made
for      at
       least ten    twelve days before
                               or         was put together; and
had been lying, during the interval,       small heaps freely ex   in it
posed     the open air.

containing an ounce of finely pulverized charcoal. The char
coal was left to stand in the oxygen for 24 hours; and at the
expiration of that time no trace of carbonic acid was to be
found on passing the remaining gas through lime-water.
   This experiment was three times performed in the same
manner, and with precisely the same result.

 10      Mr. T. Smith             on the Muscular Structure and Functions
of tissue the capsular belt and radii surrounding it belonged,
I removed the lens from the capsule, and immersed the cap
sule attached to the radiated zone, along with the whole                                          vi
 treous humour, in boiling water.        The belt contracted both
 in length and breadth, and became white; the anterior part
 within the belt became white, but did not contract; the pos
 terior part within the belt remained transparent. The radii of
 the hyaloid zone contracted, and became white. These radii,
 therefore, and the belt around the capsule exhibit the pro
perties of muscular tissue.
    Assuming the muscularity of the capsule and hyaloid zone
as declared by the test, it remains to try whether such a struc
ture in action is capable of performing the function of adjust
ment, as it is found to be performed, in the perfect eye.
    The function of the muscular belt around the capsule is
made sufficiently evident by        effects      its
                                              the figure           on

when plunged         boiling water; but the function
                        in                                   the radii            of
 of  the zone around the capsule can only            understood             be                    by
attending      the fixed points towards which their contraction
                  to
must carry their extremities.         have stated above, that these
                                                    I
fixed points correspond        the position    the ciliary ligament.of
                                        of to                  of            of
Hence the contraction         that  part    each      the radii that
lies between the capsule and the ligament must draw the cir
cumference       the capsule towards the ligament, and increase
                   of
the diameter           of
                   the lens.   The function     the radii, therefore,of
is  antagonist     thatto          of
                           the belt.

distances. Sir David Brewster* employs this argument suc
cessfully against the hypothesis that the eyeball is lengthened,
or the convexity of the cornea increased, to accommodate the
eye to near objects.     It is of equal force against the supposition
that the lens is drawn forward by any means; for this would
move the centre of the lens, and consequently the optical cen
tre of the eye, forward,       an occurrence which the apparent
stability of stationary objects out of the axis of vision during
the adjustment, disproves beyond any doubt.

   3rd. All anatomists agree that in young eyes the lens is
entirely soft and pulpy; whereas in old eyes, which of course
have been often adjusted to near objects, it is firmer, and has
a hard nucleus at the centre.     In the foetal calf and lamb                                                 I
have found the whole lens so fluid that it formed the capsule
into the figure of a globule.   In very young calves, lambs and
rabbits, after birth, the consistence was firmer, but still pulpy
throughout; but in old cows, sheep, &c. the central part con
stituted a nucleus hard or firm enough to retain any form
given to     it.   this respect, therefore, observation also agrees
                     In
with the   theory.

            regret that it is not in my power to try the question
by means of polarized light; for it would be highly interesting
to know whether the want of symmetry of structure of the cry
stalline lens of fishes, observed by Sir David Brewster on ex
posing it in different positions to polarized light, was owing
to the hardest or densest part lying nearer to the more con.
vex surface than to the other, and whether the ratio of the
difference could be found in that way.

                                                        to                                                   is
situated near the summit         the Cronebane mountain,

compact clay-slate, and the metallic veins that occur            this                                 in
and other mines             on

poraneous formation; the veins being interstratified with the
laminae composing the rock, and conformable with                 dip                            it

 the interesting phaenomenon is observable of regular alterna
 tions  of granite and mica slate.
    The lode on which the experiment was           made is very large,
and    appears    to be more     distinctly defined than most of the
others.      It consists principally of clay and soft clay-slate and
friable quartz, through which the ores (chiefly gray copper-ore
with some mundic, and a small portion of yellow copper-ore,)
traverse in various directions in thick ribs and bunches, the
continuous direction of which I could not satisfactorily ascer
tain.    The experiment was made on this lode in a level about
25 fathoms from the surface, driven about 8 fathoms in a
south-west direction from the shaft.         The galvanometer being
fixed in the level about 4 fathoms in that direction from the
shaft, the end of one wire was placed against the ore ground
in the “end” or extremity of the level about 4 fathoms further
in the same direction, the other end of it being placed in the
western receptacle of the instrument.            The end of another
wire was placed against a mass of ore near the shaft; and on
inserting the opposite extremity of it in the eastern recep
tacle, it had the effect of repelling the north end of the needle
towards the west, showing the wire in the western receptacle
to be negative, and the other of course positive.          The oscil
lations of the needle reached about 18°.

IV.    On the Electro-magnetism of Veins of Copper-Ore in       Corn
                    wall.   By Mr. JoHN BENNETTs.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       Gentlemen,
              the discovery of electrical currents in the    mines  of
SINCE Cornwall, by Mr. R. W. Fox, the galvanometer           has been
applied to veins in various copper-mines with more or less
effect.
    In  my experiments the electro-galvanic action has borne
some    proportion    to the quantity of copper-ore in those parts
of the vein with which the wires of the galvanometer have been
brought into contact.
    When the vein produces but little copper-ore, I have found
but little action; but my experiments have not been suffi
ciently numerous to lay down a rule as to the -relation ex
    Third    Series. Vol. 3. No. 13. July 1833.

isting between the intensity of electrical action and the quan
tity of the ores in the vein.
    But a series of electro-galvanic experiments on metalliferous
veins is greatly to be desired; and to show my willingness to
contribute, I beg leave to annex the following Experiment:-
    At Wheal Vyvyan Mine near Helston in this county, in the
present month, I applied one wire of the galvanometer to a
productive part of the vein 20 fathoms below the adit; the
 other wire to the same vein 10 fathoms below this level,—thus
 leaving 60 feet in depth between the plates connecting the
 wires with the vein. The action on the magnetic needle was
 considerable; it passed over an arc of 15 degrees, the lower
 part of the vein being negative to the upper part.
     There are some peculiarities in the formation of this lode
 or vein which are not unworthy of the attention of the geolo
 gist.    It is in some places 20 feet wide in granite strata. A
 great part of the vein is also composed of granite mixed with
 quartz and fluor. The more productive part of the vein is from
 3 to 6 feet in width, and composed of arsenical pyrites, fluor,
 yellow sulphuret of copper, and tin; the tin and copper being
 so intimately mixed in the same stone, as not to be separated
 without being first pulverized, roasted, and washed; the pro
 portion of copper to tin in the vein stones being as 5 to 1 in
 weight. The lode underlies north, about 4 feet in a fathom,
  and its direction is east and west.

     To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
         Gentlemen,
     Tis within these few days that         I
                                       read by accident in your
    Journal the letter I sent to Mr.  Faraday; and feel much        I
obliged to him for the kind manner in which he noticed it”.
 The same experiment has with equal success been performed
in France by a single powerful magnet: those that made use          I
 of were of the smallest description, yet the wire was of con
                                        I
siderable length. Shortly after sent that letter, made a con   I
siderable improvement in the apparatus, by connecting a soft
iron ring to the wire, which became momentarily a magnet, and
in    its
       turn reacted     the wire, and caused
                                on            very considerable

            my former communication on this subject,              have            I
  procured     a prismatic bar of gold of the standard quality
used in British coinage, and have found the modulus of elasti
city in one direction to be 12,226,000 pounds, and in the other
direction 11,955,000,—the mean of the two is 12,110,500
pounds; from which the height of the modulus will be found
about 1,480,000 feet. The additional height of the modulus
of coinage gold above that of pure gold is less than I expected;
it agrees, however, very nearly with the calculated modulus, as
deduced from the proportioned modulus of gold and                alloy.        its

of moist carbonic acid gas on granite, as exemplified in the
volcanic districts of Auvergne.     Basaltic rocks were likewise
prone to decomposition, partly in consequence of containing
felspar, and partly from the protoxide of iron of the augite or
hornblende which enters into their composition.           The pas
sage of the iron into a higher degree of oxidation was due
to atmospheric oxygen applied in a liquid state to the rock
through the medium of water. It was probable that carbonic
acid likewise co-operated;—that, as in the rusting of iron, a
carbonate of the protoxide was first generated, which subse
quently passed into the hydrated peroxide of iron.
    The rocks in which these changes occurred, underwent a
total alteration both in their mechanical state and in chemical
constitution.    Their tenacity was so entirely destroyed, that
the slightest force, a shower or the breeze, sufficed to over
come the cohesion of their particles.       The alkali of the fel
spar was entirely washed away, and an earthy mixture, com
bined with water, remained. The ochreous tint of decom
 posed basalt and greenstone sufficiently indicated that their
iron had passed into a higher state of oxidation; but felspar
 often left a perfectly white earth, the small portions of iron
 and manganese contained in the original rock having been
 removed, probably in the state of carbonate, during the pro
 gress of disintegration.    These changes constituted one of the
 great sources of the alkalies present in springs and in the soil;
 and the alkaline matter of the nitrates of potash and soda,
 generated so abundantly in parts of India and America, had
 probably the same origin.       They likewise accounted for the
 connexion observed between the agricultural character of the
 soil of certain districts, and the rocks from which it was de
 rived. The decomposition of granitic rocks led to deposites of
 clay and sand, which were too entirely free from each other
 and from lime to be suitable for the growth of plants; while
  the earth derived from most basaltic rocks was an intimate
 mixture of argillaceous, siliceous, and calcareous matter, in
 proportions peculiarly favourable to vegetation.
     II. Deposites from Aqueous Solution of Substances commonly
  considered insoluble.—The lecturer next discussed the second
  branch of his subject, referring more especially to siliceous de
  positions; such as flint, calcedony, and rock crystal. Many
  circumstances, he remarked, proved the fact that silica very
  frequently existed in solution.   Mineral waters, he said, com
  monly contained silica:—chemists,      indeed, frequently over
  looked it in their   analyses; but when carefully sought for, it
  might in most instances be detected.      It was constantly con

 tained in the sap of certain plants, if not in all.     For it was
 shown  by  the late Sir H.  Davy  that silex is contained in grass,
 and in the epidermis  of reeds,  corn, canes, and of hollow plants
 in general. The existence of silex in the sap of the bamboo was
 not only attested by               its
                            flinty epidermis, but      the siliceous           by

are inappreciably soluble in one state, may be freely dissolved

while in the nascent state, it was freely dissolved.         Substances
in the act of being formed from their elements, or of separa
ting from previously existing combinations, do not possess that
force of aggregation which properly belongs to them, and in
such states of transition they have a peculiar aptitude to com
bine with other bodies. This property is observed more or less

26              Report    of Dr. Turner's Lecture
Hence the quantity of silica          carried   off in solution       was
enormous.
     The lecturer then went on to explain how it happened that
silica, existing in solution, was deposited so as to constitute
minerals. One obvious principle, he stated, was the molecular
attraction which exists between similar particles of matter, as
was proved by facts without number.              Its existence was at
tested by the globular form assumed by water, oil, mercury,
and other liquids;–by the separation from one another of
salts in crystallizing out of mixed solutions;–by the formation
of crystals during the slow deposition of vapour, as when cam
phor was subliming slowly in a glass bottle, the particles at
taching themselves to one another rather than spreading uni
formly over the surface on which they collect;-and by the
tendency of like molecules to get together and cohere while
intermixed with a mass of dissimilar matter rendered liquid
by heat, as when particles of titanium, diffused in a furnace
through a mass of iron, seek out each other and form regular
crystals, or when minerals crystallize out of melted lava or
basalt. So from solutions of silex, whether strong or dilute,
the particles are disposed to adhere together whenever they
cease to remain in solution.
    Another principle applicable to this question, was the fol
lowing: Whenever substances, insoluble in their ordinary state,
were dissolved by the force of favourable circumstances, such
 solutions were very prone to decomposition.             They formed
 instances of peculiarly unstable equilibrium.            The slightest
 disturbing causes,—as agitation, change of temperature, or the
affinity, though slight, of some other body for the solvent, would
in such cases put an end to the solution. Illustrative examples
 of this principle were afforded by solutions of tin, titanium,
 and peroxide of iron in a neutral state.          He might probably
 quote albuminous solutions as an instance from the animal
kingdom. Water cooled carefully below           its usual point  ofcon
 gelation, and saturated solutions        Glauber's salt, were liquids
                                          of
in  which  a  similar instability    ofequilibrium was conspicuous.
 The lecturer, illustration, here showed two solutions
                in                                              ofGlau
ber's salt:—he     explained    that the mere   pressure   ofthe atmo
 sphere   on removing the cork,       or the slightest agitation, often
 caused such solutions      to become solid; and that when these
failed, the introduction     of  asolid body, especially   a  crystal   of
                         any             having
             salt,
                     or
Glauber's            of      substance            even a feeble affinity
for the salt   or   its
                     solvent,--such   as
                                      a     globule   of
                                                       air or  carbonic
acid gas, generally determined immediate crystallization. The
solutions on the lecture-table retained their form after removal

                             on the Chemistry                  of Geology.                                   27
of the cork and after gentle agitation:                                       one   of them instantly
became solid on the introduction of a glass tube; and the other
bore the introduction of the tube, but crystallized instantly
when a globule of air from the lungs was blown through the
tube. The principle elucidated by these facts was, he said,
directly applicable to his argument. A solution of silica oozing
slowly into the cavities of a porous or cellular rock, might
yield a deposite as a consequence of evaporation, of a slight
affinity between the silica and some substance with which it
accidentally came into contact, or of the solvent power of an
alkali which had contributed to          solution being lessened by
                                                              its

taining lime, strontia, and baryta.        He showed a specimen
of red oxide of iron possessed of a stalactitic form decisive of
aqueous origin; and oxide of manganese, he said, sometimes
occurred in a similar state.       He considered such specimens
to have been originally deposited in the state of carbonates,
out of solutions of carbonic acid, and to have been sub
sequently still further oxidized,—a change which he illustra
ted by a specimen of carbonate of manganese kindly given
to him by Mr. Phillips, in which the progress of conversion
was distinctly exhibited.      He also suggested a possible ex
planation of the origin of the pyrites so often found in fossil
shells imbedded in clay which abounds in nodular pyrites. It
had been observed that sulphates undergo gradual decom
position by the action of organic matter; and he thought it
therefore far from improbable that sulphate of iron, generated
from oxidized pyrites, might by the deoxidizing agency of
animal remains be reconverted into sulphuret.

appears, that previous        the year 1821, Mr. W. Forster was
                                       to

are not interstratified with the encrinal limestone (see Sections

Dyke was      continuation
               a                the Ninety-fathom Dyke,

  mass, large rhomboidal crystals, similar to the Dufton spar, of
  a pale azure blue, were detected: these, however, were of rare
  occurrence.      That sulphate of barytes once covered the lime
  stone at the old quarries is evident from patches left on the
  cliffs not worked away, but which being far out of reach, were
  mistaken for the remains of a bed of white limestone. Bo
  tryoidal heavy spar, of a flesh-red colour, was some years since
  found in the interstices of the rough partially crystalline
  magnesian limestone at Man Haven, on the coast of Durham
  near Whitburn, by the Rev. Mr. Abbs; but believe that an                                                         I

                  hear, have been found in the Whitley Quarries;
  and small brilliant crystals of blend I have seen in the dyke,
  on the sea-shore, where the soft yellow sandstone, first de
  scribed as underlying the magnesian limestone, appears in the
  cliffs on the north side of the dyke at Cullercoates; and after
  passing under the village of Whitley, may be seen at                                                                                                                                                                    its

which corroborates the conclusion he had stated in a former commu
nication “On the extensive atmosphere of Mars”,” namely, that no
indication now existed of any atmosphere being attached to that
planet.    A star retained                     its
                                   light blue colour, and         full brilliancy                     its
and comparative steadiness, till the very instant                occultation                  of   its                       by
Mars.        At     its
                 emersion     was seen nearly dichotomized. The author
                                         it
concludes, that either some physical change has occurred                       the                                    in

tendant on the different modes in which electricity has been excited
and supplied. Thus no difference was found to exist in the mode in
which a Leyden battery charged with ordinary electricity, and a vol
taic battery, were discharged, when the comparison was made by
means of fine points, nicely arranged and approximated, either through
air of the ordinary temperature, or through heated air, such as the
flame of a spirit-lamp, interposed between the points.
    By the term current, the author designates any progressive change,
of whatever nature it may be, in the electric state, whether consisting
in the motion of one electric fluid in a particular direction, or of two
fluids in contrary directions: and by the term arrangement, he under
stands a local adjustment of particles, or fluids, or forces, not pro
 gressive.
     By ordinary electricity, he understands that which can be obtained
 from the common electrical machine, or from the atmosphere, or by
 pressure, or cleavage of crystals, or similar mechanical operations;
 its character being that         great intensity, and the exertion
                                          of                                 attrac                        of

suggests doubts of the soundness of the inferences he draws from his
experiments”.
    The author then proceeds to examine the electrical phaenomena
elicited by magneto-electricity, and shows that, as far as they have
been observed, they coincide with those of voltaic electricity, and,
consequently, are referrible to the same agency. The only effects that
have not yet been obtained are chemical decompositions. The quan
tities of thermo-electricity that can be elicited in ordinary cases are
too small to produce any effects but those of magnetism, and also
muscular contractions in the limbs of frogs. The animal electricity
of the torpedo produces most of the effects of voltaic electricity, ex
cepting the evolution of heat and light. The general conclusion de
duced by the author from these researches          that electricity, what                is,
ever       be   its
            source,   perfectly identical

motion, these muscles being subservient to those functions of life
which require that combined influence; that the manner in which
the influence of these organs affects the muscular fibre is not essen
tially different from that of other stimulants and sedatives; and that
this influence is not an agent peculiar to the nervous system, but is
capable of existing elsewhere, and is consequently not a vital power,
properly so called; a conclusion which appears to him to be confirm

this highly useful appropriation of his leisure moments, has aug
mented those claims upon our gratitude which he had established by
many acts of good fellowship, and the devotion of his time and talents
to Our Cause.
   Through the early investigations of William Smith, the oolitic series
was divided into sub-formations; and, by the subsequent adoption of
these subdivisions by Conybeare, their provincial names have become
classic throughout Europe, and have served to commemorate the
discernment of him who first taught us to identify strata by their
organic remains.
    At the last anniversary it was announced that, with entire confi
dence in his qualifications, your Council had fixed upon Mr. Lons
dale to commence a task, the prosecution of which they conceived
to be strictly consonant to the spirit of the bequest of the lamented
Wollaston; by which we are endowed with the means of rewarding
those who enlarge the circle of geological knowledge.        Mr. Lonsdale
has presented us with the result of his labours, having laid down upon
maps of the Ordnance Survey the range of different members of the
oolite, from the neighbourhood of Bath, where he had previously de
veloped their relations, to the southern limits of Warwickshire and
Oxfordshire. The success attendant upon this undertaking has already
been made apparent in the maps, sections, and remarks of our Curator.
By these you will perceive he has already demonstrated that the upper
shale and marl-stone of the lias, which are only visible as mere beds
in the neighbourhood of Bath, swell out rapidly in their north-eastern
course, and soon assume the same characters which Mr. Phillips has
assigned to them in Yorkshire.       He next establishes that the whole
of the fine-grained white oolite in the escarpment of the Cotteswold
Hills, although lithologically undistinguishable from the great oolite
of Bath, is only an expansion of the inferior oolite. It is then made
apparent that the Fuller's earth disappears entirely to the north of
Gloucestershire; and the highest degree of interest is added to these
groups, by determining, for the first time, the true position of the
Stonesfield slate, which he shows to be the base of the great oolite;
thus removing it from the geological horizon, in which, from the
obscure sections at Stonesfield, it had before been placed. Such
are a few of the evidences of the good already derived from the re
vision of this series of our formations by a geologist like Mr.
Lonsdale, who, to the eye of an unerring observer, adds the rare
qualifications of a thorough acquaintance with specific distinctions in
organic remains.
    But the value of such a work is not to be measured by reference
 to English geology alone; for, if it be now ascertained that the oolitic
 groups are made up of members which inosculate with each other,
 expanding to vast thicknesses, or thinning out entirely, within the
 limited range of two counties; and that even      itsprincipal formations
 cannot  be followed into Yorkshire, still less
                                              to  Brora and the Hebrides,
 without exhibiting great changes       their mineral and fossil contents;
                                       in
 we can scarcely hope      identify each subordinate member

 country with the subdivisions    ofthe serieson the continent      Europe.
I  willingly express this opinion, although may seem
                                            it            to   beslightlyat

variance with a surmise I ventured to advance last year respecting the
age of the lithographic stone of Solenhofen.              That comparison was
intended simply to afford the English geologist an approximate idea
of the age of a rock, which, by some of my countrymen, had been
considered as of tertiary origin, by others, as belonging to the green
sand; so that if my rough estimate should prove less accurate than
that of a distinguished Prussian *, who has since compared it with the
coral rag, I shall still feel satisfied in having first pointed out to the
English inquirer, that the Solenhofen slate is a member of the                                  Ju
rassic or oolitic system, and that, from the general similarity of many
of the organic remains, such as Pterodactyli, Crustaceae, and certain
plants, it is probably the equivalent of the Stonesfield slate, or one
of the central and slaty members of this complex series. On a broad
                               I
scale, however, feel persuaded, that a simple division into “upper”
and “ lower” oolitic systems is the full extent to which we can bring
continental and British formations of this age under comparison.
   To Dr. Fitton we are indebted for his “ Notes on the Progress of
Geology,” in which the relative merits of the founders of the science
in England are well put forth; and also for his “Geological Sketch
of the Vicinity of Hastings,” a most valuable addition to those local
monographs which contribute so largely to the diffusion of precise
information.              I
                      rejoice to see this powerful geologist once more be
fore us as an author, and still more when it is announced, in this last
useful work, that a series of figures, including               the undescribedall

  In    the communication explanatory of these coloured maps, <U+017F> hope
to   prove  that the old red sandstone, with few exceptions, passes
down into, and is conformable to, those rocks, to which we have been
accustomed to apply the term “Transition;” and that, throughout great
areas, the old red sandstone is equally conformable to the overlying
carboniferous limestone as to the underlying grauwacke;—that the
fossiliferous grauwacke is divided into a number of large natural for
mations or groups, charged with a variety of organic remains, for the
most part undescribed. In tracing the lines of disturbance which
have affected these deposits, flexures upon a gigantic scale will be
pointed out, whereby the old red sandstone has been thrown into
basins of elevation, and, by a reversed inclination, extended to the
westward, far within the escarpment of the grauwacke; and these lines
of disturbance and elevation will then be delineated, and their re
lation traced to ridges of intrusive rocks.
    Whatever merit these observations may possess, they cannot but
derivevalue from being linked with the contemporaneous investigations
of Professor Sedgwick, amid the adjoining regions of grauwacke,
slate, and older rocks of the Welsh mountains.
    This will become evident when the Professor shall exhibit to you
the directions of those extensive anticlinal and synclinal lines which
he has determined with much personal labour, though unaided by
good geographical data. It will then be shown by him at what pe.
riods igneous action has been in operation within these older rocks;
whilst it will be my province to point out how these outbursts have
 been succeeded, on the eastern frontiers of the principality, by other
 linear, submarine eruptions, and to describe the effects produced by
 them upon the different sedimentary strata.
    These results must, however, only be viewed as the first attempts,
 on the part of Professor Sedgwick and myself, to reduce to chrono
 logical order a vast succession of ancient deposits, which have hitherto
 been much neglected in this country, on account, as we may suppose,
 of the alleged obscurity of their organic remains, and still more, per
 haps, in consequence of their altered condition, due to the numerous
 convulsions to which they have been subjected.
    IRELAND.—We have been favoured with two communications upon
 the geological structure of parts of the North of Ireland, illustrated by
 excellent maps, constructed by the authors. In one of these, Mr. A.
 Bryce, of Belfast, describes the north-eastern portion of Antrim, in
 which he points out a much larger extent of mica schist than had
 been noticed by former observers. These primary rocks are succeeded,
 in ascending order, by ancient red conglomerates, partial carbonife
 rous deposits, new red sandstone, lias, greensand, and chalk.          He
 mentions porphyry as only associated with the older red sandstone;
 and basalt, as overlying the chalk,  all the important peculiarities   of
 which have been   so  well detailedby  Conybeare and Buckland.
    The other Memoir upon Ireland        isfrom the pen   of   Archdeacon
 Verschoyle, and  is  much more comprehensive, describing the north
  west coastof   Mayo and Sligo.    The accompanying map     is   of consi
 derable value, the geographical features having been obtained from

the more so, as his inferences are interwoven with theories of the

from, bear a strong analogy to existing species, the brown coal of
the Rhine is probably of the age of the lacustrine limestone of
Aix en Provence.
   Mr. Horner further throws new light upon the period of the tra
chytic and basaltic eruptions of the Sieben-gebirge, which, like many
volcanic hills in central France, he supposes to have burst forth
from beneath an ancient lake; and whilst he indicates that this ridge
has been elevated posterior to the formation of the associated brown
coal, he shows that one of the lake-craters on the opposite bank of
the Rhine, the Rodderberg, was formed during a more recent period,
probably contemporaneous with the accumulation of the loess or loamy
alluvium.
   We are here naturally led to reflect upon that exciting theoretical
question concerning craters of elevation, which now divides the geo
logists of France and Germany. In France, De Beaumont, Dufrénoy,
and others, contend for the establishment of the views of Von Buch
and Humboldt, which refer the crateriform cavities to simple expan
sion of the earth's crust, caused by intumescence from within; whilst
Cordier and Constant Prevost maintain that all these ancient cones
and craters present in their structure a direct analogy to the products
of modern volcanic agency, and have been similarly formed.
   M. Constant Prevost is preparing an account of his late voyage in
the Mediterranean, by which he hopes to convince us, that                        the                 all
most ancient geological phaenomena,               igneous characters, can alone

      UNITED STATEs.-Though this be not the occasion on which I may
   dilate upon the productions and discoveries of our foreign contempo

  true principles, rises steadily in public estimation. A Geological
  Society is formed at Philadelphia, which commencing energetically
  in the collection of specimens, and inviting descriptive sections
  from        all
            parts     Pennsylvania, shows how effectually the intelligence
                              of

strata of similar red colours reappear at intervals throughout the

the new red sandstone by the presence of salt; since it is now demon

suing summer.
   If we turn from these hitherto neglected western regions and
transport ourselves to the eastern shores, who does not perceive that
we are there without any complete history of the crag and younger
deposits 2 The works of Mr. R. C.Taylor and others, though excellent
in their respective districts, are not of general application; and inge
nious as are the views of Professor Lyell, they are only drawn from
those parts of the coast which have fallen under his own observation.
   Let me, therefore, entreat you to wipe away this imperfection from
our system, and to endeavour to establish demarcations as clear as
our fellow-labourers in France have done for the deposits of this
age, by working out the whole extent of the crag, and the precise na
ture of         its
             upper limits: also                     by

   Feb. 12 (continued).-With this (Dr. Weatherhead's) communi
cation M. Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire was only partially acquainted, by
the extracts from it given by Mr. Owen (with some observations
upon them,) as an Appendix to...his Paper on the Mammary Glands
of the Ornithorhynchus paradoxus, published in the Philosophical
Transactions for 1832: he requests to have a literal copy of the
communication.
    He recalls attention to the history of our knowledge of the sexual
organs of Ornithorhynchus; refers to M. Meckel's discovery of a
gland, situated under the integuments of the abdomen of the female,
and considered by him as mammary, and to his own subsequent ob
servations on this subject, in which these glands are regarded as
analogous to the structure that surrounds the true mammary glands
of the Shrews; and hints at the probability that M. Meckel may
not, in 1833, entertain the same ideas which he expressed in 1826.
M. Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire repeats some of the most striking pecu
liarities of the organs of reproduction: 1, the existence of a uterus
and vagina in a state of atrophy, which he has repeatedly represented
under the name of a little indistinct organ, the utero-vaginal canal;
2, the non-continuity of the urinary bladder to the ureters; 3, the
interposition, when in action, of the genital organ between the folds,
&c.; and, referring to his published accounts of the sexual anomaly
in    all   its
           details, reproduces the conclusion      which   has been led      to        he

    Feb. 26.—A specimen was exhibited of a Seal, presented to the
Society by Mr. Henry Reynolds. It was obtained by that gentleman
from a native of New Holland, who stated that he brought it from the
interior of the country adjoining the settlement of New South Wales.
The marine habits of the animal (a species of Arctocephalus, and most
probably the Otaria Peronii, Desm.) render this statement problema
tical. Should it be correct, it would seem to indicate the existence of
salt water in large masses at a distance remote from the coast.
    A specimen was exhibited of the Carolina Cuckoo, Coccyzus Caroli
mensis, Bon., which was killed in the last autumn in the preserves of
Lord Cawdor in Wales: it was communicated for exhibition by His
Lordship.      Two instances of the occurrence of a bird of the same
species   in Ireland have been recorded.
    Dr. Grant called the attention of the Society to a specimen of a
Cephalopod, forming part of his own collection, which he exhibited in
illustration of a paper “On the Zoological Characters of the Genus
Loligopsis, Lam., and Account of a New Species from the Indian
Ocean.”
    Mr. Yarrell read a Paper “On the Laws which regulate the Changes
of Plumage in Birds.”
    March 12.—A letter was read, addressed to the Vice-Secretary by
M. Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire, For. Memb. Z.S., and dated Paris, March
5, 1833. It acknowledges the receipt of the copy of the letter of Lieut.
the Honourable Lauderdale Maule to Dr. Weatherhead respecting
the Ornithorhynchus, and states that the writer has proposed a system
calculated to put an end to the controversy respecting these animals.
This system is contained in a “Memoir on the Abdominal Glands of
the Ornithorhynchus, falsely presumed to be mammary, but which
secrete, not milk, but mucus, destined for the first nutriment of the
young, when newly hatched,” published in the “Gazette Medicale,'
under the date of Feb. 18th. A copy of the Memoir was laid on the
table, and an abstract of it was read.
    M. Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire translates the whole of Lieut. Maule's
letter, and quotes also Mr. Owen's observations on the Mammary
glands of Echidna, from the Proceedings of the Committee of Science
and Correspondence.         He then enters into some details on the history
of our  knowledge    of the Monotremata, and on the various opinions which
have been held     respecting  their mode of generation, and the nutrition
of their   young.    Recurring   to the very curious observation of Lieut.
Maule, he admits the effusion of a fluid of a milky appearance, but he
doubts that this fluid was actually milk. “To arrive so rapidly at this
decision,” he proceeds, “many impossibilities must have been for
gotten.     You have not the function, nor the result of the function
which characterizes the Mammalia, if the organs that produce it are
truly wanting.      Now this is what I think I can demonstrate; and
what I undertake to do in the following remarks.
    “For this purpose I seek for analogous facts; and they have long
since been furnished to me by the Shrews. There are on each side
of the bodies of these animals two kinds of glands arranged parallel
to each other, 1st, Internally, conglobate and truly lactiferous glands,

of the known structure: 2ndly, Externally, an apparatus formed of
caca, furnished with some membranous and diaphragmatic frana, and
with many cellulosities. This apparatus, in the young state and during
the inactivity of the sexual organ, consists only of a longitudinal projec
tion without distinct characters; but during the season of sexual ex
citement, this projection becomes enlarged and is visibly surmounted
on its internal surface by a multitude of small parallel casca, dissemi
nated over and attached to the glandular body, like the bristles upon
a brush. These caca open on the projection made by the gland, which
on its tegumentary surface has but a single excretory orifice. The
secretion consists of a mucus possessing a very powerful odour.
                    >k    >k     >k    >k    >k      :k
   “The epigastric artery is divided into two principal branches; one
passing towards the median line to supply the mammary glands; the
other ramifying externally and performing the same function with re
gard to the odoriferous glands. The same structure exactly is presented
by the ventral glands of the Ornithorhynchus, two characters excepted,
which do not militate against the determination and analogy assigned
to them : viz. a much more extensive development, and two secretory
orifices instead of one, as in the Shrews. I explain this difference by
the atrophy and entire suppression of the internal epigastric branch.
This branch being annihilated, there is no formative vessel, and con
sequently no apparatus produced,—no mammary gland; but, on the
other hand, the whole arterial alimentation passing more excentrically
by means of the single terminal branch, the apparatus to which this
branch is distributed is proportionally enlarged. This shows why and
how the odoriferous glands have reached, in the Monotremata, their
maximum of development. Where the apparatus becomes more con
siderable, the function is so much the more powerful, and the mucus
secreted must in fact exist in such quantity in the Monotremata, that
its effusion may become a fact susceptible of observation.
   “I   should not be surprised, if this mucus, more abundant and more
substantial in the Monotremata, became the nutriment of the young
after their hatching.     The Monotremata would act, in this respect,
like some aquatic birds which conduct their young after hatching to
the water, and assist them in their substantation.        The maternal in
stinct would lead the female Ornithorhynchus to effect the contraction
of the gland, which is possible by the efforts of the panniculus carnosus
and the great oblique muscle, between the fibres of which the gland is
seated, and thus to procure for the young, at several periods of the day,
by way of nutriment, an abundant supply of mucus. If this education is
carried on in the water, where we know, by the history of the generation
of frogs and the nutrition of their tadpoles, that the mucus combines
with the ambient medium, becomes thick, and supplies an excellent
nutriment for the early age of these reptiles, we shall understand the
utility of the ventral glands of the Ornithorhynchus, as furnishing a
source of nutriment for the young of these animals, for young ovipara
newly hatched. When we meet with such curious organic conditions,
we do not attempt, by a truly retrograde march, to throw back well
 averred differential facts, decidedly acquired to science, by means of

 64                            Žoological Society.
 a forced assimilation, among other facts peculiar to the class of Mam
 malia; but on the contrary we are under the necessity of placing the
 Monotremata further within the limits of oviparous animals.

     “At the other extremity of the scale of beings, where the fishes are
  placed, we meet with a gland secreting mucus, extending along the
  sides from the head to the tail.    Ascending the scale, we see it sepa
  rate into fractions; some Reptiles, and among others the Salamanders,
  have it large and forming a continuous band, as in Fishes: we have
  said in what state it is found in the Monotremata.”
     In a postscript, dated February 19th, M. Geoffroy states that at a
  Meeting of the Academie des Sciences on the previous day, M. de
  Blainville had read a paper, in which he maintained his former opinions
  on the subject of the Monotremata,         and supported the views of
  Mr. Owen. He states that some contradictions and physiological
  impossibilities contained in it had been noticed by MM. Duméril and
  Serres, in the course of the discussion, but does not enter into any
  details.
     The reading having been concluded of the abstract of the views
  proposed by M. Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire in the memoir submitted,
  Mr. Owen addressed the Society on its subject. The following is an
  outline of his observations.
     When the glands in question were first detected by M. Meckel,
 that eminent anatomist at once regarded them as mammary. M. Geof
 froy-Saint-Hilaire objected to this mode of viewing them, that their
  structure is not conglomerate, like that of mammary glands, but
 lobed and consisting of numerous casca, resembling the structure which
 he has described as existing in the odoriferous glands which surround
 the mamma of the Shrews; hence he concluded that their function is
 similar to that of the corresponding organs, as he considered them, in
 these little animals, namely, to secrete an odorous substance for the
 purpose of attracting the other sex in the season of heat.         M. von
 Baer subsequently proved that it is incorrect to assume that a mam
 mary gland must necessarily be conglomerate, by showing that these
 organs in the Cetacea consisted of simple caeca, a structure even less
 complicated than that demonstrated in Ornithorhynchus at a later pe
 riod, by Mr. Owen.        During his investigation of the structure of
 these glands Mr. Owen proved, by comparing their condition with the
state of the sexual organs in several individuals which he examined,
that they correspond in the phases of their development with the true
mammary glands, their greatest size being attained when the ovaries
appear to have recently parted with their contents. The fact of their
development being at     its maximum          at
                                            about the time              of
                                                                the birth        of
the young, evidentlyindicating the connexion             of
                                                    their function with this
period, M. Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire       first conjectured that they might
                                         at
secrete the earthy matter       the egg-shell, (see
                               of                      60,) with which

conceives the young    as to provided when brought into the world; but
this may  be   regarded    improbable, the tubes, (upwards

 as to be evidently adapted for carrying fluids. M. Geoffroy-Saint
 Hilaire's subsequent and most recent opinion is that they secrete
 mucus, which being squeezed out by the mother in the water, be
 comes thereby thickened, and adapted for the aliment of the young;
 but Mr. Owen remarked that as he had shown that similar glands exist
 in Echidna, animals inhabiting sandy places, and unfitted for going
 into the water, such cannot be their use in Echidna at least, and it
 may therefore be concluded that such is not their use in Ornitho
 rhynchus.
    Mr. Owen added, that he had purposely limited his observations
 on the present occasion to the theories propounded by M. Geoffroy
 Saint-Hilaire respecting the uses of the abdominal glands of Orni
 thorhynchus. Lest, however, it should be inferred from his silence as
 to the other views advanced by that distinguished zoologist in the
 two communications recently laid before the Society, that he coin
 cided in them, he thought it necessary to remark that he was by no
 means disposed to admit their general correctness.

 Society, by Charles Telfair, Esq., Corr. Memb. Z.S., and dated Port

  The exhibition was resumed of Mr. Cuming's shells, accompanied
by characters from the pen of Mr. G. B. Sowerby: the following
are the names of the species exhibited on the present occasion. CU
MINg1A     (a new genus, which should be placed near to Amphidesma)
mutica, lamellosa,     coarctata, and trigonularis; CoRBULA nuciformis,
(found at a depth of six fathoms in sandy mud at Real Llejos, Cen
tral America, and also in a fossil state near Guayaquil,) bicarinata,
biradiata, nasuta, ovulata, radiata, and tenuis; BULINUs Chilensis,
punctulifer, rugiferus, pruinosus, Laurentii, unifasciatus, bilineatus,
corneus, erythrostoma, and chrysalidiformis.
    At the request of the President, Mr. Gould exhibited a specimen of
a Toucan, remarkable for the peculiar form of the feathers on the back
part of the head and cheeks.            They are without barbs towards
their extremities, the shafts being widely expanded; those of the
crown of the head are curled and horn-like, and, being of a jet black
colour, bear some resemblance to fine ebony shavings; as they pro
ceed along the neck they become straighter, narrower, and spatulate:
the feathers of the cheeks have the latter form, and are straw-coloured
slightly tipped with black. Mr. Gould proposed for it the name of
PTERoGLossus ulocomus.
    March 26.—Specimens were exhibited of numerous Mammalia re
 cently obtained by the Society from that part of California which
adjoins to Mexico. They comprehended several species hitherto ap
parently undescribed, to which the attention of the Meeting was
particularly called by Mr.Bennett, who characterized them as follows:
MEPHITIs nasuta ; DIDELPHIs Californica, and breviceps; SPERMo
PHILUs spilosoma, and macrourus; Sciurus nigrescens; and LEPUs ni
gricaudatus. Mr. Bennett concluded by calling the attention of the
 Society to two skins forming part of the same collection, which, not
 withstanding their marked difference in fur and colour from an arctic
 specimen of the Meles Labradoria, Sabine, he felt disposed to con
 sider as referrible to that species.      They accord sufficiently with the
 Tlacoyotl of Hernandez.
    A specimen was exhibited of a species of Sepiola from the Mauri
 tius, which had been presented to the Society by Charles Telfair,
 Esq., Corr. Memb. Z.S., and Dr. Grant explained                    its

bone of a gigantic species of Scarus.
    The exhibition of Mr. Cuming's Shells was resumed, the following
new species among them being characterized by Mr. Broderip and
Mr. G. B. Sowerby; the former premising that the innumerable
varieties presented by the genus described, render the conclusive
establishment of new species in it a task of great difficulty.   Conus
tiaratus, tornatus, nivifer (one variety possibly Lamarck's Con. ni
vosus), manus, luteus, concinnus, recurvus (its markings sometimes
resembling Con. Amadis), Nur (may be a variety of Con. sponsalis),
monilifer, Archon (approaches some varieties of Con. Cedo-nulli in
contour and markings), Musivum (allied to Con. Textile), purpu
rascens, Gladiator, Orion, geographus, and Princeps.
     In further illustration of his Paper “On the Laws that regulate
the Changes of Plumage in Birds,” Mr. Yarrell exhibited several
varieties of British species, which possessed in part only the plumage
 common to the race. In some of these the feathers assumed at the
 moult were of the natural colour, and distinct from those previously
 borne; from which it was inferred, that, as the bird increased in
 age and strength, the plumage would assume entirely the colours
 peculiar to the species. Mr. Yarrell also referred to some newly
 collected series of feathers, which were shown.

   June 4.—Read a communication from Thomas Andrew Knight,
Esq. F.R.S. & L.S., President of the Horticultural Society, giving an
account of two remarkable examples of sagacity displayed by Birds
during the period of incubation.    The most remarkable of these was
as follows:—A wild duck had deposited her eggs near the side of
a brook, but so far above the highest level to which the water had
ever been known to rise, as to be apparently perfectly secure from
being overflowed.     An exceedingly violent thunder-storm, however,
caused the brook suddenly to rise        above       far
                                                    usual level; the nest
                                                                      its
was    inconsequence overflowed, and the eggs remained submerged
during more than two hours. No expectations were entertained
that the bird would ever return      the nest,  to                   or
                                                   that life had not been
totally extinguished    the eggs; but she did return
                                in                           the nest, and         to
every egg hatched well. The water which had covered the eggs
was very warm, and the temperature         the nest and the eggs, after
                                                          of
the water had subsided, probably led the animal, Mr. Knight con
ceives,     resume her labours, which

                 nearly akin, that they might perhaps           included                    be
in the same   genus.    They are here, however, separated, and the
two genera are considered       forming family distinct from

 ON AN           HITHERTO              UNOBSERVED PROPERTY OF CHLORINE.
                                      BY MR. A. TREVELY AN.
To    the Editors          of   the Philosophical Magazine and                           Journal of              Science.
          Gentlemen,
I    AM not aware that chlorine gas    has been observed to possess the
             property as oxygen in kindling the flame of a candle
          same
when introduced into it with the wick in an incandescent state.
When attending, on the 18th of February, the lecture of the able elec
trician Mr. K.T. Kemp, on Chlorine, it struck me that it might possess
this property, which                 I
                         immediately ascertained to be the case by in
troducing into a jar of                  it,
                              candle, the flame
                                              a    which had been pre             of
viously extinguished       withdrawing   byfrom that gas;   was imme
                                                                 it                                 it
diately rekindled, and the experiment was repeated several times                                                          in
the same measure        gas.     ofYours, &c.

     CARBONATE                  OF POTASH FROM GREEN AND DRY PLANTS.
    M. Becquerel has made some experiments               the manufacture          on                                      of
potash. The comparative analyses              great number      of ashes have                       of
                                                                      a a
proved that those       green wood yield

   M. Pelouze considers the atomic constitution of this salt to be l
atom of phosphoric acid saturated with 2 atoms of barytes and 2
atoms of alcohol, with 12 atoms of water of crystallization.        The
phosphovinate of lead was found to be of analogous composition.
Phosphovinic acid is obtained by gradually adding dilute sulphuric
acid to an aqueous solution of phosphovinate of barytes, as long as
precipitation takes place. The filtered liquor is to be evaporated,
at first over the naked fire, and then in vacuo beside a vessel contain
ing sulphuric acid. A liquid is obtained, which reduced to the con
sistence of a thick oil, cannot be further concentrated; but it does
not decompose at common temperatures in vacuo, as sulphovinic acid
does.
   Phosphovinic acid may also be obtained by decomposing phospho
vinate of lead with sulphuretted hydrogen.
   The properties of phosphovinic acid are, that it has a biting and
very acid taste; it is inodorous and colourless, of an oily consistence,
and reddens the blue colour of litmus strongly.          It is soluble in                                      all

portion of coal has been more than one half! This but imperfect
description of the section of measures will convey to the reader but
an inadequate idea of their frequent changes and respective natures;
it will merely serve to show the kind of formation actually existing
here;—they must be seen to be properly appreciated. Some of the
disciples of Mr. Smith's school thought well, at the commencement
of my undertaking, publicly to announce, that I should not come
upon these coal-measures before                            I
                                             had penetrated the ponderous
series of lias, red-marl, and sand strata intervening between this
spot and the north-western coal districts; founding their assertions
upon Mr. Smith's hypothesis of the vast ranges of strata delineated
on his Geological Map of England, taking a regular and continuous
dip, “stratum super stratum,” to the eastward. Now, though it be
unquestionably true that the prevailing dip of the strata of Great
Britain is to the east, it is nevertheless equally true that such de
clivity is but of a partial or local nature. To this now generally
received opinion,             I
                         may adduce one entertained by Mr. Williams
upon the subject (vol.

                   says,           “I
                              have never been able           trace any particu     to

                                the earth.        once took      Ifor granted,          it                        as
many do, that every stratum was zone; but on more accurate ex

 me that there           such thing

   -            1. On the Velocity       of Electricity.
   OME      ingenious experiments have lately been made by Mr.
     Wheatstone, with a view to determine the velocity of the
electric spark passing through air by means of a revolving
mirror. But has it ever been shown with certainty that the
passage of electricity, even through a conducting body, is per
formed in a space of time so short as to be absolutely inap
preciable? An experiment is upon record in which the spark
was sent through seven miles of iron wire, which it is said to
have traversed in an instant. But it may fairly be presumed that
the philosophers who made this observation, could not answer
for an interval of time smaller than the tenth part of a second.
Now, as the revolving mirror gives us the power of increasing
the accuracy of observation at least a thousand-fold,             I
                                                                will
suggest a method of applying it to determine this question.
   Let the greatest length of wire that can be procured, be
disposed so that the two extremities are brought very nearly
together. Let one end of the wire receive the spark from the
machine, and the other end give it out again to any body
which communicates with the earth.
  If  the flashes of electric light, entering the wire, and leaving
it after traversing     its
                          whole length, appear simultaneous           to
                                        on
the eye,  take mirror mounted
              a                         a revolving axis, and place

 it in such a position that (the mirror being at rest) the images
 of the two sparks coincide, or are superposed one upon the
 other.
    This being effected,      the observation let made through                     be                            a
 fixed tube, placing the combined image exactly           the centre                         in

 great speed,    any separation

XIV.    List of the Simple Minerals of the Counties of Down,
  Antrim, and Derry. By JAMEs Bryce, Jun.M.A.; Member
  of the British Association for the Advancement of Science,
  of the Geological Society of Dublin, of the Natural History
  Society     of Belfast, &c."
  N    a small work, entitled “Tables of Simple Minerals,
     Rocks and Shells, with local Catalogues of Speciest,” pub
lished by me about two years since, there was given a list
of the minerals found in the North of Ireland,-the list being
confined to the minerals of the three northern counties, the
productions of the others being but imperfectly known.      Im
pressed with the importance of making catalogues of local
productions more extensively known than they could be by
means of a work of the above kind, I avail myself of the ex
tensive circulation of the Philosophical Magazine, to make
naturalists generally acquainted with the minerals of the North
of Ireland.
   Sir C. L. Giesecké has lately published an Irish Mineralogy,
appended to his descriptive Catalogue of the Royal Dublin
Society's Collection.      The appearance of this work should be
hailed with pleasure by every one interested in promoting a
knowledge of the Natural History of Ireland. It is to be hoped
that it will speedily be followed by an Irish Flora, and an
Irish Fauna. It was not, however, to be expected that, in the
present state of our knowledge, a work of this kind could be
                                           §ºis
at  all complete, although the indefatigable zeal and accom
plished skill     Sir  of            have effected much.

 Common Chlorite.—Occasionally            with Quartz in Primary Rocks.
Rock Cork and Rock Leather.—Occasionally between the strata of Chalk.[?]
Emery.—Is said to occur in Mourne.
 Topaz and Beryl—Are well known as occurring in the Granite of Mourne.
 Calc Spar.—Of various forms; common everywhere.
Satin Spar.—Frequent in Trap Rocks.
 Fibrous Arragonite.—Met with at Downhill and the Causeway.
 Calcareous Tufa and Stalactites.— Common; the latter chiefly in Trap
      caverns.
 Aphrite.—Is       said to occur on the Transition     Slate, Mourne.   I have  not
      seen it.
 Agaric Mineral—Lining Flint balls, Ballycastle, along with Rock Cork;
     also at Sleive Gallion in the same manner.
 Hydrocarbonate of Lime and Magnesia.-In the Amygdaloid of Downhill,
     in spheroids having the appearance of a puddingstone. It is called by
      Sir C. Giesecké, Hydrocarbonate of Lime. Dr. Thomson has discovered
      Magnesia in it”.
 RhombSpar and Carbonate of Magnesia.-Occur in the MagnesianLimestone
      at Holly and Belfast. The granular, compact, and fibrous varieties of
      Gypsum and Selenite are found in various places in Antrim, in the
     variegated Marl subordinate to the new red sandstone.
  Wulpinite—I recently found this mineral in a Trap dyke at the base of the
      Cave Hill near Belfast; it is of a laminated structure and sky-blue co
      lour.    Sir C. Giesecké mentions Rathlin as a locality, I know not on
      what authority.
 Heavy Spar.—Occurs in Lead mines in several places; also in the Old Red
      Sandstone of Cushendun.         Sulphate of Strontia is said to occur with it
      in Newtonards lead mine.
    * Perhaps Mr. Bryce will inform us, in a future communication, whether
 this mineral is allied to that which the late Mr. W. Phillips, at the sug
 gestion of Mr. Brayley, described under the appellation of Hydrocarbonate
 of Lime, in the last edition (1823) of his Elementary Introduction to          Mi
 neralogy, p. 161. “The latter mineral we are informed, in a communication
 from Mr. Brayley, is the result of the action of the trap dykes of the Giants'
 Causeway upon the chalk which they have intersected, and, according to
 the analysis of the late Dr. Da Costa, would appear to be composed of
 4 atoms carbonate of lime and 3 atoms water; indicating, probably, that
 the hygrometric water of the original chalk, under the combined influence
 of heat and pressure, has entered into combination with the earthy salt:
 or the water may have been derived from a former superincumbent ocean.
 It would not be difficult to account for the formation of a similar hydrate
 in        cavities of an amygdaloid, such as that alluded to by Mr. Bryce.”

from the wood employed by Mr. Hadfield, we have in his
manufacture the same operation and the same materials as
in M. Brunner's experiment, and may therefore expect the
same results. The only difference would be, that as M. Brun
ner used much potash, he procured a large proportion of the
metallic base; while in the other case the potassium must be
in small quantity, because                        all

                of the Spontaneous         Combustion             of Charcoal.                           91

the explanation  suggested, occur, the alkali formed being much
heavier than          its
                 metallic base.      appears that,
                                               It      produce the               to

soon after       its
               formation, but that the sooner              reduced           it   is
the more certain and considerable will be the effect. Now this
fact also    entirely consistent with the explanation; because
                is
when the pulverization has been delayed, air and moisture
will have gradually produced the alkali,            process imper      by
                                                                        a
ceptible because the minute portions         potassium would  of                                         be
at comparatively distant intervals from each other, and thus
would not
                 be
                  sufficient quantity
                 in                       any one place  at    pro                             to
duce   asensible effect.
   Colonel Aubert pulverized       mixture     acharcoal and sul   of
phur; and            he
               found that, under these circumstances,         igni                             no
tion ever occurred.     The reason    obvious;  for the
                                                    is  potassium,
which has been conceived                  to
                                   the cause   be the combustion,      of
entered, during the trituration, into combination with the sul
phur.
     He also triturated charcoal with nitre; and                                 he   again found
that the spontaneous combustion was prevented. Now nitre,
by  mingling with the potassium, would check          too rapid ab           its
sorption    oxygen; and the effect
                of                       his experiment
                                                     of         this                     is      in
way sufficiently accounted for.
   The presence      potassium seems
                            of             account for the circum
                                                         to
stance, that when charcoal      moistened and subjected
                                          is                   heat,                           to
carburetted hydrogen        set     liberty.
                                   is          at  this instance       In                                it
would appear that the water           decomposed,
                                                is   the hydrogen
evolved, and the oxygen united with the potassium              form                            to
the alkali.          If
                the heat     continued, carbonic oxide would
                                     be                                                                  be
evolved; the oxygen absorbed          the first part
                                                in       the opera               of
tion being again detached from the metallic base.          Now this
explanation corresponds precisely,        believe, with the order
                                                     I
in which,     such
                 in    experiment, these gases are produced.

                                        Mr. Hadfield and Col.
Aubert   appear  therefore perfectly reconcilable with the sup
position, that the spontaneous incandescence      owing entirely            is
to the oxidation       the potassium liberated from the wood
                             of

    Let us now turn our attention to that part of the district which
is situated on the south side of the Tyne. At Jarrow, two miles
west of South Shields, the well-known high main seam of coal
is nearly two hundred fathoms below the surface of the earth,
but in the vicinity of the latter place the accompanying section
gives us a depth of about seventy-nine fathoms.             This re
markable difference is not     owing    to  any considerable inequa
lity on the surface, but from the coal-measures here rising at
an unusual angle to the east. It was long ago observed by the
viewers or professional men here, that from the neighbour
hood of Heworth the high main coal, the very best seam on
the Tyne, or even in the north of England, became injured
as it proceeded in a south-easterly direction, by being inter
stratified by a band of coal of inferior quality with an admix
ture of stony matter and iron pyrites. This they called the
 Heworth Band; and though borings were made near the
 Scots House in the vicinity of the Boldon Hills, there appears
not to have been sufficient encouragement resulting from the
trial to induce one of the most enterprising and opulent coal
 owners of his day to prosecute the undertaking by sinking a
 shaft.    Owing to the high main coal being deteriorated by
 this  band,   an opinion prevailed very generally, even among
 professional men, that no mine would be worked to profit
 near or under the magnesian limestone formation; and as far
 as the high main seam was the object of their speculations,
 they were not far from the truth.      I  am not aware that the lime
 stone was ever thought to be the direct cause of rendering
 the coal of inferior quality; but one thing was certain, that
 whenever the collieries on the south side of the Tyne extended
 their workings in the direction of the limestone hills, the He
 worth band was sure to intervene and injure the coal.           How
 far this is the case to the southward, will appear when the sec
 tion of Hetton Colliery comes under consideration.

                                                                          in in

ders        nº        to   be   equivalent            to   nº.            He accordingly                  reads

104.            Mr.   J.  Blackwall's Characters    of some
“pitched planks”; "Sy being, as he says, in the plural num
ber, and signifying planks or boards.           But in this latter re
spect he is clearly in error; since the primary and proper
meaning of      ºy (hetz), of which ‘sy is the plural in the         state
of construction, is Tree and not Plank.         See Gen.    i. 29. Deut.
xxii. 6. and innumerable other texts.                              -
   Thus the literal translation of the words of the text"pi"sy
is “Trees of Pitch,” or “Pitch Trees,” meaning the wood of
that description of tree from which pitch is obtained.
   It remains to be ascertained what tree, the product of the
country where the Ark was built, is most likely to have had
this name applied to it by Moses;—on which I confess my
incompetency to offer an opinion.
   Another observation on Mr. Drummond Hay's paper                       I
make with regret. It is with respect to his remarks on the
manner in which Padre Felipe Scio has rendered these same
words    nº"Sy,        and likewise the words D'êty"sy (hatzé
shittím), Exod. xxv. 10, in his Spanish Version of the Bible.
I  have no intention to advocate the worthy Padre's transla
tion, but    I  feel persuaded that Mr. Drummond Hay would
not have ridiculed him for his “utter ignorance” if he had
not overlooked the fact, that this modern Spaniard has merely
followed the ancient authority of the Vulgate; he having trans
lated the “ligna lavigata” of that version by “maderas                 la
bradas,” and the “ligna de setím” of the same by “maderas
de setím.”         I  am, Gentlemen,

                             Genus, Savignia.
           six in number, unequal in size; four of them, which
EYES  are disposed in a transverse row behind the anterior pro
minence of the cephalothorax, are separated by large inter
vals, the two intermediate ones being the smallest of the six,
and immediately before each of the lateral eyes another is             si
tuated.

            undescribed Genera and Species                        of Araneidae.                       105
  Maxillae greatly enlarged at the base externally, where the
palpi are inserted, and inclined towards the lip, which they
encompass.
  Lip     short, broad, prominent at the apex, and semicircular.
  Legs moderately robust; the anterior and posterior pairs,
which are the longest, equal in length; the third pair is the
shortest.
  The     name   of M. Savigny, which                    I have
                                                     upon this         bestowed
genus, is connected with highly interesting discoveries in this
department of zoology.
                           Savignia frontata.
  Cephalothorax       oval, convex above, with a minute indenta
tion in the medial line of the posterior region, and an acute
perpendicular eminence of a conical form in front, surmounted
by a tuft of fine hair. Mandibles small, dentated on the inner
side, and inclined towards the pectus, which is heart-shaped.
These parts, with the maxillae and lip, are of a brownish-black
colour.     Legs and palpi brown, with a tinge of red. Each
tarsus has three claws at                 its
                                    extremity; the two upper ones
are finely pectinated, and the inferior one          abruptly inflected
 near   itsbase. The fourth and fifth joints          the palpi are ex of is

concave within, and are connected with the sexual organs,
which are highly developed, exhibiting several curved spiny
processes, (a certain indication that the animal has attained
maturity,) and are of a dark red-brown colour.
   Mr. T. Blackwall discovered this minute species in October,
1832.   It is found in abundance under stones in the township
of Cheetham,    near Manchester.
                        Walckenaëria cuspidata.
    This species is precisely similar in colour to Walckenaëria
acuminata, but in the form of the pectus it resembles Walc
kenaëria cristata. The upper part of the cephalothorax is
not so gibbous as that of either of the other species belonging
to the genus, and has no indentation in the medial line of the
posterior region.
    Length, from the anterior part of the cephalothorax to the
extremity of the abdomen, ºth of an inch; length of the ce
phalothorax ºn ; breadth gº ; breadth of the abdomen gº.
The legs of the first and last pairs, which are the longest and
equal in length, measure 4th, and those of the third pair,
which are the shortest, ºth.
    The male is rather smaller than the female, but the relative
length of       legs

   This spider, which was discovered by Mr. T. Blackwall in
September 1831, under stones and rubbish in the township of
Crumpsall, pairs in the month of October.          In it are com
bined several striking characteristics of the genera Theridion
and Tetragnatha.       Allied to the former by the structure of
the  mouth,   and the irregularity of the insignificant web it fa
bricates, it resembles the latter in the form and relative length
of the legs, which it frequently extends in the same manner as
 Tetragnatha eatensa; thus closely connecting by           organiza           its

  which, after all, are so loosely described, that it seems very pro
 bable that they may be nothing more than fragments of fossil
 wood, known to be very common in the lias formation, instead
 of true coal. In like manner the fossil vegetable remains men
 tioned by him, are described only under the old and vague
 name of Carpolithes, without any indication which can enable
 us to judge whether they belong to the species usually asso
 ciated with the regular coal-measures or not.              The notice is
 also destitute of every thing like a general account of the geo
 logical relations of the district; and it is hastily assumed that
 scientific geologists would previously have pronounced against
 the possibility of the occurrence of any coal in that neigh
 bourhood; although the slightest acquaintance with any stand
 ard work on geology would have informed Mr. Holdsworth,
 that, besides the principal carboniferous formation, others are
 recognised, especially that connected with the sands of the
 inferior oolite, in the eastern moorlands of Yorkshire, and at
 Brora in Scotland. Now it so happens that these very sands
of the inferior oolite, assuming a character very similar to their
 type in Yorkshire, range from Belvoir along the eastern
portion of Leicestershire, and skirt on Billesdon itself. It
seems, therefore, by no means improbable that if Mr. Holds
worth has really found any coal, it may belong to this forma
tion; but his description does not at
                                                          in all

     2. When QOq is a circle, the points T and V coincide in
a nodal point n, where the two sheets of the wave surface cross
each other.   At this point there are an infinite number of
tangent planes, for OQ and Oq are now indeterminate. The
same refracted ray On may therefore be derived from any
one of an infinite number of incident rays, and                   polariza                       its

retained by the water. Hence in starting a new lead-house, or
whenever fresh water is used, there is withdrawn at once a
large portion of that element which is essential to the acidifi
cation of the sulphurous gas; it is withdrawn either as nitric
acid, or as deutoxide of azote. As the water of the lead-house
becomes slightly acidulated by sulphuric acid, part of the                                                      ni
trous acid is also retained by it (7); it undergoes no further
decomposition. As the chamber absorbs sulphurous acid gas,
this acts on the deutoxide of azote, and protoxide” is the result;
it acts on the nitric acid, the usual decompositions occur, and
we have the nitric and nitrous acids and deutoxide of azote pro
duced. As the acidulated waters of the lead-house increase in
density, less sulphurous acid is absorbed, and the nitrous acid is
retained, undergoing no further change.           Hence we easily ac
count for the fact, that little sulphuric acid can be obtained by
using fresh water in the chambers. The nitrous acid vapour
is withdrawn, being changed into nitric acid, deutoxide and
protoxide of azote, and being itself partly retained as such.
   The white solid, I suppose, is formed in every part of a lead
house, and falls like hail into the water or acid on the floor.
 Cold condenses the moisture of the lead-house; and I have
generally observed the formation of this substance to take

 from a lead-house: it ought to be wholly decomposed by
 sulphurous acid.          Yet it is well known that nitric acid is

red   vapours     appear if free oxygen gas is excluded from the
vessel.     The above experiments were reversed by passing the
vapour from sulphuric acid and nitre over a weak solution
of sulphurous acid in water. No effervescence took place, ex
cept when a drop of strong nitric acid fell from the beak of
the retort into the liquid. The nitrous acid vapour was ra
pidly absorbed by the sulphurous acid solution, and whatever
nitric acid was formed by the action of the water remained
undecomposed.

      Dear Sir,
INthea series of experiments which were read at a meeting of
       Royal Society some time ago, I stated that when an
electro-magnet had the magnetic state induced on it by re
maining in contact with the battery for some time, it required
a considerable time to induce an equal magnetic power by
changing           poles; but that the same power was again ra
                   its
pidly restored,               by
                           inducing the poles                  at
                                                   the same extremities

  There appear to me only two ways of accounting for this
curious fact. We must either suppose that the electricity
having been first arranged in a particular direction is after
wards more easily arranged in trials in the same direction than
in the contrary:—or, that in reversing the poles we do not

oxide, of lead.     Dr. Dalton in his work already alluded to,
considers the   protoxide  as composed of 7 oxygen and 90 lead,
and the peroxide of 14 oxygen and the same quantity of
metal. Now as these differ but little from the atomic propor
tions usually adopted,                 I
                            shall consider the protoxide as com
posed of an atom of oxygen = 8 + 104 an atom of lead, and
the peroxide of 16 = 2 atoms oxygen + 104 of lead.
    It is well known that when red-lead is treated with nitric
or acetic acid, it is separated into protoxide, which is dis
solved, and peroxide remaining unacted upon; and Dr. Dal
ton correctly observes, that if minium were a sesqui-oxide, it
ought to leave more than 50 per cent. of peroxide when acted
upon by either of the above-named acids; the sample, how
ever, which he examined left only 20 per cent. of peroxide,
proving that it was not a sesqui-oxide.
    Dr. Dalton concludes from his experiments that “the mi
mium of commerce is constituted of 1 atom of oxygen, holding
6 atoms of yellow oride together; or it is composed of 100 lead
and 9:07 orygen.” And he observes, that “when it is                                                 di
gested in cold acetic acid the residuum constitutes another oride,
consisting of 1 atom oxygen and 3 of yellow oxide, or 100
lead, and 10:4 orygen, possessing the same colour as the former,
but distinguishable by                 its
                             not being acted        cold acetic acid,  on   by
                                  much brown oride and extra oay
       as by
and            its
            containing  twice                   as
gen      minium.”
    These experiments are, confess, new      I    me, and certainly     to
have not excited the attention which      they  merit;  and without
at  present entering further into this part      the subject, shall    of                     I
just state that have found acetic acid

              protoxide from minium, without altering          colour                    its
at  all; and consequently proving that          not sesqui-oxide,it
                                                                 is              a

                                                of
M. Dumas indeed prove the existence                  several varieties  of
of minium; and according            his experiments,
                                                  to    which appear
to  have been conducted with          great   care,   the increase                                   of
oxygen goes                  on
                     very slowly from 8:26 per cent.           the pro                  in

         the first calcination,      8-79 contained   to   the minium              in
of the eighth   operation.    He found also that white lead sub

                      Mr. R. Phillips  on  Minium.            127
mitted to three calcinations gave a fine orange minium, con
taining 9:24 per cent. of oxygen; this, however, he observes
is still below the proportion required to constitute the lead a
sesqui-oxide, and which, in fact, amounts to 10:38 per cent.
    M. Dumas states minium of the eighth operation to consist of
74 protoxide, and 26 peroxide; that obtained by calcining
white lead, of 66-8 protoxide, and 33.2 peroxide; and pure
minium he considers as equivalent to 65°1 of protoxide with
34.9 of peroxide.
     I  shall now state the results of my own experiments on
minium; that which       I used appeared to be free from carbo
nate of lead, and was moderately dried before submitting it to
the following experiments:–Two            hundred grains were  di
gested in an ounce of strong nitric acid, diluted with half a
pint of water; 49.6 grs. of peroxide were left, consequently
 the minium was separated into
                  Protoxide of lead..........    75°2
                  Peroxide of lead...........    24.8
                                                100-0
     I also boiled some of the minium with excess of moderately
 strong acetic acid; by this operation it was separated into
                  Protoxide ...................  74°2
                  Peroxide.....................  25.8
                                                100-0
     These results do not differ much; but taking the mean, we
 have minium resolved into
                  Protoxide....................   74-7
                  Peroxide.....................  25-3
                                                100-0
      Now this result differs considerably from that obtained by
  Dr. Dalton; he procured only 20 per cent of peroxide. The
  cause   of this difference is readily explained by referring to
  M. Dumas's Table of Experiments; from which it appears
  that minium of the third calcination yields only 20.3 per cent.
  of peroxide; while that of the eighth gives 26 per cent. Dr.
  Dalton appears to have employed a specimen of the former,
  while   I used one of the latter.
      In order to determine the proportion of pure minium in the
  specimen which I used, I added separate portions of 200
  grains each, to the annexed quantities of strong acetic acid,
  diluted with half a pint of water; viz. one, two, two and a half,
  and three drachms.       I found that the minium digested in the
  first lost 22 per cent.; in the second 27°5; and in the third

29.1 per cent. ; and in                          all
                              these cases the residue remained
perfectly unchanged      colour: the quantity

the residue had acquired      slight brown tint, showing that
                                                 a                                                           a
portion     the  pure
                of     minium had been decomposed. From
these experiments     conclude that the maximum

   “Mr. Palmer has described, in the Philosophical Transactions, a self
registering machine which is intended to give the time and height of high
water; and I believe it is intended to set one up at the London Docks, but
I have not heard that it is yet in operation. The principle consists in a style,
or pencil, which is moved horizontally by the tide along the summit of a
cylinder, which is turned round slowly and uniformly; the pencil describes
a curve upon paper wound round the cylinder, which curve indicates the
fluctuations of the water. The motion of the tide being originally vertical,
is changed by a common mechanical contrivance of the simplest kind.
   “When it is intended to make a long series of observations, it is of course
very desirable to adopt every precaution to ensure accuracy; but many per
sons have it in their power to make observations, which may be useful in
determining the establishment of a port, or the mean interval between the
moon's southing and the time of high water, without any expensive appa
ratus.
   “For this purpose the observations during one lunation, or even less,
may suffice, where, as in the river Thames, the rise is considerable and the
tides little subject to irregularities.  In the open ocean, where the rise on
the contrary is small, the tide often hangs half an hour at high water, and
the phaenomena take place very irregularly.        At St. Helena the rise in
springs, according to Dr. Maskelyne, is 39 inches, and in neaps 20 inches;
and I apprehend that less information could be elicited from a year's obser
vations there, than from a month's observations at the London Docks. When
a few observations only are made with a view of determining the establish
ment, they should not be used to determine that quantity absolutely, but
they should be compared with observations at some place of which the esta
blishment is accurately known, or where observations are continually car
ried on. It would be very desirable for those who are able, to combine so
as to effect the monography or detailed description of the tides through some
short extent of coast, such as that which has been effected by M. Daussy for
the coast of France."
   Some observations on the progress of the tide-wave around the
globe, and on the cotidal lines which represent the successive posi
tions of      its
              crest, conclude the Report.         Our readers are already

upon which the dome revolves will at once accommodate themselves
to a trifling shrinking of the parts.        We imagine that the author's
objection to the light copper covering might be obviated, by having
an interior covering (not in contact with the copper) made of some
material that is a bad conductor of heat : perhaps oil-cloth might
be found effectual for this purpose.
   From $. IV. to $. VII. inclusive we find an interesting and                                              in
structive account of the most important instrument used in practical
astronomy, the Refracting Telescope.                   The account of this
instrument given in these sections is extremely valuable, for the
practical instructions contained in them, as to certain requisites in
deterºining the goodness of a telescope.
   In §. IV., Art. 9–14, our author details the results of his own
experience, in the examination of the figure of an object-glass. The
rest of this and the two following Sections are dedicated to the de
scription of the celestial eye-piece, from the single lens, to the most
effective combination, the eye-pieces of Huygens and Ramsden,_
the first denominated the negative eye-piece, where the image is
formed behind the second lens of the combination, and the latter
the positive eye-piece, the image being formed before                   This last           it.

 heavens with his 40-feet reflector, with the power of 1000.          He
 supposes that he may obtain 100 favourable hours in the year; then
 he calculates that to sweep the northern hemisphere, and such part
 of the southern as is visible, by directing the axis of his telescope.
 into each point of space for a single instant, would require 811 years;
 so that his 40-feet telescope may furnish work for his descendants
for some generations. Our author concludes this Section by giving
 a list of the works of Sir W. Herschel.
     The next Section gives an account of a telescope of the Hersche
lian construction, which was erected at Greenwich, a few years
 since, by a self-taught artist of Aberdeen, of the name of Ramage.
 In this construction the mechanism is much more simple than that
of Sir W. Herschel's great telescope.
    Section XVIII. is taken up with a very curious account of what
 Sir William Herschel has denominated the space penetrating power
 of a telescope: we believe he was the first person who considered
 this subject.   This power consists in the most advantageous com
bination of the magnifying power with the quantity of light.       After
a very interesting discussion of the subject, he illustrates the differ
ence between this power and the magnifying power by observations
of several nebulae and clusters of stars; also of the satellites, of the
 Georgian planet, and of the Satellites of saturn.
    The Sections commencing with XVIII. and ending with XLVIII.
are almost entirely taken up with the important subject of measuring
with accuracy small celestial arcs. The first of these Sections gives
an historical epitome of the gradual improvements which have taken
place in this department of practical astronomy, from the earliest
times that we have any account of attempts being made to deter
mine the places of the heavenly bodies, to the present time;—
from the date, when the third part of a degree was only appreciated
by estimation, to the present day, when the tenth part of a second
may be appreciated, probably with greater certainty.
    The MicroMETERs, which are described in the following Sections,
maybe dividedinto classes, which may again be subdivided as follows:–
    Class I. Single Image Micrometers; containing,
    (1.) Where the measure is taken by means of two parallel spider's
lines, the distance of the separation of which can be accurately es
timated :
    (2) Where the measure is obtained from a divided scale, placed
in the common focus of the object- and eye-glasses:
    (3.) By means of reticulated diaphragms, with which the required
measure is obtained only by means of a troublesome calculation,
deduced from the time of passage.
    ClassII.   Double Image Micrometers; containing,
    (1.) The divided Object-glass micrometer:
    (2.) The divided Eye-glass micrometer, with the Catoptric micro
meter, by Ramsden:
    (3.) Prismatic and Cuneiform micrometers:
    (4.) Doubly-refracting Crystal micrometers.
    Class III. Binocular Micrometers.

for measuring the sun's             or
                                moon's diameter; and the great advantage
gained was, that both the images were equally bright                          parts                in   all
of  the  lengthened     scale.     Dr.  M.,   however,    dying    before       had                      he

upon the description of these last means of measuring small arcs, he
gives the description of the best construction for clamps and tangent
screws. We believe that Dollond's clamp, described in Art. 5, page
275, is the best for insuring a steady motion to a large instrument
like the mural circle. After this the principle of the VERNIER is
fully described in §. XLVII. Our author next minutely describes
the construction of Troughton's Reading Microscope.
    After having described the means of measuring small arcs, our
author comes to the description of the principal instruments in
an observatory: but preparatory to this, he describes two of the
most important and indispensable appendages required in making
their adjustment. The first is the Plumb-line, and the second the
 Spirit-level.
    In §. LIII. we find an account of the most improved construction
 of the Transit clock, which, as the late Professor Robison has justly

Sectors; and the last, Zenith Micrometers, the account of which is
contained in S.LXXXII. The first Zenith Sector, by Graham, is re
markable as the means by which Bradley was led to the discovery
of the aberration of light. Also a full account of a complicated
Zenith Sector, by Ramsden; and also of a much more elegant, much
more simple, and we have no doubt quite as accurate a one by
Troughton.
  In the following Section will be found an account of another of
Troughton's instruments, a portable Quadrant.
  In §. LXXXIV. is given the account of Ramsden's Polar instru
ment.
   After an interesting account of the fixed telescopes used at Green
wich, at the suggestion of the Astronomer Royal, for the purpose
of settling the question of annual parallax in the fixed stars, our
author, in §. LXXXVII. and some of the following Sections, describes
the construction and use of another class of instruments,         those
employed in Nautical Astronomy.         The first which is  considered,
is the first effective instrument of this kind that was ever contrived:
it is generally known under the      name of Hadley's Sextant, with
which the   angle  between two   objects is measured by means of re
flection from two mirrors, and the inclination of the mirrors is half
the required angle. In the Section appropriated to the description
of this beautiful instrument, the author, after giving a short account
of the original invention, proceeds to give an accurate detail of the
instrument in           its
                    most perfect form.
   Our author has detailed                         all
                                   the successive improvements made
in  this instrument,      the account

  In the concluding Section of this elaborate work we find similar
excellent expressions of the same principle, which was displayed in
the opening Section. We cannot do better than confirm our re
marks by quoting our author's own words.
   “When the practical astronomer has proved, and can confide in
his various and delicate resources, his mind, like his telescope, is
pointed to heaven, and his soul is wrapped up in the contemplation
of objects, that prove beyond contradiction the immutability of
those laws by which the Omnipotent Creator upholds, actuates,
and directs the luminous bodies composing this solar system. When
ever he detects a glaring discrepancy in his comparative observa
tions, or in the errors of his clock, he arraigns not the heavenly
bodies, or the earth on which he stands, as subject to move under
the misguidance of capricious laws; but suspects his own imperfect
powers, or the tendency of material mechanism to change          position            its
or  dimensions,       by
                     variations             of

   The author finds that the principal results of the superposition of
two similar modes of vibration are the following:—first, the points
where the quiescent lines of each figure intersect each other remain
quiescent points in the resultant figure; secondly, the quiescent lines
of one figure are obliterated, when superposed, by the vibratory parts
of the other; thirdly, new quiescent parts, which may be called points
of compensation, are formed whenever the vibrations in opposite di
rections neutralize each other ; and, lastly, at other points, the mo
tion is as the sum of the concurring, or the differences of the opposing
vibrations at these points. After considering various modes of binary
superposition, the author examines the cases of four co-existing su
perpositions.
   When the vibrations of the superposed modes are unequal in inten
sity, there is formed a figure intermediate between the perfect re
sultant and one of                its
                        compounds. These figures the author denomi
nates imperfect resultants.
   In  each series      transitions there are certain points which are in
                            all of
variable during        the changes: these are quiescent points, formed
by  the nodal lines       one figure intersecting those
                                 of                           the other, and              of

vibration agree       each component mode
                           in                     vibration. The points       of                                of
compensation are changeable.         Transitional figures appear when the
sides     the plate are nearly, but not exactly, equal.

  the conducting power of a wire for electricity, with                     length and                      its
  diameter, and which, according              Professors   Cumming  to   and Barlow,
  varies  directly       the          as

                               of                           the length. He points         as

serving, that “as no increase of electro-magnetic power is gained by
increasing the decomposing powers of a battery, and as action and re
action are equal, it appears improbable that we shall ever obtain high
decomposing powers by any increase in magneto-electric induction.”
   A paper was then read, entitled, “Notice of the Remains of the
recent Volcano in the Mediterranean.” By John Davy, M.D. F.R.S.
Assistant Inspector of Army Hospitals.
   The author communicates an account given by Captain Swinburne,
dated the 24th of August, of a dangerous shoal, in latitude 37°9' N.
and longitude 12° 43' E., consisting principally of black sand and
stones, with a circular patch of rock, which has been left by the vol
cano that lately appeared in the Mediterranean.     Captain Swinburne
furnished the author with two specimens of the air which was seen
rising from the site of the volcano, in small silver threads of bubbles.
These were found, upon examination by chemical tests, to consist of
between 9 and 10 parts of oxygenous to 79 or 80 of azotic gases.
   The author adduces arguments in favour of the supposition that this
air is disengaged from sea water at the bottom in contact with the
loose and probably hot ashes and cinders composing the shoal, rather
than that it arises from the extinct volcano. He is also disposed to
extend this theory to the explanation of the gases disengaged from
hot springs, which are generally found to consist of a mixture of oxy
genous and azotic gases, the former being in less proportion than in
atmospheric air, in consequence   of     abstractionits   oxidating pro    by
cesses from the air originally contained    these waters. in

    In the Lagotis Cuvieri the fore feet, like the hinder, have only
four toes, there being no vestige of a thumb; and the claws are
small, slightly sharpened, and entirely concealed by long and some
what bristly hairs. Those of the hinder feet are similar in shape
and rather larger; but that of the inner toe is flattened, curved in
wards, and exposed, the hairs immediately adjoining it giving place
to a tuft of about eight rows of short, stiff, horny, curved bristles, ap
proaching nearly in their rigidity to the comb-like appendage, which
is found in almost the same situation in the Ctenodactylus Massonii,
Gray. A similar structure also occurs in the Chinchilla.
    Mr. Bennett afterwards entered at length into the internal ana
tomy of Lagotis and Chinchilla, and gave a full description of their
skeletons, dwelling more particularly on the points of difference ex
isting between them. He concluded by some observations on the

aurora borealis; in which Dr. Robinson of Armagh, Dr. Dalton, Sir
John Herschel, Professor Airy, Mr. Scoresby, Mr. Whewell, Profes

that the aurora was never elevated more than from three to seven
miles above the earth's surface; while others contended that        alti                                      its
tude was ninety       hundred miles: this discrepancy led

recommendation that the phaenomena should            more carefully and            be

and present state of various branches of science, which had been                                     pre
sented at the Meeting of last year: he noticed summarily the publi

of Mineralogy: and, finally, announced that His Majesty and the
 Government, wishing to manifest their attachment to science, and to
confer some mark of royal favour upon an illustrious philosopher, have
 conferred upon Dr. Dalton a pension out of the Civil List.
   Mr. Whewell then addressed the assembly at great length, in re
ference to the objects of the Association, and read his exposition of

                observed,       Members
many   of  them were not         yet Members         all. The Committee had

                                                                               to to

ferent theories which have been propounded                  philosophers by    this             on
subject. There are three leading hypotheses: first, that which sup
poses metallic veins        have been open fissures, caused
                               to                                     some erup

above; the second theory                     is,
                                     that these fissures were formed          vio               by
lence done    by  the strata, and filled
                                                        up   by
                                                  matter from within the earth,
forced  up      to
               heat, and becoming mineral substance; the third theory
                                                   a
is,  that the whole formation was contemporaneous with the rocks
themselves.      Each       these theories was investigated
                               of                                    the Report,       in

    Mr. Greenough, as President of the Geological department.
    Mr. Garnons, as President of the Natural History department.
    Dr. Haviland, as President of the Medical department.
    Professor Christie then read a Report on Magnetism ; in which he
 considered, first, the direction of the terrestrial magnetic force ; and
 secondly, the intensity of the magnetic force. In the course of this Re
 port the learned Professor regretted that this was the only country in
 Europe in which observations on this important science were not made
 in a national observatory.
    Mr. Whewell then delivered a Report on the knowledge we have
 of the strength of materials; in which he entered into the history of
 that science, and presented a variety of facts in illustration of his sub
ject. After which the Meeting adjourned.
    A numerous auditory again assembled in the Senate-House this
evening, the several Sections being engaged in their different de
partments. At about ten o'clock Professor Sedgwick took the chair.
    Mr. Whewell delivered an exposition of his recent researches rela
tive to the tide-wave, illustrating them by reference to maps which he
had constructed for the purpose.                                             -
    Professor Farish addressed the    Meeting   on the subjects of railways
and steam-carriages.
   June 28.—The several Sections met as usual at ten o'clock; and
at one o'clock the last Public Meeting of the Association was held in
the Senate-House.
   The President announced that the Report read by Mr. Whewell had
been printed; and that any Member of the Association might receive
a copy of it gratuitously, by applying at the Society's office.       It was
printed, not at the expense of the Association, but of Mr. Whewell
himself; to whom the thanks of the Association were afterwards re
turned,                                                             -

     The Reports of the Sections were then presented by the respective
 Chairmen.
     Mr. Challis read a paper on the Theory of Fluids; in which he
 treated of the leading hydrostatical and hydrodynamical problems; the
 latter of which chiefly occupied his attention, and which he divided in
 the following manner:—1st, the motion of fluids in vessels and pipes;
 2nd, the determination of the velocity of the propagation of motion in
 air; 3rd, the musical vibrations of the air; 4th, the theory of waves;
 5th, resistance to a ball pendulum, supposing it to oscillate in a small
 degree.
    The President announced, that since the preceding day, among the
 names which had been enrolled by the Committee, were the names
 of the illustrious Dr. Chalmers, Professor Jameson, and Dr. Henry,
 sen., of Manchester; on each of whom he passed a high eulogium,
 and who were then elected Members of the Association by acclama
 tion.
    He then stated that the Meeting for 1834 would take place at Edin
 burgh, in the month of September, probably in the early part of                                               it;

   One of                  called the Nottington Spa, rises about
                    these springs,
three miles from  Weymouth,     and has been known and frequented
for a considerable time. The other, named the Radipole Spa, is
of recent discovery, and is only one mile distant from the town.
   The saline contents of these waters are so small in quantity, that
they must be considered as quite inert; and therefore those who
wish to avail themselves merely of the sulphuretted hydrogen, may

                              have found scarcely any variation in the
          of the saline matter of the Nottington Spa; but that of the
Radipole has varied a little. The proportions of sulphuretted hy
drogen, however, differed considerably at different times in both.
The only circumstance which I have constantly observed respecting
the sulphuretted hydrogen                              is,
                                     that the Radipole Spa always con

                    ELASTIC FLUIDS EVOLVED FROM VOLCANOS.
  M. Boussingault having examined the     gases emitted from many
of the volcanos near the equator, has arrived at the following con
clusions:—
   1st. That the elastic fluids disengaged from the volcanos near the
equator, are the same in the different volcanos; viz. vapour of water
in great quantity; carbonic acid gas, sulphuretted hydrogen gas,
and sometimes the vapour of sulphur.
   2ndly. That the sulphurous acid and azote, which are met with
in the craters of these volcanos, are to be considered as accidental
substances.
   3rdly. That muriatic acid, hydrogen and azote are not among the
gases disengaged from the volcanos at the equator.—Ann.   de Chim.

brought me to a point at which it was essential for the further
prosecution of my inquiries that no doubt should remain of
the identity or distinction of electricities excited by different
means.    It is perfectly true that Cavendisht, Wollastoni, Col
ladonS and others, have in turn removed some of the greatest
objections to the acknowledgement of the identity of common,
animal and voltaic electricity, and I believe that philosophers
generally consider these electricities as really the same.   But
on the other hand it is also true, that the accuracy of Wol
laston's experiments has been denied], and that one of them,

 mon electricity (309. 327.), has been that selected by several
 experimenters as the test of chemical action (336. 346.). It
 is a fact, too, that many philosophers are still drawing distinc
 tions between the electricities from different sources; or at
 least doubting whether their identity is proved. Sir Humphry
 Davy, for instance, in his paper on the Torpedo”, thought it
probable that animal electricity would be found of a peculiar
kind; and referring to that, in association with common elec
 tricity, voltaic electricity and magnetism, has said, “Distinc
tions might be established in pursuing the various modifica
tions or properties of electricity in these different forms, &c.”
 Indeed I need only refer to the last volume of the Philosophi
 cal Transactions to show that the question is by no means
 considered as settledt.
    266. Notwithstanding, therefore, the general impression of
 the identity of electricities, it is evident that the proofs have
not been sufficiently clear and distinct to obtain approbation

 164   Dr. Faraday's Experimental    Researches in Electricity.
 magnetic or chemical action. In this, however, was found
 no point of discordance between voltaic and common electri
 city; for when a Leyden battery (291.) was charged so as to
 deflect the gold leaf electrometer equally, the points were found
 equally unable to discharge it with such effect as to produce
 either magnetic or chemical action. This was not because
 common electricity could not produce both these effects (307.
 310.), but because when of such low intensity the quantity
 required to make the effects visible (being enormously great
  (371. 375.),) could not be transmitted in any reasonable time.
 In conjunction with the proofs of identity hereafter to be given,
 these effects of points also prove identity instead of difference
 between voltaic and common electricity.
    271. As heated air discharges common electricity with far
 greater facility than points,   I hoped that voltaic electricity
might in this way also be discharged. An apparatus was
therefore constructed (fig. 5.), in which AB is an insulated
glass rod upon which two copper wires, C, D, are fixed
firmly; to these copper wires are soldered two pieces of fine
platina wire, the ends of which are brought very close to each
other at e, but without touching;              Fiig. 5.
the copper
        pp   wire C was connected
with the positive pole of a vol
taic battery, and the wire D with
a decomposing apparatus (312.
316.), from which the communi
cation was completed to the nega
tive pole of the battery. In these
experiments only two troughs,
or twenty pairs of plates, were
used.
    272. Whilst in the state described, no decomposition took
place at the point a, but when the side of a spirit-lamp flame
was applied to the two platina extremities at e, so as to make
them bright red-hot, decomposition occurred; iodine soon
appeared at the point a, and the transference of electricity
through the heated air was established.      On raising the tem
perature of the points e by a blowpipe, the discharge was ren
dered still more free, and decomposition took place instantly.
On removing the source of heat, the current immediately
ceased.     On putting the ends of the wires very close by the
side of and parallel to each other, but not touching, the effects
were perhaps more readily obtained than before. On using
a larger voltaic battery (270.), they were also more freely ob
tained.
    273. On removing the decomposing apparatus and inter

posing a galvanometer instead, heating the points e as the
needle would swing one way, and removing the heat during
the time of     return (302.), feeble deflections were soon ob
                    its
tained: thus also proving the current through heated air; but
the instrument used was not so sensible under the circum
stances as chemical action.
   274. These effects, not hitherto known               expected under       or
this form, are only cases                  of

     291. The electric battery consisted of fifteen equal jars.
They are coated eight inches upwards from the bottom, and
are twenty-three inches in circumference, so that each contains
one hundred and eighty-four square inches of glass, coated
on both sides, independent of the bottoms, which are thicker
glass, and contain each about fifty square inches.
     292. A good discharging train was arranged by connecting
metallically a sufficiently thick wire with, first, the metallic
gas pipes of the house, then with the metallic gas pipes be
longing to the public gas works of London; and finally, with
the metallic water pipes of London.               It was so effectual as to
carry off instantaneously electricity of the feeblest tension,
even that of a single voltaic trough, and was essential to many           -
of the experiments.
     293. The galvanometer was one or the other of those
formerly described (87. 205.), but the glass jar covering it and
supporting the needle was coated inside and outside with tin
foil, and the upper part (left uncoated, that the motions of
 the needle might be examined,) was covered with a frame of
 wire-work, having numerous sharp points projecting from                                  it.
 When this frame and the two coatings were connected with
 the discharging train (292.),               insulated point

and finally, when the battery had been positively charged by
 about forty turns of the machine, it was discharged by the
 rod and the thread through the galvanometer. The needle
immediately moved.

XXXII.        On the Inflection     of Light, in Reply     to Professor
                 Powell.     By John BART.on, Esq.”
     AM     much indebted to Professor Powell for the candid
     and friendly manner in which he has commented on the
objections to the undulatory theory of light, which          I   adduced
in my former communication. On the present occasion                     I
propose, first, to make a few remarks in explanation or justifica
                I
tion of what before advanced; and then to suggest another
hypothesis, which       I persuade myself is capable of explaining
the phaenomena of inflection more completely and satisfactorily
than that of Fresnel.
    The first question at issue between the undulationists and
myself relates to a matter of fact. Newton found that when
a beam of light is suffered to fall on a very narrow slit, the
beam parts in the middle, leaving a dark space between the
 two portions into which it is divided. This result agrees with
 my own observation. Professor Airy, on the contrary, finds
 the centre of the spectrum always relatively bright, however
 narrow the slit through which the light passes.               I  have no
 wish to disparage Professor Airy's authority; but must be     I
 permitted to prefer the testimony of my own senses, sup
 ported as it is by the observations of Newton, and even,                I
 think   I   may add, by the observations of Professor Powell.
 For  although    this gentleman has not succeeded in reproducing
 the phenomena under the exact form described by me, and
 delineated in my last communication, he has said enough to
 convince every one who reflects on the subject, of the possibi
 lity of so succeeding when the experiment is repeated with due
 precaution.      “When,” says he, “the edges approached very
 nearly,    I observed something like the appearance described
 by Mr. Barton, but with this difference, that the boundaries
 of the dark space, instead of being continuous, diverged either
 way into the shadow in hyperbolic lines.” Now, I am sure that
 if Professor Powell will reconsider the question, he will see
 that, from the nature of the hyperbola, there must, on his own
 showing, be a certain width of interval between the two knife
 blades, giving a result such as        I have described.      In fact, it
 is easy,  from the    hyperbolic  form of the   lines, combined with
 Newton's observation that the dark space begins to appear
 when the interval between the two blades is less than the four
 hundredth part of an inch, to assign the precise distance at
 which the blades must be placed, and the degree of curvature
 they must possess, in order to give a dark space of any re
 quired figure and dimensions.        I need not dwell on this point,
    * Communicated    by the Author: see our preceding volume, p. 424.

            Mr. Barton    on the Inflection    of Light.            173
since the details of the computation will be readily supplied
by any one versed in mathematics.    But I may add, that if
Professor Powell will employ blades of less curvature, he will
find the experiment succeed more readily. Those employed
by him in repeating my experiment had, if I do not mistake,
so inconsiderable a radius of curvature as to reduce the             di
mensions of the dark space within a limit too small to be con
veniently observed.
    It would seem, indeed, from his subsequent observations,
that Professor Powell is not quite sure whether to admit or
not the correctness of Newton's observation; for after saying
that he cannot succeed in obtaining the results described by
me, he goes on to assign certain considerations which may
serve, he thinks, to reconcile the phaenomena with the undu
latory hypothesis, even supposing the facts to be such as I have
asserted.     The formulae of Fresnel, he says, always suppose
the opening through which the light enters the darkened
chamber to be a mathematical point: whereas Newton em
ployed for this purpose a hole a quarter of an inch in breadth.
But the experiment succeeds with me equally well, whether
the opening in question be large or small, while it fails equally
in either case with Professor Airy; this cannot, therefore, be
the source of the different results obtained by us.       Indeed it
appears quite incredible that the enlargement or contraction
of the aperture by which the light enters the chamber can
produce a difference of such a kind as supposed by Professor
 Powell. That a change in the dimensions of the aperture
 should affect the breadth or intensity of the dark space may
 be readily imagined; but that such a change should convert
 light into darkness appears inconceivable.
     The second observation of Professor Powell under this
       I                  I
 head am apprehensive do not fully comprehend. He says,
“It    results from the well-known fact of the enlargement of the
 shadows of the two edges beyond their geometrical boundaries,
 that these shadows will coalesce before the edges meet;......and
 this seems very likely to have been the real result observed by
 Newton.”       Surely the formulae of Fresnel are intended to
 comprise the whole of the phenomena, including among the
 rest that enlargement of the shadow to which Professor Powell
 alludes. If   so,it  cannot  beallowable     employ this enlarge
                                             to
 ment as an after correction        the results of calculations de
                                   to
 duced from those formulae.
     With regard     to another objection advanced        by
                                                        me against
  the theory of    Fresnel,-its inconsistency with the observa
  tions of Newton and Biot on the distance       which the first of
                                                  at
the   dark bands cross one another      in   the centre    of   the spec

 174                    Mr. Barton             on the Inflection          of Light,
trum,_Professor Powell thinks these observations not to be
relied on, as being of earlier date, and performed with ap
paratus less susceptible of accuracy than that employed by
  Fresnel.          I
                 must observe, however, that the question at issue
 does not rest on the comparative accuracy of the methods of
 observation employed.           Fresnel has not recorded any experi
 ments made under circumstances similar to those which gave
 to Newton and Biot results so much at variance with his
 theory. He examined in two cases only the distance at which
 the first dark bands are found to intersect. In these two cases
 the width of the slit was, respectively, two millimetres, and one
 millimetre and a half”; whereas the discordant results given
 by the observations of Newton and Biot relate to widths be
 low one millimetre, or the twenty-fifth part of an inch.             Even,
 therefore, if the observations of Fresnel were as far superior
 in accuracy to those of his predecessors as Professor Powell
 assumes, it would not be decisive in favour of his theory.
 But I confess                I
                       cannot see any sufficient ground for attri
 buting to the observations of Fresnel such unmeasured supe
 riority as has been supposed.                          I
                                           cannot think that if Fresnel
 deserves       all
                 confidence       the hundredth part
                                            to                  millimetre,        of  a

178            Mr. Barton  on the Inflection of Light.
excepting a small orifice or slit, and blow strongly through
it against  the flame of a candle. The flickering motion of the
flame will show that the air does not issue from the orifice in
an uniform stream, but in a succession of rapidly alternating
movements.       This fact was observed by Dr. Young, and de
scribed by him in a paper published in the Philosophical
Transactions for 1800.       The mode of observation that he
employed was, indeed, somewhat different from that here de
 scribed: he contrived to render the issuing current of air vi
 sible by combining it with smoke.      If the pressure is increas
 ed, a whistling sound is produced; affording another kind of
 proof that the air in passing through the orifice is thrown into
 a state of undulation.
    Now, if the particles of light be supposed to constitute an
 elastic fluid, it is evident that a phaenomenon of the same
 kind must take place whenever a stream of this fluid impinges
 upon a narrow aperture; and in this case the formulae of
 Fresnel will be applicable, with some modification, to the hy
 pothesis here proposed, as well as to the hypothesis which
 supposes light to consist in the vibrations of an imaginary
 aether; and with this advantage, that an obvious reason is
 assigned why the undulations are found to have their origin
 at the aperture by which the light enters: for which no rea
 son, as it appears to me, can be given on the opposite theory.
     By the help of the same principle it might also be ex
 plained, I think, why a beam of light passing through a very
 narrow slit, is separated into two portions, leaving a dark
 space between them; and why the formulae of Fresnel are
 found to fail in approaching this limit.       But it would, per
 haps, be out of place at present to enlarge on these questions,
 which are not likely to excite much interest while the theory
 on which they rest is not yet recognised or established.         I
 could bring forward other considerations in abundance which
 appear to me decisive against the undulatory hypothesis; but
 it seems preferable thoroughly to investigate and discuss, in
 the first instance, the circumstances of one or two classes of
 phaenomena, rather than to lose ourselves in a wider circle
 of reasoning.
     I cannot conclude without again expressing my sense of the
 friendly spirit in which Professor Powell has criticized my
 former observations.     I should be fastidious indeed, if I did
 not perceive and acknowledge that his remarks deserve to be
 considered in no other light than as intended, and as calcu
 lated, “to promote the common cause of scientific truth.”

    We thus            see that the factor sin”g which arose out                                                  of the
process of finding (5) is really a foreign factor introduced, as
those factors so generally are, by elimination: and we see too
how it arose; viz. by Bernoulli and D'Alembert having can
celled the factor cosec * g from equation (4) merely because it
was a factor of the whole equation.     Had this view occurred to
them, they would have depressed their biquadratic to a qua
dratic at once, and have escaped the embarrassment created
by attempting to prove that certain roots contained in it did
not fulfill the conditions of the problem, and were therefore
inadmissible.     But an important question here arose—what
is the signification of this result, and how did it make           ap                                              its
pearance intermingled with the proper solution of the problem                                                             *

ployed in reducing to a vacuum, the effect of the motion of
the fluid not being taken into account. According to our
theory mºvº is to be added, in consequence of the simultaneous
movement of the air with the pendulum.       The reasoning led
to the conclusion that so little  change of density takes place
at the surface of the ball, that we may consider the air to be
put in motion just as if it were incompressible. The influence
of the air carried by the suspending wire was neglected in the
theory. Also the surface of the ball was supposed to be per
fectly smooth, so as to impress no motion on the aérial parti

contact with the ball will move in directions normal to its
surface, and consequently directed to a centre.   Because the
density is very nearly unchanged, the velocity at a given                                                     in
stant will very nearly vary at different points, in a radius
produced, inversely as the square of the distance from the
Centre.

    Legs moderately long and robust; the anterior and posterior
 pairs, which are the longest, equal in length; the third pair
 is the shortest.
    The spiders of this genus fabricate small horizontal sheets
 of web of a slight texture, among coarse herbage, or in cavities
 beneath stones, on the under side of which they take their sta

 the eyes are seated, elevated but obtuse; the posterior part
 depressed, with an indentation in the medial line.            Mandibles
 strong, armed with teeth on the inner surface, and inclined
 towards the pectus which is heart-shaped.             Maxillae enlarged

 parts are of a very dark brownish-black colour.                Legs and
 palpi provided with erect spines; their colour is reddish
 brown, with bands of a darker hue.                Both of the superior
 tarsal claws are     pectinated,    and the inferior one is inflected

peculiarities of structure on which the generic character is
established.     The lateral margins of the cephalothorax are
strongly dentated, and a series of short sharp spines, slightly

half fathoms of limestone and ten fathoms and a half of sand

stone and twenty-one fathoms of soft sandstone. The Ele
more Pits are one mile south-west of the Hetton Pits, and the
Eppleton about one mile north-east of the Hetton Pits.” In
this part of the district the dip of the coal beds is towards the
east, at the rate of one yard in twenty-two; but along the coast
of Northumberland, and as far south as Manor Walls End",
at the mouth of the Tyne, they rise rapidly to the east, as well
as more gently towards the west.     On the other hand the coal
measures south of the river Wear continue to'dip regularly to
the eastward. Even at Hetton the high main coal had not re
covered the good quality it was formerly known to possess on
the Tyne; but the low main, a very inferior coal, from being
brittle and breaking into small fragments before reaching the
London market, is at Hetton and other Wear water collieries
a coal of very superior quality.      In                     all

instantaneous movement of the needle as evident in one case
as in the other.     So far, then, as promptitude of transmission
through long wires is a distinction, thermo-electricity does not
differ from the other kinds.
     The magnetest employed in these experiments consists of a
pair of sewing needles, 3 inches long, the lower one having
just enough of predominance to give them terrestrial direction.
 The conductor, which passes only once between them, and
 returns beneath the lower needle, consists of four lengths of
 bright copper bell-wire laid together, not twisted, the ends
 amalgamated, and working into mercury boxes. A pair, of
 copper and tinned iron, by the heat of the fingers gives a de
 flection about 25°.
     A guide-cross lies between the mercury boxes, to keep
 always before the eyes the relations between the current and
 the needle.
     It is constructed of two slips of
 card, fastened in the centre, one
  over the other, with sealing-wax;
  one representing the magnet, the
  other the conducting wire.          On
  the latter an arrow is drawn (on
  both sides) to indicate the direc
  tion of the current; on the former
  a line, also on both sides, to
  stinguish the marked pole.

  II.   Is Thermo-electricity produced at the expense   of Caloric2
    3. Into the smaller neck of a tubulated receiver was fixed
 an open glass tube, reaching obliquely to the bottom, and
 bent, siphonwise, on the outside, so as to descend a little lower
 than the inner end: it was then again bent upward, nearly at
 a right angle, and to this rising end a scale was attached.
   Into the receiver     was poured water tinged with cochineal,
 and covered with a stratum of oil, to prevent evaporation by
 the heat. Suction being now applied to the end, the liquid
 remained, on the principle of the siphon, a few degrees up
 on the scale. A cork thoroughly soaked in grease being fitted
 to the open neck, the whole constituted a very sensitive air
 thermometer.
    The cork was now perforated by two wires; one of copper,
 the other of tinned iron; the latter bent off at each end, so that
 it could be brought into contact with, or separated from the
 copper by a slight turn with the fingers. Both ends of each
 wire were doubled, flattened and polished to ensure good
 contact; they projected about three inches into the receiver,
and nine inches outside.      .                    -
    Being now set in contact, the cork was drawn out, and the
 ends of the wires which entered the bulb were placed between
a fold of sheet copper, and heated by holding them for a given
time (25%) over an Argand gas light, being turned over at 15°,
to equalize the heat in both wires. The sheet copper being
now drawn off, the hot ends were thrust into the bulb, and
the cork pressed in air-tight.   The fluid rose quickly to about
90° (more or less, depending on slight differences in the heat,
and in the quickness and force with which the cork was pressed

    The charge being now made such                     warm the silver  as   to

wire, of equal diameter throughout, produced no current when
heated in any part; but a knob being made in the circle, and
heat applied near                 it,    on

in favour of the conducting power of copper, down to a very
low heat, and at   # an inch distance.
    15. To try at still shorter distances, two other lengths of
the same wire were twisted together for , an inch, then separated
for an inch, and the other ends brought near together, for
holding in a pair of cold pliers. (The twist was tarnished, to
prevent metallic contact between the mercury and copper,
which also was the object of the thread-binding in the former
part of the experiment.) Spots of lard were now placed, at
equal distances from the twist, on the iron and on the copper,
and the twist plunged into the warm mercury. The lard became
transparent (by melting) first on the copper; and this on repe
tition, whatever the distances, down to ºth of an inch; and what
ever the temperature, so long as it was sufficient to melt the
lard at all. Varying the sizes and proportions of the wires,
tinning their surfaces, to prevent unequal waste of heat, in
transitu, by radiation, did not alter the result. In every in
stance, for equal distances, the lard first became transparent
upon the copper wire; which is thereby proved, for low heats
and short distances, to retain its character as the better con
ductor for caloric.
    16. To ascertain the conducting powers for electricity of
very low tension, a pair of iron and a pair of copper wires,
atomically proportioned as before, and each 2 inches long,
had     an inch at each end bent down at right angles, and the
points tinned, for equal contact with the mercury.       Through
these   wires,  two other   mercury   boxes were connected with
those of the magnetest, an iron and a copper wire being em
ployed on each side.      Into the further boxes dipped the ends
of a thermo-electric pair, of copper and tinned iron, of which
the other ends were twisted together, and the twist was ex
posed to an equable heat, until the needle became stationary
at 18°.
    The short iron wires were now removed, leaving the con
duction to be carried on by the short copper ones only: no
appreciable change took place in the deflection.
   The iron wires being now replaced, the copper ones were
removed, leaving the conduction entirely to the iron. The
needle receded more than a degree, and sometimes nearly 2°,
confirming the superiority of copper as an electrical con
ductor, for extreme low tension and very short distances.
    17. But as heat also enters into the question, the apparatus
remaining as described, a spirit-lamp was brought under the
middle of the copper leg of the thermo-electric pair, and con
tinued there until the point acted upon by the flame became
red hot,    Little or no change took place in the deflection.

   The lamp being then removed to the iron leg, the needle
receded 2° before the heat had attained redness.          Thus the
conducting power of iron suffered more from heat than that
of copper.
   18. Iron being thus proved to beinferior in conducting power,
both for heat and electricity, in circumstances directly in point,
to copper, cannot owe                             its

lies. The first scientific attempt that was made to compare the de
veloped theory with any extensive range of observations, was that of
Daniel Bernouilli in 1740: the subject has since been pursued by
Laplace and Bouvard, and still more recently by Mr. Lubbock. But
the comparison of contemporaneous tides has hitherto been unac
countably neglected : and to this particular branch of the subject the
researches of the author are in this paper especially directed; the
principal object of his inquiry being to ascertain the position of what
may be called cotidal lines, that       lines drawn through         the adja

     February  27.-A   paper, commenced during the last Session,     en
 titled “Description of Parts of the Kingdoms of Valencia, Murcia,
 and Granada, in the South of Spain,” by Capt. Cook, R.N. F.G.S.,
 was concluded.
     A paper entitled “Observations relative to the Structure and
 Origin of the Diamond,” by Sir David Brewster, K.C.H. LL.D.
 F.G.S. &c., was then read.
    In the year 1820, the author communicated to the Royal Society
 of Edinburgh a singular fact relative to the structure of the dia
 mond, accompanied with some conjectures respecting the origin of
 this remarkable gem :-the present essay may be viewed as a con
 tinuation and extension of the same inquiry.
    The author refers to the remark of Newton, that amber and the
 diamond have a refractive power three times greater in respect of
 their densities than several other substances; and he quotes New
 ton's conjecture, founded on that remark, of the diamond being
 probably, like amber, an unctuous substance coagulated.        In proof
 of the intimate relation between the inflammability and absolute
 refractive power of bodies, Sir D. Brewster adds the facts, that
 sulphur and phosphorus exceed even the diamond in absolute power
 of refraction, and that these three inflammables stand before all
 solid and fluid substances in their absolute action upon light.
    Another close analogy between the diamond and amber, inde
 pendently of their like locality and carbonaceous nature, was traced
by the author in their polarizing structure.      Both of these minerals
contain within their substance small cells or cavities, filled with air,
the expansive force of which has communicated a polarizing struc
ture to the parts in immediate contact with the air. The descrip
tion of this structure, which is displayed from sectors of polarized
light encircling the globule of air, is illustrated by drawings.
    The author contends that the peculiar polarizing power around
the cavities in amber and in the diamond must have been occa
sioned by the expansive force of the confined substance, supposed
to be gaseous, compressing the sides of the cells, while the sub
stance of the minerals was in a soft and yielding condition.          A
similar structure may be produced in glass, or in gelatinous masses,
by a compressing force, propagated circularly from a point.
    Having thus shown that the diamond was at one time in a soft or
pasty state, the author argues that this state was not produced by
igneous fusion.    For in his laborious examination of the cavities in
crystals, both natural and artificial, such as topaz, quartz, amethyst,
chrysoberyl, &c., and in salts, he observed the condition of many
thousand cavities; but in no case, neither in crystals formed by
means of igneous fusion nor by aqueous solution, did he observe

a single cavity in which the expansible fluid within had communi
cated a polarizing structure, similar to that around the cavities in
the diamond.     He believes, therefore, that the softness must have
been that of semi-indurated gum; and that the diamond was de
rived from the decomposition of vegetable matter, as is admitted to
have been the case with amber.     The crystallized condition of the
diamond is not to be considered as decisive against this inference,
since the mineral called mellite has a distinct crystallized form,
while      its
          composition and locality attest  vegetable origin                 a                                     *.

balls, like volcanic bombs, of varieties of trachyte, quite distinct in
character from any found en masse. It is traversed in many places
by trap dykes; and as these last are also found traversing solid tra
chyte, the subsequent eruption of the trap is demonstrated. He
discovered no instance of the recurrence of trachyte after basalt had
begun to flow. There is on the side of the Rhine, opposite to the
Siebengebirge, an extinct volcano, of comparatively modern date,
the Rodderberg, composed of cinders and scorified rocks. The cra
ter is about a quarter of a mile in diameter, and a hundred feet
deep; a farm-house, surrounded by corn-fields, stands in the middle
of it.
   The brown coal formation is        composed of beds of loose sand,
sandstone, and compact siliceous conglomerate, which often, in mi
neral structure, cannot be distinguished from many varieties of grau
wacke; of clay, abounding with balls and layers of clay ironstone;
and of many varieties of lignite, from the state of a light brown earth,
to a black compact shining mass, or jet. All of these are frequently
met with in thick beds, and the lignite is most extensively worked for
fuel. They contain numerous impressions of leaves, and stems of
trees are very abundant. With the exception of casts of Lymnara and
Planorbis, in an opake white chert, of very limited extent, no shells,
fresh-water or marine, nor any remains of mammalia or birds, have
been found in any part of the formation; but in some beds of the
lignite, impressions of fresh-water fishes, the Leuciscus papyraceus of
Agassiz, are found in great abundance, and there have also been found
extinct species of frog, salamander, and triton, together with remains
of insects, which Professor Goldfuss considers to belong to the genera
Lucanus, Cerambyr, Anthrax, Cantharis, and eight others.
   The author submitted the specimens which contain impressions of
leaves, to the examination of Professor Lindley. Most of them are in
too imperfect a state to admit of any accurate determination, but
they consist generally of casts of portions of dicotyledonous leaves;
and among them are two species, the existence of which is suffi
cient to determine the relative age of the formation, and, with great
probability, the then warm climate of the North of Germany, viz.
Cinnamomum dulce and Podocarpus macrophyllus: there are besides
impressions of leaves very clearly belonging to the Palm. It is re
markable, however, that a recent examination by Professor Nögge
rath of Bonn, and M. Cotta of Heidelberg, of an extensive suite of the
woods found in this brown coal formation, did not disclose a single in
stance of a monocotyledonous tree.
   A vast deposit of gravel, chiefly composed of quartz, but containing
also a few fragments of basalt, trachyte, transition limestone, and
bunter sandstein, lies over the brown coal formation, sometimes
being only a thin covering, at others attaining a thickness of 125
feet.   It is very distinct in character from the gravel now forming the
bed of the Rhine, and is older than some of the volcanic eruptions,

  tive age of this brown coal formation, a task extremely difficult, from
 the almost total absence of shells, and the imperfect state of the
 means of determining an epoch of formation by fossil plants. By
  previous writers it has been assigned to the plastic clay of the Paris
 basin ; but it appears to the author to possess no other character of
 identity than the mineral composition of some of the beds, and the
 occurrence of lignite, which prove nothing as to age. The amphi
 bious animal remains resemble those of the great fresh-water deposit
 of GEningen; but the few shells which occur, and the plants, are
 identical in species with many of those occurring in the older fresh
 water beds of Aix in Provence. It seems to be very clear, that it is
 an exclusively lacustrine deposit, and the organic remains, the only
 evidence of age to be relied on where there is none from superpo
 sition of other beds, imperfect as they are, would seem to indicate a
 more modern date than the plastic clay. The author states that a
 distinguished geologist of Bonn has expressed his belief that it is
 even older than the chalk; but that although the opinions of that
 experienced observer are entitled to great respect, he cannot recon
 cile the phaenomena described with anything known respecting the
secondary rocks.
     The determination of the age of this brown coal formation is of the
 highest importance, as fixing the periods of eruption of the extinct vol
 canos of the Lower Rhine; for the author of this paper shows, that the
 trachytic tuff contains leaves of plants identical with those found in
 the clay and sandstone deposits; that extensive layers of trachytic
 tuff are interstratified with the beds of the formation in many places;
 and that in one situation a mass of basalt, thirty feet thick, lies upon
 beds of coal thirteen feet in thickness. The conclusions which the
 facts appear to the author to justify, are, that there existed a vast
 fresh-water lake, in which the brown coal beds were deposited ; that
during that deposition volcanos burst forth at the bottom of the lake,
as they do now at the bottom of the sea; and that a continuance of
volcanic action, or of elevatory force, raised the Siebengebirge after
the deposit had ceased,—perhaps at the very time when the basalt or
trap eruptions took place, since near the summit of the Mandeberg,
a columnar basaltic cone, there is a patch of brown coal beds at the
height of nine hundred feet above the surface of the Rhine.
     The last great formation, if it may be so termed, of this district,
lying upon the gravel in which the present bed of the Rhine is cut,
is that most remarkable deposit the Loess, a friable sandy loam, full
of existing species of land shells, without river shells, and without
plants, but containing bones of the Elephas primigenius and Rhino
ceros tichorinus.     It is found in detached masses, of vast thickness,
but without any signs of stratification, and sometimes at a height of
600 feet above the Rhine, and may be traced with scarcely any inter
ruption from Bonn to Basle, a distance of 250 miles. The author
states that   all
                the facts yet observed with respect     to   it,
                                                           lead him   to
conjecture that     its
                    origin may have been owing      the sudden burst

    March 27.-The first part of a memoir “On the sedimentary de
posits which occupy the western parts of Shropshire and Hereford
shire, and are prolonged from N.E. to S.W., through Radnor, Breck
nock, and Caermarthenshires, with descriptions of the accompanying
rocks of intrusive or igneous characters,” by Roderick Impey Mur
chison, Esq. F.G.S. F.R.S. &c., was read.
    After adverting to the want of definite knowledge of the order of
succession, and of the fossiliferous characters of those great deposits
anterior to the old red sandstone, and commonly called transition
rocks (fossiliferous grauwacke, De la Beche), the author states that
the task of attempting to separate them into distinct formations, was
first suggested to him by the very clear and perfect exhibition of their
details in the country under review.

last summers, and has for                  its

of eruption of much basaltic matter.

these succeed micaceous flagstones and thin-bedded building stones,

   In this part of the memoir the author separates into distinct for
mations by the evidences of fossils and the order of superposition,
the upper portions of those vast sedimentary accumulations, which
have hitherto been known only under the common terms of transi

sandstone, which formation he had described in the previous part of
the memoir, he proceeds to give an account of the underlying de
posits as they succeed to each other in descending order in Shrop
shire and Herefordshire.

  III.  Lower Ludlow Rock.—Equivalent, “Die Earth.”
   This group is chiefly made up of incoherent, grayish, argillaceous
schist, seldom micaceous. The higher strata are in some places
charged with many Orthocerata of new and undescribed species,
Lituites, Asaphus caudatus, &c. Other beds are locally distinguished
by concretions of argillaceous limestone, formed around corals and
other organic bodies; and towards the base of this deposit a thin
calcareous zone is observable in Shropshire, containing the Penta
merus laevis and a new species of that bivalve, both differing from the
species noted in the overlying group 2. The thickness is supposed
to exceed 2000 feet.
   The dislocations and faults on the Severn are described, by which
this unproductive shale or “Die Earth” is brought in one point into
unconformable contact with, and in another passes conformably be
neath, the coal fields of Madeley and Brosely.
   IV. Shelly Sandstones.—Equivalent,
    Red and green colours predominate in these sandstones, although
purple and white are also frequently observed; by which charac
ters, as well as by the nature of the stone and the specific differences
in the organic remains, this formation is clearly distinguished from
any of the overlying groups.        Associated with the sandy strata are
calcareous bands, almost made up of Productae, Leptaenae, and Spi
riferi, with crinoidal remains,              all
                                      differing from those       the superior           in

    On the Latitude and Longitude of the Cape Observatory.                                         By
Mr. Henderson.
    In this paper Mr. Henderson assumes the geographical position of
the Cape Observatory to be 33° 56' 3" south latitude; in 13m 56s
east longitude from Greenwich; the former being determined from
his own observations, and the latter from those of Mr. Fallows com
pared by Mr. Henderson with the corresponding observations made
at European observatories. From the determination of the longitude
of the Cape Observatory here stated, compared with observations
made by Lieut. Meadows and by Capt. Owen, Mr. Henderson also
finds that the longitudes of the two Capes which inclose False Bay
may be stated as follows:—
        Cape of Good Hope . . . . . . 18°29' 0"
        False Cape . . . . . . . . . .       18 50 30 east of Greenwich.

I found, to my great astonishment, that, at the time when I had ob
served the satellite at extreme elongation, the tables represented it
as between the earth and Jupiter.       I satisfied myself that this was
owing to no error in my own calculations, and I then compared La
place's numbers with those of Halley and Delambre.         From the tables
of the former I could only infer that there was some very strange
error in Laplace's epoch for 1750; from the mean conjunctions of

   On the Attraction of Spheroids, by G. Green, Esq. In this paper
the author presents certain analytical formulae, in reference to triple
integrals of a more general form than those offered in the attractions
of spheroids of arbitrary form and density, and applies them to the
problem of the attractions of ellipsoids, so as to comprise the ac
tions on points, internal and external, in a common process, by the
addition of a positive quantity, under the radical sign in the expres
sion, for the reciprocal distance between the point acted on and any
point of the ellipsoid, which quantity is afterwards made to vanish.

bouring places, and consequently, that the cause which conveyed
them was entirely local.

    6thly, The period during which the bone caves were formed was
 extremely long.
   7thly, In certain caverns, the mud, bones, and pebbles have been
 simultaneously introduced; in others, on the contrary, the mud has
 been deposited after the bones.

24.2                 Mr. Faraday               on holding the Breath
nary circumstances.        It is as follows:—If a person inspire
deeply, he will be able immediately after to hold breath for a
time, varying with his health, and also very much with the state
of exertion or repose in which he may be at the instant. A
man, during an active walk, may not be able to cease from
breathing for more than half a minute, who, after a period of
rest on a chair or in bed, may refrain for a minute or a minute
and a half, or even two minutes.          But if that person will pre
pare himself by breathing in a manner deep, hard and quick,
(as he would naturally do after running,) and, ceasing that ope
ration with his lungs full of air, then hold his breath as long
as he is able, he will find that the time during which he can
remain without breathing will be double, or even more than
double the former, other circumstances being the same.                                                   I

     Avoid         all

quart jar with water over the pneumatic trough, and with a
piece of tube and a forced expiration throw the air from the

a lighted taper put into that air will be immediately extin

   A very curious fact connected with the time of holding the
breath was observed by Mr. Brunel, jun., and has, I think,
never been published.        After the river had broken into the
tunnel at Rotherhithe, Mr. Brunel descended with a com
panion (Mr. Gravatt, I think,) in a diving-bell, to examine the
place: at the depth of about 30 feet of water, the bell touched
the bottom of the river, and was over the hole; covering                                                    it,

have greatly tended          support the theory
                                    in to                coal being            of                        a    la

shores,           or
                 were washed into them              rivers.    This mode
of   accounting for the coal strata, which has long been consi
dered         the most plausible
             as                        geologists,    byopen      insupera    is          to

             the Mode  of Deposition of the Coal Strata.     247
ble objections, which must occur to the mind of every one who
is adequate to the consideration of the present circumstances
of inland lakes, even in the most thickly-wooded countries.
But without dwelling upon these objections, I shall proceed
to notice two facts which have but lately been brought to
light, and which appear to me to be of the most conclusive
nature, and utterly destructive of this long-received theory.
    The first of these facts is the very recent discovery of ex
tensive strata in the coal-fields, containing sea shells in great
abundance, of which an interesting account has already ap
peared in your pages from the pen of Mr. J. Phillips, in your
 Number for November 1832.          Nor are these marine strata
 so situated with  respect  to the beds of coal as to leave the
 smallest doubt of their having been actually deposited by the
 sea. They are found to extend over a very wide district, and it
 cannot therefore be for a moment supposed, that the sea-shells
 were, in a manner, accidentally introduced amongst what have
 hitherto been looked upon as fresh-water deposits.        I have
 lately had presented to me specimens of sea-shells from a bed
 of coal shale near Wigan, in Lancashire; and as this locality
 is situated on the western margin of the same great coal-field
 which has been so ably traced by Mr. J. Phillips, as having
 an intermixture of marine strata, it appears probable that the
 specimens now in my possession have been derived from a
 continuation of the same beds; although I have not yet ascer
 tained the particular situation in which they were found.
 These shells are bivalve, of about two inches in diameter, are
 much injured by pressure, but may still be distinctly defined.
  They appear to me to resemble most nearly the genus Mac
 tra, and especially the M. Lutraria of Wood's Catalogue.
  So singular and conclusive a fact, although similar instances
 have not yet been brought to light in any great variety of
  cases, not only affects most materially the very foundation of
  the lacustrine theory, but even brings at least one portion of
  the coal strata distinctly within the catalogue of marine de
  posits; and when we consider that the existence of these ma
  rine strata has only lately become known, not in a new series
  of coal mines, but in a district supposed to be perfectly well
  known to geologists, we cannot but anticipate a speedy,      in
  crease to our store of similar facts, as the lights of science
  begin to shed a more steady lustre on those who are most
  intimately connected with the coal districts.
     The second class of facts to which I before alluded, have
  even a stronger bearing upon the manner of the coal deposits
  than these marine strata have upon their general character.
  I  mean the existence of large entire trees, in various parts of

  248             Mr. Fairholme               on the Nature               of Coal, and                on
 the strata, placed                  in a vertical position, and intersecting, in
 many instances, a                  great variety of beds.   It is scarcely neces
 sary to enumerate                  the instances in which this remarkable posi
 tion of the fossils                has been observed.                         The       facts connected
 with these vertical stems, projecting through beds of coal, of
 shale, and of sandstone, and assuming in a greater or less de
 gree, the character of each bed with which they come in con
 tact, must now be well known to             geologists; and    onlyall                                    it
 appears surprising that the discovery          even one such fossil      of
 tree,     any well-defined coal district, should not have had the
          in
 effect     utterly exploding from our systems the theory
             of                                                                                                    of

250         Mr. Fairholme   on the Nature   of Coal, and     on
sections,   which are of the very same character as those of the
 mines of the North of England and the South of Scotland,
 contain no one stratum differing in any material degree from
 those through which tall and entire stems, of great diameter,
 have in numerous instances been found to penetrate vertically;
 and it is nearly certain, that if we could bring into one spot
 the various stems found at various depths in different parts
 of that coal-field, we should obtain a regular series of mea
 sures from the present surface of the ground down to the ut
 most depths of our coal mines.         When we unite, therefore,
 the evidence adduced     by  these  stems,  and that of the marine
 strata in contact with the coal, we arrive at the natural con
 clusion, that instead of a long-continued and gradual process
 in the bosom of fresh-water lakes, these invaluable and inter
 esting formations must have taken place in the waters of the
 sea, and by a violent and rapid process, at some period of un
 usual destruction in the vegetable kingdom.
                                                         I
    Although no geological writer has yet, as far as am aware,
 brought these speaking witnesses to bear with their full power
upon the general theory of progressive formations, I find that
my own opinion respecting them cannot be looked upon as
 singular; for Mr. Bakewell, in his very able “Introduction
 to Geology,” makes the following remarks upon them, while
treating of the coal-measures.      “In     some places where sec
 tions have been made in the sandstone strata accompanying
 coal, instances of fossil stems of large plants occur in a ver
 tical position. In Burntwood quarry, at Althouse, near Wake
 field in Yorkshire” (which is situated in the very same coal-field
as Halifax and Leeds, where the marine strata have been re
marked by Mr. J. Phillips,) “several vertical stems of large
magnitude have been found. One stem which            I   measured in
 the quarry, was 9 feet long and 10 inches in thickness: but,
what is very remarkable, this stem cut through three strata of
sandstone parted by regular strata seams.          It had therefore,”
observes this   author,  (not being   aware,  at the time he wrote,
of the intermixture of marine strata amongst these very forma
tions,)—“it had therefore probably grown where it stood; for
it is difficult to believe that any vegetable stem could pierce
through three strata of sandstone, the lower of which, at least,
must have been partly consolidated.        This fact proves that the
strata were deposited rapidly.” p. 148. To the “difficulty.”
here mentioned by Mr. Bakewell, I shall only add the still
greater one of believing that a living tree could be rapidly
covered up where it grew, and       its top imbedded     in the very
same substance    in   which its roots had before found nourish

 ment.   Had this strange idea been well founded, we must
 have discovered such fossil trees in many more instances than
   we do: they must have been almost always upright, and                                                     in
   variably furnished with roots and branches.                 This, however,

  The singular anomaly here presented to the geologist power
fully supports the argument which naturally arises from the
specimens of vertical trees, to which allusion has just been
made.    According to geological theories, such deposits of ve
getable matter, accompanied by micaceous sandstones and shales,
were formed long previous to the creation of such mammalia
as are here described *; and yet we have only to suppose the
highly probable existence of vertical trees in this coal basin of
Alpnach, such as are elsewhere found in similar localities, to
perceive the rapidity of this formation also, and that it took
place at a period when the destruction of animal life was such
as our upper diluvial deposits more usually demonstrate.

309. iii. Chemical De-     YTVHE chemical action of voltaic elec
       composition.                tricity   is characteristic of that
agent, but not more characteristic than are the laws under
which    the bodies evolved by decomposition arrange them
selves at the poles. Dr.Wollaston showed” that common elec
tricity resembled it in these effects, and “that they are both
essentially the same;” but he mingled with his proofs an ex
periment having a resemblance, and nothing more, to a case
of voltaic decomposition, which however he himself partly
distinguished; and this has been more frequently referred to
by others, on the one hand, to prove the occurrence of electro
chemical decomposition, like that of the pile, and on the other,
to throw doubt upon the whole paper, than the more numerous
 and decisive experiments which he has detailed.
    310. I take the liberty of describing briefly my results, and
 of thus adding my testimony to that of Dr. Wollaston on the
 identity of voltaic and common electricity as to chemical ac
 tion, not only that I may facilitate the repetition of the experi
 ments, but also lead to some new consequences respecting
 electro-chemical decomposition (376. 377.).
     311.  I  first repeated Wollaston's fourth experiment+, in
  which the ends of coated silver wires are immersed in a drop
  of sulphate of copper. By passing the electricity of the ma
  chine through such an arrangement, that end in the dro
  which received the electricity became coated with metallic
  copper.     One hundred turns of the machine produced an evi
  dent effect; two hundred turns a very sensible one. The
  decomposing action was however very feeble. Very little cop
  per was precipitated, and no sensible trace of silver from the
  other pole appeared in the solution.
     312. A much more convenient and effectual arrangement
  for Jhemical decompositions by common electricity, is the fol
  lowing.     Upon a glass plate, fig. 2, placed over, but raised
  above a piece of white paper, so that shadows may not interfere,

and the decomposing wires being contracted to the utmost de
gree.    A piece of paper moistened in the solution of iodide of
potassium and starch, or of the iodide alone, with certain pre
cautions (322.), is a most admirable test of electro-chemical
action; and when thus placed and acted upon by the electric
current, will show iodine evolved at p by only half a turn of
the machine. With these adjustments and the use of iodide
of potassium on paper, chemical action is sometimes a more
delicate test of electrical currents than the galvanometer
(273.). Such cases occur when the bodies traversed by the
current are bad conductors, or when the quantity of electricity
evolved or transmitted in a given time is very small.
   317. A piece of litmus paper, moistened in solution of com
mon salt or sulphate of soda was quickly reddened at p. A
similar piece moistened in muriatic acid was very soon bleach
ed at p.   No effects of a similar kind took place at n.
   318. A piece of turmeric paper, moistened in solution of
sulphate of soda, was reddened at n by two or three turns of
the machine, and in twenty or thirty turns plenty of alkali
was there evolved. On turning the paper round, so that the
spot came under p, and then working the machine, the alkali
soon disappeared, the place became yellow, and a brown alka
line spot appeared in the new part under n.
   319. On combining a piece of litmus with a piece of tur
meric paper, wetting both with solution of sulphate of soda,
and putting the paper on the glass, so that p was on the litmus
and n on the turmeric, a very few turns of the machine suf
ficed to show the evolution of acid at the former and alkali
at the latter, exactly in the manner effected by a volta
electric current.
   320. All these decompositions took place equally well,
whether the electricity passed from the machine to the foil a,
through water, or through wire only; by contact with the con
ductor, or by sparks there; provided the sparks were not so
large as to cause the electricity to pass in sparks from p to n,
or towards n; and I have seen no reason to believe that in
cases of true electro-chemical decomposition by the machine,
the electricity passed in sparks from the conductor, or at any
part of the current, is able to do more, because of         its
                                                          tension,

                                            a   regular current.
   321. Finally, the experiment was extended into the follow
ing form, supplying    in this case the fullest analogy between
common and voltaic electricity.      Three compound pieces         of
litmus and turmeric   paper   (319.) were moistened       in
                                                          solution

Deiman in 1789 or earlier. That the experiment should never
be quoted as proving true electro-chemical decomposition, is
sufficiently evident from the circumstance, that the law which
regulates the transference and final place of the evolved bodies
(278. 309.), has no influence here.           The water is decomposed
at both poles independently of each other, and the oxygen
and hydrogen evolved at the wires are the elements of the
water existing the instant before in those places.                 That the
poles, or rather     points,  have no mutual       decomposing      depend
ence, may be shown by substituting a wire, or the finger, for
one of them, a change which does not at all interfere with the

                                               believe, with the
opinion of every other philosopher, that atmospheric electri
city is of the same nature with ordinary electricity (284.), and
I  might therefore refer to certain published statements of che
mical effects produced by the former as proofs that the latter
 enjoys the power of decomposition in common with voltaic
 electricity.  But the comparison I am drawing is far too                     ri
gorous to allow me to use these statements without being fully
                                           I
 assured of their accuracy; and have no right to suppress
them, because, if accurate, they establish what I am labour
ing to put on an undoubted foundation, and have priority to
my results.
    336. M. Bonijol of Geneva” is said to have constructed
very delicate apparatus for the decomposition of water by
common electricity.      By connecting an insulated lightning
rod with this apparatus, the decomposition of the water pro
ceeded in a continuous and rapid manner even when the elec
tricity of the atmosphere was not very powerful.       The appa
ratus is not  described; but as the diameter of the wire is men
tioned as very small, it appears to have been similar in con
struction to that of Wollaston (327.); and as that does not
furnish a case of true polar electro-chemical decomposition
(328.), this result of M. Bonijol does not prove the identity in
chemical action of common and voltaic electricity.
   337. At the same page of the Bibliotheque Universelle, M.
Bonijol is said to have decomposed    potash, and also chloride
of silver, by putting them into very narrow tubes and passing
electric sparks from an ordinary machine over them. It is
evident that these offer no analogy to cases of true voltaic de
composition, where the electricity only decomposes when it is
conducted by the body acted upon, and ceases to decompose,
according to      its
                 ordinary laws, when passes    itsparks. These

voltaic electricity, is evident, for the “usual shocks” only were
produced, and nothing like the terrible sensation due to a
voltaic battery, even when it has a tension so feeble as not to
strike through the eighth of an inch of air.
   341. It seems just possible that the air which was passing
by the kite and string, being in an electrical state sufficient to
produce the “usual shocks” only, could still, when the elec
tricity was drawn off below, renew the charge, and so con
tinue the current. The string was 1500 feet long, and con
tained two double threads.         But when the enormous quantity
which must have been thus collected is considered (371. 376.),
the explanation seems very doubtful.               I charged a voltaic
battery of twenty pairs of plates four inches square and with
                                                                    posi

inches, and the point amalgamated.                 Thus the faces of the
spirals could be pressed against each other, by means of the
cork handles, the amalgamated ends entering the mercury
boxes to communicate with the magnetest. One of the spirals
being now heated, and (having placed the points in the mer
cury boxes,) pressed against the cold one, a deflection took
place of 5°, showing an electric current from the hot spiral to
 the cold one. The heat employed was about 300°.
     20. An iron pair, formed in the same way, being similarly
 employed, gave a deflection in the opposite direction, indica
 ting the current from the cold to the hot spiral, which increased
 by increased heat till, on approaching redness, it reached 18°.
      A pair, of tinned iron, being next employed gave the same
 result, but in a much greater degree.               The mere warmth of
 the fingers communicated to one of the spirals produced de
 flections of 3° or 4°; and before the heat reached redness, it
 was 30°; the electric current being in this instance also from
  cold to hot.

    25. On comparing these tables, the thermo-electric reac
 tion, in pairs of different metals, would seem to be compounded
of the idio-thermo-electric force of each, and           conducting                   its
power.
      Inthe thermo-positive class, the order       conduction     re       of                         is
versed: here iron and antimony differ little         thermo-positive            in
quality; but antimony            the worst conductor, and stands
                                                is
highest      Cumming's table.
                in
    Zinc and iron differ little     conducting power; but iron
                                                     in                                                    is
considerably more thermo-electric than zinc, and accordingly
predominates         action when the metals are acting together.
                         in
      Inthe thermo-negative    class, the arrangement corresponds
with the order                of
                       conduction; the conducting power tending
 to raise, the thermo-negative       lower, the metal to Cumming's                   in

   Copper      better conductor than platinum, and much less

                          to

                      is

the currents was traced by the needles last described (26.).
 The ends of the copper wires were now brought into the line
of the current, (by turning and sliding the hoops,) in the hope
that, by the superior conducting power of the copper, either
the direct or return current might be taken up by the wire.
 But I could not succeed in obtaining this, or the vestige of any
current, through the wire, until, coming in contact with a
warm part of the bismuth, it assumed                    proper thermo            its

     Having placed the thermo-electric pair described (9.) p. 211,
in connexion with the magnetest, heat was applied to the mid
dle of the copper leg instead of the twist. This soon commu
nicated, through the good conducting power of the copper, to
the point of contact, and proportionate deflection ensued.
When the apparatus had cooled, heat was applied to the mid
dle of the iron leg, which did not soon affect the needle.    In
the meanwhile it was touched, near the heated point, with a
piece of iron; then of tinned iron; but still with little effect
on the magnetest.       Presently the heat was renewed, and a
slip of sheet copper substituted for the iron, as a better con
ductor, being also bent double, to pinch the wire, and thus
ensure good contact. A lively deflection now took place, but
in direction contrary to that above stated, the current being
from the part touched with copper to the point of heat.
   33. Instead of the pair, a single wire of tinned iron was
now taken, 18 by Tºth inches, bent in the form of the letter U,
or forming a sort of wire staple. The points of this being set
in communication with the magnetest, and the bend, or any
part (distant from the mercury”) heated, gave a current, when
pinched by copper, near the point of heat, from the part touched
to the heated point.
   34. A copper staple was now employed, and being pinched
with tin, gave the same result; but                          tin
                                             plate being used,                               in

tuted for the  antimony,   currents took  place equally active, but
in  the converse  direction;  and the same with tin, when sub
stituted for the bismuth.       Hence the inside          spiral         of   a              is
equally thermo-electric with the outside.

       36.    A
            staple was then, made, having one leg a tube of tin
  plate, in which short cylinders of bismuth and tin were made
 to slide. When either of them approached a heated point in
                                              j
 the tube, a current was driven back toward the heated point.
 Thus it acts inside a tube as well as outside a wire.
    37. It is therefore evident that a foreign metal, brought into
 contact with a homogeneous circuit, near a heated point, enters
 into the thermo-electric connexion, and determines a current,
 according to the reaction between the two metals.           Such cur
 rent        is,
           however, weaker than when the second metal inter

clean iron when heated together (4.1.).       Fusible metal acts

     Seams of coal, inferior in thickness to those belonging to
 the Newcastle coal formation, and interstratified with the
 encrinal limestone, as well as with sandstone and shale, are
 spread over most parts of Northumberland; but owing to
 these landsale collieries being generally inconsiderable in point
 of depth and extent of workings, the continuity of the beds
 of coal has never been accurately ascertained. Sections of
 coal mines in this formation are to be found in the fourth
 volume of the first series of the Geological Transactions, p. 60,
where an account of Shilbottle Colliery, which supplies Aln
 wick with fuel, is given; and in the Transactions of the Na
tural History Society of Newcastle, in vol. i. pp. 126, 127,
 128, 129, sections of the more important mines in the vicinity
of Berwick-upon-Tweed, are inserted. The section above is
of the colliery close to the old castle of Blenkinsop, 33 miles
west of Newcastle, and close to the borders of Cumberland.
The viewer at this place considered the position of the coal to
be below the four-fathom limestone, and above the great lime
stone of the Alston Moor mining field, and that the bed of coal
was the same as that worked in the more extensive mines on
Tynedale Fell. From these collieries Carlisle derives         coal.                                  its

sun would cause the time of passing from one given almacan
tar to another to be a maximum or a minimum ?         The actual
path of the sun is no part of the data; and hence D'Alem
bert's difficulty here arose from tacitly introducing a new con
dition into the solution of the problem, which had not been
introduced into the process for finding the equation of the
problem. • It is true that under the physical circumstances
which were known to exist (but which were unknown in the
problem in the aspect under which he viewed it as a mathe
matician,)there was an obstacle to the maximum answer taking
place actually in certain latitudes; but in other given latitudes
the maximum might, with the present position of the ecliptic,
be actually attained. His showing that the maximum could
not be attained in certain particular cases, did not show that
it was unattainable in all: and hence his inference, as a ge
neral one, that the second answer did not refer to the maxi

reasonings of Laplace are incorrect.        In this case, then, the
surface described   by  the  point  p" is that of a sphere whose
radius is the difference between a and a'; and the values of

  Substituting these values in the equation V+V’—W’’= 2a A,

is mentioned.
 “    Dr. Drummond                  of
                            Belfast observed, that the membrane

behind the retina of the dog, and other animals which pro
duce those blue and green and sometimes red reflections, which
often shine with such brilliancy in the living animal, loses the
power of reflecting these tints when it is dry, and becomes
entirely black. Upon learning this fact from Dr. Drummond,
 we prepared several eyes that reflected these colours with great
vivacity, and invariably found that they became black when
dry, and blue and green when softened with water. After some
of them had remained four or five years in a dry state, they
still possessed the property of developing their colours by
moisture.      It is worthy of remark, that the black passed                                 in
 stantly into a brilliant blue, the blue into green, and the green
into a greenish yellow”.”
                                                          I
    After this paragraph was written, had occasion to repeat
the experiment on one of the eyes just mentioned, and found                           I
that the colours could be revived in the membrane ten or
twelve years after it had been taken from the animal.
   I   do not recollect to have anywhere seen it stated that the
brilliant colours which appear in the eyes of animals have been
                                               I
noticed in the human eye; but had occasion many years ago
to observe them in the most distinct manner, and to examine
them repeatedly in the eye of a boy about ten years of age.
The colour was a bright red, with a purplish tinge; but it is not
in my power to ascertain now whether or not this colour va
ried with an increase of years. On this point Mr. Fielding

   Notice of the Elliptic Orbit of £ Boötis, with a further Approxima
tion to the Orbit of y Virginis. By Sir John Herschel.
   The elements of the orbit of £ Boötis are given for the first time;
those of y Virginis are recalculated by the aid of observations made
in the current year, by Sir J. Herschel and others, which differ
materially from the Ephemeris published in the Supplement to the
Nautical Almanac for 1832. Comparisons of the calculated results,
with observations, are given in both cases.
   The elements are as follow                           :-
                                                        &   Boötis.

the instrument used at Bedford being, as I understand, the excel
lent 8%-feet achromatic of nearly 6 inches aperture, and conse
quently possessing an illuminating power of between two and three
times greater than that of my 5-feet achromatic.               Hence it is ma
nifest that some plan must be devised for equalizing the optical
powers of the different observers and their instruments, the eye and
the telescope being viewed as one compound optical machine. And
 this being attained, the varying condition of the atmosphere would

altitude might be very nearly allowed for by a corresponding altera

 nights, what is the minimum aperture with which his instrument
 will enable him, on an average of such nights, to keep this delicate
 object just steadily in view. Perhaps it would be proper to                 the                                      fix

   June 11–A specimen of the Patagonian Penguin, Aptenodytes
Patachonica, Gmel., recently presented to the Society by Lady
Rolle, was exhibited. Mr. Yarrell availed himself of the oppor
tunity to point out on it the proofs which it afforded of the state
ment made by him at the Meeting on March 12, that the woolly
Penguin of Dr. Latham is the young condition of this species.
   A specimen was exhibited of a Goose from the Sandwich Islands,
being one of a pair recently living at the Society's Gardens, to which
they were presented by Lady Glengall. Mr. Vigors characterized
it as a species of Barnacle Goose, by the name of Bernicla Sandvi
censis, and pointed out               its
                            distinguishing marks. He also observed

an oblique wavy band on the shoulder. The spots on the sides gene

    A brief description         was read of a pair of Doves, now living at
 the Society's Gardens, which had been pointed out by Mr. Vigors
 as representatives of a species hitherto undescribed.                   It was cha
 racterized as Columba Princeps, Vig.
    Dr.Grant exhibited a preparation of the cloaca of a female Condor,
 Sarcorhamphus Gryphus, Dum., which recently died at the Society's
 Gardens.        He entered into a series of observations on the subject,

having been two hours before less luminous than usual, presented
one mass of bright phosphoric light extending to a considerable
distance around the vessel.         The extensive field of bright luminous
matter emitted so powerful a light as to illuminate the sails, and to
permit a book of small print to be read with facility near the win
dows of the stern cabins. Above this luminous field numerous sea
fowl were hovering in search of their prey. The light appeared to
be entirely owing to the Pyrosomata.
   Specimens taken from the sea and placed in a vessel containing
sea water, ceased altogether to emit light, or emitted it but spa
ringly while they remained at rest. On the water, however, being
agitated, or when one of the masses of animals was taken into the
hand, the whole mass became instantly illuminated by myriads of
bright dots, much resembling in hue the points on the elytra of a

termine the structure of the umbilical appendage visible in the pre
paration.    It was accompanied by sketches by Mr. G. Bennett of
the foetal Kangaroo   in utero, which were exhibited.
   The preparations were accompanied by a letter addressed by Mr.
G. Bennett to Mr. Owen, and dated Sydney, New South Wales,
February 4, 1833, from which several extracts were read. Among
them was the following:
  “I   have a section of one female Ornithorhynchus which I shot, in
which the milk gland is very large; and I can now inform you from
actual observation that milk is secreted from it: it comes out (as
your mercury did when you injected the ducts,) in small drops on
the surface of the skin.   I intend sending you a further account of
this ; but you can mention it to the Zoological Society as a decided
fact; and which had also been seen by some intelligent gentlemen
in this country;-but I was not satisfied to assert it until I became
an eye-witness of the fact.            I
                                  wish you to show the specimens to
the Zoological Society, with some brief comments in my name,
stating also that           I
                       am about to send home a detailed account of
the habits and oeconomy of the Ornithorhynchus and Kangaroo."
   The exhibition was resumed of the new species of Shells contained
in the collection made by Mr. Cuming on the western coast of South
America, and among the Islands of the South Pacific Ocean. Those
brought on the present evening under the notice of the Society
were accompanied, as on previous occasions, by characters by Mr.
                                                                    pº

the inquiry as soon as the remarkable fact was announced by Mr. Tre
velyan, and was induced to prosecute it to a considerable extent ex
perimentally, in consequence of being dissatisfied with the only plau
sible explanation yet offered,—that of the successive expansions of
the cold metal by the hot one at the point of contact, at each succes
sive vibration, which was conceived to afford the necessary impulse
or maintaining power.
   In this paper the phaenomena of sound are first discussed, which,
with Mr. Faraday, the author imputes solely to the number of vibra
tions taking place in a given space of time. This seems completely
proved by observation; and the note depends upon the frequency of
the oscillations, which have been observed as high as between 700
and 800 in a second, and must often be greatly more frequent. The
phaenomena of vibration are next considered, as affected by the nature
of the metals, by the form of the masses, and by temperature. The
order of the metals as vibrators is the following,-meaning that the
cold metal must always stand lower in the list than the hot one, and
that the force or intensity of vibration                          is,

              EARLY ANTICIPATION OF PHRENOLOGY.
     HE   Rev. W. D. Conybeare, F.R.S. &c., has favoured us with
      the following notice of a curious anticipation of the modern
Phrenological System, bearing date as early as 1503; it occurs in
an old Encyclopaedical kind
of Work, entitled Margarita
Philosophica, printed at Fri
burg in that year. The author
speaking of the mental func
tions, says, “Sensus interi
ores numero quinque sunt:
Sensus Communis, Imagina
tiva, AEstimativa, Cogitativa,
et Memorativa. Horum Or
gana in substantid        cerebri
subtilissimis secernuntur pel

ventriculi medii attribuitur AEstimativae; 2da, Cogitativae; posterior
vero ventriculus totus Memorativae deputatur.”       This is illustrated
by the sketch of a head divided just like one of Gall or Spurzheim's
models, a part of which is copied in the annexed.         .
          COMPOSITION       OF PHOSPHURETTED       HYDROGEN.
   M. Rose published some years since researches on the composi
tion of phosphuretted hydrogen gas, which, he observes, do not
agree with those published at the same time by Dumas and by
 Buff: he has since repeated his experiments, both upon the spon
taneously inflammable gas, and that obtained from hydrated phos
                                                                      -
 phorous acid.
    Spontaneously inflammable Gas.-M. Rose does not state the com
 position of this gas by weight; but states that he considers it as
 composed of 1 atom of phosphorus and 3 atoms of hydrogen, or,
 by calculation, of # a volume of vapour of phosphorus +1} volume
 of hydrogen gas, condensed to 1 volume. Now as neither the
 absolute weights of the constituents of the gas, nor those of the
 atoms are given, we are compelled to make them out indirectly.        M.
 Rose finds that hydriodic acid combines with phosphuretted hydro
 gen, atom to atom, and 100 parts are stated to consist of 78-73 acid
 +21-27 phosphuretted hydrogen. Assuming the atomic weight of
 the acid to be 127, that of phosphuretted hydrogen will, of course,
 be 3430 (78-73: 21:27: ; 127:34-30).          Subtracting then 3 = 3

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous              Articles.              309
atoms of hydrogen from 34:30, we have phosphuretted                           hydrogen
composed of 3 atoms of hydrogen . . . . . . .    3
             1 atom of phosphorus . . . . . . . 31-30
                          Weight of atom . . . 34:30           -
   Now whether we admit 15-7 as the atomic weight of phos
phorus, as stated by Dr. Turner, or 16, as given by Dr. Thomson,
we may consider phosphuretted hydrogen as composed                       of
          3 atoms   of hydrogen .          . .   . . . . . 3°      or    3"
          2 atoms   of phosphorus .        . .    . . . . . 32-         31-4
                                                           35°          34°4
  It is therefore a sesquihydruret.
   M. Rose procured the gas by heating hypophosphite of lime:
the gas contains variable proportions of hydrogen: the volume of
the gas obtained was accurately measured, and remained for thirty
six hours exposed to a weak solution of sulphate of copper, de
prived by long boiling of atmospheric air: the phosphuretted hy
drogen gas was completely absorbed, and the hydrogen only left.
M. Rose states that the specific gravity of phosphuretted hydrogen
by calculation should be 1-1846; that which was procured from
phosphite of lead was of sp. gr. 1.205.
   M. Rose proved by several experiments, that the spontaneously
inflammable phosphuretted hydrogen gas, does not lose this pro
perty, when kept over either mercury or water. He states also
that it is requisite to dry the gas perfectly by means of chloride of
calcium, as without this precaution it may contain vapour of phos
phorus, which would increase the weight of the gas; and he thinks
that is the only way in which the different sp. gr. found by himself
and M. Dumas can be explained.
   Phosphuretted Hydrogen from Phosphorous Acid.—This gas was
obtained by heating the hydrated phosphorous acid in green glass
retorts: white ones must not be used, as the acid readily attacks
them: a phosphite is formed with the alkali of the glass, which, by
the action of heat, becomes a phosphate, and disengages hydrogen
gas. The gas received was dried over chloride of calcium, and the
latter portions of it rejected. The gas obtained is a mixture of
varying proportions of hydrogen and phosphuretted hydrogen.
Much depends upon the degree of heat employed: when it was
quick and intense, the gas was much richer in phosphorus.
    M. Rose found the action of the inflammable and uninflammable
gases to be perfectly similar on different substances; and they have
both the property of being converted, one into uninflammable and
 the other into inflammable phosphuretted hydrogen : on these ac
counts M. Rose considers them as isomeric compounds.-Ann. de
Chim, et de Phys. tom.     li.   p.   1.

                                 had several years since arrived
the same conclusion      M. Rose, with respect
                          as                       the similarity  to
the two kinds    phosphuretted hydrogen.

    “It may be proper,”    he observes, “to advert more particularly to
 the  hydrophosphoric    gas of Davy. That this gas is the same as that
we have been describing, can hardly admit of a doubt. Their near
agreement in sp. gr., in their absorbability by water, in the quantity
of oxygen requisite for their combustion, in their moderate expan
sion by burning with a minimum of oxygen, and in their combusti
bility in oxymuriatic acid, are circumstances sufficient to warrant
their identity.”
   Dr. Dalton states the sp. gr. of the spontaneously inflammable
gas to be nearly 1:1, which much more nearly approximates to 1-1846,
Rose's calculated statement, than the sp. gr. given by Dumas, viz.
1.761. It may be further observed that Dr. Dalton's analysis does
not widely differ from that of Rose: he states the gases to be com
posed of 1 hydrogen +9 phosphorus, which will give

                       METALLIC PHOSPHURETS.
   M. Rose obtained phosphuret of copper by passing a current of
hydrogen gas over heated phosphate of copper.            This salt became
at first yellow by the conversion of the peroxide into protoxide, and
afterwards, at a higher temperature, it became gray phosphuret of
copper, water being formed at the same time. It consisted of
       Copper . . . 65-09 or nearly      1 atom   of copper  . . .  64

   Phosphuret of Cobalt.—A current of hydrogen gas, directed upon

given out. This compound is gray, powdery, and gives no phos

   When exposed to a current of dry chlorine, and moderately
heated, strong ignition occurred; chloride of phosphorus sublimed,
and chloride of cobalt crystallized.          Its composition was found
to be
       Cobalt . . . 73.47 or nearly 3 atoms of cobalt . . 90

   Phosphuret of Nickel.—This phosphuret may be obtained, as well
as those of copper and cobalt,by decomposing the muriate with phos
phuretted hydrogen gas. . It is black and insoluble in muriatic
acid; but dissolved by nitric acid, it burns under the blowpipe with
a phosphoric flame.       Phosphuret of nickel may also be obtained
from the phosphate by hydrogen gas.
   Phosphuret of Iron.—This was procured by the action of phos
phuretted hydrogen gas upon sulphuret of iron, at a gentle heat.

It is powdery, insoluble either in concentrated or dilute muriatic
acid, but dissolved by aqua regia and nitric acid. It burns when
heated by the blowpipe with a phosphoric flame.
   Phosphuret of Chromium.—The decomposition of anhydrous cry
stallized chloride of chromium is not effected by phosphuretted
hydrogen below a red heat, which occasions the gas to deposit
phosphorus.     The phosphuret of chromium preserves the form of
the chloride: it is black, insoluble in muriatic acid, and very slightly
dissolved by nitric acid and aqua regia: it burns with the blowpipe,
giving a phosphoric flame. It is composed of
      Chromium . . . 64-5 or 1 atom of chromium . . 29
       Phosphorus . . 35-5          1 atom of phosphorus.    .  16

   In attempting  to convert other metallic chlorides and   sulphurets
into phosphurets by means of phosphuretted hydrogen, satisfactory
results were not obtained. Though at first combined with phos
phorus, it was lost by continuing the heat necessary for the decom
position of the chlorides or sulphurets.
   Phosphuretted hydrogen gas very readily decomposes chloride
of silver, but metallic silver only is obtained; chloride of lead is
not so quickly decomposed, but the results are similar.       Muriatic
acid gas is disengaged, and phosphorus is deposited in the cool
parts of the apparatus.     Chloride of mercury, decomposed by the
gas, produces a phosphuret. There is a very violent disengagement
of muriatic acid gas, but the combination is destroyed by heat.
   Chloride of zinc may be converted into phosphuret, but the
quantity obtained was too small for examination.          Chloride of
manganese also gives a phosphuret by the action of phosphuretted
hydrogen: it has a metallic lustre, but does not give a phosphoric
flame with the blowpipe.     Protosulphuret of tin is very slowly de
composed at a low temperature by phosphuretted hydrogen gas;
sulphuretted hydrogen gas is disengaged and phosphorus sublimes.
No phosphorus was discoverable in the residue, but it still contained
sulphur; it dissolved entirely in muriatic acid with disengagement
of sulphuretted hydrogen gas.
   Sulphuret of bismuth is also reduced by the action of phosphu
retted hydrogen gas to the metallic state, and so also is sulphuret
of antimony; phosphorus is deposited; sulphuretted hydrogen is
given out: it      is,

   Erp. l. 50 grains of pure dry carbonate of potash, prepared by
exposing the bi-carbonate to a red heat, are dissolved in 200 grains
of water (4 times the weight of the carbonate); and to the solution
are added 70 grains of proto-hydrate of lime. The mixture is heated
to boiling as quickly as possible, the whole heating operation only
lasting two minutes. The liquor is filtered while hot and undiluted,
and a part of it treated with sulphuric acid, sp. gr. 1-135, of which
60 grain measures are required before effervescence takes place, and
only 20 more for saturation; consequently #ths of the carbonate are
decomposed            by the lime.
   The boiling point of the mixture is about 220°; but I find that a
very material decomposition of the carbonate takes place even when
a like mixture is exposed only to 150° for a quarter of an hour, being
briskly agitated            all

          PROPOSED MODIFICATION OF THE PATENT LAWS.
    The following paper has been privately circulated; and at the
 present time, when the attention of many persons is directed to the
law of patents, it may prove interesting to some of our readers.
    Proposed Definition of the Subject Matter of Patents for Inven
tions.—That His Majesty is hereby empowered to grant letters pa
 tent, of exclusive privilege, for limited periods of time, as hereinafter
 provided, to the inventor or inventors, or to the introducer from
 abroad, of any manufacture, which, at the time of lodging applica
 tion for such letters patent, shall be new in the United Kingdom of
 Great Britain and Ireland; which new manufacture shall consist,
 either in a new saleable thing made, or in some new means or pro
 cess, employed in the working, making, or preparing of a saleable
 thing; and such letters patent shall confer on such inventor or in
ventors, or on such introducer from abroad, and their executors,
 administrators, and assigns, the exclusive privilege of making and
 selling such new manufacture, so far as the same shall consist in
 a new saleable thing made, and the exclusive privilege of using and
 practising such new manufacture, so                                far

 DEATH    of   THOMAS ALLAN, ESQ.,              or LAURISTON,              F.R.S. L.           & E.
                                F.L.S. &c. &c.
    The friends of Mr. Allan will receive with deep regret, and those
who saw him so lately at the Cambridge Meeting of the British
Association, not without surprise, the intelligence of his death; for
though evidently declining in health, yet there was nothing then to
indicate that the termination of his earthly career was so near at
hand. After returning to Edinburgh, he again left that city early
in September, attended by some members of his family; and when
on a visit to his friend Mr. Bigge, of Linden Hall, Northumberland,
was suddenly attacked with apoplexy, and died there, on the 12th
ult., in the 57th year of his age.
    The claim of Mr. Allan to be honourably remembered by the
cultivators of science, rests mainly on his extensive and accurate
                                                                                     of its
knowledge of mineralogy, and on his contributions to                 advance
ment.     He was thoroughly acquainted with the system                external
characters, and most skilful            applying them
                                         in                  the discovery
                                                                   to                              of
those minute resemblances and differences on which the classifica
tion of minerals    is  founded.      Instances of his skill must be       the                in
                                                                        by byof be

friends who have seen them are of the same opinion, particularly the
above gentleman, who has paid great attention to microscopic pur
suits. Whether they are living animalcula or not, I am at a loss to
determine, and must leave it for the investigation of our microscopic
friends. The readiest way of examining them is as follows:–Take
a single scale from any fish (say a fresh herring); put it on a flat
piece of glass, and cover it with a drop of pure water; press the scale
to make it       flat   lie
                         the glass; place

LIV.     On the Vibration of heated Metals.          By ARTHUR      TRE
   vely AN, Esq.; including a Letter on           the same Subject     by
   Dr. W. KNIGHT.*
Asstances
        it is always interesting to know the accidental circum
                which lead to the discovery of any new fact in
natural science, I shall begin by relating the manner in which
I  was led to observe the vibrations of heated metals. On the
9th of February 1829, I was about to spread with a plaster
iron some common pitch, when the iron being at too high a
temperature,     I  placed it in a slanting direction against a block
of  lead,  the handle resting on the table: shortly after doing so
I  heard a shrill high tone, which much resembled a note pro
duced on the chanter of the smaller. Northumberland pipes,
an instrument played on by my father's gamekeeper. Not
                                          I
knowing the cause of the sound, thought he might be prac
tising out of doors. The room being on the ground floor,                I
went outside, when the sound was no longer heard; and seeing
no person, returned again to the room, when I was surprised
at still hearing the sound as shrill as before. After looking
about for a few minutes,           I at last approached closer to the
iron, perceived the vibration, and thence found the imme
diate cause of the sound.        I  was much surprised and pleased;
but at that time, not having studied any branch of natural
philosophy connected with the subject of heat, I was not aware
that it was a fact which had not been before observed (al
though it struck me so at the time). I came to Edinburgh in
November 1830, and attended Dr. D. B. Reid’s class of
   *  Communicated by the Author. Part of this paper was read before the
Section of Physics of the British Association, meeting at Cambridge, June
27, 1833.

Practical Chemistry.         Having mentioned the circumstance and
shown him the experiments, he informed me that the fact was
new, and recommended me to make further experiments, and
prepare a paper on the subject for the Royal Society of Edin
burgh.        I took his advice, and during the winter session had
the honour of having two papers read before that Society,
which were illustrated by experiments.
     Since that time               I
                            have made numerous additional experi
 ments, and have succeeded in obtaining vibration with most
 metals, many of which            failed with previously, from the ap

 paratus not being sufficiently delicate.
     On the opposite page is a Table of the different metals in
 which <U+017F>have observed vibration.
     The experiments were repeated several times before was                                      I
 satisfied with the results.
    I   have not yet observed any effect with bismuth, although
I   have with pale solder, which is an alloy of that metal.                -

          of         metals      at     the side   of   the Table        are those        of    the    bars   which        were     heated         and    placed
                                                                                                                                                                   on      the cold   metal.

324     Mr. A. Trevelyan                   on the Vibration         of heated Metals.
     When the brass bar        at a high temperature is placed on the
 cool   lead,  the vibration seldom fails taking place instantly
 and   spontaneously.
    A bar 5 inches long, 2 inches wide, and ºths of an inch
 thick, vibrated when supporting a weight of 12 pounds.
    However near the bar and block may be brought to each
 other, no apparent phaenomenon takes place until they are in
 actual contact.
    By balancing the bar in a horizontal position on a narrow
lead block (fig. 1. p. 332), rounded on the part on which the
bar rests, the vibration is well exhibited, the bar moving ver
 tically and laterally at the same time. A rod 10 or more
inches long, flattened in the centre to prevent                slipping, with  its
a   ball  on  each end     (fig.  5),  when    placed   across       heated          a               vi
brating bar (fig. 6), increases the arc               motion, rendering the
                                                               of
movements much more conspicuous.
    A   thick ring        of
                        copper,        inches  5    diameter, when heated,

and hung        on   alead bar, vibrates backwards and forwards;
and when laid              onnarrow lead block, upwards and down

tried with me, but             very uncertain and difficult

    The bars vibrate best when             placed       blocks      onlead with       of
the surface somewhat rough: both metals also should                         kept               be
clean, and free from oxidation, which impairs the vibration.
    A    bar    of  heated copper was placed                             on
                                                                   iron block    an

quence, except for the more delicate experiments with the
hard metals:             on
                       lead the hard metal almost              any form will  of
vibrate when heated.

other side     ishollowed out down the centre                             so
                                                                     throw the as    to

      Mr. A. Trevelyan            on the     Vibration of heated Metals.                       325
weight on each side, which assists the vibration: the longitu
dinal ridge is the part that rests on the block, (figs. 3 & 4.).
    A hollow lead cylinder about ; an inch thick, with the dia
meter in proportion to the length of the bar, is the best form
for showing the vibrations and producing the tone.
    An inequality or unequal notch on the lead cylinder                                        in
creases the sound. When the bar at a high temperature is first
placed on the cold lead, the tone is very harsh and undefined;
but when the lead has acquired a certain proportion of heat,
it becomes clear, full and mellow.
    Pressure on the bar alters the note: the greater the pres
sure the higher is the note. Pressure also applied to the
sounding-board or table on which the vibrating bar may
happen to be placed, or even walking across the room, by al
tering the position of the bar, changes the tone.
     A common poker heated and placed on a lead block                                          vi

                                         the vibrating bar be placed
on a   piano-forte,    and certain notes be struck on the instru
ment, the vibration of the bar, and consequently the tone pro
duced by      it,  altered, and sometimes suddenly stopped.

    The vibrations have not been produced with any substances
besides metals, except                in
                                the instance     the glass tumbler

 ready mentioned.
    To try whether there was any attraction between the hard
and soft metals when heated,           had two pieces
                                             I              brass, about   of
 the size    of  ounce weight, with
                  on an                    wire attached
                                                      a       them, and             to
 then hung        a delicate scale beam: having heated the brass
 weights, blocks            of
                        lead were placed under them and tried                                    at
 various  distances,    but without producing the slightest effect.
    To try whether electricity caused the phaenomenon               made                  or
 any alteration whilst the bar was vibrating,        hole was drilled
                                                                    a                           in
a  bar and filled with mercury,         wire was soldered
                                                a                the lead            to

                                 it                galvanic battery
                                                               a                                 of
 150 plates,     inches square, being charged, the wire from the
                  4
 cylinder was placed           one end
                                  in                  of
                                             the battery, whilst from
 the other end       wire was brought          the mercury contained
                                                          to

in   the cavity     the bar, which was heated, and                             in
 vious  to completing     the circle. We also tried other methods,
 but with none          of
                     them did we succeed         producing any change
                                                           in
 either  in the tone or       the vibration.
                                  in                       .
    A   Leyden phial was charged with electricity, and applied
 to  the same bar and block, without producing any effect.

 326      Mr. A. Trevelyan         on the Vibration      of heated Metals.
     Spirit of wine, or aether, evaporated off the heated bar when
in motion, produced no effect.
   Air blown with a pair of bellows on the heated bar when
 vibrating does not affect the tremors.
     Ifthe heated bar be ground smooth, on the resting part,
 and the block of lead be also very smooth, no vibration takes
 place.
    When the bar and block become of the same temperature,
 the vibration and sound cease.
    A cylinder, 5 inches long, with a thick side bevelled off,
 leaving a flat ridge in the centre, similar to the former bars,
 when heated and placed on lead, produced no change of tone.
    From the above-related experiments it appears:
    1st, That in order to produce the vibrations, metals must
 be employed, either of the same kind or different, for both the
 bars and blocks; with the single exception of the glass tumbler.
    2nd, That the difference of temperature between the two
 metals must be considerable, although some require a much
 higher temperature than others: the vibrations on zinc and
 bell-metal succeed with a lower temperature than others of
 the hard metals.
    3rd, That the surface of the block must have some degree
 of unevenness, for when rendered quite smooth, the vibration
 does not take place; but the bar cannot be too smooth.
    4th, That the interposition of any matter prevents vibra
tion, with the exception of a burnish of gold-leaf, the thick
ness of which cannot amount to the 200,000dth part of an
inch.
    5th, That the air has no share in the production of the
vibratory movements, however much                      its
                                                presence     essential  is
to  the production      of
                        sound.
   6th, That     ithas        no
                            connexion with galvanism          electri   or
city, the vibration and tone not being affected             passing by           a
current through the bar when             action. Professor Forbes
                                                  in
found       no

ber    ofexperiments.
   7th, That      all
                    the metals, both simple and alloys, produce
vibration and    sound,  when one     heated and the other cool,
                                             is
on  being brought into contact, (with the exception        bismuth,)

which with some requires great nicety.
   8th, Although        all
                         the metals are not found         vibrate  to            on

of those partial and sudden expansions which give the tremor
 causing impulse.
   The rocking on the narrow lead block may be induced by
 two causes, either by some slight inequality in the weight of
the portions of the bar on the two sides of the ridge, or some
difference in the condition of the surface of that part of the
block which the ridge of the bar touches; and may be thus
explained:
   1st, If the first-mentioned inequality exist, as soon as the
bar receives an upward heave, the greater weight of the one
side will cause it to incline to that side; and as soon as that
heave ceases, and the contraction succeeds, the bar approaches
  its                                                   for the incli

impulses which the bar receives,            this position, from the
renewed expansion and elongation, will not only renew the
upward heave, but also incline        again      the preponderating

side, and thus increase the lateral movement, which, like the
vertical, though altogether insensible           first,      incessant at                   by
frequent repetition accumulates and increases till the rocking
becomes conspicuous, and           rendered much more

   2ndly,     there exist any difference
               If                              regard      asperity                        to              in

will     greater than
          be               the other, and consequently the up
                                on
ward heave will be so modified as

                                            create an inclination
one side. The bar thus thrown off           balance     the right                      to

  330         Dr. W. Knight on the Vibration of heated Metals.
  sending you a shorter account than I could wish of the new
 trials made on the vibrations of metallic bodies in the end of
  March and beginning of April last.
     “Having frequently failed as well as succeeded with the
 iron pokers and masses of lead, &c., and not being always able to
 account for the failures, a simple plan of producing vibrations
 occurred to me, which in no instance yet fails upon the greater
 number of metals employed. This consists in placing a quan
 tity of a melted metal (as tin, lead, fusible metal, bismuth,
 &c.) in a hemispherical, or, better, in a parabolic conoidal cup
 of copper, or iron, or brass, lying above a piece of lead or
 other metal.     The oscillations of the cup thus resting upon a
 small surface continue long after it has become solid, indeed
 until the cup and              of its
                         contents have fallen       temperature not        to
                                                                           a

  “3rd, The vibrations of the cups above a platina coin were
very slow, and did not commence until after the lead had be
come solid: they soon ceased;—as if connected with the bad
conducting power of platina?        -
   “4th, The solidifying of the melted metals in the cup, and
their crystallization when made to solidify during their vibra
tions, offered several singular phaenomena, particularly with
bismuth, lead and tin. As far as trials have yet gone, the cry
stallizing property seemed to be more conspicuous when so
lidifying during the vibrations, than when the same quantities
of metals were not vibrating.
     “These observations,               #.
                                  those of your brother, seem to
connect this  subject  closely  with the arcana of cohesion. On
seeing the copy of your brother's paper, which you were so
good as to send me, on the 19th of April, was naturally much          I
interested in the perusal, and cannot but think his theory
the true one. An extensive field seems to be opened for ex
amining the passage of heat through metallic bodies, in con
nexion with the structure of their atoms in cohesion.          could                         I
wish much that he or     you  would repeat some of the above ex
periments.        I
               do not know when                        I
                                        shall find time to resume

advance without one of the small metallic        Breguet's  thermo
meters, with which the temperature of the ingots might be
approximated           to.

                                                  to

the infallibility of the undulationists.    They tell us, it is true,
that the   image  of the sun's  disk,  produced  by a lens of short
focal length, may be used instead of a luminous body, in all
experiments in which it is wished to produce a series of waves
diverging from a point. And the measurements hitherto taken,
which have been supposed by some to demonstrate the undu
latory theory, have been made with common lenses, without
its being imagined there was any need            achromatic, apla         of

342      Mr. Westwood's Descriptions of                   several new           British
   For another example, the experiment of May 23rd gives
                         z = .996759
                   and           -*-

                                       =    1.49685.
Or,     the ratio    of the velocities appears still to be, when fully
considered, nearly 1492, as we have taken it to be, at an                                 in
cidence nearly perpendicular.
   These experiments, then, give no adequate ground for main
taining the incorrectness of the hypothesis that the velocity in
refracting bodies is inversely as their refractive indices.
   On a careful re-examination of the thickness of the glass,
of the value of the threads of the screw by which were mea
sured the distances i i and ef, and of the other parts of the
apparatus, I could find no ground to suppose the results I had
obtained were influenced materially by any other imperfec
tion besides the aberration at the focus of the lens.
    I  shall consider it exceedingly important to determine
whether, when an achromatic lens of short focus is used to
form the luminous point, the central band of direct interference
given by two mirrors is black, as it has appeared to me, and
to several friends to whom I have shown                        it,

proximus, sedad Encyrtum quoque accedere videtur,” a remark which ap
plies both to Coccophagi and Agonioneuri. Were, however, the latter genus
synonymous with Aphelinus, Dalman would doubtless, from the intimate
affinity of the two genera, have placed Ent, scutellaris with Aphelinus. The
number of joints in the antennae is also different in Agonioneurus and
Aphelinus.                                                                         º

enlarged at the apices, and slightly inclined towards the lip.
Pectus heart-shaped.         In structure and relative length the
legs and palpi are similar to those of Neriene marginata. The
colour of these parts is red-brown, the pectus, lip, maxillae,
and margins of the cephalothorax being the darkest; and the
eyes are placed on black spots. Abdomen oval, convex above,
projecting over the base of the cephalothorax, thinly clad with
hair, glossy, and of a brownish-black colour.

  of the lateral margins, immediately above which is a longitu
 dinal row of triangular, black spots, and along the middle
 extends a black band bifid in front.           Eyes placed on black
 spots, their disposition and relative size being the same as in
  the other species of the genus. Mandibles long, conical,
 armed with two rows of teeth on the inner surface, and in

 of the mandibles, is yellowish-brown, the maxillae being the
 palest. Legs long and slender, provided with a few upright
 spines; they are of a pale yellowish-brown colour with brown
 ish-black bands. Each tarsus has three claws at its extre

     I   procured specimens                       of this spider in the spring of 1833,
in the woods at Oakland, but they were                                       all   males, and    I      have
not yet discovered the female.

     Cephalothorax oval, compressed before, convex above,
rather hairy, with depressed sides marked with furrows di
verging from the upper part towards the margins; it is of a
red-brown colour bordered by a fine, black line; on each side
are black lines forming several diverging narrow triangles,
whose vertices are directed towards the upper part of the ce
phalothorax, the small area inclosed by each being red-brown.
Eyes disposed on the anterior part of the cephalothorax in
two transverse, curved rows, whose convexity is directed back
wards; the eyes of the anterior row are somewhat larger than
those of the posterior row, the two intermediate ones bein
the largest of all.    Mandibles strong, conical, vertical, rather
prominent at the base, and armed with a few teeth on the                 in
ner surface. Maxillae short, powerful, convex underneath,
rounded at the extremity, and inclined towards the lip, which
is short and nearly square, being rather narrower at the apex
than the base.     Pectus heart-shaped.       Legs and palpi mode
rately long and robust, and provided with hairs and spines.
 These parts are of a red-brown colour, the                   lip

   With  respect to the explosion of the shell being audible at
a great depth, the experiment at Geneva is not any proof; for
if Irecollect aright, that was super<U+017F>ºcial sound, not perpen
dicular sound,—a difference of considerable consequence.

city, but unavailingly. In July last I received an anonymous
letter (which has since been published",) describing a mag
neto-electric apparatus, by which the decomposition of water
was effected.   As the term “guarded points” is used, I sup
pose the apparatus to have been Wollaston's (327. &c.), in
which case the results did not indicate polar electro-chemical
decomposition.     Signor Botto has recently published certain
results which he has obtainedf; but they are, as at present
described, inconclusive. The apparatus he used was appa
rently that of Dr. Wollaston, which gives only fallacious in
dications (327. &c.).     As magneto-electricity can produce
sparks, it would be able to show the effects proper to this ap
paratus. The apparatus of M. Pixii already referred to (343.)
has however, in the hands of himselft and M. Hachettes, given
decisive chemical results, so as to complete this link in the
chain of evidence.     Water was decomposed by          and the                     it,

  § 8. Relation by Measure of common and voltaic Electricity.
     361. Believing the point of identity to be satisfactorily esta
  blished,  I  next endeavoured to obtain a common measure, or
 a known relation as to quantity, of the electricity excited by
 a machine, and that from a voltaic pile; for the purpose not
 only of confirming their identity (378.), but also of demon
 strating certain general principles (366. 377, &c.), and creat
 ing an extension of the means of investigating and applying
 the chemical powers of this wonderful and subtile agent.
     362. The first point to be determined was, whether the
 same absolute quantity of ordinary electricity, sent through a
 galvanometer, under different circumstances, would cause the
 same deflection of the needle.       An arbitrary scale was there
 for attached to the galvanometer, each division of which was
 equal to about 4°, and the instrument arranged as in former
 experiments (296.). The machine (290.), battery (291.), and
 other parts of the apparatus were brought into good order,
 and retained for the time as nearly as possible in the same
 condition. The experiments were alternated so as to indicate
 any change in the condition of the apparatus and supply the
 necessary corrections.
     363. Seven of the battery jars were removed, and eight re-.
 tained for present use. It was found that about forty turns
 would fully charge the eight jars. They were then charged
 by thirty turns of the machine, and discharged through the
galvanometer, a thick wet string, about ten inches long, being
included in the circuit... The needle was immediately deflected
five divisions and a half, on the one side of the zero, and in
vibrating passed as nearly as possible through five divisions
and a half on the other side.
    364. The other seven jars were then added to the eight,
and the whole fifteen charged by thirty turns of the machine.
The Henley's electrometer stood not quite half as high as be
fore; but when the discharge was made through the galvano
meter, previously at rest, the needle immediately vibrated,
passing eractly to the same division as in the former instance.
These experiments with eight and with fifteen jars were re
peated several times alternately with the same results.
    365. Other experiments were then made, in which all the
battery was used, and     its     charge (being fifty turns   ofthe
machine,) sent through the galvanometer: but        it   was modi
fied   by   being passed sometimes through a     mere wet thread,
sometimes      through  thirty-eight      of
                                      inches    thin string wetted
by   distilled  water, and sometimes    througha   stringof  twelve

times the thickness, only twelves inches in length, and soaked
in dilute acid (298.).     With the thick string the charge
passed at once; with the thin string it occupied a sensible time,
and with the thread it required two or three seconds before
the electrometer fell entirely down. The current therefore
must have varied extremely in intensity in these different cases,
and yet the deflection of the needle was sensibly the same in
all     of
        them.      any difference occurred,
                         If                    was that the thin            it
string and thread caused greatest deflection; and        there                               if                  is
any lateral transmission,      M. Colladon says, through the

       then the  intensity   lower and the lateral transmission
                                            is
eSS.
     366. Hence       would appear that
                           it               the same absolute quan
                                                                 if

be      intensity, the deflecting force upon the magnetic needle

                                                 the needle was now                                               as

               as         the eleventh division, but the graduation

   projected, were parallel, and five sixteenths of an inch apart.
   The upper ends were well connected with the galvanometer
   wires. Some acid was diluted, and, after various preliminary
   experiments, that adopted as a standard which consisted of
  one drop strong sulphuric acid in four ounces distilled water.
   Finally, the time was noted which the needle required in
  swinging either from right to left or left to right: it was equal
  to seventeen beats of my watch, the latter giving one hundred
  and fifty in a minute.       The object of these preparations was
  to  arrange  a voltaic  apparatus,   which, by immersion in a given
  acid for a given time, much less than that required by the
  needle to swing in one direction, should give equal deflection
  to the instrument with the discharge of ordinary electricity
  from the battery (363. 364.); and a new part of the zinc wire
 having been brought into position with the platina, the com
 parative experiments were made.
      370. On plunging the zinc and platina wires five eighths
 of an inch deep into the acid, and retaining them there for
 eight beats of the watch, (after which they were quickly with
 drawn,) the needle was deflected, and continued to advance in
 the same direction some time after the voltaic apparatus had
 been removed from the acid.             It attained the five-and-a-half
 division, and then returned swinging an equal distance on the
 other side.     This experiment was repeated many times, and
 always with the same result.
     371. Hence, as an approximation, and judging from mag
 netical force only, at present (376.), it would appear that two
 wires, one of platina and one of zinc, each one eighteenth of
 an inch in diameter, placed five sixteenths of an inch apart,
 and immersed to the depth of five eighths of an inch in acid,
 consisting of one drop             oil   of

    373. The following arrangements and results are selected
from many that were made and obtained relative to chemical
action. A platina wire one twelfth of an inch in diameter,
weighing two hundred and sixty grains, had the extremity
rendered plane, so as to offer a definite surface equal to a cir
cle of the same diameter as the wire; it was then connected
in turn with the conductor of the machine, or with the voltaic
apparatus (369.), so as always to form the positive pole, and
at the same time retain a perpendicular position, that it might
rest, with         its
                   whole weight, upon the test paper                       em            to         be

 362   Mr. Faraday's Experimental                    Researches       in Electricity.
and in chemical force, the current of electricity of the standard
voltaic battery for eight beats of the watch was equal to that
of the machine evolved by thirty revolutions. .
    377. It also follows that for this case of electro-chemical de
composition, and it is probable for all cases, that the chemical
power, like the magnetic force (366.), is in direct proportion to
the absolute quantity of electricity which passes.
    378. Hence arises still further confirmation, if any were
required, of the identity of common and voltaic electricity,
and that the differences of intensity and quantity are quite suf
ficient to account for what were supposed to be their distinc
tive qualities.
    379. The extension which the present investigations have
enabled me to make of the facts and views constituting the
theory of electro-chemical decomposition, will, with some other
points of electrical doctrine, be almost immediately submitted
to the Royal Society in another series of these Researches.
   Royal Institution,     Dec. 15, 1832.
   NoTE.—I am anxious, and am permitted, to add to this paper a correc
                              I
tion of an error which have attributed to M. Ampere in a former series
of these Experimental Researches. In referring to his experiment on the
induction of electrical currents (78.), I have called that a disc which I should
have called a circle or a ring.     M. Ampere used a ring, or a very short
cylinder made of a narrow plate of copper bent into a circle, and he tells me
 that by such an arrangement the motion is very readily obtained.          I have
 not doubted that M. Ampere obtained the motion he described; but merely
 mistook the kind of mobile conductor used, and so far I described his ex
periment erroneously.
      In the same paragraph        I
                                  have stated that M. Ampere says the disc
 turned “to take a position of equilibrium exactly as the spiral itself would
 have turned had it been free to move;” and further on I have said that
 my results tended to invert the sense of the proposition “stated by M.
 Ampere, that a current of electricity tends to put the electricity of conductors
 near which it passes in motion in the same direction.”   M. Ampere tells me
                     I
 in a letter which have just received from him, that he carefully avoided,
 when describing the experiment, any reference to the direction of the in
 duced current; and on looking at the passages he quotes to me, I find that
to be the case. I have therefore done him injustice in - the above state
ments, and am anxious to correct my error.
    But that it may not be supposed I lightly wrote those passages, I will
briefly refer to my reasons for understanding them in the sense         did. At     I
first the experiment failed. When re-made successfully about a year                     af.

   To some copies of this work Mr. Young has added a set of loga
rithmic and other tables; but as we have already occupied so much
of our space, we can only add that we like the arrangement of these
 tables and certain contrivances employed in them very much.          Of
 their accuracy it is not easy to offer an opinion ; but we feel it
proper to state that we have lately dipped into them, at hazard,
 and with others of established reputation on our desk for compari
son, about two hundred times, and in no one of these cases did we-
detect an error.

of   Chatham and Rochester, and is characterized by the passage of
the river Medway through a narrow, winding gorge bounded by
chalk hills.   It exhibits six different deposits, viz. –Lower chalk,
Upper chalk, Plastic clay, London clay, Diluvium, and Alluvium.
An abstract of the paper is given in the “Proceedings"of the Society.
   A memoir was afterwards read “On a Fossil in the Bristol Mu
seum, and discovered in the Lias at Lyme Regis,” by Dr. Riley,
and communicated by Charles Stokes, Esq., F.G.S., &c.
   After stating the different opinions which had been given by those
naturalists who had seen the specimen, and alluding to their apparent
incorrectness, the author states that he is induced to consider the
fossil as the remains of a cartilaginous fish, having many points of
resemblance to the Rays, but differing from them in several im
portant characters.     He then proceeds to give a minute description
of the anatomical structure of the fossil, commencing with the head.
He states that the jaws are very much elongated; that he could dis
cover in the upper no traces of respiratory canals or openings; that
it appears to have fitted into a central groove in the lower jaw; that
there are no signs of any cavities for the reception of teeth; but that
there are lying near the jaws many spines with radiate bases similar to
the spines of rays and other cartilaginous fishes. The orbits are stated
to be of immense size, surrounded by an elevated edge or ridge,
and the space on each side of the median line and within these ridges
and corresponding to the parietal and frontal bones, to be flat and
depressed not unlike that of a Saurian; but the author considers
that this depression between the orbits may be better accounted for
by the fact of this part of the cranium being nothing more than a
thin membrane, as in some of the Chondropterygii.
   The vertebral column is said to be less injured than the other
parts of the animal. The processes have disappeared, but the bodies
of the vertebrae are perfect; they are circular and very numerous,
amounting to about 260, 28 of which are cervical, 143 dorsal, and
90 caudal.     From the slight groove for the reception of the spinal
marrow, and the separated condition of the cervical vertebrae, the
author is inclined to consider the spine as having a nearer resem
blance to that of a Squalus than of any other of the cartilaginous
fishes.
    The thoracic and pelvic members are stated to be greatly injured;
but from the characters which they present, it is inferred, that
they afford additional proofs that the fossil belonged to a cartila
ginous fish.
   In conclusion, the author conceives himself justified in considering
the specimen as the type of a new genus, and therefore assigns to
it the appellation of Squalo-raia Dolichognathos.

    The organic remains are found principally in two of the strata,
 namely, in the shelly bed B, which lies directly on the surface of
 the great oolite (C. &c.), and in the yellow clay, marked E, which lies
 within the oolite. The fossils of the bed B, are Aviculae in
 abundance, numerous species of Terebratulae and Ostreas, with
 several other species of univalve and bivalve shells, Corals, Asteriae,
 Echini, vertebrae and teeth of fishes, Crustaceae, Pentacrinus vulgaris,
 Eugeniacrinites pyriformis (Goldfuss), and three species of Apio
 crinites, viz. Apiocrinites globosus, A. intermedius, and A. elongatus.
 The author observes that where the undulations of the great oolite
rise above the level of half a foot, the debris of shells are wanting.
 He also remarks that the columns of the Apiocrinites are never found
erect, but appear to have been thrown into their present, horizontal
position by the superincumbent weight of clay at the moment of
 deposition.     He supports this opinion by the fact that the columns,
 though in general separated from the roots, have their terminations
almost invariably directed towards them, -an arrangement which he
believes could not have occurred, had they been broken off and
 swept from their pedicles by a strong current.
    The fossils contained in the yellow clay bed E, are Terebratulae,
 Ostreas, Echini, palatal bones, numerous small corals, and the three
species of Apiocrinites already mentioned. The remains of the latter
are abundant, but in this bed, as in the stratum B, the Apiocrinites
elongatus is the most rare.
    The author next proceeds to draw the distinctive characters of
the genus Apiocrinites, and afterwards those of the three species
above enumerated. The memoir was illustrated by drawings and
very fine specimens of the fossils.

    In this paper, an abstract of which is given in the “Proceedings,”
various widely scattered remnants of tertiary formations are described,

which the deposits have been acted upon by igneous and aqueous
agents.

 County of Fermanagh,” by Sir Philip de Malpas Grey Egerton, Bart.,
F.G.S.,   was first read.
    After alluding, in terms of commendation, to Mr. Griffith's account
 of the Connaught coal-field, the author states that his principal ob
ject is to describe the organic remains which he obtained, in con
junction with Lord Cole, from the beds of shale forming part of the
lowest division of the coal series.      This shale deposit is stated to be
600 feet thick; to be covered by 70 feet of sandstone, and to be
separated, in the northern division of the district, from the subjacent
 or mountain limestone by another system of sandstone strata about
40 feet thick. It is described as being composed principally of fre
 quent alternations of beds of shale, more or less indurated, and of
 clay-ironstone.     In the upper part of the series, several beds of black
 argillaceous limestone and a thin stratum of micaceous sandstone
 are stated to occur, and in the lower a bed of finely grained ferru
ginous sandstone. The shale is said to differ considerably in aspect,
 colour and structure at the superior and inferior portions of the
 deposit, but that the distinctive characters pass into each other by
 insensible gradations.      The whole of the beds are stated to be re
 plete with organic remains, entirely different from those found in the
 subjacent limestone. In the upper strata the prevailing fossils enu
 merated in the Memoir, are Ammonites and Orthocerata, associated,
 though in less abundance, with Producta and Calamites; and in the
 lower, crinoidal remains and corals of the genus Calamopora.
    The authorthen describes the subjacent sandstone; the phaenomena
 which accompany the streams engulfed by the mountain limestone,
 and the fossils he procured from that formation; and lastly, he details
 the characters of a bed of shale which occurs at the bottom of the
 limestone system, and abounds with fossils, some of which are stated
 to be peculiar to         it.

   A specimen was exhibited of the Irish Hare, recently presented
to the Society by Mr. Yarrell, who pointed out the characters by
which it is distinguished from the common Hare of England and the
 Continent of Europe. Its head is shorter and more rounded;                                                        its

ears still shorter than         head; and      limbs less lengthened.
 The fur also differs  essentially from that    the common Hare, and
is useless     as
                an article    trade. ofMr. Yarrell added, that he had

   Mr. Owen mentioned             as an additional instance of the existence
of this power in the Loligo              that two specimens were pre

served in the Museum of the      Royal  College  of Surgeons, to which
 they were presented by Dr. Henderson as having leaped on board a
                                                                        -

   Dr. Grant again called the attention of the Society to his spe
cimen of Loligopsis guttata, Grant, and to specimens of Sepiola vul
garis, Leach, for the purpose of explaining more fully the anatomical
structure of these species, which he had exhibited, with Sepiola steno
dactyla, Grant, at the Meetings on February 12 and March 26. He
gave a detailed account of their anatomy, which he illustrated by
reference to an extensive series of diagrams prepared by himself.
These diagrams have been engraved on a reduced scale for publi
cation in the Society's Transactions.
   In the Loligopsis the parietes of the mantle are remarkably thin
and loose, excepting where they are supported by the dorsal trans
parent lamina, and by two thin cartilaginous laminae extending from
the free edge of the mantle about half-way down the sides, and
placed rather towards the ventral surface of the animal. These la
teral lamina present an appearance anomalous in Cephalopods. Each
of them sends out twelve or thirteen conical tubercles, about a line
in diameter at their base, and projecting to the distance of a line
beyond the general surface of the mantle.
   The viscera occupy but a small portion of the cavity of the mantle,
in which they are placed far backwards, the branchiae themselves not
extending forwards beyond the middle of the sac. The liver is                       di
vided, as in Nautilus, into four principal lobes, which are quite se
parate from each other; but the lobules which compose these lobes
are not, as in the Testaceous Cephalopod, detached from each other.
The branchial arteries are surrounded, before entering the auricles,
by a spherical cluster of vesicles, like those which open into these
vessels in Nautilus; but the auricles are not, as in Nautilus, wanting:
they are, however, destitute of those singular appendices usually
found attached to these muscular sacs in the Naked Cephalopods.
 The branchiae are single on each side, and are proportionally the
smallest which Dr. Grant has yet met with. The systemic ventricle
is very muscular, and of a lengthened fusiform shape: it has an
aortal trunk at each end. On the large dorsal or descending aorta
 there  is,   as Nautilus,
                   in           distinct bulbous enlargement, probably -
                                  a

taining, by the duration of their life when deprived by immersion in
water of the access of free air, whether the animals of Melampus,
 Tornatella, &c., are pectinibranchiate or pulmoniferous.              Mr. Lowe,
in his present paper, intended for publication in the same Journal,
is anxious to guard against the too strict adoption of his conclusion
that animals which continue to exist for a long time immersed in
water cannot be lung-breathing; as he conceives it to be possible
that in animals so comparatively low in organization as Mollusca,
the quantity of oxygen required for the aération of the blood may
be so small as to be furnished even by sea-water to lung-bearing
races; or, in the second place, the lungs being supposed to be in
active during the immersion, that some compensating power may
exist, as in the skins of the Batrachia, which may enable existence
to be prolonged for a considerable time without the access of free
air to animals whose organization is adapted for breathing                                                    it.

 was given in this Magazine for February 1832.                 Instead of consi
 dering the curves traced upon a spherical surface, as is usually
 done, as the line of intersection of two curve surfaces, one of which
 is the sphere itself, and of referring each curve surface to their recti
 linear coordinate aires, Mr. Davies refers that curve to two coordi
 nate ares, situated upon the spherical surface itself.               The system.
 which the author has already developed, is that in which points are,
 defined by the common geographical method of reference to lati
 tude and longitude, or else to polar distance and polar angle : he
 had before given                       all

same time that when reduced to the protoxide by calcination it lost
33 per cent. As the protoxide contains about 10per cent. of oxygen,
the 67 remaining parts would contain 67, which would give a total
of 397, differing 10 from their analysis.                                 -
   When the yellow oxide of bismuth is moderately heated with
potash, the mixture becomes brown, and after washing, a brownish
powder remains, which gives chlorine with muriatic acid.           As, how
ever, by this process but little of the peroxide is obtained,
                                                                    the fol
lowing process is recommended instead of it by M. Stromeyer
                                                                            :
Heat the oxide obtained by calcining the subnitrate with a solution
of chloride of potash or soda, which is readily prepared by decom:
posing chloride of lime with the alkaline carbonates.
                                                               When cold
but little action takes place, and even when heated the process goes
on but slowly, so that the ebullition must be continued for some
time.     The oxide of bismuth assumes at first a fine ochre yellow
colour, and at length becomes deep brown.            It is then to be well
washed, and in order to separate the protoxide which may remain,
it is to be treated with cold nitric acid, diluted with 9 parts of water;
it is to be added in excess to prevent the formation of submitrate of
bismuth.      It is then to be washed, at first with weak acid, and then
with   water,   and to be dried by a gentle heat.
   The  peroxide   thus prepared is a heavy deep-brownpowder, strongly
resembling peroxide of lead. When exposed to a temperature
                                                                        near
that of boiling mercury, it is decomposed, yellow oxide remaining
and oxygen gas being evolved. When mixed with powdered char
coal, and heated, it burns vividly; the mixture may be
                                                                 fired by a
live coal, and it continues to burn like amadou: the residue is a
mixture of metal and protoxide.           Hydrogen, at a moderate tem
perature, reduces it to protoxide, and at a higher one to the
                                                                    state of
metal.     When heated with sulphur it is quickly converted into
sulphuret: it forms no compounds with acids: muriatic acid evolves
chlorine, hydriodic acid converts it into a fine brown iodide,
                                                                         and
the liquor becomes yellow owing to free iodine.             Cold sulphuric
acid expels oxygen, but if dilute, heat is requisite, and phosphoric
acid acts in the same way. Cold nitric acid, containing no nitrous
acid, acts but feebly upon        it,
                                   but when heated        evolves oxygen.

formed.     If these experiments are made in a glass tube over mer

On comparing the crystallized acid with that contained in the salt
of silver, it will beseen that their difference consists in the first con
taining an atom of water.
   Berzelius's results were obtained by analysing benzoate of lead,
and in this the acid retains the water, which it does not when com
bined with oxide of silver, and this circumstance accounts for the
difference observed.
   MM. Wöhler and Liebig state, that the analysis of Dumas, in
which the oxygen and hydrogen are said to be in the proportions
which form water, is incorrect.

detailed with propriety       that place.    The reason was, that      those                                       as

 invariably exhibit local currents, which return into themselves in the
 same piece by various windings; and as those currents always affect
 the general current in the circle, it was necessary to explain the
 operation of those local currents in the first place, and to guard against
 their influence when contemplating the operation of general currents,
supposed to arise from other causes than that of crystalline groups of
 metallic films.
    For this purpose I cast rectangular frames, of the same fashion as
those I had before employed, of an alloy of tin and bismuth, in which
no local or other current could be detected, to whatever point heat
was applied; owing, no doubt, to the crystallization of the bismuth
                                                                         -
being nearly neutralized by the admixture of tin.
    When one end of a frame was cut open by a fine saw, and one sid
of the opening warmed in the flame of a spirit-lamp, the whole frame
became magnetic whenever the warm and cool sides were brought
into contact, as if an electric current set through the saw-cut, from
the heated to the cool extremity. I employed no multiplying gal
vanometer; simply sprung the sides of the opening together, and -
operated as with the whole frames of antimony, bismuth, &c.
     Ihad placed a good deal of importance in this discovery, until I
found that the phaenomena were not uniform in               the metals; for                        all
although the current passes through the opening from the heated

tent to which this mode of analysis may be carried.
    With regard to copper, and zinc, the law appears to hold good
when the battery is not too powerful. I have employed 100 pairs of
one-inch plates, and also 100 of two-inch plates, and have obtained
the same results. The metals were held in solution by sulphuric acid
and water. Whilst the battery was active, both copper and zinc were
deposited on the negative platina wire; but when the power was less.
active, the copper alone was revived.                                     -

          Letter from Captain Ross to the Hon. Captain Elliot.
                   “On board the Isabella, of Hull, Baffin's Bay, Sept. 1833.
    “Sir, Knowing how deeply my Lords Commissioners of the Ad
miralty are interested in the advancement of nautical knowledge, and
particularly in the improvement of geography, I have to acquaint you,
for the information of their Lordships, that the expedition, the main
object of which is to solve, if possible, the question of a north-west
passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, particularly by Prince
Regent's Inlet, and which sailed from England in May 1829, not
withstanding the loss of the foremast and other untoward circum
stances, which obliged the vessel to refit in Greenland, reached the
beach on which His Majesty's late ship Fury's stores were landed, on
the 13th of August.
     “We found the boats, provisions, &c., in excellent condition, but no
vestige of the wreck. After completing in fuel and other necessaries,
we sailed on the 14th, and on the following morning rounded Cape
 Garry, where our new discoveries commenced, and, keeping the west
 ern shore close on board, ran down the coast in a S.W. and W. course,
 in from ten to twenty fathoms, until we had passed the latitude of
 72° north in longitude 94° west: here we found a considerable inlet
 leading to the westward, the examination of which occupied two days;
 at this place we were first seriously obstructed by ice, which was now
 seen to extend from the south cape of the inlet, in a solid mass,
 round by S. and E. to E.N.E.: owing to this circumstance, the
 shallowness of the water, the rapidity of the tides, the tempestuous

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous    Articles.          395
 weather, the irregularity of the coast, and the numerous inlets and
rocks for which it is remarkable, our progress was no less dangerous
than tedious, yet we succeeded in penetrating below the latitude of
70° north in longitude 92° west, where the land, after having car
ried us as far east as 90°, took a decided westerly direction, while
land at the distance of forty miles to southward was seen extending
east and west. At this extreme point our progress was arrested on
the 1st of October by an impenetrable barrier of ice. We, however,
found an excellent wintering port, which we named Felix Harbour.
     “Early in January 1830, we had the good fortune to establish a
friendly intercourse with a most interesting consociation of natives,
who, being insulated by nature, had never before communicated with
 strangers; from them we gradually obtained the important informa
 tion that we had already seen the continent of America, that about
forty miles to the S.W. there were two great seas, one to the west,
 which was divided from that to the east by a narrow strait or neck of
 land. The verification of this intelligence either way, on which our
future operations so materially depended, devolved on Commander
 Ross, who volunteered this service early in April, and, accompanied
 by one of the mates, and guided by two of the natives, proceeded to
 the spot, and found that the north land was connected to the south
 by two ridges of high land, fifteen miles in breadth, but, taking into
 account a chain of fresh-water lakes, which occupied the valleys be
 tween, the dry land which actually separates the two oceans is only
 five miles. This extraordinary isthmus was subsequently visited by     .
myself, when Commander Ross proceeded minutely to survey the sea
 coast to the southward of the isthmus leading to the westward, which
 he succeeded in tracing to the 99th degree, or to 150 miles of Cape
 Turnagain of Franklin, to which point the land, after leading him into
 the 70th degree of north latitude, trended directly: during the same
journey he also surveyed thirty miles of the adjacent coast, or that to
 the north of the isthmus, which, by also taking a westerly direction,
 formed the termination of the western sea into a gulf. The rest of
 this season was employed in tracing the sea-coast south of the isthmus
 leading to the eastward, which was done so as to leave no doubt that
 it joined, as the natives had previously informed us, to Ockullee, and
 the land forming Repulse Bay. It was also determined that there
 was no passage to the westward for thirty miles to the northward of
 our position.
     “This summer, like that of 1818, was beautifully fine, but ex
 tremely unfavourable for navigation, and our object being now to try
 a more northern latitude, we waited with anxiety for the disruption
 of the ice, but in vain, and our utmost endeavours did not succeed
 in retracing our steps more than four miles, and it was not until the
 middle of November that we succeeded in cutting the vessel into a
 place of security, which we named Sheriff's Harbour.       I may here
 mention that we named the newly-discovered continent, to the south
 ward, Boothia, as also the isthmus, the peninsula to the north, and
 the eastern sea, after my worthy friend Felix Booth, Esq., the truly

 enabled me to equip this expedition in a superior style.
   “The last winter was in temperature nearly equal to the means of
 what had been experienced on the four preceding voyages, but the
 winters of 1830 and 1831 set in with a degree of violence hitherto
 beyond record; the thermometer sunk to 92° below the freezing
 point, and the average of the year was 10° below the preceding; but,
  notwithstanding the severity of the summer, we travelled across the
 country to the west sea by a chain of lakes, thirty miles north of the
 isthmus, when Commander Ross succeeded in surveying fifty miles
 more of the coast leading to the N.W., and, by tracing the shore to
 the northward of our position, it was also fully proved that there
                                                                -

 miles to the northward, and as we had not doubled the Eastern Cape,

immediately took the consistency of ice, and thus we actually became
the inhabitants of an iceberg during one of the most severe winters
hitherto recorded. Our sufferings, aggravated by want of bedding,
clothing and animal food, need not be dwelt upon. Mr. C. Thomas,
the carpenter, was the only man who perished at this beach; but three
others, besides one who had lost his foot, were reduced to the last
stage of debility, and only thirteen of our number were able to carry
provisions, in seven journeys of sixty-two miles each, to Batty Bay.
   “We left Fury Beach on the 8th of July, carrying with us three
sick men, who were unable to walk, and in six days we reached the
boats, where the sick daily recovered.    Although the spring was mild,
it was not until the 15th of   August  that we had any cheering pro
spect. A gale from the westward having suddenly opened a lane of
water along shore, in two days we reached our former position, and
from the mountain we had the satisfaction of seeing clear water almost
directly across Prince Regent's Inlet, which we crossed on the 17th,
and took shelter from a storm twelve miles to the eastward of Cape
York. The next day, when the gale abated, we crossed Admiralty
Inlet, and were detained six days on the coast by a strong north-east
wind.    On the 25th we crossed Navy Board Inlet, and on the fol
lowing morning, to our inexpressible joy, we descried a ship in the
offing, becahmed, which proved to be the Isabella, of Hull, the same
ship which I commanded in 1818. At noon we reached her, when
her enterprising commander, who had in vain searched for us in
Prince Regent's Inlet, after giving us three cheers, received us with
every demonstration of kindness and hospitality which humanity could
dictate. I ought to mention also that Mr. Humphreys, by landing
me at Possession Bay, and subsequently on the west coast of Baffin's
Bay, afforded me an excellent opportunity of concluding my survey,
and of verifying my former chart of that coast.                     -
  “I    now have the pleasing duty of calling the attention of their
Lordships to the merits of Commander Ross, who was second in the
direction of this expedition. The labours of this officer, who had the
departments of astronomy, natural history and surveying, will speak
for themselves in language beyond the ability of my pen; but they
will be duly appretiated by their Lordships, and the learned bodies
of which he is a member, and who are already well acquainted with
his acquirements.                                                      -
   “My steady and faithful friend Mr. William Thom, of the Royal
Navy, who was formerly with me in the Isabella, besides his duty as
third in command, took charge of the meteorological journal, the
distribution and oeconomy of provisions; and to his judicious plans and
suggestions must be attributed the uncommon degree of health which
our crew enjoyed; and as two out of the three who died the four years

    “Commander Ross, Mr. Thom, and myself, have, indeed, been
 serving without pay; but, in common with the crew, have lost our
 all, which I regret the more, because it puts it totally out of my power
 adequately to remunerate my fellow-sufferers, whose case I cannot
 but recommend for their Lordships' consideration. We have, how
 ever, the consolation, that the results of this expedition have been
 conclusive, and to science highly important, and may be briefly com
 prehended in the following words:—The discovery of the Gulf of
 Boothia, the continent and isthmus of Boothia Felix, and a vast num
 ber of islands, rivers and lakes; the undeniable establishment that
the north-east point of America extends to the 74th degree of north
latitude; valuable observations of every kind, but particularly on the
magnet; and, to crown all, have had the honour of placing the illus
trious name of our Most Gracious Sovereign William IV. on the true
position of the magnetic pole.
      “Icannot conclude this letter, Sir, without acknowledging the
important advantages we obtained from the valuable publications of
Sir Edward Parry and Sir John Franklin, and the communications
kindly made to us by those distinguished officers before our departure
from England.      But the glory of this enterprise is entirely due to

404                  Sir John F. W. Herschel on the Absorption
perfect elasticity resolves our conception of the vibrating mass
 into that of a multitude of inharmonious systems communi
 cating with each other. At every transfer of an undulation
 from one such system into that adjacent, a partial echo is
 produced.     The unity of the propagated wave is thus broken
up, and a portion of it becomes scattered through the interior
of the body in dispersed undulations from each such system,
as from a centre of divergence.          In consequence of the con
tinual repetition of this process, after a greater or less number
 of passages to and fro of the original wave across the body,

 respecting them (at the end of observation 11.): “When                                                         I
 made the foregoing observations, I designed to repeat most of
 them with more care and exactness, and to make some new
 ones for determining the manner how the rays of light are
 bent in their passage by bodies for making the fringes of co

his views with extraneous considerations, he would give the
scientific world a perspicuous and systematic development of
them, so as fairly to contrast the explanation of the facts which
his theory affords with that resulting from the other theories.
   Perhaps it may not be altogether uninteresting to the reader
to see at one view how the rival theories at present apply.
I subjoin, therefore, a synoptic sketch, which I believe to be
perfectly impartial; indeed, I have given every advantage to
the corpuscular theory.     It would be interesting if Mr. ar
ton would add a third column, giving a similar view of his

         Gentlemen,
THE  demonstration which appears in the Number of your
  Magazine for March 1833, by Mr. Murphy, does not
seem to me to be conclusive.
      For P is       of p and q: as also is
                       a function                                                     now a value  Q:
being assigned to p, a value is found                                                       for
                                                                                     which makes   q,
       =
Q      0; and the value                         of       P        in    (1) depends upon these as
signed values     and        of  p           q.
   Again:     the second substitution,
                      in                                                           for          p         is   put     p   +     h.

value        is   then found for                q+h.              sin   #,   and therefore for q,which
                                 but this value does not necessarily appear

LXVII.          On a brilliant Arch of an Aurora Borealis seen on
  the Evening     of March 21, 1833. By R. Potter, Jun. Esq.”
     N   this evening the sky was cloudy in the neighbourhood
       of Manchester: it was nevertheless noticed by Mr. John
Blackwall, of Crumpsall Hall, by Mr. Hatfield, of Corn
brook, and by myself, that there was a considerable light in
the N.N.W.; no one in the neighbourhood, however, was
                                                                                               j
able to obtain a useful observation.
    This display was, however, seen in many other places situated
at considerable distances from each other, and the same ge
neral description is given of                    it.
                                           Professor James          Forbes                  D.
kindly sent me       an account             of
                                     his observation   immediately    after
it occurred and ;    I   am since also indebted         him for extracts to
from the “Proceedings”              the Royal Society, giving particu

tolerating any notion that the meteor seen in the N.N.W.
part of the heavens, over a distance of country of 200 to 300
miles, can possibly be located in the region of the clouds, or
that the epithet borealis, acknowledged to be appropriately
applied to this aurora, can be with any propriety attached
to any variety of aqueous clouds seen in our lower atmo
sphere.

of  the system about that axis are the same.
                     all                           Where the re

434 Rev.     H. Moseley            on the Theory             of Ilesistances in Statics.
   In a paper inserted in the Memoirs of the Academy of St.
Petersburgh—Novi Commentarii, tom. xviii.-entitled, “De
Pressione Ponderis in Planum cui incumbit,” Euler has investi
gated the conditions of the equilibrium of a heavy mass sup
ported upon a given number of points in the same horizontal
plane, and upon continuous and edged bases of given geome
trical forms and dimensions.    As the foundation of this in
vestigation,he has assumed the principle, that if the surface
on which the body rested were elastic, each point of support
would sink to a depth proportionate to the pressure it sustains.
Taking, then, the actual surface on which the mass rests for
the plane of a y, and assuming
                                  z   =     x4   + 3y + y
to be the equation to the plane in which the points of support
would be found on the hypothesis of an elastic surface, z is
proportional to the pressure upon that point of support whose
coordinates are a y. And, this admitted, the constants a, 3, y,
may be determined by the known conditions of equilibrium.
   To this hypothesis, which is grounded on no experimental
fact or analogy, there is an objection, apparent on the very
face of  it.      this: “The forces
                 It                       which the body   sup

brium    onthe elastic surface, are not the same with those                                 by
which   it   sustained
             is              the perfectly hard surface.
                                       on                 Euler
has foreseen this  objection.
   He thus speaks           “Neminem autem pannus ille pres
                              of      it:

   Now although                   be
                         admitted that the actual displacements

any of the sections into which M. Walckenaër has subdivided the genus
Drassus, in the woods at Oakland, in July 1833; at which season of the
year the female constructs a lenticular cocoon of white silk, of a fine,
compact texture, about ºths of an inch in diameter, which she places in
a semicircular cavity formed in the ground beneath stones and lined with
silk, depositing in it between one and two hundred whitish eggs of a
spherical form, not agglutinated together.      She is greatly attached to her
cocoon and is separated from it with difficulty.     Hitherto the male of this
species has escaped my observation.               -

                                     then, examine whether we

Graham adopts with                 Na'.               Berzelius represents water either
 by   Aq, which was his former method,                                  or   by H      which           is   his

nifies half an atom of oxygenated water. Berzelius places
the symbol of water last, with + prefixed, as will be observed
in the formula quoted from him. Mr. Graham places it be
tween the alkali and acid, without the sign +. In page 285,
Mr. Graham denotes a compound of three atoms of water
with one atom of phosphoric acid by                           Hº P: Berzelius would
formerly have denoted               the compound               by   P+3 Aq,             and at
present he uses the formula                P + 3H.
   In answer to these observations, it may perhaps be ima
gined that Mr. Graham has employed a totally distinct system
of notation. I am not prepared to deny this, yet I much
doubt    it;

                Optical Structure of the Crystalline Lenses of Animals,
particularly that of the Cod.” By Sir David Brewster, K.H., LL.D.,
F.R.S. V.P.R.S. Ed.
  The author was led, by             the observations he had made of some very
 singular phaenomena in the crystalline lenses of fishes and quadrupeds
 when exposed to polarized light, to examine their minute anatomical
 structure, with the view of ascertaining if it had any relation to these
optical appearances.           He found that the crystalline lens of a cod has
 the form of a    prolate    spheroid,     of which the axis coincides with that
of vision.          Its
                  body      inclosed  is                        an

appearance peculiar               grooved surfaces, and exhibited

to the decomposition of atmospheric air during putrefactive processes
going on at the bottom of the sea. Dr. Daubeny offers objections to
the theory of that gas rising to the surface in consequence of the high
temperature to which it has been subjected. He conceives that the
air which Dr. Davy examined cannot have been derived from sea
water, but must have originated from the atmosphere itself, with
which the volcano communicated. The author is disposed to attach
great importance to the accurate examination of the gases given out
by warm springs, and recommends the prosecution of the inquiry.
   A paper was also read, entitled, “Experimental Researches on
Atomic Weights.” By Edward Turner, M.D., F.R.S. Lond, and Edinb.,
Professor of Chemistry in the University of London.
   This paper is a continuation of the Essay, by the same author, on
the Composition of the Chloride of Barium, which was published in
the Philosophical Transactions for 1829*. Having shown that the
atomic weights current among British chemists, though in some in
stances correct, or tolerably approximative, have, as a whole, been
adopted on insufficient evidence, he proceeds, in this paper, to give
an account of the experiments he has made to ascertain the equivalent
numbers for lead, chlorine, silver, barium, and nitrogen. Finding, with
reference to lead, that the method adopted by Berzelius did not afford
uniform results, he endeavoured to ascertain the quantity of subsul
phate of lead which given weights of metallic lead and the protoxide
of that metal respectively produce. He details the mode he employed
for the conversion of metallic lead into the subsulphate by a mixture
of nitric and sulphuric acids, diluted with an equal bulk of water, and
the precautions he adopted to avoid loss. The mean of three expe
riments gave 146.375 grains of sulphate of lead for 100 grains of
metallic lead. By the mean of four experiments, Berzelius had ob
tained, instead of the former number, 146:419. Dr. Turner adopts
the mean of the whole, namely, 146-41. By prosecuting this inquiry,
he finds the sulphate to consist of 73-575 of protoxide of lead, and
26-425 of sulphuric acid; and that the former contains 5-274 of
oxygen. According to these results, the equivalent number for lead
is 103-6.                                                      -
   By experiments with the chloride of lead, which gave very uniform
results, Dr. Turner obtained an equivalent number for chlorine, closely
agreeing with that calculated from the analysis of chlorate of potash
in the experiments of Berzelius, namely, 35-45, but totally incon
sistent with the atomic weight assigned to it by British chemists. The
accuracy of this result was further confirmed by a careful comparative
analysis of the binoxide and bichloride of mercury.
   The author next endeavoured to determine the equivalent number
for silver, by the analysis of           its
                                     oxide and sulphuret, but could not
arrive  at  any precision        in    his
                                   results. The equivalent number                        for
barium may        calculated from his analysis

 His investigation of the atomic weight of sulphur is not yet com
pleted; but he details several previous steps in this inquiry, which he
intends to prosecute on a future occasion. He estimates the equiva
lent of mercury at 202; a number which he considers as a close ap
proximation.
    He concludes by various remarks on the inconsistency with expe
riment, which is apparent in many of the numbers adopted as chemical
equivalents by British chemists; and on the inaccuracy of those num
bers which have been employed as elements in calculating the equi
valents of nearly                  all
                             the other elementary substances.            The author

    The author, while prosecuting his researches on electro-chemical
decomposition, observed some phaenomena which appeared to be refer
able to a general law of electric conduction not hitherto recognised.
 He found that an electric current from a voltaic battery, which is
 readily conducted by water, did not pass through ice: even the
 thinnest film of ice, interposed in the circuit, was sufficient to inter
 cept  all   electric influence         of
                                        such low intensities         that produced byas
 the voltaic apparatus, although               allows

  ments of the French Academy.         In the present communication he
  states the results of his further inquiries on this subject. His expe
 riments were made at the East India Docks, on a boat twenty-three
 feet long and six wide, with the stem and stern nearly vertical; one
 end being terminated by an angle of 42°, and the other of 72°; and
  the resistance to the boat's motion being measured by a dynamome
 ter. The results are given in tables: and it appears from them, that
 in light vessels sharpness is more important in the bow than in the
 stern ; but that the reverse is the case in vessels carrying heavy car
goes. From another series of experiments the author infers that the
resistance to a flat surface does not exceed 195lb. for each square
foot, at a speed of one mile per hour; increasing, for greater velo
cities, in a ratio considerably higher than the square of the velocity.
    The author concludes with some observations on the results lately
obtained in Scotland, where great velocities were given to boats
moving on canals, without a proportional increase of resistance.
    The reading of a paper, entitled, “Researches on the Arseniates,
Phosphates, and Modifications of Phosphoric Acid,” by Thomas Gra
ham, Esq., M.A., F.R.S.E., Lecturer on Chemistry in the Andersonian
Institution of Glasgow; communicated by Edward Turner, M.D.,
F.R.S.,-was        commenced.
     June 13.—Mr. Graham's paper was resumed and concluded.
     The tendency of the arsenic and phosphoric acids to form subses
 quisalts with the oxides of silver and lead is well known ; correspond
 ing salts with alkaline bases also exist. The author describes the me
 thod of forming the subarseniate and subphosphate of soda, and their
 properties; and shows that they are subsesquisalts, containing one
 proportion and a half of base to one of acid. They are the only known
 soluble salts of that constitution; and it is remarkable, that the acid
 of the subphosphate of soda is not convertible into pyrophosphoric
 acid by the action of heat, like the acid of the common phosphate of
soda. This may be explained on the hypothesis, that phosphoric acid,
 in contradistinction to pyrophosphoric acid, contains an atom of water,
 which stands in a basic relation to the acid, and which may be re
placed by an atom of any of the usual bases.         Hence also arises the
disposition of phosphoric acid to form subsesquisalts; for the common
phosphate, used as a precipitant, exchanges           its
                                                     basic water for fixed   a
base; and for this reason, likewise, phosphate         soda,
                                                          of    any neutral

phosphate, cannot       bemade   anhydrous    without   becoming      pyro   a
phosphate; but the subphosphates having              an

anhydrous,       Stromeyer observed; and indeed they are not con
                  as
vertible into pyrosalts. The acid formed         by

animal matter, constituting the nacreous or granular structure.                   The
former class of shells, which includes most of the turbinated uni
valves, may be divided into those in which the crystals are rhombic,
and those in which they are prismatic. The first are composed of
three distinct layers, the laminae of which are disposed differently in
the intermediate layer from what they are in the outer and inner
layers. The direction of the fibres of each being nearly at right
angles to that of the contiguous layer, the strength of the shell is
rendered considerably greater than if the arrangement of the fibres
had been uniform in each plate. The comparative thickness of the
three plates varies in different shells; but the central plate is gene
rally the thickest. The outer plate is the thinnest; and, in some
shells, is easily detached, in consequence of the deposition underneath
it of a white film of less coherent matter. It often happens, that

the  largest of which was about fifty-seven pounds in weight; the
others were considerably smaller. Their shape is more or less oval
and flat, with surfaces rather oxidated, and here and there covered
with an earthy crust. The larger lumps did not exhibit any trace of
scoriae; but in some of the smaller pieces, part of the metallic mass
had passed into a porous slag-like body; of which latter a few de
tached pieces were likewise found. This iron possesses no degree of
ductility; it is not attacked by the saw, and but slightly and with
difficulty by the file. Its tenacity, however, is considerable; the
masses required great strength to be broken; but small fragments
did not oppose greater difficulty to be reduced to a coarse powder
than white cast-iron; and glass was but slightly scratched by them.

which are situated between the caeca of the stomach, and which are
studded by an immense number of small rounded bodies closely con
gregated together, and bearing a great resemblance to the structure
of the venae cavae of the cephalopodous Mollusca. The purpose an
swered by this structure is involved in much obscurity: the author
offers a conjecture that they may be analogous in their office to the
mesenteric glands of the higher animals.
   With a view to determine some circumstances relating to the mode
of the respiration of the leech, the author made some experiments, by
confining the animal in water deprived of air by boiling. After some
time the leech was observed to give out bubbles of air; and the water
of the vessel, when tested by lime-water, indicated the presence of
carbonic acid.—The paper is accompanied by drawings of the struc

   With a view to the future investigation of the osteological deve

the results of a great number of measurements, which he has very
carefully made, of the dimensions of the different bones composing
the adult human skeleton.    The male bones examined were those in
the collection of     Dr. Monro; the female bones were furnished by
Dr. Hamilton.       The author was anxious to fix on some one dimen
sion in the skeleton which might be taken as the standard of                  the                                    all

bonic acid and ammonia, by which a salt is formed possessing singu
larly alkaline properties. The second is on the sesquicarbonate of
ammonia; a term which Mr. Richard Phillips has applied to that salt
of ammonia which is commonly called the subcarbonate, and which is
obtained by the mutual decomposition of carbonate of lime and sal
ammoniac, by means of heat. This the author concludes, from his
experiments, to be composed of one proportion ammonia, one and
a half of carbonic acid, and one of water. He then enters into a
comparative review of the analyses of this salt by other chemists, and
 gives an account of the results of his experiments to determine its
 solubility at different temperatures. He next proceeds to consider
 the bicarbonate of ammonia, which he finds to consist of one propor
 tion of ammonia, two of carbonic acid, and two of water.     He con
 cludes by an inquiry into the effects of heat on the solid sesquicar
 bonate and the carbonate of ammonia, in which he reviews the ex
 periments and inferences which Sir H. Davy has recorded in his ma
 nuscript notes.
  5. “On the Influence of Colour on Heat and Odours.” By James
Stark, M.D., of Edinburgh. Communicated by Sir David Brewster,
K.H., LL.D., F.R.S.V.P.R.S. Ed.
   The author observes, that the only experiments on record relating
to the modifying effect of different colours on the absorption of heat
from solar light, are those of Franklin and of Sir H. Davy.         In order
to investigate this subject, the author employed pieces of wool, silk,
and cotton, which were wrapped round the bulb of a thermometer
placed in a glass tube: the tube was then plunged into boiling water,
and the time which elapsed during the rise of the thermometer from
one given point to another was accurately noted. Other experiments
were also made with an air-thermometer, of which the bulb was coated
with various coloured materials, and heat thrown on the ball by means
of polished tin reflectors from an Argand burner. The results accord
very nearly with those of Franklin and of Davy; the absorbing power
with regard to different colours being nearly uniformly in the order of
black, brown, green, red, yellow, and white. The author next investi
gates the differences which occur in the radiation of heat by differently
coloured substances; a subject on which he is not aware that any ex
periments have ever been made previously to his own. The mode of
ascertaining the amount of radiation was generally the converse of
that by which the absorption of heat had been determined; namely,
by exposing the coloured substances, in contact with a thermometer,
to cooling instead of heating processes.       The general result of     his   all
experiments was, that the loss         caloricof           by
                                                  radiation follows exactly
the same order, with regard              to

particularly with soda. The crystallized salt of phosphate of soda was

of  the arch seen there had           Cambridge     at  very confused appear

unknown    distance,    and had afterwards remained         nearly  stationary.

                                               to
wards, perhaps 15°. The Professor remarked that the elevation
must depend principally (among the observations here collected,)

for about half an hour, with very small change of position. At Cam
bridge it was seen about a degree south of the Pleiades, directed
to a point three or four degrees south of a Cygni, and therefore
north of 2 Arietis: at York it was seen four degrees south of the
Pleiades and south of a Arietis, passing between 2 Arietis and                                      Ju
piter. On tracing these directions on a celestial globe, it appeared
that they both met the horizon at a point about twenty-six degrees
north of the east: and the Professor's conclusion was that this was
a horizontal arch seen according to the rules of perspective in these
different positions at York and Cambridge.     If so, it was probably
seen as an arch in some country to the east or north-east of us. At
Brussels, the only place from which any account had been received,
the weather was cloudy.     The principal arch was seen to become
double at the same time at Cambridge and at York; and the undu
lations or pulsations of light commenced at the same time at both
places. The Professor pointed out as a phaenomenon probably of
great importance in reasoning on the physical cause of these flashes,
and which he had verified with care in this and in a previous                                        in
stance, that the successive flashes always illuminated the same
portions of the heavens, the light passing in the order of upwards
over these portions.

of the members present.

   The notes which Mr. Rees has added, though not numerous, will
in general       be
                found useful, and we especially approve            his pre               of

                          is   in

   Again,      page 37, note, Mr. Rees says “In

                             of                                                                                        of

the alkaline substances occurring in the Solana. It is a white pearly
powder, insoluble in cold, scarcely soluble in boiling water, and fu
sible at 212° Fahr. When decomposed by heat, it yields products
which contain no azote: it restores the blue colour of litmus which
has been reddened by an acid, and forms with acids perfectly neu
tral but uncrystallizable salts.
   Solania was discovered by M. Desfosses in the ripe berries of the
Solanum nigrum, and also in the leaves and stocks of the S. Dulcamara.
M. Morin met with it in the fruit of the Solanum mammosum, and
MM. Payen and Chevallier, in that of the Solanum verbascifolium.
