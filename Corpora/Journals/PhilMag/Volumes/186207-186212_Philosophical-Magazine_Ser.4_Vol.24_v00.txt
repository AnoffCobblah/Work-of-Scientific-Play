                      have, for the purpose of illustrating the ab
sorption of  light,  made use of a principle already propounded by
Euler in his “Theoria lucis et caloris,” viz. that the particles of
a body, in consequence of resonance, absorb principally those
ethereal undulatory motions which have previously been im
pressed upon them, and                   I
                               extend the validity of this principle
not  only to the case in which the absorbed light displays itself
sensibly as light and heat, but also to that in which        effect                     its        is
evidenced         by

hofer-lines in the solar spectrum were, so to speak, an inversion
of the bright lines in the electrical spectrum, and that an ex

respecting the nature of heat; and at the same time the success
of such treatment must depend essentially on the truth of the
hypotheses assumed, whence it is evident that, in assuming the
grounds for such a theory, it is necessary, as much as possible, to
interrogate Nature by experiments. A first clue is offered by
the natural connexion which exists between radiant and thermo
metric heat.    Radiant heat must necessarily consist of trans
verse aethereal vibrations, while, again, those vibrations are
dependent on the influence which the molecules of the body
itself have upon the particles of the aether. In the mean
time experiment shows that the influence of the medium
upon the motion of the aether consists in (1) a constant
alteration of the wave's length and velocity, (2) a diminution
of the amplitudes dependent on the distance. This diminution
is what is called absorption.           It cannot, however, take place
 unless the    particles   of the  body  be set in motion, and the heat
accordingly become thermometric.              In other words, experience
shows that radiant heat is absorbed when it passes through any
more or less athermanous body, and that the body is thereby
heated: if now radiant heat consist in certain undulatory mo
tions of the aether, and these motions are checked by the                                            in
fluence of the particles of the body, then, according to the law
of   vis viva, these particles must themselves acquire              motion.               a
Now,   it      true that this does not

motions are what constitute thermometric heat; but when we

seem that the hypothesis, that thermometric heat belongs ex
clusively to the body’s own molecules, is unavoidable.
   § 5. The question then becomes, What is the nature of that
oscillatory motion that constitutes thermometric heat? By a discus
sion of the differential equations that obtain for wave-motion in
general, we easily arrive at the conclusion, that the molecular
elasticity of a medium cannot be sufficiently great to allow that
medium to assume an undulatory motion in which the periods
of oscillation are so short as those of light and heat.              The
lengths of the waves would be so small as to be equal                                               to,      or

case  of  the vibrations      sound, these periods are millions

aggregation to another occurs without any sensible change in the

known, appear as chemical agency, fluorescence.
   The     chemical action must, however, be under the same rule as
the thermometric heat, viz. that a ray will show a more powerful
chemical agency in proportion to the ease with which the smallest
constituent parts of which a molecule may be considered as com
posed assume certain oscillatory motions.
    Fluorescence and phosphorescence, on the other hand, cannot
be explained on the grounds set forth in the foregoing articles,
In the first place, it must be considered as a law of nature that,
as long as light and radiant heat preserve their form of undulatory
motion, the period of oscillation remains unaltered. This, as
appears from the experiments of Melloni and Knoblauch, is also
the case with diffused heat, which moreover ceases instantaneously
with the radiation that produces                  Fluorescence,

12                       Mr. H. F. Baxter         on Nerve Force.
     First. The nervous tissue, like the muscular tissue, possesses
an electric state.
   Secondly. This electric state is developed during, and main
tained by, nutrition.
    Thirdly. The electric force of the nervous tissue is not con
verted into current force during nerve action.
   Fourthly. Whether the electric force of the tissue is converted
into nerve force during nerve action was left an open question.
It is this question I propose considering on the present occasion.
§ I. On the conversion             of the electric force of the                 nervous
                   tissue into nerve force during nerve action.
   Assuming my readers to be acquainted with the conditions
under which the so-called nerve current is obtained in the living
or recently-killed animal, viz. by placing the electrodes of a
galvanometer, one in contact with the transverse section, the
other in contact with the longitudinal surface of a nerve, the
point for consideration is this:—Can we obtain any evidence of
a sudden decrease in the nerve current during nerve action
indicative of a loss in the electric state of the nerve, and which
loss may give rise to the development of nerve force,—in other
words, a conversion of the electric force into nerve force in accord
ance with the principle of Conservation of Force #7
   To avoid unnecessary repetition                     I
                                           will sum up the general
results of my experiments,  as my   object  will be, not to study the
development of the nerve    current,  but merely the effect upon it
during the excitement of the nerve.
  The animal (guinea-pigs, rabbits, and frogs) having been
pithed, to avoid too great motion of the limb, the leg was fastened
down; the sciatic nerve was then exposed throughout              whole         its
course, and piece         thin of
                                glass  placed beneath      One      it.
                                                                   the               of
                  of a

shell-lac, excepting the extreme end, was inserted into the
nerve; the flat end          the other electrode was placed
                                   of                              the               on
surface     of
           the  nerve,  sometimes                 on
                                         the distal side, other timesat
on  the spinal side              of
                            the other. The distance between the
electrodes varied.     As soon               as
                                      the circuit was completed and
the nerve current obtained and noted, the spinal extremity         the               of
nerve was excited           by
                           small galvanic circle,

                        Mr. H. F. Baxter            on Nerve Force.                         13
marked decrease in the nerve current; and the effect, the oscilla
tion of the needle, was evidently due to the motion produced in
the nerve by the muscular contractions.    Instead of exciting the
spinal extremity of the nerve, the sole of the foot was irritated
by pieces of glass so as to cause reflex actions; the effects were
the same.
   In other experiments the distal extremity of the sciatic nerve
was divided, and the electrode, instead of being inserted into the
nerve, was placed in contact with the divided surface, the other
electrode being placed upon the external or longitudinal surface;
there was not the same oscillation of the needle as before,
neither was there any marked or sudden decrease; the needle
gradually receded.
   The nerve, and sometimes the spinal cord, was irritated by
other means (chemical+ and mechanical) so as to produce con
tractions; but the results were the same. It need scarcely be
stated that, when employing these means to excite muscular
contractions, great care is requisite that the chemical reagents,
or the electrodes of the battery, should not come into contact with
the electrodes of the galvanometer, and that the mechanical agent
should not consist of steel or iron, so as to act upon the needle of
the galvanometer.       In short, in            all
                                          these and similar experiments

stated that nerve force was a polar force*.         He considered the
nervous substance to consist of two forms—the vesicular or grey
nervous matter, and the fibrous or white nervous matter.             But
with   regard  to the  generation  of nerve  force,  he  compared   it to
the actions which take place in a galvanic battery. He says+,
“At    the point of junction or intermingling of these two forms of
nervous matter (the white and the grey or vesicular) blood is very
freely supplied, and at these points there is generated constantly
and unceasingly a force which in                                 its
                                               nature resembles very

there are  ample   grounds   for the   opinion  that,  although   nearly
allied   to electricity,    differs from, and

  According           to   Müllery, “the nervous principle                                   is    generated

16                     Mr. H. F. Baxter     on Nerve Force,
one part and transmitted to another.          Mr. Huxley, however,
after describing the connexion existing between the ganglionic
corpuscle and the nerve-fibres, very pertinently asks, “What are
the properties of ganglionic corpuscles?”         This appears to me
to be the very question requiring solution.         Do they originate
nerve force which is transmitted     by  the nerves to other parts?
or do they merely serve as the means of intercommunication
with the various parts of the nervous system, the whole extent
of the nervous system originating nerve force?
    The evidence upon which it is generally assumed that nerve
force arises in one part and is transmitted to another, rests
upon the non-transmission of impressions when the continuity
of the nervous trunk is interrupted either, as in our experiments,
by section or removal, or by disease. Here, however, we assume
the non-transmission of impressions to be identical with the non
transmission of force, and therefore it leaves the question as to
the parts originating nerve force undecided.          Brown-Séquard
has been   obliged to draw “a distinction between the property of
conduction or transmission and the property of being sensitive
or impressionable.”      He says, “The nerve fibres of the cerebral
lobes are conductors,  but they are not excitable, not impressionable;
and so is the grey matter of the spinal cord: when it exists alone,
establishing the communication between two parts of the spinal
cord, after a transverse section of the whole of the white matter,
it conducts, it transmits to the brain the sensitive impressions
made on impressionable organs behind the section, but when
irritated it does not transmit anything, because it is not im
pressionable”.” Here, then, we are obliged to suppose the same
property, the same mode of conduction to be associated with two
portions of the nervous system presenting such different anato
mical characters.
    Assuming it possible that nerve force might be generated in
the ganglionic portion as suggested by Dr. Todd, it appeared
probable that a difference in the nutritive actions in           whenit,
compared with those              of
                             the white fibrous     matter,  might            be
observed—that         greater activity would
                       a                             manifested, and
                                                      be
hence produce more powerful nerve current.
                   a                                 To ascertain this
point the following experiments were performed.

needle amounted to 3°. There was no difference in this respect
whether the experiment was made on the convolutions of the
cerebrum or those of the cerebellum. The greatest care, how
ever, is required not to allow one of the electrodes to come into
contact with the blood from a wounded vessel, as the effect upon
the needle was then very decided, amounting to 10° or 15° or
more.     Here, then, in these experiments we obtained the same
effects (the nervecurrent) as with the two surfaces of a nerve,
and, what is more to the purpose, the amount is not greater than
with a nerve.
   It     was impossible to perform similar experiments with       the
grey matter of the spinal cord, inasmuch as the two surfaces are
divided sections. When, however, one electrode was placed on
the longitudinal surface of the cord, and the other in contact
with the divided surface, no difference was observed when the
latter electrode was placed in contact with the grey matter or
with the white matter of the cord; the longitudinal surface was
positive to the other as with a nerve.
   Similar experiments were made on the cervical ganglia of
rabbits and guinea-pigs, by placing the electrodes one on the
surface, and the other in contact with the divided surface; the
effect upon the needle amounted to 2° or 3°.

  18               Mr. H. F. Baxter      on Nerve Force.
  that these are the views that are generally entertained; but the
  language usually employed implies them. The experiments of
  Helmholtz, in which he has calculated the time that elapses in
  the conveyance of an impression from one part of the nervous
  system to another, and the analogy that has been attempted to
  be drawn between a current of electricity traversing a wire in a
  galvanic circle, and the force which is supposed to be conducted
  by a nerve, have afforded some grounds for the supposition; but
  how could we explain reflex actions unless we supposed that the
  force was generated at the peripheral extremities of the nerves?
  Again, if nerve force be generated in any particular part of the
  nervous system, how is it that we are enabled to excite con
  tractions in the muscles of a limb by stimulating the divided
  extremity of the nerve? We cannot suppose for a moment that
  the mere irritation is converted into nerve force; this would be
 carrying the conversion-doctrine to rather an absurd extent.
     The supposition that nerve force is generated in the vesicular
  or ganglionic portion only of the nervous system and then
  transmitted to other parts,    I  believe to be erroneous.   That the
  peripheral extremities of the nerves, distal and central, are more
  adapted to receive impressions than the white or fibrous sub
  stance, I admit.     Impressions are made at the peripheral ex
  tremities of the nerves, and then transmitted to other parts by
 means of the white fibrous substance, or even by the grey or
  ganglionic portion; but the force, nerve force, is generated or
 associated with the nervous tissue under whatever form it
                                  -  - -
 assumes.
     Although   I have  failed in establishing to my own satisfaction
 the development of nerve force from electric force, still the appli
 cation of the principle of Conservation of Force must not be lost
 sight of by physiologists.      We have a right to ask how a force
 is generated, and how exerted or expended; we have no right to
assume that nerve force is increased by action; action implies ex
haustion.     I  have elsewhere stated that nerve force may be con
sidered   in a state of tension, and that it bears a stronger resem
blance to magnetism than to current force.           Its loss by action,
nervous     exhaustion,   is restored     by nutrition;  and increased
nutrition may give rise to excess of nerve force; but during
health the various forces in the organized body are so admirably
adjusted, that in their action and reaction upon each other no
disturbance ensues; in disease, however, the disturbance may
manifest itself in various forms.
    There is one other observation to make before concluding.
We shall err greatly if we keep limiting our inquiries to the
mere study of the electric properties of the various tissues, just as
we should err if we limited them to the investigation of the heat

that is developed in the animal body, or the carbonic acid in the
lungs, or the urea in the kidneys. The study of one is of as much
importance as that of the other. All these actions are mutually
dependent and answer one common purpose—the                                                well-being       of

Th;      elliptic functions which correspond to the modulus k=1
       reduce themselves, as is well known, to circular functions.
The case in question plays implicitly an important part in the
general theory, and it has been particularly studied by Guder
mann, and by Dr. Booth in connexion with his theory of parabolic
logarithms. But in the absence of a notation corresponding to
that used for elliptic functions in general, the theory has not, it
appears to me, been exhibited in                        its
                                        proper form. The defect

   Acetylene is not an isolated substance, but presents a starting
point for the formation of other bodies.     Berthelot has shown
that by simple addition of hydrogen it can be changed into
olefiant gas; by means of olefiant gas, alcohol can be formed,
and thus a commencement made with the chain of compounds
which constitute organic chemistry.     To     syntheses and pro       all
gressive formations, that                     of   acetylene furnishes the first step.

treatment submitted to fractional distillation, by which it was
resolved into three hydrocarbons, hydride of amyle, amylene,
and allyle, the latter being the most abundant.   It boils at 59°,
and is easily separated from the two others which boil at 30° and
35° respectively. These are separated by treatment with bro
mine, with which amylene forms a compound, while hydride of
amyle is quite unattacked.
   The formation of amylene is effected by a simple addition of
the radical ethyle to the radical allyle,
                                 C2H5+ C3H5–C5H10,
and is thus a sort of mixed radical, ethyle-allyle, analogous to
those described by Wurtz some years ago.
   The investigation of cocaine, the new base in the coca leaf,
begun by Niemann under Wöhler's direction*, has been con
tinued by Lössent. When the base is treated with hydrochloric
acid, it undergoes a simple metamorphosis: it separates into
benzoic acid, and a new base, for which Wöhler proposes the
mame Ecgonine (Škyovos, sprout).     The analysis of this new base
                  formula was C*H* NO9, and hence that the

mina as 2: 1. The substances were placed in a sealed tube, and
at once solidified in the cold. Heated to about 170°, the magma
was changed into a colourless liquid, which was separated by
decantation from small limpid hexagonal tables; under the
polariscope these exhibited the coloured rings and black cross
characteristic of the rhombohedral system.   The analysis showed
that this substance was   Levyne, Al” O’SiO4 CaO SiO2+6HO.
   When the same mixture was heated to a higher temperature,
a sand was produced which was nothing but crystallized silica,
accompanied by a small quantity of Levyne.
   By altering the relative proportions of silica and alumina,
variable results were obtained. A mixture of silicate and alumi
nate of potash gelatinized at the ordinary temperature, but was
transformed at 200° into a crystalline sand which had the com
position of Phillipsite.
   Deville has found that aluminate of baryta may be formed,
either by calcining the nitrate or carbonate of baryta with an
excess of anhydrous alumina, or by precipitating sulphate of
alumina by baryta.

  28      MM.   Geuther and Forsberg on Artificial Tungstates.
  bases crystallized exactly in the forms in which they occur       in
  Scheelite; and Geuther and Forsberg” have obtained a series       of
  tungstates by the same method. They found that the addition
  of common salt is necessary in order to obtain large crystals.
 They have prepared the tungstates of baryta, magnesia, zinc, and
 cadmium, and find that these bodies are isomorphous with the
 lime and lead salts. They also prepared the tungstates of iron
 and manganese, as well as some of their double salts. These
 latter bodies crystallize in rhombic forms, like the native tung
 sten.     By using different quantities of the chlorides of manga
 nese and iron, the various natural tungstens may be obtained in
 beautiful large crystals.
      The preparation was effected by placing a mixture of the salts
 in a covered porcelain crucible, which stood in a Hessian crucible
 half-filled with magnesia.      This was heated in a wind-furnace,
 and allowed to cool slowly; when the fused mass was extracted
 with water, the crystals were left undissolved.
     Of the various double tungstates of iron and manganese pre
 pared, the compound 7 (MnO WoO") + FeO WoO” was obtained
 in small brown crystals.      It probably corresponds to a Wolfram
from Schlackenwalde       analysed by Rammelsberg. The compound
2(MnO, WoO") +3(FeO WoO") was obtained in crystals 5 to 6
millims. in length.        It corresponds to no natural compound.
The     compound     MnO WoOº.--4(Fe0 WoO") corresponds to a
Wolframite from Ehrenfriedensdorf; and another, with the com
position MnO WoO84-7 FeO WoO", to a Wolfram from Neudorf,
analysed by Rammelsberg. A compound was obtained in lamel
lar crystals which had the formula MnO WoO"+3 Fe0 WoO";
it corresponds to the Wolfram of Limoges, and to a specimen
from Cumberland analysed by Berzelius.          Attempts were made,
but without success, to obtain crystallized tungstate of chrome
and tungstate of silver.
     In  an investigation of the higher degrees       of oxidation of
bismuth, Schradert has arrived at the following        results:—
     In the cold, hypochlorite of potash exercises no oxidizing
action on oxide of bismuth.
     If hydrated oxide of bismuth be boiled with an alkaline hypo
chlorite, substances richer or poorer in oxygen are obtained,
according as potash is present in greater or less excess.
     The bodies obtained by treatment with dilute alkalies are
soluble in concentrated nitric acid; treated with dilute acid,
brown anhydrous bodies are formed which correspond to the
formula Bió".

         M. Liebig   on the preparation  of Iodide of Lithium.     29
1-385, according to the proportion of the potash to the oxide
of bismuth, either red and yellow substances rich in oxygen are
obtained, or brown and black bodies poorer in oxygen. Boiled
with concentrated nitric acid, they leave a yellow residue of the
composition BiO*-i-2aq, difficultly soluble in this acid.
     Whatever the proportion of the potash to the bismuth, pro
vided very concentrated potash was used, red bodies were
obtained, and never, as Arppe states, brown anhydrous bis
muthic acid.
     The final product of decomposition of these red bodies by con
centrated nitric acid is also BiO*-i-2Aq.
     Liebig has described” the following simple method of pre
paring iodide of lithium and certain other iodides. One part of
amorphous phosphorus is placed in a mortar with forty times
its weight of warm water; twenty parts of iodine are added, and
brought well in contact with the phosphorus by rubbing.           The
liquid, at first dark brown, afterwards becomes colourless, and
more rapidly if heated in the water-bath.        The liquid is poured
off from the small residue of      phosphorus    and quite saturated
with baryta, at first with carbonate, and afterwards with baryta
water; and then filtered from the phosphate and well washed out.
The clear filtrate now contains iodide of barium; and by double
 decomposition with carbonate of lithia iodide of lithium is
formed.      The acid liquid formed by the action of iodine on
 phosphorus and water, which consists of phosphoric and hydri
 odic acids, may be neutralized with lime instead of baryta; the
 Imethod is otherwise the same.         In the place of amorphous
 phosphorus, ordinary phosphorus may be used; the action is
 then quicker, but also more violent.
     Pettenkofer, under Liebig’s direction, made experiments in
 order to see if iodide of potassium could not be advantageously
 prepared by the above method: one ounce of phosphorus was
 treated with iodine in the manner described, as long as the
 iodine dissolved without colouring the liquid; for this 13%
 ounces of iodine were necessary. The clear liquid was poured
 off from a small quantity of amorphous phosphorus which had
  been formed, and milk of lime, prepared from 8 ounces of burnt
 lime, added until the liquor was alkaline. After filtration, a hot
  solution of 9 ounces of crystallized sulphate of potash in 48
  ounces of water was added, and the whole allowed to stand six
  hours.    After filtration from the sulphate of lime, the clear
  liquid was evaporated down to a quart, and a solution of pure
  carbonate of potash added as long as a precipitate of carbonate
  of lime was formed. This was filtered; and the clear liquid, when

W. Reply to     Mr. R. Sabine's “Remarks on the Influence of Traces
    of Foreign  Metals on the Electric Conducting Power of Mercury.”
    By A. MATTHIEssen, F.R.S.; and C. Vogt, Ph.D.”
    N the above (Phil. Mag. June 1862) Mr. Sabine has                made
       some remarks on our paper (Phil. Mag. March 1862) which
we cannot leave unanswered.        Mr. Sabine says (page 457) “that
no formula is given to indicate how the numbers in the seventh
columns, headed ‘conducting powers calculated,’ are obtained.”
    On referring, however, to our paper(pp.177,178), the following
statement is made:—“From the foregoing Tables it will be seen .
that mercury, when alloyed with very minute quantities of an
other metal, with the exception of zinc, has a greater conducting
power; but when alloyed with larger quantities, has a lower
conducting power than the mean of the conducting powers of
their relative volumes * f.
    “The mean conducting powers of their relative volumes” ex
presses, we think clearly, the method by which the numbers in
the seventh columns were calculated.         We may be allowed here
to add to the passage above quoted, after the words “with the ex
ception of zinc,” gold and silver; for one of us used in calculating
the numbers given in the seventh columns of the gold and silver
series, as pointed out by Mr. Sabine (page 458), the values 49-468
and 63.333 for the conducting powers of gold and silver, instead
of 494-68 and 633-33 respectively.
    Mr. Sabine (page 458) refers to an opinion expressed by Dr.
W. Siemenst, “that the conducting power of a fluid metallic
mixture is in proportion to the conducting powers of the two
metals in their fluid state at the same temperature.”              If this
opinion be correct, we may deduce the value for the conducting
power of the metal alloyed with mercury from the observations
made with the amalgams; and we ought also to find that the
values so deduced from each observation are the same, for Mr.
Sabine has given, in a Table (page 459), only the means of the
conducting powers so found.         Let us now see how far the above
hypothesis will be correct; and in order to do so, we give in
Table I. the values deduced from our experiments for the con
ducting powers of the metals alloyed with mercury.
   * Communicated by   the Authors.
   t Unfortunately “values” has been allowed to stand (loc. cit.) as a
misprint for “volumes;” we think, however, that no one attentively reading
our paper would find much difficulty in making the necessary correction.

same amalgam twice in different tubes of different lengths and
diameters, the same amount of filtration should occur in both
cases.  The great concordance in most of the values obtained
with  amalgams of the same composition proves, we think, con
clusively that no such error was made in our experiments: this
also proves that the amount of the metal oxidized during the
process of heating the amalgams was so small that it has no
influence on the values obtained.   For, looking at the values
deduced for the conducting power of tin from the tin amalgams,
published in a former paper* (I.), and on comparing them, as
shown in Table IV. with those deduced from the amalgams in
our paper (II.), we find them almost identical.

  With regard to the remarks respecting the analysis of the
contents of the tube, we would only state that such analyses
would be exceedingly difficult; and it appears to us very doubtful
whether they could be made with nearly so great accuracy as the
weighing out of the two pure metals and alloying them together.
   It is also very doubtful whether, in Dr. Siemens's experiments
with the silver amalgams, he did not have in different parts of
his tube amalgams of different composition; for they were forced
into it by means of a small pressure-pump. We must not over
look one fact of importance, viz. that Mr. Sabine has not taken
into consideration whether the alloys partially solidify on cooling
or not, but deduces the values for the conducting powers of the
metals in a “liquid state” from                     all
                                      the observations.
     Inconclusion, Mr. Sabine remarks (page 459) that we ought
not  tohave taken into our calculations     the conducting powers
                                                             of

    Mr.  J. Cockle   on a New Species   of Differential Equations.     37
ing powers given by us only serve to show that the amalgams
do not conduct electricity in the ratio of the conducting powers
of the relative volumes of the components as one might a priori
have thought.        If such  calculations were not made, we should
sometimes be unable to      get an insight into the laws which regulate
those properties; thus, for instance, it is only from having calcu
lated the conducting powers in this manner of the solid alloys that
we have been led to discover the method of calculating the per
centage decrement in the conducting power of an alloy between
0° and 100°; in fact the calculated conducting powers are neces
sary to do this. We have already mentioned that it is more than
probable that, when metals are dissolved in one another, the part
which they then take in the conducting power of the alloy is the
same whether the resulting alloy be a solid or a liquid one.
    In the foregoing we have assumed, with the hypothesis from
which we started, that the amalgams are merely a solution of
one metal in the other; but in the case of those of zinc, we have
already pointed out that with the richer ones this is not the case;
and as we at present know so little regarding the chemical nature
of the amalgams, it seems to us that Dr. Siemens's hypothesis,
based only on the determination of six amalgams, viz. three with
zinc and three with silver, was rather premature. That chemical
combinations exist in the amalgams is more than probable from
the experiments of Joule+, Crookewittit, and others; so that it
is clearly wrong to try to deduce laws respecting the parts the
components take in the properties of the alloys from a few ob
servations, where we have no knowledge as to their chemical
 nature.

     This source of rubidium accordingly contains 3 ounces of chloride
of rubidium   per pound *.
    The   preparation  of the chloride of rubidium is effected best as
follows: a kilogramme of the salt is dissolved in 2.5 kilogs. of
water, and precipitated in the cold by a solution of about 30
grims. of platinum in aqua regia.           As soon as the yellow preci
pitate has sufficiently subsided, the supernatant liquid is poured
into a large beaker-glass, and the precipitate brought into a basin
in order to boil it out twenty-five consecutive times with small
quantities of water. For this purpose about 1.5 kilog. of water, in
 all, may be used; and the operation is best performed in a large
platinum capsule, from which the volume of water used for boil
ing out the precipitate is poured boiling-hot into the original
decanted liquid. A new precipitate then falls down from the
liquid, now amounting to about 4 kilogs. The liquid poured off
from this precipitate is next boiled down until, on adding it
again to the precipitate, the volume is not greater than it was at
the commencement of the operation. The platinum obtained by
reducing the purified precipitate in hydrogen is dissolved in
aqua regia, and this added to the boiled-down liquid; the preci
pitate which falls, as well as the supernatant liquid, is then
under the same conditions as it was at the beginning of the pre
paration.     Precipitate and liquid can therefore be treated again
                                                          -
in the manner just described.
    When these operations have been repeated seven or eight
times, the greater part of the chloride of rubidium contained in
the original kilogramme of salt has been extracted.            Each of the
seven or    eight  platinum-precipitates      is dried at 100° C. in the
dish in which it was boiled, then brought into a glass tube and
reduced in a current of hydrogen at a temperature below a red heat,
and below the melting-point of the chloride of rubidium. By di
gesting the black reduced mass with warm water, the soluble chlo
ride of rubidium is easily extracted from the platinum, which, as
   * This salt can now be obtained from Dr. Struve's mineral-water manu
factory in Leipzig at a price of 6 thalers the kilogramme, or about 9s. per
pound.

50        On the Preparation of the Rubidium Compounds.
has been already mentioned, when dissolved in aqua regia, may
at once be used for the next precipitation.   In this way, by using
only 30 grims. of platinum, which can be regained at the end of
the operation with very slight loss, more than a quarter of a
pound of chloride of rubidium can be obtained, containing only
from about 3 to 4 per cent. of the chlorides of potassium and
caesium.    In order to separate these impurities, the 36 grims. of
the salt and the 30 grims. of platinum as chloride are each mixed
with a kilogramme of water, and the solutions mixed when boil
ing. On cooling down to 40°C., a yellow sandy precipitate is
 deposited, and this is washed by decantation with water of the
 temperature of about 40°C. The chloride of rubidium obtained
 from this precipitate by reduction in a current of hydrogen is
 dissolved in water, and the chloride of potassium separated by
 a repetition of the foregoing operation, until a small quantity of
 the salt examined in the spectrum apparatus shows no trace of
 the red potassium line.
    The salt likewise contains a small quantity of chloride of
 cassium, the spectrum of which, however, is not visible until
 the potassium has been removed.       For the purpose of separating
 the caesium, the chlorides are converted into sulphates, and the
 sulphuric acid separated by the addition of a slight excess of
baryta water, the resulting hydrated oxide of rubidium being
evaporated    to dryness with carbonate of ammonium in a silver
 basin. The carbonate of rubidium, which is separated by pre
vious filtration from a trace of carbonate of barium, is completely
 dried, and the dry powder extracted twenty to thirty times with
boiling absolute alcohol. The carbonate of caesium is thus dis
 solved, leaving behind pure carbonate of rubidium.
    The salt is pure as soon as no trace of the caesium lines are
 seen in the spectrum. The few grammes of chloride of caesium
 contained in it may be obtained by the evaporation of the alcoholic
 solution.
    It is not advisable to separate the chlorides of sodium and
potassium by preliminary crystallization of the original salt.
This is seen by the following experiment made by M. Wander:-
200 grims. of the salt were dissolved in water and the solution
evaporated by boiling; as soon as about one-third of the salt
had separated out in the form of crystals, the mother-liquor was
poured off and evaporated to dryness. The residue, completely
dried, weighed 32.955 grims. ; 2.7975 grims. of this salt, when
treated with chloride of platinum, yielded 2-0465 grims. = A of
a mixture of the chlorides of rubidium and potassium, which,
precipitated with nitrate of silver, gave 2724 grims. = B of
chloride of silver.    Hence the salt consists of

   Although the salt remaining in the mother-liquor contains, as
the preceding analysis shows, about 60 per cent. of chloride of
rubidium, a preliminary separation by crystallization is not ad
visable, as the salt which crystallizes out contains nearly half the
total quantity of chloride of rubidium, thus rendering necessary
a repetition of the complete series of platinum precipitations, and
tedious washings with boiling water.

IX.    Observations      a Paper by M. De la Rive “On the
                       upon
  Aurorae Boreales,” in the Supplement to the Philosophical Maga
  zine     for June 1862.       By Professor Potter, A.M.4
           paper entitled “Further Researches on the Aurorae
IN Boreales,
    his
                 and the Phenomena which attend them,” M. De
la Rive assumes that the meteor is an atmospheric and terres
trial result only. If he had first studied the locality of the phe
nomena,      I
             have no doubt he would have given us a valuable
paper, from his great knowledge of the science of electro
magnetism; but he unfortunately follows the old Aristotelian
view, that the meteor is terrestrial and atmospheric, and ignores
the scientific principle that inaccessible heights and distances
can be only measured by parallactic observations with the aid of
trigonometry.
   The reasonings and measurements of Halleyt, Cavendisht,
Bergman, Dalton $, and others have given the locality of the
meteor as beyond the earth’s atmosphere, and               height fromits
 52   miles the   lowest,  calculated          by
                                            Cavendish,        very great   to

an undergraduate of Queen’s College, Cambridge, in October of
that same year, I did not attend the Meeting of the British
Association at Edinburgh (nor since, except for a day or two
at Cambridge in 1845), but on calling upon my old friend and
former private tutor in chemistry, Dr. Dalton, to bid him good
bye on my going up to Cambridge, we had a conversation very
interesting to both upon the Aurora-Borealis committee which
had been appointed in 1833.            He informed me that he had
made inquiries respecting meetings of the committee which
ought to have been held at Edinburgh, but could learn nothing
 on the subject, and only heard from Sir D. Brewster, “Oh, you
have it       all

increase of the refracting power renders manifest.         The method is
obviously comparable to the determination of a star by its right
 ascension and declination.     Not only, however, is the zero of Kirch
 hoff's scale placed  quite  arbitrarily, but he also states that “a rela
 tion between the numbers on the scale corresponding to the indivi
 dual lines and the refractive indices of my prisms does not exist,
 because the prisms were sometimes placed more exactly than at
 other times at the angle of minimum deviation for the particular
 rays.” The only natural mode of determining a line, as opposed to
 an arbitrary mode, is of course the refractive index in some medium
 of invariable composition, such as water, or bisulphide of carbon.
 But there are great difficulties in the way of determining refractive
 indices with sufficient exactness, and, provisionally at least, Kirch
 hoff's scale is certain to be adopted. The whole subject would be

 proved both experimentally and theoretically that a gas has the
 power of absorbing the very same rays of light which, when ignited,
it gives off. The positive spectrum is from the rays of light produced
by the gas; the negative spectrum is due to absorption of the same
rays when white light from some extraneous source is passed through
the gas. Kirchhoff hence arrives at the conclusion that the sun con

white light, and of an atmosphere containing many of our terres
trial elements in a state of vapour, yet capable of absorbing parts of
the white light. The inductive proof of this interesting conclusion

has presented; and we shall gladly dwell upon                                          it.

of men, and reveals the composition of the sun with a kind of dig
nity worthy of the occasion.
   Before closing his memoir, Kirchhoff enters into a very interesting
discussion as to the constitution of the sun's surface and atmosphere.
After totally refuting the old physical hypothesis of Sir William
Herschel, Arago, and others, he concludes that the sun's spots, instead
of being cavities in a photosphere, are black clouds elevated above the
luminous surface of the sun's body; he shows also that the perspect
ive phenomena which led Alexander Wilson to consider the spots as
cavities, are at least partially explicable on this cloud theory. After
much reflection, however, we are inclined to think that this new pro
position is not only inconsistent with the general testimony and
belief of those who have most minutely examined the sun's surface,
but is decisively contradicted by the following observation of Sir
William Herschel”:

drawn so near the     margin,  that  the elevated   side of the following
part of it hides all the black ground, and still leaves the cavity visible,
so that the depression of the black spots and the elevation of the
faculae are equally evident.”
   We might point also to the original drawing by Wilson of the
great spot of 1769t as partially exhibiting the same appearance.
But the subject is one eminently debatable and worthy of debate:
no one at        all
               interested     the subject can omit studying Professor
                                    in
Kirchhoff's able arguments; but every reader               yet, we think,    is   as
free to draw his own    conclusions.

from the earth that the attraction of the earth is barely sensible,
and let it fall to the earth from this distance.       It would reach the
earth with a final velocity of 36,747 feet in a second; and on col
lision with the earth the body would generate about twice the
amount of heat generated by the combustion of an equal weight of
coal.    We have stated that by falling through a space of 16 feet
our lead bullet would be heated three-fifths of a degree; but a body
falling from an infinite distance has already used up 1,299,999 parts
out of 1,300,000 of the earth's pulling power, when it has arrived
within 16 feet of the surface; on this space only Trºomth of the
whole force is exerted.
    Let us now turn our thoughts for a moment from the earth
towards the sun. The researches of Sir John Herschel and M.
Pouillet have informed us of the annual expenditure of the sun as
regards heat; and by an easy calculation we ascertain the precise
amount of the expenditure which falls to the share of our planet. Out
 of 2300 million parts of light and heat the earth receives one. The
 whole heat emitted by the sun in a minute would be competent to
 boil 12,000 millions of cubic miles of ice-cold water.         How is this
 enormous loss made     good      Whence is the sun's heat      derived,  and
 by what means is it maintained            No combustion, no chemical
 affinity with which we are acquainted would be competent to pro
 duce the temperature of the sun's surface.        Besides, were the sun
 a burning body merely,        light and heat would assuredly speedily
                                     its
 come  to   anend.   Supposing               solid globe

it liesalways to the east of the moon's meridian; and thus the waters

                      town physician       Heilbronn, this man was the

partially known. Led by his own beautiful researches, and quite
independent         Mayer, Mr. Joule published his first Paper “On the
                          of
Mechanical Value            Heat"     of1843; but        1842 Mayer had
                                                           in                               in

a  man       rare originality alone could turn
                of                                    account.   From the
velocity          of
              sound    air, Mayer determined the mechanical equivalent
                                in
 of heat.        1845In               he
                          published his Memoir        “Organic Motion,”              on

 precise manner       vital processes. He also embraced the other
                                 to
                                                   1853 Mr. Waterston
                                                                                    of In
 natural agents   his chain in conservation.        of
 proposed, independently, the meteoric theory       the sun's heat; and
 in 1854 Professor William Thomson       applied his admirable mathe
 matical powers      the development
                                to         the theory; but six years     of
 previously the subject had been handled           masterly manner by          in    a
 Mayer, and all that have said      Ithe subject               on
                                                 has been derived from
 him.           When we consider the circumstances                                  of      Mayer's life, and the

                           Prof. Tyndall on Force.                    65
period at which he wrote, we cannot fail to be struck with astonish
ment at what he has accomplished. Here was a man of genius working
in silence, animated solely by a love of his subject, and arriving at
the most important results some time in advance of those whose
lives were entirely devoted to Natural Philosophy. It was the
accident of bleeding a feverish patient at Java in 1840 that led
Mayer to speculate on these subjects. He noticed that the venous
blood in the tropics was of a much brighter red than in colder lati
tudes; and his reasoning on this fact led him into the laboratory of
natural forces, where he has worked with such signal ability and suc
cess.   Well, you will desire to know what has become of this man.
His mind gave way; he became insane, and he was sent to a lunatic
asylum. In a biographical dictionary of his country it is stated that
he died there: but this is incorrect. He recovered, and, I believe,
is at this moment a cultivator of vineyards in Heilbronn.
     While preparing for publication my last course of lectures on
Heat, I wished to make myself acquainted with all that Mayer had
done in connexion with this subject. I accordingly wrote to two
gentlemen who above all others seemed likely to give me the in
formation which I needed. Both of them are Germans, and both
particularly distinguished in connexion with the Dynamical Theory
of Heat. Each of them kindly furnished me with the list of Mayer's
publications; and one of them was so friendly as to order them from
a bookseller, and to send them to me. This friend, in his reply
to my first letter regarding Mayer, stated his belief that I should not
find anything very important in Mayer's writings; but before for
warding the memoirs to me, he read them himself. His letter accom
panying the first of these papers contains the following words:–
“I    must here retract the statement in my last letter, that you would
not find much matter of importance in Mayer's writings: I am
astonished at the multitude of beautiful and correct thoughts which
they contain;” and he goes on to point out various important sub
jects, in the treatment of which Mayer had anticipated other emi
nent writers. My second friend, in whose own publications the
name of Mayer repeatedly occurs, and whose papers containing
these references were translated some years ago by myself, was, on
the 10th of last month, unacquainted with the thoughtful and beau
 tiful essay of Mayer's entitled Beiträge zur Dynamik des Him
 mels; and in 1854, when Professor William Thomson developed in
 so striking a manner the meteoric theory of the sun's heat, he was
 certainly not aware of the existence of that essay, though, from a
 recent article in “Macmillan's Magazine,' I infer that he is now
 aware of it.     Mayer's physiological writings have been referred   to
 by   physiologists (by Dr. Carpenter, for example)   in   terms of ho
 nourable recognition. We have hitherto, indeed, obtained fragmen
  tary glimpses  of  the man, partly from physicists, and partly from
 physiologists; but his total merit has never yet been recognized     as
     assuredly would have been had     he         happier mode    publi

to recoil to the disadvantage of him in whose interest it is made.

attempting to place him in that honourable position which I believe
to be his due.

John Allan Broun, Esq., F.R.S.
  The results obtained hitherto for the lunar diurnal variation of
atmospheric    pressure have been received with some doubt; the range
of the variation has been found to be small, and the proximity to the
sea of the stations for which the discussions have been made, has
given some value to the idea that the variation is due simply to the
tidal rise and fall of the sea, the base of the atmosphere.    It has
even been suggested that the barometer should be incapable of show
ing an atmospheric tide, because the gravity of the mercury is dimi
nished by the lunar attraction, as well as that of the atmosphere ;
this suggestion, however, omits              all
                                      consideration   the integrating of

I    have considered the question      two stationsat   the following  in
manner.   Simultaneous observations of two standard barometers of
the same construction, with boiled tubes 0-65 inch internal diameter,
were made hourly during fifteen months (April 1857         June 1858)      to
at  two observatories; one       Trevandrum 200 feet above the sea
                                       at
level and three miles distant from the sea, the other       the summit     on
of the Agustier  peak          of
                         the South Indian   Ghats, 6200 feet above the
sea, about 22 miles from Trevandrum, 25 miles from the sea          the                   on
west, and 40          to
                  60 miles from the sea                 on
                                            the south and east. The
means    of     all
              the observations give the following results.
   At Trevandrum.—The lunar diurnal variation              atmospheric     of
pressure has two nearly equal maxima, occurring almost exactly                                 at
the moon's passages            of
                          the upper and lower meridian, the minima
occurring six hours before and after these epochs.
   At Agustier (6200 feet).-The law nearly the same is          epochs,         as   to
the maximum for the inferior    passage occurring, however,   about one
hour later, and each minimum occurring about one hour nearer the
upper passage.

        Mr. J. A. Broun                  on the Lunar Barometric Variation.                                         67
   The chief difference in the two results is that between the relative
values of the maxima and minima. The oscillation occurring while
the moon is below the horizon, or between the meridians of 6" and
of 18*, has the same amount at Trevandrum (height 200 feet) and
at Agustier (height 6200 feet); but the oscillation occurring while
the moon is above the horizon, has twice the amount at the lower
station which it has at the upper station.
   This curious result, which it is difficult to explain by any theory
depending simply on the attraction of gravitation, whether acting on
the sea or the atmosphere, agrees remarkably with the conclusions
for the solar diurnal oscillation obtained from the discussion of
hourly observations made simultaneously during a month at five
different stations, four of these being on the Agustier mountains,
rising gradually from 1200 to 6200 feet, the fifth station being at
Trevandrum.      From these observations (an abstract of which will
be found noticed in the Report of the British Association for 1859,
Trans. of Sect., p. 46), it appeared that the solar semidiurnal oscilla
tion between 9 P.M. and 9 A.M. was nearly the same at              the                                        all
stations; while the day oscillation,       A.M.       P.M., diminished
                                                              9                   to   9
with the height, being      6200 feet little more than half the amount
                                      at
of the oscillation           at   200 feet.
   These facts might      put into the following general form:—When
                                    be
the heavenly body (sun     moon)     or
                                      below the horizon, the semidiurnal
                                                      is

               the barometer within the tropics has the same value                                                  at
 allheights             up
                   6200 feet; but when the body        above the horizon,              is

                   6200 feet has only  half the amount     the oscillation                      of
at the level of the sea.

   It appears from these values that the range of the lunar diurnal
period varies from year to year according to the same law (nearly) as
the range of the solar diurnal period; and we may conclude that the
range of lunar diurnal variation obeys the “decennial” law.
   It is well known that the declination needle obeys two diurnal laws
due to the solar action; the first of these governs the movement of
the north end of the needle from east to west and from west to east,
the second determines a superposed movement resulting from the
relative amounts of displacement of the needle from       normal posi                 its
tion  at each  hour;  the latter    usually termed the diurnal law
                                             is                                                        of

   There is a lunar diurnal law of disturbance which, from the mean
of six years' observation, consists of a
   Principal maximum 5 hours before the moon passes the upper
meridian.
   Principal minimum near the moon’s passage of the lower meridian.
  Secondary maximum 6 hours after the passage            of the upper meri
dian.
  Secondary minimum        1   hour after the passage of the upper meri
dian.
   When the results for each year are compared, the principal maxi
mum and minimum are always shown distinctly; but the values and
epochs of the secondary maximum and minimum vary, and that so
irregularly, that in the mean for the three years 1857–59 the exist
ence of either is doubtful, only the principal maximum and minimum
being well-marked.
   In order to determine if the law varied with season, means of groups
for quarters of the year were obtained; means also for the groups of
half-years, October to March and April to September, were taken. As
the results for the quarters forming each half-year agreed with each
other, and that for the half-year which contained them, the following
conclusions may be accepted as probably true.
                       Half-year October to March.
  Principal maximum, 53 hours before the moon's passage of the
upper meridian.
  Principal minimum, 3 hours before the moon's passage of the lower
meridian.
  Secondary maximum, 54 hours after the moon's passage of the
upper meridian.
  Secondary minimum, 1 hour after the moon's passage of the upper
meridian.
                      Half-year April to September.
Maximum, 44 hours before the moon's passageof the upper meridian.
Minimum, at the passage of the lower meridian.
   In the case of the half-year including the June solstice, the secon
dary points disappear; this also is the case for each of the quarters
forming the half-year.    It may be due to this and the preponderance
of the disturbance in one half of any given year, that the mean for
the whole year shows distinctly or indistinctly the secondary points,
the question, however, of the secondary points will be considered here.

containing bromine and iodine to be resolved by the prism; nor
have I succeeded in reversing them by bringing these substances into
a very hot but little luminous flame.          Bright lines were discerned,
but in other     positions.    In connexion with this subject, it may be
worth    noting  that a  prismatic  examination of the sun's rays passing
through three inches of mercury vapour at above 300°C., did not
afford the least indication of the reversal of the bright rays that
appear when that metal is rendered incandescent.
      rom the fact that the atmospheric lines do not always present
the same appearance when the sun is on the horizon, and that the
 band 3 has been observed during a shower, and the most prominent
lines during a fog, it has been sometimes supposed that the aqueous
 vapour in the atmosphere is the cause of them.               Yet this can
 scarcely be. They seem not to be due to little vesicles of condensed
vapour; for the sun's rays when passing through the edges of a cloud
 do not exhibit them, unless, of course, near the horizon. And they
 seem not to be due to gaseous water; for they appear near sunset
when the aqueous vapour in the atmosphere is reduced to a minimum
 by frosty weather, though they are not seen when the sun is higher
 up in the heavens on a damp warm day. From Sir David Brewster's
 notes, it appears that February 10, 11, 12, and 13 of the year 1838 were
 frosty days; yet the lines were well seen: 3, ,           , C6, C15, C16,
 and D are specially mentioned.        On the 13th, when the thermometer
 stood at 23° F., is said to have been the most prominent.
     In the paper referred to at the commencement, we, in common
 with most of those who worked on the subject before the appearance
 of Kirchhoff and Bunsen's papert, ascribed a bright line coincident
 with D to other spectra than that of soda. This was no doubt owing
 to the almost universal trace of that substance.
     The electric lights produced between charcoal points by Professor
 IIolmes's magneto-apparatus, and by a galvanic battery with
 M. Serin's lamp, were found to be identical, when subjected to pris
 matic analysis.      Each exhibited a continuous spectrum, and not
 those variations of bright and dark which other observers, as well as
 myself, have noticed in electric lights from charcoal points of but
 inferior quality. The spectrum extended at both ends beyond that of
 ordinary direct sunlight, and the only lines which I could discern were
 bright ones in the violet or lavender region. The following refractive
indices were determined for the magneto-electric light; and they are
 compared with the refractive indices of the nearest principal dark
 lines of the solar spectrum as determined with the same prism. The

  Westerly Thinning of the Lower Eocene Beds in that Basin; and
  on the Greywethers.”        By William Whitaker, Esq., B.A., F.G.S.,
  of the Geol. Surv. Great Britain.
     In the first part of this paper the author described certain outliers
 of Tertiary strata in the neighbourhood of Bedwin and Savernake
  (or Marlborough) Forest, in Wiltshire, where in the course of the
  Geological Survey of the district he found that both the Woolwich
  and Reading Beds and the London Clay gradually thinned out
  westward, until merely 3 or 4 inches of the latter alone remained
 between the Bagshot Beds and the Chalk.         Further eastward these
 are probably in direct apposition.       The superficial loam and clay
 with unworn flints on the Chalk district along the northern side of
 the London Basin were then described.
    In the second portion of the paper it was shown, both from the
 published results of Mr. Prestwich's researches and later observa
 tions made in the progress of the Geological Survey, that the Thanet
 Sands thin out westwardly, from a thickness of about 85 feet in the
 Isle of Thanet, to about 35 feet at London, and to 3 feet at Chob
 ham, disappearing    altogether near Epsom.        The Woolwich and
 Reading Beds include the Blackheath Pebble-bed, according to the
author: at Herne Bay Mr. Whitaker gives these beds a thickness
of about 50 feet, at Croydon 45 feet, at New Cross 54 feet, at
London from 40 to 70 feet, at Ealing 60 feet, at Hanwell 75 feet,
at Chiswick 90 feet, at Reading about 50 feet, and near Great Bed

  The following communications were read:—
   1. “Note respecting the Discovery of a new and large Labyrin
thodont (Loromma Allmani, Huxley) in the Gilmerton Iron-stone of
the Edinburgh Coal-field.” By Prof. T. H. Huxley, F.R.S., Sec.G.S.
  Looking over the vertebrate fossils from Burdie House and                        Gil
merton in the University Museum, Edinburgh, Prof. Huxley came
upon some reptilian specimens—a fragment of the hinder part of the
upper wall of a cranium and some sternal plates of a Labyrinthodont,
which, from the obliquity of its orbits, he names Lowomma.      The
skull would be about 14 inches long if perfect, and the animal about
6 or 7 feet.
  2.    “Note       on a new Labyrinthodont (Pholidogaster pisciformis,
Huxley) from the Edinburgh Coal-field.”            By Prof.   T. H.       Huxley,
F.R.S., Sec.G.S.
    The specimen on which this new form has been determined was
placed in the British Museum by Sir P. Egerton and Lord Ennis
killen, who recognized it as Reptilian. Mr. Davis, of the British
Museum, drew Mr. Huxley's attention to it as being probably Arche
gosaurian. It is not well preserved, but on careful study proves to
be an amphibian allied to Archegosaurus, differing, however, from
it in the form of the head, the extent to which the ossification of the
vertebral column has proceeded, and in the character of the dermal
armour.     This animal was about 44 inches long.
   3.   “On the    Land Flora of the Devonian Period in North-eastern
America.”         ByJ. W. Dawson, LL.D., F.G.S.
   First  noticing   what was formerly known of the Devonian Plant
remains in the States of New York and Pennsylvania (Hall, Van
uxem, and Rogers), in Gaspé (Logan), in New Brunswick and
Maine (Gesner, Robb, Bennett, Hartt, Matthew, and Hitchcock),
the author stated that, with Messrs. Hartt, Matthew, and others at
St. John's, he had lately examined the productive localities near
that city, and was now enabled to add largely to the account of the
Devonian plants he had already published in the ‘Canadian Natu
ralist,’ vol.     vi.
                  1861.     He now enumerates about 70 species (32
genera)      ofplants       occurring
                             as      in   the Upper Devonian       of Pennsyl

  The result of Prof. Sandberger's  examination of a collection of
these fossils, carefully named by Mr. F. E. Edwards and forwarded
by Mr. Hamilton, has been to confirm him in his opinion that the
upper beds at Hempstead, Isle of Wight, are the exact equivalent
of the marine beds at Weinheim, Jeurres, and Bergh (“Rupélien
inférieur” of Dumont). The freshwater limestone of Bembridge and
Sconce appears to correspond to the beds at Buxweilar (Alsace)
and Abstadt (Baden); and the fossils from Headon Hill and Colwell
Bay probably belong to the level of Dumont's “Tongrien inférieur”
(Lethen and Westergeln) “et supérieur (Marnes supérieurs au
gypse).”

          ON THE ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE OF WOLTAIC PILES.,
                          BY M. MARIE DAVY.
Howºn              carefully units of resistance and of current are
        defined, inasmuch as these units are arbitrarily chosen, it
cannot be hoped that, in estimating the electromotive force of bat
teries, they will directly furnish the calorific value of the special
work performed by the chemical actions of these batteries. It is
necessary to determine the value of a constant numerical coefficient
which, like the units of resistance and of current, could be easily
obtained by each physicist.

stronger batteries than non-amalgamated ones; but the force varies
also notably with the state of the amalgam and the purity of the
zinc. Commercial zinc amalgamated four days, and presenting a
crystalline surface giving 18,796, I found only 18,510 for pure
distilled zinc dissolved in pure mercury; difference, 286.
   5. Influence of the purity of the sulphuric acid-Ordinary commer
cial acids contain traces of nitrogen compounds which increase the
electromotive force of Smee's battery.       Thus with an ordinary acid
I obtained 18,961 instead of 18,796 as with a pure acid; difference,
165.
   6. Influence of the water.—The influence of the water is to me the
most inexplicable.     While with distilled water I obtain the normal
number 18,796, with unfiltered Paris water it was only 16,886;
difference, 1910.
    7. Influence of the temperature.—The   influence of temperature on
the conductibility of saline solutions and of metals is too marked
not to be shown, if not upon the electromotive force of a pile, at
least on its numerical estimation.        Exact results are not possible if
the  temperature    of the circuit varies in any of      points during the       its
                experiment;

over this frame, they would have obtained glass of uniform thickness,
 and nothing more would have been required except to polish the
 surfaces, an operation to which they were no strangers; for Pliny
 says that they made use of obsidian to make mirrors which they at
 tached to the walls; and this could only be done when the obsidian
 was polished.

       To the Editors     of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
    The law of form noticed by Mr. Cayley in the June Number of the
Philosophical Magazine, p. 471, is true when the data are the pro
babilities of events unconnected by any conditions expressed or im
plied; but it is then true, not as a first principle, but as a conse
quence of acknowledged principles in the theory of probabilities.                   As
it has not been proved to be true beyond this case (indeed it is cer
tainly not generally true), no argument ought to be built upon the
assumption that it is true.

tity in such a way, that in treating of it we are obliged in some
measure to trust to probabilities; whereas the external work is
immediately accessible to observation and measurement, and
thus admits of more strict treatment.          Accordingly, since, in
my former paper, I wished to avoid everything that was hypothe

          entirely excluded the internal work, which      was able to                       I
do   by  confining  myself to the consideration of circular processes

body undergoes are so arranged that the body finally returns to
 its original condition.         such operations the internal work

is undergoing modification absorbing heat from the one body and
giving it out again to the other. In this case the bodies between
which the transference of heat takes place are to be viewed merely
as heat-reservoirs, of which we are not concerned to know any
thing except the temperatures. If the temperatures of the two
bodies differ, heat passes, either from a warmer to a colder body,
or from a colder to a warmer body, according to the direction in
which the transference of heat takes place.     Such a passage of
heat may also be     designated,  for the sake of uniformity, as a
transformation, inasmuch as it may be said that heat of one tem
perature is transformed into heat of another temperature.
   The two kinds of transformations that have been mentioned
are related in such a way that one presupposes the other, and
that they can mutually replace each other.        we call transfor        If
mations which can replace each other equivalent, and seek the
mathematical expressions which determine the amount of the
transformations in such a manner that equivalent transforma
tions become equal in magnitude, we arrive at the following ex

     If
      we  represent   the transformations which occur in a circular
process by these expressions, the relation existing between them
can be stated in a simple and definite manner. . If the circular
process is reversible, the transformations which occur therein
must be partly positive and partly negative, and the equivalent
values of the positive transformations must be together equal to
those of the negative transformations, so that the algebraic sum
of   all
       the equivalent values becomes =0.           the circular process If

in  such      way that the positive transformations predominate.

mechanical work. These          processes   always   admit      being reduced                        of

  86              Prof. Clausius on the Internal Work
 of which we can define the effect of heat as simply tending to in
  crease the disgregation.   The way in which a definite measure of
  this magnitude can be arrived at will appear from the sequel.
     In the case last mentioned, an alteration in the arrangement
  of the electricity takes place, an alteration which can be repre
  sented and taken into calculation in a way corresponding to the
  alteration of the position of the molecules, and which, when it
  occurs, we will consider as always included in the general expres
  sion alteration of arrangement, or alteration of disgregation.
     It is evident that each of the kinds of alteration that have been
 named may also take place in the reverse sense, if the effect of
 the opposing forces is greater than that of the heat.         We will
 assume as likewise self-evident that, for the production of work,
 a corresponding quantity of heat must always be expended, and
 conversely, that, by the consumption of work, an equivalent quan
 tity of heat must be produced.
     § 3. If we now consider more closely the various cases which
 occur in relation to the forces which are operative in each of
 them, the case of the expansion of a permanent gas presents
 itself as particularly simple. We may conclude from certain pro
 perties of the gases that the mutual attraction of their molecules
 at their mean distances is very small, and therefore that only a
 very slight resistance is offered to the expansion of a gas, so that
 the resistance of the sides of the containing vessel must maintain
 equilibrium with almost the whole effect of the heat.         Accord
 ingly the externally sensible pressure of a gas forms an approxi
 mate measure of the separative force of the heat contained in the
 gas; and hence, according to the foregoing proposition, this
 pressure must be nearly proportional to the absolute tempera
 ture. The internal probability of the truth of this result is indeed
 so great, that many physicists since Gay-Lussac and Dalton have
 without hesitation presupposed this proportionality, and have
employed it for calculating the absolute temperature.
    In the above-mentioned case of thermo-electric action, the
force which exerts an action contrary to that of the heat is like
wise simple and easily determined.         For at the point of contact
of two heterogeneous substances, such a quantity of electricity
is driven from the one to the other by the action of the heat,
that the opposing force resulting from the electric tension suffices
to hold the force exerted by the heat in equilibrium.        Now in a
former memoir “On the application of the Mechanical Theory of
Heat to the Phenomena of Thermal Electricity*,” I have shown
that,in so far as changes in the arrangementof the moleculesarenot
necessarily produced at the same time by changes of temperature,
the difference of tension produced by heat must be proportional

to the absolute temperature, as is required by the foregoing
theorem.
     In
      the other cases that are quoted, as well as in most others,
the relations are less simple, because in them an essential part is
played by the forces exerted by the molecules upon one another,
forces which, as yet, are quite unknown.          It results, however,
from the mere consideration of the external resistances which
heat is capable of overcoming, that in general          force increases                its
with the  temperature.       we  wish,  for  instance,

to employ     greater pressure the more the body heated; hence
                   a                                                                   is
we may conclude, without having          knowledge         the internal
                                                                 a                           of

                                  the resistances which can        over                                  be

                          the foregoing theorem, without knowing
the internal forces.    On the other hand,         this theorem       re    if                                be

together, or subtracted from one another, however various the
forces may be to which they are referable.
    It is therefore convenient to alter the form of the above theorem
by introducing, instead of the forces themselves, the work done
in overcoming them. In this form it reads as follows:–
    The mechanical work which can be exerted by heat in any altera
 tion of the arrangement of a body is proportional to the absolute
temperature at which this alteration occurs.
   §4. The theorem does not speak of the work which the heat
does, but of the work which it can do; and similarly, in the first
form of the theorem, the resistances which the heat can overcome
are spoken         of.

another body during the alteration of condition. We have, how
ever, already represented by d() the infinitely small quantity of
heat imparted to another body by the one which is undergoing
modification, hence we must represent in a corresponding man
ner, by —d(), the heat which it withdraws from another body.
We thus obtain the equation
                           —d Q=d H+. AdL,

     In
      order now to be able to introduce the disgregation also into
the formulae, we must first settle how we are to determine it as a
mathematical quantity.
   * In my previous memoirs I have separated from one another the internal
and the external work performed by the heat during the change of condition
of the body.    If
                 the former be denoted by dI, and the latter by dW, the
above equation becomes
                           dO+d H+AdI+AdW=0.                                 .   .   .       .           .       .   (a)
Since, however, the increase in the quantity of heat actually contained in a
body, and the heat consumed by internal work during an alteration of con
dition, are magnitudes of which we commonly do not know the individual
values, but only the sum of those values, and which resemble each other in
being fully determined as soon as we know the initial and final conditions
of the body, without our requiring to know how it has passed from the one
to the other, I have thought it advisable to introduce a function which
shall represent the sum of these two magnitudes, and which I have denoted
by U. Accordingly
                           dU = d H+AdI, . . . . . . . . . (b)
and hence the foregoing equation becomes
                                d0+d U+AdW =0;                           .   .   .   .           .       .       .   (c)
and if we suppose the last equation             integrated             for any finite alteration                      of
condition, we have
                                Q+ U+AW =0.                   .    .     .   .   .   .                               (d)
   These are the equations which I have used in my memoirs published in
1850 and in 1854, partly in the particular form which they assume for the
permanent gases, and partly in the general form in which they are here

     By disgregation is represented,as stated in § 2, the degree of
dispersion of the body.   Thus, for example, the disgregation of a
body is greater in the liquid state than in the solid, and greater
in the aëriform than in the liquid state. Further, if part of a
given quantity of matter is solid and the rest liquid, the disgre
gation is greater the greater the proportion of the whole mass
that is liquid; and similarly, if one part is liquid and the re
mainder aeriform, the disgregation is greater the larger the
aériform portion.         The disgregation of a body is fully deter
mined when the         arrangement      of                      its
                                               constituent molecules                                              is

                         be

   We will now suppose that, with the aid                   heat, the body          of
changes       its
               state, and we will provisionally confine ourselves                                                 to

94                     Prof. Clausius on the Internal Work
  If we now apply this equation to a perfect gas, the specific
heat under constant volume is in this case to be regarded as the
true specific heat, and this gives the increase in the quantity of
heat actually present in the gas; for here no heat is consumed
in work, since external work is only performed when increase of
volume occurs, and internal work has no existence in the case of
perfect gases.   We may therefore regard cdT as identical with
dB. We have     further, for the perfect gases, the equation
                                                pc= RT,
where   R is      a constant, and thence we get
                                %de= #de-Ra.logº.
                                dT
Equation (6) is thus transformed into
                                dO=dH+ARTd. log v.                                    .    .        .      .     .      (7)
This equation agrees, disregarding the difference in the sign of
d0 (which is caused only by the different way in which we have
chosen to employ the signs + and                                –
                                          in this case), with equa

bol Z has, in this particular case, the form AR log v.
   Rankine, who has written several interesting memoirs on the
transformation of heat into work”, has in like manner proposed
to transform equation (6), which in        original form applies    its                                                  to

             that what I can claim as new in my equation (II.) is
just this, that the magnitude Z which there occurs has acquired,

it follows that it is fully determined by the arrangement of the
constituent molecules of the body existing at any given instant.
Thus only does it become possible to deduce from this equation

 [The   Reade Lecture, delivered    in the Senate House of the University of
                             Cambridge, in May 1862.]
IN directing our attention to the subject of terrestrial magnetism,
we may conveniently separate the phenomena into two distinct
classes,   viz. those which originate in and indicate the magnetic
state of our own planet, and those which admit of a traceable con
nexion with bodies exterior to the earth, or forces emanating from
                                                 I
them. The title of the lecture which shall have the honour of ad
dressing to you will lead me to dwell chiefly on the second of these
two classes of phenomena, namely, on those which with more or
less certainty indicate cosmical relations. We are now justified
in predicating that such cosmical relations are discernible in all,
or almost all, those fluctuations and changes of direction which,
as many of my present audience are aware, our magnetic needles
are continually undergoing, whether they appear in the form of
momentary affections or in regularly recurring periods, such as
a day, a month, a year, or a cycle of years.
   The advances which have been made in this department of
magnetical science date chiefly from the epoch              (in
                                                       1840) when,

British system of observation to the modes in which the investi
gations that had been thus commenced could be most success
fully prosecuted, the Report of the Royal Society manifested
a sagacity which subsequent experience has so fully confirmed
that we may, with propriety, on the present occasion recall one
or two sentences of that Report, because they strike the key-note
of all the discoveries which have since been made, and also because
to this day they appear to be too little understood, or at least too
little regarded, by many who profess to take part in a system of
observation which has accomplished so much for this branch of
science.    The extracts will be very brief.
    “All the magnetic elements are at each point now ascertained
to be in a constant state of fluctuation, and affected by transient
and irregular changes; and the investigation of the laws, extent,
and mutual relations of those changes is now become essential
to the successful prosecution of magnetic discovery, for the fol
lowing reasons:—
    “1st. That the progressive and periodical changes are so
mixed up with the transitory changes that it is impossible to
separate them so as to obtain a eorrect knowledge and analysis
of the progressive and periodical, without taking express account
of and eliminating the transient and irregular; . . . . and further,
because the theory of these transitory changes is in itself one of
the most interesting and important points to which the attention
 of magnetic observers can be turned, as they are no doubt inti
mately connected with the general causes of terrestrial mag
metism, and will probably lead us to a more perfect knowledge
 of those causes than we now possess.”
   The interest with which these fluctuations were regarded            at
the close of the German    Association,  as shown     by  the preceding
extracts, was much increased by the results of the first year of
the observations made, on days concerted with European obser
vatories, at the British Colonial stations in Canada, St. Helena,
the Cape of Good Hope, and Van Diemen Island.              By the inter
comparison of these it was found that the disturbances were con
temporaneous, not only over a limited area in Europe, as pre
viously known, but also at       all
                                  these widely distributed stations
situated  in  parts  of the globe most distant from each other.
They were obviously affections common
                                                                                    or of

                                                  of             local     a

marked character were noticed          tostrictly

America,   it was also found that        stations remote from each

other the disturbance of the same element might differ widely in
amount, and might occasionally be even reversed in direction.
Not unfrequently also a disturbance showing itself at the same
instant at distant stations would affect one magnetic element at
one station and another element at another station, thus giving
increased probability to a surmise originally due to the sagacity
of M. Gauss, that “various forces might not improbably be con
temporaneously in action, having possibly very different sources,
and proceeding independently of each other, the effects of these
various forces being intermixed in very different proportions at
various places of observation according to the directions and
 distances of these from the sources from whence the perturba
 tions proceed.”
    The problem of the origin and laws of the phenomena might
 thus be deemed even more complex than had been at first ima
 gined.    But in every case the solution required as the first step
 the  separation,  at a particular station where observations had
 been made    hourly,  of a sufficient body of the disturbed observa
 tions to enable their laws to be investigated, should such laws
 exist. The difficulty which here presented itself was to decide
 on some criterion by which a disturbed observation might be
 distinguished from one which was not disturbed.               It has been
 already noticed that the fluctuations which characterize the dis
 turbances are frequently found to exceed the limits of any of the
 known periodical variations.          The magnitude of the discord
 ance of an  observation,   when  compared      with the mean or normal
 position of the magnet in the same month and at the same hour,
 was therefore assumed as a criterion of disturbance for a first
 essay.   Care was taken that the magnitude of disturbance, mea
 sured from the mean or normal position, should exceed the pro
 bable limit of irregularities which might be occasioned on parti
cular days by the periodical variations of known amount, so that
the separated observations might, as                  far
                                                     possible, consist only

in respect to the particular times of their occurrence when viewed
singly, they were in their mean effects strictly periodical pheno
mena, exhibiting by the character of their periodical variation a
dependence on the sun as their primary source.          To this im
portant fact the disturbances of each of the three magnetic
elements—the declination, the dip, and the intensity of the
magnetic force—bore concurrent testimony, although the hours
of maximum and minimum of their respective diurnal progres
sions were dissimilar, confirming the belief of distinct pheno
menal laws in the disturbances of each of the elements.
    The knowledge of the existence of periodicity in respect to the
hours of the day was followed by the recognition of a periodical
variation of a more remarkable kind, but which did not at first
seem to connect itself with any other known phenomena, either
cosmical or terrestrial. The employment of a constant quantity
at each station, as a measure of disturbance at that station, had
 been adopted with the view of learning whether the aggregate
amount of disturbance in different years was subject to any note
 worthy variation.   It soon appeared that this was the case. The
 observations made hourly at the colonial observatories, situated
 in very distant parts of the globe from each other, concurred in
 showing a progressive annual increase in the amount of disturb
 ance from the year 1843 to the years 1848 and 1849, the two
 last being the years when the period for which the Government
 had sanctioned the hourly observations terminated. The          in
 crease was far too great to be ascribed to an accidental cause,
 the ratio of disturbance in 1848 and 1849 being more than
 double that in 1843 and 1844. The progressive increase was
 shown in each of the three elements, each having a distinct     in
 strumental apparatus. The consistency of the evidence from so
 many sources seemed decisive as to the fact of a progressive
 increase during the years which have been named, wearing the
 appearance of being a portion of a periodical variation of which
 the cycle had yet to be discovered.     Regret might well be felt
  that at this conjuncture   the course of hourly observation, by
  which we had been thus far guided, had to be broken off, by the
 termination of the period for which the colonial observations had
 been sanctioned.    Fortunately another indication was available
 which included a rather longer interval.       It appeared that the
 increase of disturbances from 1843 to 1849 had been accom
 panied by a similar, though smaller, increase in the magnitude
 of the range of the diurnal oscillation of the three magnetic
 elements in those years, after due elimination had been made
 of the greater part at least of the effects of the disturbed obser
 vations.   A less onerous system of observation, which had been
 commenced two years before and continued two years longer

 102          Major-General                 Sabine on the Cosmical Features
 than the full hourly system, sufficed to give the range of the
 diurnal oscillation for purposes of comparison; and the series
 thus afforded, extending from 1841 to 1851, showed that the
 diurnal range had been greater in 1841 and 1842 than in 1843
 and 1844, from which date (concurrently with the aggregate
 amount of disturbance as already related) it had progressively
 increased to 1849, whilst 1850 showed no further advance,
 and 1851 a decided retrogression.        Putting these facts together,
 there appeared sufficient ground on which to call the attention
 of those engaged in magnetic researches to the possibility of the
 existence of a periodical magnetic variation, which should have
 had   itsepoch       minimum about the years 1843

how these phenomena would be found to comport themselves in
succeeding years.     Supposing the continuance of the same cycle
in the variations both of the solar spots and of the magnetic
disturbances which had been traced up to 1851, the next epoch
of minimum might be looked for in 1853 or 1854. The British
Colonial observatories having terminated,      availed myself, for                    I
the purpose of this investigation, of the means afforded by the
hourly magnetic observations made by direction of the Russian
Government at Pekin, from 1852 to 1855 inclusive. The obser
vations themselves are published by M. Kupffer in the “Annales
 de l'Observatoire central de Russie,” and are discussed by my
 self in the Introduction to the second volume of the “ St. Helena
 Observations,’ published in 1860, pp. cxxxv. to cxliv.        The
 ratios of disturbance in the   years  1852 to  1855,  taking   the
mean   of the four years as the unit, were as follows:—
                           1852          .        .    .        .        .        1.01 to    1

lies, as we might term them, may present themselves.               Should
such take place in the phenomena of the solar spots, we have
reason to expect that they may be accompanied by correspond
ing anomalies in the magnetic variations, if the causal connexion
be indeed as close as our late experience would lead us to infer*.
Meanwhile the conclusion which we may most safely draw is that
it is highly desirable that both classes of phenomena should be
carefully and independently observed and scrutinized.                        -
     In a discovery  so unexpected     and so recent as that of the cos
mical connexion of the magnetic disturbances, it cannot be sup
posed that much can yet have become known to indicate the
mode in which the sun's influence is exercised in the production
of the phenomena of magnetic disturbance which we witness
 and record. The path in which we may most securely advance
towards the attainment of this knowledge is by the careful and
 continuous study of the effects themselves, and by applying to
 them such processes of analysis as may appear most suitable to
 aid us in their comprehension. Already by such means we
 have advanced in a track which promises well, and seems de
 serving of being further pursued, and by a course more systematic
 than circumstances have hitherto permitted. The disturbances
 occurring at a particular station are resolvable, for example,
 into six distinct categories,      those which deflect the declination
 needle to the east, and those which deflect it to the west; those
 which increase and those which decrease the inclination or dip;
 and those which increase or which decrease the intensity of the
 magnetic force. This analysis has been made at a few stations;
  and the result fully confirms M. Gauss’s anticipation that the phe
  nomena of each of the different categories would be found to have
  distinct and independent laws. The research by which these
  are eliminated may indeed be tedious, requiring both time and
  labour, and the words of the great geometrician may frequently
  have to be borne in mind,         “It   will be a triumph of science
  should we at some future time succeed in arranging the mani
  fold intricacies of the phenomena, in separating the individual
  forces of which they are the component result, and in assigning
  the source and the measure of each.” That we are advancing
  in this course, and that the results which have already been
  obtained merit confidence as true representations of natural facts,
  may be exemplified by exhibiting in diagrams (Plate I. figs. 1
     * The number of groups of spots observed in 1856 appears, from a notice
  from M. Schwabe in the Astr. Nach., to have been less than might have
  been expected from the previous decennial progression shown in the Table
  from 1826 to 1850. The aggregate magnetic disturbance in the same year
  in the Nertchinsk series, 1851-57 (the only series that I have examined
  which includes 1856), exhibits a precisely similar anomaly.

108           Major-General                 Sabine on the Cosmical Features
to the form in fig. 2, which corresponds to the easterly deflec
tions at Kew and Hobarton.      During twelve hours, or about
half the diurnal period, the amount of disturbance, and conse
quently the ratios, scarcely vary; there occurs then a sudden
and rapidly progressive increase of disturbance continuing for
about six hours, and forming an apex in the curve which at Kew
and Hobarton occurs between eleven and twelve hours of local
astronomical time; and from this apex there is a symmetrical
and progressive decrease of disturbance lasting also about six
hours. This is the general form, as I have stated, of one of
the curves; but the local hour at which the apex occurs,
although it happens to be the same at Kew and at Hobarton,
appears to range through         the hours             all

in producing the disturbances in different parts of the globe which
have a systematic aspect, and are not unlikely to lead to import
ant generalizations.    What has been here stated in respect to
the declination appears also to be the case in the other two mag
netic elements, though requiring more labour and patience in
the deduction.
    There is yet one other and most notable distinction with refer
ence to geographical relations: the aggregate amount of dis
turbance varies greatly and instructively in different parts of the
globe; it is small in the intertropical regions, and augments in
the middle latitudes, but by no means in a ratio dependent on
the increase of latitude; for as the higher latitudes are ap
proached, the disproportion of disturbance in different meridians
becomes excessive, and leads to the inference that in both hemi
spheres there are localities indicated by the peculiar magnitude
of the disturbing influence as being those where that influence
 may possibly enter on the terrestrial surface, and from whence
 it may be propagated with progressively decreasing intensity.
 Such a locality is found in the north-western part of the Ame
 rican Continent.     Hourly observations made during seventeen
 months in 1852, 1853, and 1854, at Point Barrow, show an
 aggregate amount of disturbance unparalleled elsewhere, so far
 as our knowledge extends—greatly exceeding the amount of
 disturbance at other stations of hourly observation in the
 Canadian and Hudson's Bay territories or in high arctic lati
 tudes, which amount is itself much greater than is found, or
 than may be inferred to exist, in corresponding latitudes on this
                                                                -
side   of the Atlantic.
  Point Barrow is no less distinguished for the extraordinary
prevalenceof Aurora, which is now known to be a concomitant
phenomenon with magnetic disturbances. During          winter                         six
months, three      1852–53, and three
                        in                   1853–54, Aurora was

   There is a second very notable geographical distinction between
the phenomena of the solar-diurnal and of the disturbance-varia
tions, and it is one which bears strongly on the probability of a
difference in the mode of the sun’s action in producing the two
classes of effects.    It consists in the very different relative mag
nitudes of the range of the two variations in different parts of
the same hemisphere.         In the case of the disturbance-variation,
we have already noticed that              amount            its

    Since the time of Halley, several maps of the declination or
isogonic lines have been published from time to time from the
observations of successive epochs.   There have also been pub
lished maps of the other two magnetic elements; and these,
which embody facts unknown at the date when Halley wrote,
have confirmed in a remarkable degree his inference, drawn from
the declination only, of the existence of four poles or points of
principal magnetic attraction.    In the higher latitudes of both
hemispheres the isoclinal and isodynamic lines have the form of
 lemniscates, each loop of which encloses and surrounds a point
of maximum force.                      In
                         each one of the three elements the maps
corresponding to successive epochs indicate a secular change in
remarkable accordance, both in character and degree, with the
views entertained by Halley. When carefully studied, the changes

      To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal,
       GENTLEMEN,
Will          you permit me to trouble your readers with a few
          remarks on the subject of my friend Professor Tyndall's
lecture at the Royal Institution, reported in your last Number ?
In this lecture he enforces the claims of M. Mayer, a philosopher
whose merit has perhaps been overlooked by some of our English
physicists, and unaccountably so by his fellow-countrymen.                                                               I
myself was only imperfectly acquainted with his papers when, in
good conscience and with the materials at command,                      gave a                                I
sketch of the  history   of the  dynamical    theory   of heat,  in  my  paper
published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1850. M. Mayer's
merit consists in having announced, apparently without knowledge
of what had been done before, the true theory of heat. This is no
                              I
small merit, and am the last person who would wish to detract
from    it. But       give  to  Mayer,     toindeed       any single indivi
                                                                  or                   to
dual, the undivided praise            propounding the dynamical theory
                                                    of
of  heat, manifestly unjust
           is                          the numerous contributors

great step       physical science.         Two centuries ago, Locke said
that “Heat          is in
                    very brisk agitation

mesure et la représentation de cette diminution de chaleur.” In
p. 389 he gives a Table of the quantity of mechanical effect pro
duced corresponding to the loss of temperature of steam on ex
panding. From this it appears that 1°Cent. corresponds with 363
kilogrammes raised to the height of 1 metre. At p. 403 he states,
“Je bornerai lames réflexions sur un sujet dont chacun saura ap
précier l'importance. Du calorique quiest employé par l’industrie
a produire de la force, et aux usages domestiques, une faible partie
seulement est utilisée; une autre quantité bien plus considérable,
et qui pourrait suffire a créer d’immenses valeurs et à augmenter
 d’autant la richesse nationale, se trouve absolument perdue.”
 From the above extracts, it will be seen that a great advance
had been made before Mayer wrote his paper in 1842. Mayer
discourses to the same effect as Séguin, but at greater length,
with greater perspicuity, and with more copiousness of illustra
tion. He adopts the same hypothesis as the latter philosopher,
viz. that the heat evolved on compressing an elastic fluid is
exactly the equivalent of the compressing force, and thus arrives
at the same equivalent, viz. 365 kilogrammes per 1* Cent.
    It must be remarked that, at the time Séguin and Mayer
wrote, there were no known facts to warrant the hypothesis they
adopted.      There was no reason to assert that the heat evolved
by compressing a gas was even approximately the equivalent of
the compressing force. This being the case may account for the
inattention of the scientific world to these writings.            The dyna
mical   theory   of heat    certainly    was not established  by Séguin and
Mayer. To do this required experiment; and I therefore fear
lessly assert my right to the position which has been generally
accorded to me by my fellow physicists as having been the first
to give a decisive proof of the correctness of this theory.
   In saying this I do not wish to claim any monopoly of merit.
Even if Rumford, Mayer, and Séguin had not produced their
works, justice would still compel me to share with Thomson,
Rankine, Helmholtz, Holtzman, Clausius, and others, whose
labours have not only given developments and applications of
the dynamical theory which entitle them to merit as well as
their predecessors in these inquiries, but who have contributed
most essentially in supporting it by new proofs.
                                                       I
   Permit me to remark, in conclusion, that applied the dyna
mical theory to vital processes in 1843*; and that in 1847, in a
popular lecture published in the ‘Manchester Courier,' I ex
plained the phenomena of shooting-stars, and also stated that
the effect of the earth falling into the sun would be to increase
the temperature of that luminaryt.               Since that time Thomson,

124       Prof. Field on some of the Basic Salts of Copper.
No difficulty  was experienced in obtaining the artificial salt of
definite composition, by the addition of a small quantity of
caustic potash to a great excess of sulphate of copper, and boiling
for some time. On filtering off the excess of sulphate, and
washing for many days until no trace of sulphuric acid or cop
per could be detected in the filtrate, the bright-green powder,
after drying at 212° until it ceased to lose weight, gave on
analysis,

agreeing very closely with the formula 3Cu0, CuO S0°,              4HO,
which involves the following numbers:—

   The copper was estimated by two methods: (1) by dissolving
the salt in dilute nitric acid, and precipitating the oxide by a
slight excess of potash; and (2) by heating it to whiteness in a
platinum crucible. The residue consisted entirely of oxide of
copper, and on examination showed no trace of sulphuric acid.
   When a solution of hypochlorite of lime is employed in place
of the caustic alkali (the sulphate of copper being in excess), no
basic sulphate is formed, the green precipitate consisting entirely
of the oxychloride, the formula of which is in most instances
3CuO, CuCl, 4HO, but upon one or two occasions (dependent
apparently upon the length of the time of ebullition) of
3CuO, CuCl, 6HO. This is somewhat remarkable, inasmuch
                                jºi
as the native oxychloride (atacamite), which generally contains
4 atoms, sometimes is found with 5; and Berthier many years.
ago analysed a specimen from Cobija (Bolivia) containing 6
equivalents.    The artificial                obtained by myself, and
the natural one examined     by  Berthier,  agree    very closely.

                       To Dr. Tyndall,    F.R.S.
       SIR,
WB          take advantage of the opportunity afforded by the
           sending of the accompanying letter, to address, through
your kindness, to the readers of the Philosophical Magazine a
few lines in answer to the remarks published by Mr. Croll
of Glasgow, in the Number of that Journal for this month,
pp. 365 et seq., in reference to our experiments on Ampèrian
repulsion.
    There must be, either in the description of our experiments, or
in the figure which accompanies them, some want of accuracy or
of clearness; otherwise we are at a loss to understand how
Mr. Croll could say that the currents in the mercury ought to
repel the horizontal parts, while they attract the vertical parts of
our moveable conductor. This seems to us to contradict all the
received   ideas  of electric currents.    We would willingly take
trouble to make our      description  more clear or more accurate,
but the remainder of Mr. Croll’s article induces us to think that
such an attempt would be quite useless.
    In fact, Mr. Croll first admits that “our experiments with
the reversed conductor, and some others detailed by us, certainly
prove that the molecules of a conductor, while the current is
passing, do repel each other; ” and then goes on to discuss the
question from a point of view which is new to us, adding that
this repulsion of the molecules of a conductor proves nothing as
to the repulsion of the contiguous parts of the current itself.
Now we will not follow Mr. Croll into the arguments upon which
he bases his opinion concerning the mutual action of the parts of

 Sir W. R. Hamilton on a Symbolic and Biquadratic Equation. 127
 the current; in the first place, because these arguments appear
 to us to be beyond the reach of experimental control; and in
 the second place, because we think it can be of but slight use to
 science to speculate on the properties of a current hypotheti
 cally detached from the material substratum without which we
 are unable really to conceive of    existence.               its
                   We have the honour       remain, &c.,                  to

   3. As it was in the Number of the Philosophical Magazine for
July  1844 that the first printed publication of the Quaternions
occurred (though a paper on them had been previously read to
the Royal Irish Academy in November 1843),          have thought                      I
that the Editors of the   Magazine  might  perhaps allow me thus
to put on record what seems to myself an important addition to
the theory, and that they may even allow me to add, in a Post
script to this communication, so much as may convey a distinct
conception of the Method which I have pursued.

between the summit of the air-bubble and the surface of the
liquid has become very small, these molecular movements are no
longer able to take place with a velocity corresponding to that
with which the bubble rises.           Hence, in order that the air which
constitutes the bubble may continue to rise and come above the
surface of the liquid, it is plain that the liquid must either part
or be raised up. Since the beautiful researches of MM. Donny
and Henry, there can, however, no longer be any doubt as to
the cohesion of liquids being comparable to that of solids; ac
cordingly the stratum of liquid which separates the summit of
the bubble of air from the surface, at the moment at which we
take the phenomenon into consideration, offers, notwithstanding
its extreme thinness, a resistance much too great to allow it to
be broken.       Consequently this layer is raised up, or, in other
words, a liquid film is formed.
     Ishow that, at the end of the phenomenon, this film neces
sarily forms part of a sphere, but can in no case become a com
plete hemisphere, although it approaches thereto the more nearly
the larger it      Iverify the last result experimentally: show that

the supposition of the equality of the angles formed at the junc
tion of the films, this superposition proves that the supposed
equality really exists.
   In the systems that we have been examining, one and the
same edge does not unite more than three films; and in the
system formed by the junction of three hemispheres, four edges
come together in one point, namely that which unites the three
partitions, and those which unite the three hemispheres, two and
two.                                I
        Now, as have set forth in my Fifth Series of researches,
in the systems of films formed within skeletons of iron wire, we
never find more than three films coming together at a single
edge, nor more than four edges coming together at the same
point: these are, then, two general laws of the combinations of
               -
films.
     Iendeavour to find by experiment upon what these laws can
depend, and                    I
                 arrive at the conclusion that the equilibrium of
every system of films in which more than three films come
together in one edge, or more than four edges unite at the same
point, is unstable. The following are two of my experiments on
this subject.
   1.      If
         an iron-wire skeleton is constructed by the junction of
two squares so arranged that two opposite sides of each square
bisect two opposite sides of the other at right angles, and if each
square be supposed to be occupied by a plane film, the two films
will cut each other, forming a straight liquid edge joining the
points of intersection of the solid edges: the system so formed
will evidently, in consequence of                                its
                                       perfect symmetry, constitute
  system      equilibrium; but the solid edge will

curvature at each point of the films in question should be equal
to nothing.    It would be difficult to verify this law very strictly
by observation; but it can be seen at least that, whenever a
film exhibits a curvature in one direction, it exhibits an opposite
curvature in the direction at right angles.
  I  have also enounced, finally, two other laws in my Fifth Series,
and   I examine their causes in the memoir of which this is an
abstract; but as they are of secondary importance, I will not
speak of them here.
                I
   Lastly, examine theoretically and experimentally the manner
in which film-systems are formed on wire skeletons.        will con I
fine myself  here to a single example,  namely,  to the formation of
the system of films of the six-sided prism, when a skeleton of
that form is removed from the liquid, the axis of the prism
being kept vertical. At the moment that the lower base is
about to emerge from the liquid, the system consists only of
six plane films, which occupy respectively the six lateral faces
of the prism; and it is obvious that these films cannot have any
tendency to enter towards the centre of the skeleton, because
they make with each other the angle of exactly 120°, which two
films belonging to the same system always make with each
other. When the lower base emerges, it remains at first united
to the surface of the liquid by a film, which soon contracts at
the bottom, closes up and separates from the liquid, and then,
as a plane film, comes to occupy the base in question.      But this
plane film, making thus right angles with the films which oc
cupy the lateral faces, cannot remain in such a position; accord
ingly it is seen to ascend between the others, bending them in
two by drawing them to itself, and thus diminishing them in size;
at the same time six new films are formed, starting from the solid
wires and ending in the liquid edges which unite the first films
two and two.      Equilibrium is at last established, when the
ascending film has arrived halfway up the prism.
  By this examination of the mode of formation of systems of
films,    I
         am led to divide them into three classes—namely, per
fect systems, imperfect systems, and abortive systems.
   In those of the first class, each solid wire serves as a base,
along     its
          whole length, for only one film.        call them perfect,
                                                   I
because       all
            the films  depend  from each other throughout their
whole extent, and because such        the liquid edges

end  upon  the skeleton start from          its
                                          extreme    points.   With     a
very few exceptions, such systems are formed            the skeletons
                                                            in

than  120°,-such,   for instance,     as

as  a base for two portions of film at a time.    These are the
systems of the second class, and are imperfect, because the two
portions of film just mentioned are rendered independent of each
other by the wire which separates them. Such, for example, are
the systems formed by prisms the number of whose lateral faces
exceeds six.
   Lastly, with other skeletons we never obtain anything but

an extensive class of problems which admit of being answered
by the formation and integration of ordinary differential equa
tions, while at the same time the answers are not given by the
general integrals, but by particular solutions deducible from
them.     These solutions contain no arbitrary constants.    When
the answers are of this    kind,  they  may  also be obtained by
direct processes, independently of the general integral.     In an
analogous manner it may be asserted, with respect to hydro
dynamical problems, that those laws and relations of the velocity
and condensation which are independent of the arbitrary disturb
ances, and are indicated by expressions which contain no arbi
trary functions, may be deduced by processes which are inde
pendent of the complete integral of the above-mentioned general
differential equation. And, conversely, any results strictly de
duced from the differential equations, and admitting of inter
pretation relative to the motion, but containing no arbitrary
functions, must be taken as exponents of laws or circumstances
of the motion which are not arbitrary, but depend only on the
mutual action of the parts of the fluid and      fundamental pro          as its
perties. These remarks may       exemplified    follows, from what

This value off, containing no arbitrary quantity whatever, ex
presses the general law of the arrangement of the condensation,
in the case of free motion, about the axis of rectilinear motion.
It is evident that the same result might be obtained from (10) by
supposing, as might be presumed to be the case in free and un
disturbed motion, that the condensation a, and therefore            f  is a
function of r.     I  have  pointed    out other methods of obtainin
the series (12) in the communication of December 1852 before
referred to.
    29. To ascertain the precise character of the free vibrations of
an elastic fluid, it will now be necessary to discuss the properties
of the function f. First, it is to be observed that, since the con
 densation in any plane transverse to the axis of 2 is proportional
 to f, those values of r which make fyanish are radii of cylin
 drical surfaces in which the condensation is zero throughout the
 motion.     Similarly, those values of r which make df vanish are
                                                          dr
radii of cylindrical surfaces in which the transverse velocity is
always zero. In order to calculate the magnitudes of these dif
ferent radii, it is necessary first to determine the value of the
 unknown constant e. I have given a process for effecting this
 determination in a communication to the Philosophical Magazine
 for February 1853, under Prop. XI.; and no other method of
 obtaining the same result has since occurred to me, although             I
 can scarcely doubt that the problem admits of being solved in a
 different manner.      At the same time I have seen no reason to
 call in  question  the exactness of the solution there given, which,
 as it is important; and admits of being exhibited in a somewhat
 simpler form,   I shall now repeat.

 and the equation (12) is the integral of this equation in a series.
 The above-mentioned process for finding the value of e requires
                                                        f
 the determination of values of r which make vanish at very
  great distances from the axis; and at first sight it might be sup
  posed that for very large values of r the middle term of the above

  tained with sufficient approximation by integrating the equation

 deprived of this term.                      But to this proceeding there lies the objec
 tion, that where the middle term is a maximum,                                                   equal to
                                                                                           drº is
 % however large r may be.                              Thus, since at very remote distances
 from the axis there may be values of the first and second terms
 comparable with each other, the latter term cannot be legiti
 mately omitted for large values of r.

propose to advert to some remaining points of this mathematical
theory which may require elucidation, and to draw some infer
ences from the foregoing results, particularly with reference to
the undulatory theory of light.
   Before concluding this communication,      I  beg to advert to the
reference made    by  Prof. Tyndall, in the  Philosophical  Magazine
for last April, to the discussion which, as he says (§ 2), was
“carried on in 1851 between Professors Challis and Stokes
regarding Laplace's correction for the theoretic velocity of
sound.”     From his expressing a hope that        Ishall deem con
clusive the results of the   experiments   on radiant heat to which
he refers,      I
              hardly think he can be fully aware of the points      in
volved in that discussion. The results of experiments made by so
able a physicist    Iaccept as valuable and trustworthy; but    I fail
to see how those to which he directs my attention settle the
question about the velocity of sound, the precise nature of which
will perhaps be understood by the following statement. Laplace,
who, it is well known, did not give much attention to the phy
sical applications of partial differential equations, was content to
deduce from hydrodynamics the value of the velocity of sound
first obtained by Newton.      In this he has been followed by later
mathematicians, as Poisson and others, who, in deducing the
rate of propagation, have adopted a process first suggested by
Lagrange.      After much consideration given for a long time to
the mathematical theory of hydrodynamics,              I
                                                     discovered that
that process is objectionable in principle, and that by the appli
cation of correct mathematical principles (which are fully ex
plained in this communication) a value of the velocity is obtained
so accordant with that given by observation as to leave scarcely
any residual quantity to account for.      This is the real question
at issue between me and Prof. Stokes, who contends for the
Newtonian value as ordinarily deduced; and it will thus be seen
that, antecedently to any physical considerations, there is a
question to be settled which is exclusively a mathematical one.
   With respect to the attempt madé by Laplace to account for
the difference between the Newtonian and the observed velocities
of sound, I fully believe that such a theory as that which he
proposed would never have been thought of if the principles of
the application of partial differential equations to the determina
tion of the motion of fluids had been better understood. Laplace's
physical theory has not been admitted in     allparticulars; but the
general conception that the heat developed        by
                                                   sudden condensa
tion,  or absorbed      by
                        sudden  rarefaction,  produces  the excess  of
velocity,    accepted. To make, however, this general view bear
            is
upon the fact, three distinct hypotheses have been made:–
 (1) that   certain amount
            a                of  increment   of  temperature always

accompanies a certain amount of condensation, whatever be the
neighbouring condensations, and whether the waves be long or
short, and the excursions of the particles be swift or slow, and
that it is exactly proportional to the condensation; (2) that this
increment of temperature is acquired simultaneously with the
condensation; (3) that the increment of temperature is quam
proxime the same in unconfined air as when the air suffers the
same amount of condensation in a confined space.        Since these
laws are not deduced from       acknowledged   principles,  they can
have no other basis than     experiment  to rest upon.     I am not,
however, aware of any experiments which lend them support,
unless the new experiments of Prof. Tyndall justify the third
hypothesis.    But confess          I                    I
                                do not yet see in what way they do
this, or, if they give countenance to this hypothesis, that the
theory is made good, so long as the other two hypotheses remain
unsupported.               I
                 cannot but think that the most probable account
of the matter              is,
                  that when the same portion       air continually                  in of   is
undergoing condensations and rarefactions         rapid succession,
the respective caloric effects are continually neutralizing each
other, and thus the rate       the velocity    propagation remains

at the bottom of the arrangement, is first vaporized by the heat, and
then decomposed by the ignited fuel and rearranged as hydrogen
and carbonic oxide; and only the ashes of the coal are removed as
solid matter from the chamber at the bottom of the fire-bars.
  These mixed gases form the gaseous fuel. The nitrogen which
entered with the air at the grate is mingled with them, constituting
about a third of the whole volume. The gas rises up a large vertical
tube for 12 or 15 feet, after which it proceeds horizontally for any
required distance, and then descends to the heat-regenerator, through
which it passes before it enters the furnaces.     A regenerator is a
chamber packed with fire-bricks, separated so as to allow of the free
passage of air or gas between them.      There are four placed under a
furnace. The gas ascends through one of these chambers, whilst
air ascends through the neighbouring chamber, and both are con
ducted through passage outlets at one end of the furnace, where
mingling they burn, producing the heat due to their chemical action.
Passing onwards to the other end of the furnace, they         the com              (i.   e.
bined gases) find precisely similar outlets down which they pass; and
traversing the two remaining regenerators from above downwards,
heat them intensely,              especially        the upper part, and           so   travel      on    in

  The following communications were read:—
  1. “On the Metamorphic Rocks of the Banffshire Coast, the
Scarabins, and a portion of East Sutherland.” By Prof. R. Hark

   The coast-section from Gamrie to Buckie was first described ; it
consists mainly of folded gneiss and grauwacke sandstone and shale,
with underlying quartz-rock, of great thickness, conformable, and
folded with         it,
                   and seen     anticlinals

dich, and still more        an arch between Cullen and Buckie. Two

folds      limestone, obscurely stratified, and not persistent, occur with
          of

syenite,       granite, and
               of               serpentine (Portsoy) were also pointed
out   in this section,     well as two outliersas   the Old Red depositsof
at  Dunidich and Cullen. The        metamorphic   rocks above mentioned
have      predominating south-east dip, and the folds hang over
          a                                                            the                       to

succeeded by the gneiss and folded white quartz-rock            the Scara                   of

a gold-bearing horizontal quartz-vein (the “barrels” of the miners)
lying on the schist and overlain by quartzite and gravel.         By the
neighbouring railway-sections the chlorite-schist is seen to alternate
in broad bands with quartzite, and to be associated with granite.
The author thinks there is reason to believe that the quartzite may
be of Lower Silurian age.
   3. “On some Fossil Crustacea from the Coal-measures and De
vonian Rocks of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Cape Breton.”
By J. W. Salter, Esq., F.G.S., of the Geol. Surv. Great Britain.
    One of the Devonian fossils is apparently allied to the Stomapods,
and is named Amphipeltis paradorus by Mr. Salter; it was obtained
by Dr. Dawson near St. John's, where it occurred with plant-remains;
another Crustacean fossil from the same locality is a new Eury
pterus, E. pulicaris.    Other remains of Eurypteri have been sent also
by Dr. Dawson, from the Coal-measures           of Port Hood and the
Joggins; and with these a new Amphipod, Diplostylus, having
some characters of alliance with Typhis and Brachyocelus.
    4. “On     some Species of Eurypterus and allied forms.” By
J. W.   Salter,  Esq., F.G.S., &c.
    After  alluding to the late and complete researches on Eurypterus
by Dr. Wieskowski and Professor         J. Hall, Mr. Salter explained
some formerly obscure points in its structure, and proceeded to de
scribe the E. Scouleri, Hibbert, from the Carboniferous limestone of
Scotland, and the Upper Old Red Sandstone of Kilkenny; the E.
 (Arthropleura) mammatus, sp. nov., from the Upper Coal-measures
near Manchester; and E. 2 (Arthropleura ) ferow, sp. nov., from the
Coal-measures of North Staffordshire.
    5. “On Peltocaris, a new genus of Silurian Crustacea.”     By  J. W.
Salter, Esq., F.G.S., &c.
    Of  this form an imperfect individual, from the anthracite-shales
 (Llandeilo flags) of Dumfriesshire, was formerly described by the
author as Dithyrocaris      aptychoides. Better specimens enabled him
to distinguish it as a new generic form belonging to the Phyllopods,
not far removed from Hymenocaris and Dithyrocaris. A fragment of
 another larger form, from the same locality, is described by the author
 as Peltocaris & Harknessi.     Mr. Salter also explained his views of
 the relationship of the palaeozoic Phyllopoda, among themselves and
with the recent forms, and illustrated them by a diagram in which
they were arranged in chronological succession.
    6. “On     a Crustacean Track in the Llandeilo Flags of Chirbury,
Shropshire.”      By  J. W. Salter, Esq., F.G.S., &c.
    This track consists of numerous, short, narrow, oblique, chisel
shaped imprints, on the ripple-ridges of the slab; and, according to
the author, it must have been caused by a small Crustacean with a bifid
telson or prong-like tail. To a like agency Mr. Salter refers similar
markings described by M. Brébisson as occurring in the Lower Silu
rian sandstone of Noron in the Falaise (Normandy).

it,and then determining the density       this mixture. This method,        of

The number 0.9178 only differs by 0.0002 from that of Plücker and

(0-9180). This latter coincidence may inspire some confidence, as
Brünner's method was quite different from that which Dufour used.

                    XXIII.   On the Conformation of the Alps.
                          By Professor TYNDALL, F.R.S.*
      URING      the last seven summers I have had opportunities of
       viewing the Alps from many commanding points of view,
and while in such positions have often speculated on the agen
cies which have given this portion of the earth's surface                  re                its
markable conformation.          How have the hills     risen,     how   have      or
the valleys sunk?         think the mere inspection
                              I                             the mountains   of
from      sufficient elevation must
          a                              suggest  insuperable    difficulties
to the  assumption     that the present   mountains have arisen through
the action        forces localized beneath their bases,
                    of                                             that the       or
valleys,      they now exist, can have sunk through want
               as                                                       local               of
support underneath. Probably nobody entertains such                  notion.           a
Upheaval may have occurred, and sinking may have occurred; but
it   isnext         to
                 inconceivable that either action should have been
so  parcelled out           produce the present conformation

                               of its
been carved into          present form.
     Inthe  uplifting     the land, cracks and fissures would probably
 be produced, and the valleys might                         be
                                                                                                   byof

example,   the ridge from Monte Rosa over the Lyskamm and
Breithorn to the Matterhorn; the upheaval of that ridge could
not possibly produce rents in the position now occupied by the
Val Tournanche, the Val d’Ayas, and the Val du Lys. The line
of strain would be parallel to these valleys, and hence the line
of fracture, if fracture at all occurred, across them.
   A sufficient consideration of the subject must, I think, result
in the conclusion already expressed, that a general elevation of
the land formerly existed, and must limit us to the question, “By
what agency has this land been scarred so as to exhibit the valleys
by which it is now intersected             *
                                       These valleys are the tracks of
rivers, and have been manifestly formed with reference to the
discharge of the aqueous precipitations which occurred on the
heights.    An eminent Swiss geologist, with whom had an op                                I
portunity of conversing a week or two ago, called the Alpine
valleys “Auswaschungsthåler,”       valleys cut out by the action of
water.    For some years an opposite conclusion has been gradu
ally forcing itself upon me; and this year completed a chain of      I
evidence which leaves little doubt upon my mind that a mightier
excavator than mere water has been at work among the Alps,
and that the country owes             its
                                    present conformation mainly                                               to

years ago     I                of inspecting the Val Tournanche
                  had an opportunity
from Breuil to Chatillon. This year I crossed the Cimes
Blanches from Breuil, wandered over the ancient névés of the
place, penetrated the higher ramifications of the Val d’Ayas,
and everywhere found the sculpture of the ancient ice. Crossing
the Col Betta Furka, and looking down the Val du Lys, the work
of the glacier which      once proceeded from the slopes of the
Lyskamm was immediately manifest.                               I
                                                 traced the action
through this noble valley, as far as Gressonay St. Jean; every
where on the valleys' flanks the same truth was proclaimed.
What air and water have accomplished since the disappearance
of the glaciers are mere scratches of the tooth of time, in compa
rison with the mighty furrows which had been previously
ploughed out.
   From Gressonay           I
                        crossed the Col de Val d’Obbia to Alagna,
and everywhere         I
                    trod upon ground deserted by the ice. Like                              of
neighbour      the Lys, the Val Sesia also formed the bed
                  of

state of things in which the ice has dwindled to limits which
barely serve as a key to the stupendous operations of a by-gone
geologic age. To account for a glacial epoch, then, we need not
resort to the hard hypothesis of a change in the amount of solar
emission, or of a change in the temperature of space traversed
by our system.    Elevations of the land, which would naturally
accompany the gradual cooling of the earth, are quite competent
to account for such an epoch; and the ice itself, in the absence
of any other agency, would be competent to destroy the condi
tions which gave it birth.

     MY   DEAR      Joule,

ON quainted
       return from Switzerland two            days ago,
            with the note which you             have published in the
last Number of the Philosophical Magazine.   Would you allow
me to make the following remarks in connexion with the subject
of it?
   During the spring of the present year I gave at the Royal
Institution a course of lectures “On Heat, regarded as a kind
of Motion.” During the early portion of the course, I had en
gaged a short-hand writer to report the lectures, with a view to
their subsequent publication; and from this gentleman's notes
                               I
of my second lecture make the following extract, which refers
to the mechanical theory of heat:-" It is to Mr. Joule, of
Manchester, that we are almost wholly indebted for the experi
mental treatment of this subject.             With his mind firmly
fixed  upon   a  principle,  and   undismayed    by the coolness with
which his first labours appear to have been received, he per
sisted for years in his attempts to prove the invariability of the
relation between heat and ordinary mechanical force.         He placed
water in a suitable vessel, agitated it by paddles moved by
measurable forces, and determined the elevation of temperature;
he did the same with mercury and sperm-oil.            He also caused
disks of cast iron to rotate against each other, and measured the
heat produced by their friction.            He urged water through
capillary tubes, and measured the heat, thus generated.            The
results of his experiments leave no doubt upon the mind that
under   all circumstances the absolute amount        of heat produced
by  the  expenditure          of
                              definite amount
                                   a            of  mechanical force  is
fixed and invariable.”      Such has been my language regarding
you; and      to
               it still adhere.
                   I                 trust you find nothing

of being the experimental demonstrator of the equivalence of
heat and work.
   It was not my object in the lecture to which you refer to give
a history of the mechanical theory of heat, but simply to place
a man of genius, to whom the fates had been singularly unkind,
in a position in some measure worthy of him.             I was quite
aware of          all
               that you  have stated   regarding    Locke,  Rumford,

        XXV.     On the Diathermancy       of the Media of the Eye.
                               By R. FRANz*.
 Th;         spectrum which is produced by a clear prism exhibits
          to the eye the greatest intensity of illumination, and hence
 the maximum of luminous action, in the yellow.            Only in a few
 cases do our thermometric          apparatus   show the maximum effect
 of the spectrum in the yellow, but often in the red, and often
 also outside the red: they even prove that the sun's action in
 favourable circumstances only ceases at a distance from the red
 which considerably exceeds the distance of the extreme chemi
 cally active rays. How is this phenomenon to be explained on
 the assumption which so many experiments, and the concurrence
 of eminent observers in this department has made probable, the
 theory, namely, that light and heat are identical? Melloni en
 deavoured to explain the phenomenon of the great intensity of
 illumination in the yellow by assuming that the retina of the eye
 has a yellowish colour, which in age becomes pale, and is then
 replaced by a yellowish coloration of the crystalline lenst.        The
 first part of this assumption would express the conjecture that
 the retina is more susceptible to the vibrations of the yellow
 light—in a certain sense, harmonizes more with them than with
 vibrations of greater or less wave-length.
     To this hypothesis of Melloni, Brücke opposed a series of accu
 rate observations.       He imagined that the media of the eye do
 not transmit     rays   of great wave-length, and therefore that an
 excitation of the retina by them cannot take place.          In order to
 establish this supposition, he used an Argand burner as a lumi
 nous source of heat, while the same lamp covered by a black sheet
 iron cylinder furnished the obscure source of heat. A deflection
of the needle of the galvanometer, amounting to from 40° to 50°,
 was observed while the bright source irradiated the thermo-pile
 directly; but when the cornea was interposed, the deflection was
only 8 to 9 degrees; and the deflection was reduced to 14 degree
when the crystalline lens was interposed. When both were
simultaneously interposed, no thermal action was produced.
When the dark cylinder was placed round the lamp, the galva
nometer exhibited no deflection, either when the crystalline lens
or the cornea was placed in the path of the thermal rayst.
     Brücke subsequently repeated these experiments in another
manner, by placing a dioptric combination of vitreous humour,
lens, and cornea in the path of a pencil of solar rays. The de
flection of the galvanometer amounted in this case to from 26 to 30

   In 1850, A. Cima published, in the August Number of the
           Il
     .
Journal    Nuovo Cimento, an investigation of the absorption of
the media of the eye for heat, and found that, of 100 rays inci
dent from a Locatelli's lamp, only nine penetrated the three media
combined by Brücke.       Of the                     H.
                                      rays (the most important in
reference to the question proposed above) Cima has taken no
aCCOunt.
             resumed the investigation in the year 1859. The
results obtained agree in general with those published by Brücke.
An accurate description of Tyndall’s experiments has not, how
ever, been given.     Lastly, Janssen published observations on
the  absorption  of heat by the media of the eye. He used a
moderator   lamp  as a source of heat.   About 8 per cent. of the
incident rays were absorbed by the eye, the media of which
were in part investigated separately. In order to determine the
thermocrose of the separate parts of the eye, Jannsen compared
their diathermancy with the diathermancy of water, using differ
ent sources of heat.   In these experiments a perfect concordance
was observed between the absorptive force of a layer of water
(between glass plates), and of an equally thick layer of any of the
media of which the eye is composed t.           But since Melloni has
shown that obscure heat can penetrate waterf, it would follow
from the last observations that obscure thermal rays can reach
the retina.   But the heat which is present in the luminous rays
could not, according to Masson and Jamin’s law § (that perfectly
transparent bodies transmit           luminous zonesall       heat    the                  of    in
same manner),             be
                     affected                  by
                                  the absorption which takes place                                     in
the interior     the eye, provided that the media
                 of                                           the eye are                  of
quite clear.   Hence the    greater part     the thermal  rays ofabsorbed
by  the eye are obscure.

sun's rays, when it is a question of working with the largest
possible number of those rays. In fact, direct comparison of the
spectra of a flint-glass and of a rock-salt prism shows that the
heat in the bright zones of the spectra produced by both prisms
has equal intensity, but in the dark zones an increase in favour
of the rock-salt prism, as I have elsewhere shown”. Neverthe
less the absorption of obscure heat by the vesicles of fog, with
which, in our latitudes, the atmosphere is perpetually charged,
is so great that the differences in the quantity of heat of the
individual obscure zones is not so pronounced as might have been
expected from Melloni’s investigations, which were made under
more favourable atmospheric conditions. With a perfectly trans
parent rock-salt prism, and with an apparently perfectly clear
sky,  I have never been able to prove an action beyond the sixth

slit was made in this spherical curvature, and upon this curva
ture the cornea was fastened.            On the side of the cylinder was
a  tube,   which   by   means of an India-rubber tube was connected
with a bladder full of air. In this manner the cornea was always
kept stretched, and the individual zones radiated through it
sharply defined.
    The aqueous humour had always to be obtained by a prick in
the fresh eye; because the humour, as soon as it was poured out
from the interior by removing the crystalline lens, always showed
a slight turbidity from the injured pigment.

     The aqueous humour during the investigation was placed in a
 brass vessel blackened on the inside, and with two parallel glass
 sides. The relatively better transmission of the yellow rays,
 which was so decided in the case of the cornea, was not seen in
 this case. The luminous rays traversed the aqueous humour in

From these results it appears that the absorptive powers of the
different media of the eye are very similar to that of water;
only the cornea and the crystalline appear to absorb more red
rays than water does.          Hence if we are to hold to the theory
of the   identity  of  light and heat, we must look for the reason of
the invisibility of those thermal rays of less refrangibility than
the red rays in the nature of the retina—revert, in fact, to a
supposition like that of Melloni: that the optic nerve cannot
give back the slow oscillations of the obscure rays.
    I may here be permitted to call attention to a great difficulty,
which diminishes the accuracy of results obtained with the ob
scure rays of the sun.        Even if atmospheric air exercises but a
small   absorption    on radiant heat, and air saturated with aqueous
vapour has the same diathermaneity as dry air”, yet there are in
our atmosphere so many fog-vesicles and finely-divided solid sub
stances, that a great quantity of the thermal rays of the sun is
lost, either by reflexion or by absorption. Hence, with an appa
rently clear sky, the distribution of heat in the various spectral
zones is very different.        I may here adduce two series of obser
vations, the most favourable and unfavourable of several, which
were to determine the heat of the zones of the spectra, using a
rock-salt prism, and both obtained with an apparently clear sky.

   The deflections in the red zone amounted to about thirty-five
divisions of the scale.   It will thus be seen that apparently
bright days, like the 12th of August, sometimes cannot be used
for experiments with obscure solar heat. On two days only
have I obtained such an absorption of the obscure rays, that the
absorption in the first obscure zone was greater than in the red.
Hence, before each series of experiments like the above, the
solar heat which reaches the surface of the earth without any
absorbing obstacle had previously to be tested.       In this preli
minary trial, a phenomenon was observed which rendered a com
parison of the results more difficult: the heat in the first obscure
zone decreased with the sinking of the sun as compared with
the heat in the red, although no difference was perceptible in
the external appearance of the sky.  In the first obscure zone,
on a very bright day, experiment gave the following results for
times of observation                 about an hour apart:—
                               13:00,     12:26,            11.78,          11.60,
if the quantity of heat contained in the red zone (which was
determined anew before each observation) is indicated by 10:00.
Similar results were obtained on other days. Hence, on the same
day, and under otherwise similar circumstances, the loss of obscure
thermal rays accompanying luminous rays increases with the
thickness of the layer of our atmosphere which the sun's heat
traverses. The general conclusion does not, however, follow,
that the quantity of obscure rays always decreases with the thick
ness of the layer of atmospheric air.   For the ratio of the quanti
ties of heat in the first obscure zone and in the red, the mean of

THE
  investigations on the new metal discovered by Mr. Crookes.
    Inexamining, three months ago, with Kirchhoff and Bun
sen's spectrum-apparatus, a specimen of selenium which my
brother-in-law M. Fred. Kuhlmann had extracted from the
deposit of the chamber in which sulphuric acid is prepared by
the combustion of pyrites, I perceived a well-marked green ray,
         I
which had not perceived in any of the numerous simple or
compound mineral bodies which                 I
                                           had studied.         was at that I
time   ignorant   that an   English   chemist,     Mr.   Crookes,  had not
only discovered the same green rays under almost analogous
circumstances, but had given the name thallium to the new ele
ment, from the Greek word 6a)\\0s, or the Latin thallus, fre
quently employed to express the rich tint of a young and vigo
rous vegetation. With great sagacity. Mr. Crookes had indicated
some reactions of the element, which he considered as a metalloid,
belonging probably to the sulphur group; but the small quan
tity of the element on which he had worked had not enabled him
to isolate this element and distinguish                 its
                                                    true nature.
    On   my  part, I  tried       to
                               isolate the new     body,  seeking        the         it   in
 sediment     ofthe lead   chambers,   from which had been extracted
the selenium that gave the characteristic green line              the spec      to
troscope. This line naturally served              guide

Acetylene is formed by passing chloride of methyle through a
tube heated below dull redness, and also by passing carbonic
oxide mixed with vapours of hydrochloric acid over siliciuret of
magnesium heated to dull redness.
  Cupreous acetylene can be formed not only by means of ammo
niacal protochloride of copper, but also by protochloride of
copper dissolved in chloride of potassium. The formation of
the body takes place more easily in the presence of free potash.
Cupreous acetylene can be obtained free from chlorine and from
nitrogen, but not from oxygen. It is a compound of variable
composition, very alterable, and analogous to an oxysulphide.
From the analyses made, it appeared to correspond to the
formula

    Woulfe, provided with a funnel tube and a gas-delivery tube, was
    about three-fourths filled with granulated zinc ; water added, as
    well as sulphuric acid mixed with the nitrile.  The liquid poured
    off from the mixture was distilled, and the distillate, which con
    tained much undecomposed nitrile, again acted on by acid and
    zinc.   From the solution of sulphate of zinc by far the greater
    part was separated by crystallization, and nearly         the rest was             all
    precipitated         by
                      alcohol. The last traces        zinc were separatedof

    Justas hippuric acid, when boiled with hydrochloric acid, is
resolved into benzoic acid and glycocol, so chlorohippuric acid is
resolved into chlorobenzoic acid and glycocol.     But the chloro
benzoic acid thus obtained differs from that prepared by the
decomposition of chloride of sulphobenzoyle. The body which
Otto obtained is transformed by the action of sodium-amalgam
into an acid free from chlorine, which is identical in all essential
respects with Kolbe and Lautemann's salylic acid*; and hence
Otto regards his chlorobenzoic acid as a peculiar isomeric modi
fication of the true chlorobenzoic acid, a view which is supported
by the properties of the nitro-compound prepared from                                    it.

of baryta removed by carbonic acid, and then the baryta com
bined with acids separated by sulphuric acid.              On evaporating
the liquid, a yellowish-brown syrup is left, from which a cry
stalline substance separates.      This is recrystallized from aqueous
alcohol, dissolved in baryta-water, and again precipitated with
hydrochloric acid.
   Thus purified it forms a white crystalline powder, very little
soluble in hot or cold water, crystallizing from alcohol and ether,
in which it is very soluble, in white stellate crystals. It melts
at 287°, and sublimes without change, like benzoic acid.
   The formula of the acid is C*H* O°, and Finck names it Uvi
tinic acid; it is isomeric with insolinic acid, but differs in its
solubility in ether and alcohol.        Finck has investigated several
of the  salts, of which the silver and copper salts crystallize.        It
is a bibasic acid, and the formula of the silver salt is C*H*Ag”0°.
   In the mother-liquor from which uvitinic acid has been sepa
rated, another acid, which does not crystallize, is contained. It
is a very strong acid, and unites directly with metallic oxides to
form neutral salts, which, however, do not crystallize.           The for
mula of this acid appears to be C*H*O".                     Finck names it
uvitonic acid.

it will be seen that the formation of the latter depends on a
reduction of the former; for while one part of the pyroracemic
acid is oxidized to oxalic acid, another part loses oxygen and is
 converted into the other two acids.
    According to Simmler”, a highly fluorescent solution may be
prepared from cane-sugar as follows.               To a syrupy solution of
cane-sugar an equal volume of sulphuric acid is gradually added.
The mixture blackens, a violent reaction is set up, which results
in the formation of a solid mass resembling black peat. When
this is somewhat cool, the mass is shaken with about ten times
its volume of distilled water and allowed to stand. After filtra
tion a liquor is obtained which in transmitted light is quite
colourless, except when strongly concentrated; but viewed in
daylight against a black cloth, exhibits a more brilliant blue
even than quinine.      It appears to be due to a peculiar organic
acid, for when neutralized with a base the fluorescence disappears.

XXVII.           Note on some Objections of Mr. Cayley and                         Mr. Cockle.
                            By G. B. JERRARD*.
       AVING          been unwell         for some weeks past,
                                                       have had no             I
        opportunity of expressing what                         I
                                            thought of the objec
tions referred to at the close of my last papert.   In appearance,
these  objections   are most formidable.   They   were intended to
upset a conclusion of mine respecting the existence of an excep
tional case, hitherto unobserved by mathematicians, in Lagrange's
theory of homogeneous functions.      My conclusion, however, still
seems to be unshaken.      But there is assuredly a notable error
somewhere.    Let us try to find out with whom it rests.
   1. The  objection which comes first in order is so peculiar,
       I
that am quite unable to characterize it beforehand, or to reduce
it to any known class.
   “Putting, for shortness,” says Mr. Cayley,
                                 “a=f(t)f(t”) f(*) f(*),
I understand    Mr. Jerrard to mean that a, a” being given as the
roots of two   equations  of the sixth order respectively, a cannot
be expressed as a rational function of a” and of the coefficients
of the two equations; or, what is the same thing, since the co
efficients of each equation are rational functions of the coeffi
cients of the given equation of the fifth order, that a cannot
be expressed as a rational function of 2* and of the coefficients
of the equation of the fifth order. If this is not Mr. Jerrard’s
meaning, he will doubtless set me right; but that a can be so
expressed seems so clear, that                      I
                                       must apologize for giving a
formal   proof of iti.”
    The question, however, relating to a                          is,
                                                 we shall see little    as              a
further   on, very different from what      here implicitly assumed
                                                         it   is
to be.
     2.Let       us
               suppose,      conformity with my previous notation
                                   in
for n=6, m-5S, that and designate two rational six-valued
                                   u          v
homogeneous functions                of
                              the roots   the equation   of
                            a”--Ala"+Agº"+...+A5=0;
then       by
          Lagrange's theory                   we
                                  can generally express either                                   of
these functions      rational terms of the other and of the coeffi
                            in
cients A1, A2,   Ag. The only exception, according
                      ...                             that theory,              to

is when there are equal roots       (U)            in         or
which       respectively depend,-or rather when the number
           u,   v
unequal roots     (U) differs from that
                       in                  unequal roots    (V).

     3.    But
             I      maintain that when             u    and   v   are taken equal     to in   those

the theory of Lagrange will afford us no aid whatever in esta
blishing a rational communication between them, although in
this case the equations (U), (W) have undoubtedly no equal roots.

theory should furnish not only illusory but even fallacious results.

problem and that which my solution exhibits.                Mr. Todhunter
assumes a certain discontinuity of the joining line, after which it
becomes a very simple matter to obtain a solution; whereas in
the process which I have employed that particular discontinuity
is inferred.          I
                     make this remark expressly for the purpose of
raising the question as to whether the solutions of problems in
the Calculus of Variations may involve the principle of discon
tinuity. This being a question of a novel and interesting cha
racter,      I
            propose now to discuss it at some length, and to give
my reasons for answering it affirmatively.
   Before entering upon considerations more directly bearing
upon the subject for discussion,                     I
                                           beg to advert to an assertion,
noticed    by   M.  Lindelöf,    and which                I
                                               cannot but regard as un
scientific, to the effect that the Calculus of Variations fails to
give a solution of the problem above enunciated. Upon the
general principles of analytical calculation it may, on the con
trary, be asserted that, if there be in rerum naturd a quantitative
maximum or minimum, there must be appropriate rules by which
 its amount may             be
                            calculated either exactly        approximately.  or
We may fail          our knowledge
                      in                  the rules; but calculation can
                                                    of
 not    besaid      fail. This
                   to             general  remark may          illustrated       be                     by
 the  following    example.

198         Prof. Challis on the Principle of Discontinuity in
This equation, containing only p and constants, shows that the
brachystochronous course is rectilinear; and with this result
nautical practice agrees.   Also it is to be remarked that the case
in which the wind blows directly from A' to B', in which case
the straight line joining these points is plainly a minimum or
maximum course whatever be the function f(p”), must be                                                in
cluded in the general investigation.      Hence it follows that the
equation is satisfied if p=0, and consequently that C-0. Thus
after getting rid of the factor p, we shall have
                      f(p”)—2(1+p°)f(p)=0.
As this result is of the form k(p)=0, and is therefore equally
satisfied by positive and negative values of p, it is the differen
tial equation of an even number of straight lines which, taken in
pairs, make supplementary angles with the axis of w.           The
values of the angles are deducible from the equation above, if
the form of f(p”) be explicitly given.   It thus appears that ana
lysis indicates, respecting the brachystochronous course, that it
consists of not fewer than two straight lines.    But we have also
to satisfy the condition that the course passes through the given
points Al and B.      Now this Inay be done by means of two such
lines inclined at  supplementary  angles to the axis of  the ship's                   ar,
course being along one               up

and  subsequently    along the other. This result also            accord is               in
ance with practical sailing.               Ifobjected that the course,

The equation obtained by equating to zero the factor in brackets,
which alone gives a value of p depending on the function f(p”),
is identical with that deduced by the Calculus of Wariations.
This instance may suffice to show that the processes of the Cal
culus of Wariations embrace solutions in which the principle of
discontinuity is involved.     Although, in the solution of the
problem mentioned at the beginning of these remarks, the dis
continuity enters in a different manner from that exhibited above,
the foregoing reasoning may, I think, be accepted as evidence
that no antecedent objection lies against a solution on the
ground that it involves discontinuity.      proceed now to con I
sider further the question of discontinuity with reference to the
other problem.
   For this instance, the Calculus of Wariations gives, as is
known, the differential equation
                           2ay—(b–y") V1+p”=0,
a and b being arbitrary constants.     This equation, if it could be
exactly integrated, would give a relation between a and y invol

ving three constants,         which would

XXIX.      On the Application of the Theorem of the Equivalence of
     Transformations to the Internal Work of a mass of Matter. By
     Professor R. CLAUSIUs.
                          {[Concluded     from p. 97.]

         WB will     now investigate the manner in which, from
               equation (II.), it is possible to arrive at the equa
tion (I.) previously given in § 1, which equation must apply,

ciated, to every reversible circular process.
   When successive alterations of condition constitute a circular
process, the disgregation of the body is the same at the end of the
operation as it was at the beginning, and hence the following
equation must hold good:—
                                  <U+017F> dZ - 0.      -       -       -        -        -        -       -    (l 5)

 In order     that this equation may accord with equation                              (I.), namely,
 the following equation must be applicable to every reversible                                            cir
 cular process:–
                                    dPI

    It is this equation which leads to the consequences referred to
 in the introduction as at variance with commonly received views.
 It can, in fact, be proved that, in order that this equation may
 be true, it is at once necessary and sufficient to assume the fol
 lowing theorem:—
    The quantity of heat actually present in a body depends only on
  its   temperature,    and not    on   the arrangement                       of       its      component
 particles.

fices for equation                         for if H is a function of the temperature
only, the differential expression                                  takes the form                 f(T)dT, in
which f(T) is obviously a real function which can have but one
meaning, and the integral of this expression must plainly be
equal to nothing if the initial and final values of T are the same.
   The necessity of this theorem may be demonstrated thus.
   In order to be able to refer the alterations of condition to
alterations of certain magnitudes, we will assume that the manner
in which the body changes        condition       its

 is for supposing it to remain constant within the same state of
 aggregation.     Within one and the same state of aggregation,
 e.g. within the solid state, alterations in the arrangement of the
 molecules occur, which, though without doubt less considerable,
 are still essentially of the same kind as the alterations which
 accompany the passage from one state of aggregation to another;
 and it therefore seems to me that there is something arbitrary
 in denying for the smaller alterations what is admitted in respect
 to the greater.    On this point   I  cannot agree with the way in
 which the talented English mathematician treats the subject;
 but, relying simply on the theorem established by myself in
 relation to the working force of heat, it appears to me that only
 one of the following cases can be possible. Either this theorem
 is correct, in which case the true specific heat remains the same,
 not only for the same state of aggregation, but for the different
 states of aggregation, or the theorem is not correct, and in this
case we have no definite knowledge whatever concerning the
 true specific heat, and it may equally well be variable within
the same state of aggregation as in different states of aggre
gation.
          I
    § 9. believe, indeed, that we must extend the application of
this theorem, supposing it to be correct, still further, and espe
cially to chemical combinations and decompositions.
    The separation of chemically combined substances is likewise
an increase of the disgregation, and the chemical combination of
previously isolated substances is a diminution of their disgrega
tion; and consequently these processes may be brought under
considerations of the same class as the formation or precipitation
of vapour. That in this case also the effect of heat is to increase
the disgregation, results from many well-known phenomena,
many compounds being decomposible by heat into their consti
tuents—as, for example, mercuric oxide, and, at a very high
temperature, even water. To this it might perhaps be objected
that, in other cases, the effect of increased temperature is to
favour the union of two substances—that, for instance, hydrogen
and oxygen do not combine at low temperatures, but do so
easily at higher temperatures.     I  believe, however, that the heat
exerts here    only a secondary   influence,   contributing to bring
the atoms into such relative positions that their inherent forces,
by virtue of which they strive to unite, are able to come into
operation.     Heat itself can never, in my opinion, tend to pro
duce combination, but only, and in every case, decomposition.
    Another circumstance which renders the consideration of this
case more difficult is this, that the conclusions we have been
accustomed to draw always imply that the alterations in ques
tion can take place in a constant and reversible manner; this,

206                     Prof. Clausius on the Internal Work
however, is not usually the case under the circumstances which
accompany our chemical operations.              Nevertheless cases do
occur in which this condition is fulfilled, especially in the chemi
cal changes brought about by the action of electric force.            The
galvanic current affords us a simple means of causing combina
tion or decomposition; and in this case the cell in which the
chemical change takes place itself forms a galvanic element, the
electromotive force of which either contributes to intensify the
current, or has to be overcome by other electromotive force; so
that in the one case there is a production, and in the other a
consumption of work.

   Similarly, believe that we could in               cases,     producing all                   by
or expending work, cause the combination               separation     sub        or                       of

    If heat is to be transformed into work, which is a negative
transformation, a positive alteration of disgregation must take
place at the same time, which cannot be smaller in amount than
that determinate magnitude which we regard as equivalent. In
the positive transformation of work into heat, on the other hand,
the state of things is different.  If the force of heat is overcome
by opposed forces, so that a negative change of disgregation is
brought about, we know that in this case the overcoming forces
may be greater than is required to produce the particular result.
The excess of force may then give rise to motions of considerable
velocity in the particles of the body under consideration, and
these motions may subsequently be changed into the molecular
motions which we call heat, so that in the end more work comes to
be transformed into heat than corresponds to the negative change
of disgregation brought about. In many operations, especially
in friction, the transformation of work into heat may take place
even quite independently of any simultaneous negative trans
formation.
   The relation in which the third kind of transformation, namely
alteration of disgregation, stands to considerations of this nature,
is implied in what has been already said. The positive altera
tion of disgregation may indeed be greater, but cannot be smaller,
than the accompanying transformation of heat into work; and
the negative alteration of disgregation may be smaller, but can
not be greater, than the transformation of work into heat.
    Finally, in so far as regards the second kind of transformation,
or the passage of heat between bodies of different temperatures,
I  have thought myself justified in assuming as a fundamental
proposition what, according to             all

that the alteration takes place            in

would algebraically have to be stated as higher.                                                 Instead        of
equation (2), we must therefore write
                                    az-*.                       .     .      .    .        .     .   .        (2a)
Applying this to equation (1), we obtain, instead of equation (5),
                                    d() + d H

   The further question now arises, what influence would it have
on the formulae, if a direct passage of heat took place between
parts of different temperature within the body in question.
   In case the body is not of uniform temperature throughout,
the differential expression occurring in equation (5a) must not
be referred to the entire body, but only to a portion whose tem
perature may be considered as the same throughout; so that if the
temperature of the body varies continuously, the number of parts
must be assumed as infinite. In integrating, the expressions which
apply to the separate parts may be united again to a single ex
pression for the whole body, by extending the integral, not only
to the alterations of one part, but to the alterations of    the parts.                        all
of In
    forming this integral, we must now have regard         the passage                 to
   heat  taking  place between the different   parts.

                                                                is                              of
which the body under consideration gives           to,   absorbs from,    up          or
 an  external body which serves only            reservoir
                                                            as

that this element does not come into       question    now that we are
discussing the passage      heat between the different parts
                                    of                              the                                  of

quantity     heat dFI leaves one part

differential expression occurring in (5a) undergoes, on account
of this transfer of heat, can therefore only consist in the addition
of a positive quantity to the value which would else have been
obtained.    But since, as results from equation (5a), the first
value which would be obtained, without taking this direct trans
fer of heat into consideration, cannot be less than nothing, this
can still less be the case when it has been increased by another
positive quantity.

The mercury being brought to the level 2 of the tube a b under
the pressure of the atmosphere H, a thermometer placed at the
side of a bindicating the temperature t, the tube No. 1 of the
barometric system is fitted on the manometer. This tube is
surrounded by melting ice; mercury is allowed to flow out by the
stopcock to expand conveniently the air of the space v; it is
thus seen whether the junction is tight; lastly, the stopcock of
the tube No. 1 is opened.    By pouring mercury into the mano
meter the level is brought to 2, and the difference h of the two
mercurial columns is measured.    The elastic force of the air in
the apparatus is              H-h.

    never give certain indications.  Their scales are continually dis
    placed by the same causes which determine the displacement of
    zero for the mercurial thermometer; but the displacement of
    zero, which does not exceed a few tenths of a degree in the mer
    curial thermometer, may reach several degrees in the metallic
    thermometer.

    know the law which the temperature follows in the various atmo

    IT      is only in recent times that explanations based upon actual
           experiments have been given of the colour of water in the sea,
    in lakes, and in rivers; it was previously thought sufficient to
    conceal the entire ignorance of a daily-observed phenomenon
    by hypothesis.        Bunsent was the first to state, and establish
    experimentally, the simple proposition that “chemically pure
    water is not, as commonly assumed, colourless, but naturally
^   possesses a blue colour.”          He observed this coloration on
    looking at a piece of white porcelain through a column of water
     two yards long.       He explained the brown to black coloration
     of   many    waters,  especially of North German inland lakes, as
     arising from an admixture of humus; the green colour of the
                                                of so,
     Swiss lakes, and, still more        the siliceous springs    Iceland,    of
     as   arising from the colour         the yellowish  base, and     the             of
     siliceous sinter surrounding the springs, and which            caused

     chemical  investigations,  has  quite  recently   shown that the green
     colour also derives            its
                               origin from organic admixtures. Accord

organic substance in the form of humic acid.      If a water does
not contain much humic     acid, this is not caused by a want of
humic acid in the  ground,  but by the fact that this ground did
not give to the water an adequate quantity of alkaline solvent
material.
      From these results we may consider the question settled as
to why, on chemical principles, some waters are blue, others
green, and others brown.    I may be permitted to make a few
remarks on some  physical phenomena which have been observed
on coloured waters.
   Formerly water was almost universally classed among those
bodies which have a different colour in transmitted, to that
which they have in reflected light. Newton says *, “water re
flects the violet, blue, and green rays, but readily transmits the
red.” Count Xavier de Maistret considers the colour of water
to be blue in reflected, and yellowish orange in transmitted
light. Aragof, that it is blue in reflected, and green in trans
mitted light. The view that the blue of water only occurs in
reflected light is common to                           all
                                          three statements.
      In the  experiments       which Bunsen made                  ascertain the            to
colour       distilled water, transmitted light was alone concerned,
             of
and yet             he
                found the colour blue.                order        look through

     other, and correspond to the different numbers of reflexioms. In
     making some experiments,        I had, at first, so placed the mirrors
     that the uncovered glass surfaces were opposite each other. The
     light must then, at each reflexion, pass twice through the glass
<U+017F>º   plates themselves.      If the liqad contained no liquid, then the
   Timage appeared almost white after six to eight reflexions; but
     still, on comparing the subjective images with one another, it
     could be seen that each following one had a somewhat yellowish
     tint. I supposed that this coloration was to be ascribed to the
     tolerably thick layer of glass which the light had to traverse,
     and therefore turned the mirrors, which were once more
     polished on the silvered side.        Yet even in this case each fol
     lowing image showed a yellower colour, though in a less degree.
     The colour must therefore be ascribed to the special colour of
     the silver, from which part of the light is reflected diffusely.
     Yet when the polish is good, it is so unimportant that it does
     not disturb further observation.
         If  the box is half filled with distilled water and the entire slit
     d   illuminated,   the lower part of the picture on the receiving
      plate is seen to be blue, while the upper part remains white.
     Looking through the slit d' at the upper part of the box, the
     entire range of more and more yellowish pictures is seen; look
     ing through the lower part, each following picture appears of a
     darker blue, with a very feeble tinge of green. The phenomenon
     is just the same when water from the deep blue Achensee is
     poured into the vessel; if this is replaced by water from the
     Tegernsee, after a few reflexions the images appear of an intense
   … yellowish green (not bluish green), although my box was only
     10 inches long.      If garden earth is drenched with water, which
     is allowed to drain off, and this is filtered and mixed, first in
     small and then in larger quantities, with distilled water, the
     colour of the images passes first into yellowish green and then
     steadily into a brown colour, just as was to be expected from
     Wittstein's experiments. The colours in question in these ex
     periments are also those in transmitted light.
         What, then, are the phenomena which have evoked the idea
      of the dual colour of water ?
         Newton based his view upon an experiment of Halley. As the
     latter, on a sunny day, had descended in a diving-bell to a
     great depth in the water, the upper surface of his hand, which
     was directly illuminated through the sea-water and through a
     window in the bell, appeared of a rose-red, but the water below
     him and the under surface of his hand, which was illuminated
     by the rays reflected from the lower water, was green. The expe
     riment is manifestly erroneously interpreted.          The rays which
     came from below are     clearly  not reflected by the water, but trans

water, especially from the sea-bottom.                The further distant this

colour   of  water, but      tomuch smaller extent, because the layer

     courses      it has traversed great distances, it is blue. It also ap

           Ispoke just now of the reddish-yellow colour in the almost
           places which has been noticed by so many observers.               This
      colour   depends   entirely  on the nature of the         ground.     Most
      frequently it consists of whitish sand, or whitish pebbles.               If
      these were absolutely white, if they reflected colours in a diffused
      manner to the same extent, the reddish colour would not occur.
      A new porous clay-cell of a Grove's battery may appear quite
      white, while, when it is moistened with water, it is of a rusty yellow
      or flesh-red colour. Hence                              its
                                            surface acquires the property                                                of
      reflecting red light           preponderating extent.

      substances    which constitute the sea-bottom have the same
      property, the bottom will appear red             those parts      whichin                            in

      the returning rays are again partially absorbed                 the water,                      by
      and thus the red colour           continually disappearing, although

  A   hollow prism made of glass plates is so brought under
water that the horizontal light from the surface is totally re
flected from the hypothenuse.        Instead of this apparatus,
Poggendorff's proposed a glass mirror inclined at 45° to the
horizon.    I happened to have occasion to make a corresponding
experiment;          I
                wanted to fill a tinplate tube, which was closed
at the ends with glass plates and had a hole in the side, b
placing it in a very inclined position quite under the sea-level.
When the upper glass plate had the right inclination, in the
Tegernsee it reflected in sunny weather an emerald-green light
more intense than I have obtained in any other way; in the
Achensee, however, a blue light, as if it had passed through
concentrated solution of sulphate of copper. Hence Arago's
proposal is appropriate; and if he had had an opportunity of
carrying it out, he would certainly have given up the notion
 that water shows different colours in reflected and in trans
mitted light.

   I permit myself a remark as to the place in which the green
colour of water arises.    The Tegernsee receives     water                                         its                b

are the most considerable.    After lengthened dry weather, the
bed      of
        the Weissach      quite empty; the pebbles which cover
                                            is
                  quite dry,
                                                                                                                       to of

THE“On   the Heat which is developed at the                          Poles      of a Woltaic
Battery during the passage of Luminous Discharges in Air and in
Vacuo.”     By John P. Gassiot, F.R.S.
   1. When the wires attached to the terminal plates of an extended
series of a voltaic battery are brought into contact with each other,
the circuit of the battery is completed; and if in this state the ends
of the wires are separated from each other, the usual luminous
or arc-discharge is produced, the length of the arc depending on
the number of the cells of which the battery consists. If this lumi
nous discharge is continued for a few seconds, the metallic positive
pole or anode becomes red-hot, and will ultimately be fused, while
the negative remains comparatively cool.       This experiment was ori
ginally described by me in the “Philosophical Magazine’ of Decem
ber 1838, p. 436.     In the same periodical of June 1840, p. 478, Mr.
Grove suggested as an explanation, that this effect “might be due
to the interposed medium, and that, were there any analogy between
the state assumed by voltaic electrodes in elastic media and that
which they assumed in electrolytes, it would follow that the chemical
action in the positive electrode in atmospheric air would be more
violent than at the negative, and that, if the chemical action were more
violent, the heat would necessarily be more intense.”
    2. Since that time I am not aware that any other explanation rela
tive to the heating of the positive pole of the voltaic battery has
been published.     Mr. Grove merely gives it as a suggestion; but as
it is immaterial whether either or both poles are of copper, alumi
nium, platinum, or any other metal, or of coke, as in either case it is
the positive that is heated, the phenomenon cannot arise from any
effect of oxidation, but must be due to some action in the battery
circuit hitherto unexplained.
    3. In the Bakerian Lecture for 1858, I have stated that, “when
the discharge from an induction coil is taken in                    air
                                                                 vacuo with
                                                                          or   in
 thin  platinum  wires, the   negative terminal becomes     red-hot,  and                  if
 the discharges are continued the wire will               be
                                                   fused.” This heating
of   the negative terminal, provided the wires are thin, always takes
 place whatever may    be   the length     the discharge
                                            of                 the medium or
 through which  it  passes.
   4.   That this heating   ofthe negative terminal     the discharge from
                                                               in
 an  induction coil had some intimate relation         the heating
                                                               to        the          of
 positive pole of  the voltaic battery was very     probable;   but why                    in
 the one case the heat should        be
                                     evolved    the negative, and
                                                     at                  the          in
 other   at  the positive terminal, appeared extraordinary and well.

226                        Royal Society : —
worth further investigation. The result of the experiments        Ihave
made with this object forms the subject of the present communication.
   5. After verifying the fact that the heating of the negative terminal
of an induction coil is always obtained either in a carbonic acid va
cuum, in rarefied gases, or in air, provided the terminal wire is thin,
but not if thick, I proceeded to examine with greater precision than
formerly the nature and character of the luminous discharges in vacuo
as obtained from my water-battery, as well as from the 400 insulated
cells of the nitric-acid battery (Phil. Mag. S. 4. vol.xx. p. 540); and
for this object I had several small vacuum-tubes constructed, about
3 inches long and 1 inch diameter; in each of these, two metallic or
carbon balls, about 4 of an inch in diameter, were attached to the pla
tinum wires, hermetically sealed in the tube about one inch apart.

                                 Fig.   1.
Each wire is protected by a glass tube as far as the ball; the vacuum
is obtained by means of carbonic acid absorbed by caustic potassa, as
described in my former communications.
   6. The discharges in these tubes from an induction coil or from my
water-battery present nearly the same appearance, viz. a brilliant
luminosity surrounding the negative ball, generally without (fig. 2),
but sometimes with (fig. 3) a minute stratified discharge from the
positive.

   7. When the vacuum-tube is introduced into the circuit of 400 in
sulated cells of the nitric-acid battery, the discharge at first always
assumes the form represented in fig. 2. This discharge, as well as those
from the induction coil and the water-battery, when examined, is found
to be very perceptibly intermittent, and will generally continue for some
time after the circuit has been completed.      As the action of the bat
tery improves, the luminous glow round the negative metallic ball
gradually increases in size, and in a few seconds the ball becomes
red-hot.   This result I repeatedly obtained; and in two instances
with tubes in which balls of aluminium, 4 inch diameter, had been
                                Fig. 4.
inserted, the negative dropped from the wire into the tube in a molten
state, but leaving the positive ball with    its
                                            original metallic lustre.

   8. The preceding experiments, so far from assisting me in explain
ing the cause of the heating of the positive pole of the voltaic battery,
rather tended to complicate the inquiry; for experiment now showed
that in carbonic acid vacua the heating effect was elicited at the nega
tive pole, whether the discharge was made from a voltaic battery or
form an induction coil; but as experiment also showed that heat is
always evolved from the latter at the negative, whether in air or in
vacuo, and that from the battery it always in air appears at the posi
tive, it was evident the media through which discharges were made
afforded no explanation for the elucidation of a phenomenon of which
hitherto the more it was examined by experiment the more difficult
appeared the solution.
   9. My next experiments were made in vacuum-tubes in which balls
of carbon were inserted in lieu of metal. With these I at first obtained
the usual heating of the negative, but in one instance           I
                                                          observed that
both balls were at the same time exhibiting red heat; in this instance,
either from some alteration having taken place in the vacuum, or from
some other cause which I had not time to examine, the discharge from
the carbon balls became so uncertain as to afford me little information
worth recording, except as to the fact         I
                                            have stated of both balls
                                  I
being heated : the cause of this was subsequently enabled to deter
Inline.
       In two of the vacuum-tubes hollow brass balls had been at
     10.
tached to the platinum wires. In the first of these the negative very
soon became heated by the discharge. As the discharge of the battery
continued, a sudden flash of light was visible in the vacuum, and the
glass instantly became coated with metal. On examining the tube,                    I
ascertained that one-half of the negative ball was separated from the
other, and partly fused : the intense heat had vaporized the silver
with which the two hemispheres forming the ball had been soldered,
and it was this vaporized metal that was deposited on the sides of
the tube. The positive ball remained much tarnished, as if it had also
been heated.
   11. I then introduced the second tube, having similar hollow
brass balls, into the circuit of the battery. In this tube the negative
also was at first heated to redness; when in this state, a sudden bril
liant stratified discharge took place, as fig. 5.
                                 Fig. 5.
   The evolution of nitrous acid fumes in the battery denoted      in        its
tense action. This discharge from the battery continued for about two
seconds, the negative ball instantly losing        its   luminosity, the positive
becoming red-hot.
   12. This experiment appeared       to           an

battery circuit;         this also obtained the usual luminous negative

                this experiment          will     observed that the circuit

                       far differs from that
 the  discharge       the latter will remain for several weeks (or until the

             On the Transit-velocity    of Earthquake-waves.         229
water in some of the cells has evaporated) of nearly the same form
and appearance (figs. 2 or 3), the discharge from the nitric-acid
battery quickly alters: as the action of the battery improves, the glow
round the negative terminal enlarges, heat in that portion of the tube
is sensibly developed, as can be ascertained by touching the tube with
the hand, and in a few seconds the negative ball becomes red-hot.
During this time no apparent sign of chemical action takes place in
the cells of the battery; the heating effect appears to be mainly due
to the elevation of tension; for if the copper wires attached to the ter
minals rest on gold-leaf electroscopes, the leaves continue expanded
until the arc discharge takes place, when they instantly collapse, and
heat is evolved at the positive terminal.
    17. In vacuo, as long as the intermittent discharge continues, resist
ance apparently takes place at the negative terminal; and this is not
 only evinced by the heat which is evolved, but by the disruption of
 the metal which is separated from this pole in minute particles, and
 deposited in a lateral direction on the sides of the vacuum-tube.
     18. As soon as the action of the battery becomes sufficiently
 energetic, so as to cause the continuous or arc discharge to pass, an
 entirely new effect is developed: the discharge itself becomes intensely
 vivid, the stratifications assume a conical form with their apex di
 rected towards the negative (fig. 5), and heat is instantly perceptible
 at the positive terminal, while the negative as instantly cools.
     19. It is beautiful and interesting to observe the suddenness with
 which the red heat of the negative terminal ball disappears, and the
 equal suddenness with which the heat is at the same instant elicited
 in the positive, when the brilliant arc discharge takes place.
    From the results obtained by these experiments,      I infer that the
  development of heat, either at the positive or the negative pole of a
 voltaic battery, is entirely due to the amount      of  resistance which
  takes place in that part of the battery circuit.

    These experiments were made by the author at the joint request
  of the Royal Society and of the British Association for the Advance
  ment  of Science, aided by grants from each of those bodies.
     Their object was to ascertain the transit rate or velocity of pro
 pagation of waves of elastic compression, analogous to those of na
 tural earthquakes, through the stratified and highly convoluted, lami
 nated, and shattered slate and quartz rocks of the neighbourhood of
 Holyhead, where the recurrent explosion of very large mines of gun
 powder in the Government quarries (for the obtaining of rock for
 construction of the Asylum Harbour) afforded a valuable opportu

mity in the production                          of the requisite impulses for generation of the
Wave.
   The author had previously determined experimentally (at Killiney
Bay, in Ireland) the transit velocity of such waves in wet sand, and
in highly-shattered and more solid granite ; media presenting, pro
bably, the extremes of slowness and of fastness of wave transit. It
was still desirable to determine this for rock, not only minutely
crystalline, but also stratified, convoluted, and generally highly per
plexed and heterogeneous in internal structure.        The instrumental
means    employed  were generally  similar to those  adopted  previously
at  Killiney  Bay,  with suitable modifications    consequent  upon the
great charges of powder fired, which at these quarries have reached
as much as nine tons at a single blast or mine.         The seismoscope
(see Trans. Brit. Assoc.   1851,   Second   Report  on Facts of Earth
quakes, R. Mallet, p. 277, &c.) was placed upon a levelled table
of solid rock at a suitable station (shown on the map and sections
that accompany the paper), and with it the chronograph and gal
vanic apparatus, by which, on making contact, by the author's
pressing his hand upon the lever of the latter instrument, the mine

   One very remarkable result is at once apparent on inspecting this
table—viz. that the transit rate tends to increase in velocity with the
increased quantity of powder fired; in other words, that the loss of
velocity in the same rock is less in some proportion as the force of
the originating impulse is greater, and so                                    be its
                                                 amplitude greater                                                        at

     Experiment No.                1    forms the only apparent exception, and even
there the departure                is   not large.
   This fact, now for                   the first time (so far                as   the author knows) ex
perimentally proved,                    appears remarkably                in        coincidence with the
theoretical researches                  of Mr. Earnshaw.

   The wave transit in these experiments was made partly in slate
rocks and partly in quartz formations, which, though lithologically
and geologically distinct, are nearly identical in wave propagative
power (as this author has shown by a train of special experiments
at the conclusion of the paper), differing not more than in the ratio
of 0.576 for the slate to 0-558 for the quartz. The author concludes
by pointing out several deductions having interest to general physics,
and some      of the special relations of the results to Seismology                                               and
Physical Geology.

in addition to the details of the results which have already been
briefly mentioned in the Philosophical Magazine, S. 4. vol. xxii. p.

   Although the rate of burning of candles and other similar com
bustibles, whose flames depend upon the volatilization and ignition
of combustible matter in contact with atmospheric air, is not per
ceptibly affected by the pressure of the supporting medium, yet this
is not true of       all
                    combustibles.    The rate       burning    self-support  of                of

                                                shells, depends essentially
upon the pressure                of
                          the medium          which they are deflagrated.

  On the Influence              of Atmospheric Pressure                       upon Combustion.                       233
   There are here evident indications of the rate of retardation being
somewhat greater at low than at comparatively high pressures; but,
neglecting these indications, the above numbers give 1.043 second
as the average retardation in a six-inch or thirty-seconds fuse for
each inch of mercurial pressure removed. This result agrees closely
with that obtained by Quartermaster Mitchell, if we except those
fuses which he burnt at the greatest altitude; and in reference to
which some error must obviously have crept             The following                    in.

   In tracing the cause of this variation of light under different
atmospheric pressures, the author calls attention to the conditions
upon which the light of ordinary flames depends. He shows that it
is derived almost exclusively from the separation of carbon particles
within the flame, and that it is increased by the augmentation of the
amount of carbon thus precipitated, and by an increased temperature
in the flame; whilst it is diminished by the separation of less carbon
and by a reduction of temperature. . The temperature of flame is
not materially altered by the rarefaction of the supporting medium;
and hence the loss of light cannot arise from a reduction of tempera
ture. On the other hand, the separation of carbon particles is
greatly augmented by increased pressure; thus candles evolve much
smoke when burnt under a pressure of two atmospheres; whilst even
a small alcohol flame, which burns with a pure blue light at ordinar
pressures, becomes highly luminous in                                      air
                                                          four times compressed.
Flames which smoke               ordinary pressures become smokeless
                                            at                                                              in
rarefied air, and undergo more complete combustion. Whilst, there

   “On Liquid Transpiration in                        relation to Chemical                Composition.”
By Thomas Graham, Esq., W.P.R.S, Master of the Mint.
  In accordance with the analogy of the transpiration of gases, the
 passage of liquids under pressure through a capillary tube is spoken
 of as liquid transpiration.      The subject owes the development which
 it has already attained chiefly to the investigations of M. Poiseuille.
 The precision of the mode of experimenting pursued by that phy
 sicist has been remarked on by every one who has engaged in the
 inquiry.     The same method was accordingly adopted with little
  variation in the present investigation.
    The isolated observation made by M. Poiseuille, that alcohol di
 luted to different degrees is most retarded in passing through a ca
 pillary tube at that degree of dilution where the greatest condensa
 tion of the mixed liquids occurs, was understood by the author as
 indicating that the definite hydrate of alcohol containing six equiva
 lents of water (or three equivalents of water with the formula of
alcohol taken as C, H, O,), was the most retarded in transpiration.
The rate of transpiration appeared here to depend upon chemical
composition, and to afford an indication of                  new physical pro
                                                                            it.   A
perty may thus become available, like the boiling-point and others,
for fixing the chemical constitution                          of
                                              substances. The same feature
was recognized        methylic alcohol, although the six-hydrate here
                     in                                                                              is
not remarkable for condensation           volume; and the inquiry was then
                                                      of
extended   to  the  hydrated  acids,   and     other substances. The results

colarctus (Koala) a similar form of ramus obtains; and that the
coronoid and condyle of the Aye-Aye are not unlike those of Plagi
aulaar, whilst in existing predaceous Marsupials the condyle has a
different form. The author is altogether confirmed in his opinion
that Plagiaulaw was essentially a phytophagous marsupial.

anchor ice, are found to accumulate with astonishing rapidity. These
accumulations of ice, by damming up the water, cause great floods,
and by yielding to the force of the water, and moving down with
the current, especially after they have become jammed and heaped up
with other ice formed on the surface, act in producing very striking
geological effects in disturbing the bottom and banks of the river,
and in shoving along huge boulders which otherwise would remain
immoveable.     The ground- and surface-ice, also, by their shoving
action, introduce formidable difficulties and dangers in the construc
tion of bridges or other engineering works requiring to be founded
on the beds of rivers in cold climates.      In the construction of the
Great Victoria   Bridge   across the St. Lawrence at Montreal (the most
costly bridge which has ever been executed), these difficulties have
been successfully overcome, and a structure has been raised which is
likely to stand secure against the much-dreaded forces of the ice. On
account of the tendency both of water approaching to the freezing
point and of ice to float, it has long been regarded as rather a singular
circumstance that ice should ever be found growing at the bottom
of a river. From among the many suggestions which have been
offered at various times to account more or less completely for the
phenomenon, the author sets out by accepting as quite correct the
view that the essential difference between the circumstances of the
                                                     of is,

would not favour the occurrence of freezing of new ice there rather
than at the top, but that, on the contrary, if effects on the tendency
to crystallization are to be sought for in such a slight cause, it should
rather be taken that the greater fluid friction at the bottom, and the
heavier pressure there, are causes slightly, but certainly very slightly,
tending to oppose the freezing of new ice at the bottom.
   Mr. Hodges, the engineer of the contractors for the great bridge
across the St. Lawrence at Montreal, in his large and valuable work
recently published (in 1860) on the construction of that bridge, de
scribes the ice-phenomena of the St. Lawrence, which he had been
obliged during many years to watch and inquire into with anxious
care; and in respect to the origin of the ground-ice, he supposes
that the water in passing down rapids may become aérated by the
rapidity of the current, and that particles or globules of cold air,
being whirled by the eddies till they come in contact with the
rocky bed of the river, attach themselves to         and there give out             it,
cold which   they have  brought  with them from the very cold atmo
sphere above,      and                         so

           ON    THE CALM LINES OFTEN SEEN ON A RIPPLED SEA.
                       BY PROFESSOR: JAMES THOMSON.
     In thispaper the object of the author was to offer a new explana
tion of the origin of lines of glassy-calm water, usually long and
sinuous, which are often to be seen extending over the surface of a
sea darkened elsewhere by a ripple. He adverted to the commonly
received supposition that these lines are due to some kind of oily
film on the surface of the water, and to the prevalent idea that the
 heoil
       somehow given off from shoals
          is                                                           of
                                              fishes. These suppositions,
    thought, although having some slight foundation               the facts                              in               of
the   case,  did not form the true      explanation       the  phenomenon.               of
His brother, Professor William Thomson, had observed, and had

meeting currents.    The author does not mean to attribute the calm
lines in general to the spreading of a sheet of fresh water over the
salt water of the sea, but he thinks the general explanation is readily
developed from the observations and explanation in the foregoing
particular case.   He supposes in general that in estuaries and chan
nels of the sea,  and in lakes and rivers, the water must often be
affected by various causes, such as tides, breezes, currents, and cir
culation due to differences of heat, so as to be made to rise occasion
ally at some places and to sink at others.             Now along the line of
meeting and sinking of two opposing surface currents,                    floating             all
objects carried               by

of the two   opposing      currents will suffice        account for the great

XXXIV.      On some Properties of the Induced Current.      By Dr.
   P. L. RIJKE, Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University
   of Leyden”.
1.      HE    mode in which an inducing current is broken,
           exercises, as is known, a considerable influence on
the striking distance of the induced current.     Although in most
cases we could not account for every increase or decrease in length
which the induction spark undergoes when we use a given mode
of breaking contact, yet some results have appeared capable of
being reduced to a general principle; and thus the experiments
of MM. Fizeau and Poggendorff have shown that everything
which tends to diminish the electric density at the place where
the circuit is broken, exerts a favourable influence on the length
of the spark of the induced current.
   In referring to the principle to which we have just alluded a
fact known for some time (the instantaneous loss of electricity
which every conductor undergoes when placed in contact with a
flame), I have been led to think that it would be possible to
increase the striking distance of an induced current, by effecting
the interruption of the inducing current in the middle of a flame.
   2. The experiments which I am about to describe have con
firmed these anticipations.
   The rupture always took place between platinum wires termi
nated in the form of a ring, which were made to slide rapidly
one along the other. Of course these wires, which were held in
the hand, were insulated sufficiently to prevent the extra current
from passing through the arms of the operator.      The ends of the
induced wire were connected with a spark-micrometer.            The
spark passed between two copper knobs, each 16.6 millims, in

a gas, a Bunsen’s lamp was used.        In these experiments the
lower orifices of the lamp were closed, so that there was not a

  8. We found that when the circuit was broken in nitrogen,
the greatest striking distances were the following:—
                                                        17.5

The gas issued from the gas-holder under various pressures.
The greatest pressure having coincided with the greatest striking
distance, I was led to inquire if this increase in the length of the
spark arose simply from an accidental cause, or if it must be
admitted that a certain degree of velocity imparted to the gaseous
molecules exerted a favourable influence on the length of the
spark.        I
            undertook some experiments to settle this question.
              I
At first found that sparks were obtained which had virtually
the same length whether the rupture took place in air at rest,
or in a current escaping from a Pepys's gas-holder. The case
was different when the rupture took place in a soufflet d’enfer.
By raising the air in this apparatus to         greatest pressure,       its                                  in
other  words,   giving                            its

                                         to                                                                  I

I worked    with ordinary rain-water, the jet was produced by a
pressure of about 10.5 millims. The electrodes were the same
knobs of copper as those used in the preceding experiment.
   10. It has been sufficiently established by many physicists,
that when an induced current is passed through the wire of a
multiplier, the deflection obtained is quite independent of the
mode in which the interruption is effected.      It is simply neces
sary that the rupture takes place in a space of time very short
compared with an oscillation of the magnetic needle. It has been
concluded that the quantity of electricity which the interruption
of the primary current sets in motion in the induced wire remains
the same, whatever be the manner in which the rupture is made,
for example in the middle of a flame.     Does not this increase of
the striking  distance appear to prove that, when the rupture takes
place under these conditions, what is called the electromotive
force of the induced wire experiences a more or less considerable
increase? There is always the same quantity of electricity; it
simply takes less time to traverse the circuit.     But if this is the
case, it follows that, when the multiplier is replaced by a Weber's
electrodynamic dynamometer, the deviation of this instrument
must increase.     In fact this instrument only differs from an
ordinary galvanometer in having the magnet replaced by a
moveable    helix suspended in the interior of the multiplier by
two wires  very  near each other. The apparatus being so arranged
that the current traverses successively the multiplier and the
helix, it follows that the action exerted by the multiplier on the
helix will be proportional to the square of the intensity of the
current, and that, if the duration of this current is very small
as compared with that of an oscillation of the helix, the elonga
tion obtained will be proportional to the square of the intensity
of the current, and inversely as             its
                                        duration. Hence,    the same               if
quantity     ofelectricity traverses the dynamometer         different             in
spaces  of time, and while        lasts the intensity
                                   it                   each current         of
remains constant, the elongation observed (which           assume             I              to
 be very small) will        inversely
                             be                as
                                          the time which the current
will have taken          traversing the dynamometer, or,

nature to raise many doubts on this subject. I therefore resolved
to make some experiments to ascertain on what         could rely,          I
and   I foundthat the deviations of the dynamometer do not change
when the inducing current is broken between the poles of an electro
magnet.                -                         -
   12. We have seen on what considerations we depend when
we desire to prove that whatever tends to increase the striking
distance of the induced current, ought also to tend to increase
the deflection which this current produces in a dynamometer.
We know that by analogous reasonings it is thought to be shown
that the physiological effect of the induced current, as well as the
thermal action which it exerts on a metallic wire, ought both to
increase when the rupture of the inducing circuit is effected
under circumstances favourable to the increase of the striking
distance.    But having seen that the deflections of the dynamo
meter do not necessarily depend on the circumstances which
favour the striking distance of the induced current,         concluded         I
it was very possible that the physiological and thermal effects
were also independent, and that it was for experiment to decide.
    To investigate the physiological effect, I employed a small-sized
Ruhmkorff’s coil.        Although     I only used a single Daniell’s
element, yet to render the shock bearable it was necessary to
withdraw almost completely the bundle of iron wires.            But far
from the shock      becoming     stronger,  I found  constantly  that it
diminished in intensity when the rupture took place in a coal
gas flame.        I
                obtained the same results by working with another
and less    powerful   induction coil, and in which I could intro
duce a greater extent of bundle of iron wire.
    An electrical thermometer, constructed according to the plan
of M. Riess, served to compare the thermal effects which the
induced current produces when the rupture of the inducing
circuit takes place successively in       air                                               of

   13.       I
          ought especially, from the theoretical point of view, to
attach   importance   to knowing the kind of action which the
medium in which the rupture of the inducing circuit is made
exerts on the extra current.
   With this view I compared the physiological effect which the
extra current produces when the circuit is broken in air, to the
action which it exerts when the rupture takes place in the middle
of a flame. For this experiment used a plane spiral, consist   I
ing of a copper ribbon 130 metres long, 26 millims. wide, and
0.3 millim. in thickness.      Holding in each hand a mandril
connected with the two ends of the spiral, the shock was                                                      in
comparably stronger when contact was broken in a flame than
when it was broken in air.      I repeated this experiment with a
small-sized Ruhmkorff’s     apparatus,  and   again found that the            I
physiological effect produced by the extra current was stronger
when contact was broken in flame than it was when broken in air.
   To measure the action which the extra current exerts on the
                              I
dynamometer, used a method which depends upon the follow
ing theorem.    Suppose a system of six conductors united, as

ting as have described, the rupture of the primary current in
air, in a flame, and between the poles of an electro-magnet, always
gave rise to the same deflection of the moveable helia.

          described some years ago (Pogg. Ann. vol. lxxxi. p. 168,
Phil. Mag.  S. 3. vol. xix. p. 240), the increase in length which                                             in
duction sparks undergo when the primary current is broken be
tween the poles of an electro-magnet.        that, by analogous     I
considerations, an explanation might be given why the striking
distance of an induced current increases when the molecules of
the gas or of the liquid in which contact is broken are endowed
with a certain velocity.    In fact, when the circuit is opened, the
current is not    interrupted  so suddenly as is usually supposed.
At the  part  at which the circuit is broken, a more or less intense
voltaic arc is produced, which continues until the electrodes have
reached a certain distance.       It is clear that this arc, though
offering a more and more considerable resistance, allows the cur
rent to pass from one electrode to the other. It is also clear
that, if the gaseous or liquid molecules in which the voltaic arc
is formed are endowed with a certain velocity, they will commu
nicate part of their motion to the particles which constitute the
voltaic arc. It will follow that this arc will not remain so long,
and that therefore the velocity of the variation in the intensity
of the induced current will increase.              But the electromotive
force of the induced current, as well as            striking distance, are
                                                                         its
quite proportional        this  velocity
                                to            variation.   Thenof     certain                       a

264         Prof. Potter on some properties of the Air Thermometer.
culated by Poisson’s rule.    was,                       I
                                       believe, the first to point      I
out, in my paper in the Philosophical Magazine for September
1853, that there is a fundamental objection to the method, in
whatever form it is used, namely, that it is a dynamical experi
ment, and the dynamical result is neglected.    In the paper say,                                                      I
“ the effect of the momentum of the moving column of water in
the gauge in passing from one position of equilibrium to another
has been attributed to the effect of heat developed in the sudden
condensation.”
  It is clear that the discussion of the dynamical problem is
needed before we can judge of the thermometric results; and the
desirable  verification of Poisson’s formula which MM. Clement
and Desormes invented may turn out after                         nothing                      all      to    be
more than fudge verification, although universally adopted            our                                          in

     With        to my own experiments,
                respect                       have found a note     I
that the tube of the barometer-gauge  passed   to , inch below the
surface of the  mercury,  and that there was a depth of ‘85 inch
of mercury below it in the cistern; but the radius of the tube
of the gauge is not stated; and even if the value of the dynamical
adhesion of the mercury to the glass were known, the value of n
would remain unknown.
   The measures on which the calculations for the degree of cold
produced, from Amontons's formula, were made in my paper of
January 1862, were as follows:—
          a-2:01 in.,                                                                =li-59          ;

                           the mercury rose to

With b so small as     inch, the small extent of the oscillations
                                   #
here shown proves that the adhesion must have been much
greater than supposed in any of the preceding computations,
even if no cold arose from the rarefaction.
   The problem is evidently a dynamical one before it becomes a
thermometrical one; and if we apologize for the chemists who
invented or employed the experiment, what must we say for the
mathematicians who have accepted it as a purely thermometric
experiment?

    But in  these experiments my first source of heat stood at some
distance from the anterior end of the tube, and the heat, pre
viously to entering the latter, had to cross a space of air which
was not the subject of examination. This air-space       I  wished to
abolish, so as to allow the calorific rays to enter the gas with all
the qualities which they possessed at the moment of emission.
I  first thought of soldering the end of the experimental tube
direct to the radiating surface, thus allowing the air to come
into direct contact with the source.    But it immediately occurred
to me that the introduction of cool air into the tube would lower
the temperature of the source, and that I could never know how
far the indication of my galvanometer under such circumstances
could be regarded as a true effect of absorption; hence       I aban
doned the idea of bringing the gases into contact with the radia
ting surface.
    Instead of this arrangement an independent tube, 8 inches
long, and of the same diameter as the experimental tube, was
soldered on to the radiating plate.      By means of a screw joint,
the free end of this tube was connected air-tight with the expe
rimental tube. Thus a chamber, from which the air could be
removed, was introduced between the first plate of salt and the
radiating surface.     Two objects were thus secured: first, my
source of heat was withdrawn from the action of irregular cur
rents of air; and secondly, the radiant heat entered the tube
unchanged in quality save the infinitesimal change due to its
passage through the diathermic salt.
    Te save the trouble, and expense of a new Plate,        I will ask
permission to refer in this memoir to the Plate (Pl.   III. vol. xxii.)
made use of in my last; a verbal reference will in most cases
be sufficient to indicate the changes recently introduced.        SS
it will be remembered, represented the experimental tube, which
was then made of brass polished within. Such a tube could not
be used for any gases or vapours capable of attacking brass; and
though    I combated this difficulty, to some extent, by blackening
the tube    within, I could never feel at ease regarding the action
of the gases upon the blackening substance.      Many gases, more
over, present great difficulties on account of their affinity for
atmospheric moisture. Hydrobromic and hydrochloric acid, for
example, form dense fumes in the air; and however carefully they
                           I
might have been dried, should have been reluctant to base any
inference on their deportment without actually having them under
my eyes during experiment.
    The brass tube, then, which stretched from S to S' in the
figure is now replaced by one of glass, 2 feet 9 inches long, and
2.4 inches in diameter. The source of heatin my last-published
inquiry was the cube of hot water C.; but glass being far inferior

taken up by the former is greater than that taken up by the
latter. The difference, however, may really be due to the me
chanical carrying away of a portion of the chloride by the current
of air.
   On the 13th of September these experiments were resumed.
The dry air then gave a deflection of less than 2 degrees; the
air direct from the laboratory caused, in one experiment, the
needle to move from 20 degrees on one side of zero to 28 on the
other.    In a second experiment the undried air caused the needle
to move from 18° on one side of zero to 32° on the other.
    Experiments made on the 17th entirely corroborated this
result.    Three successive trials made the action of the undried
air of the laboratory 29°, 31°, and 30° respectively, the deflec
tion produced by the dried air being less than a single degree.
On this day, therefore, the action of the aqueous vapour of the
air was at least thirty times that of the         itself.    air

    In the present communication I shall have to touch upon
many subjects which for want of time          have been unable to        I
develope.    The following is an example of these.       Choosing a
day of suitable temperature and moisture—a day on which the
human breath shows no signs of precipitation—the action of the
substances expired from the lungs may be most strictly deter
mined by our apparatus.        By breathing directly into the expe
rimental   tube,  the action  produced  by the sum of the products
of respiration might be accurately measured; by breathing through
the sulphuric-acid tube, the moisture of the breath would be with
drawn, and the difference between the action then observed and
the former action would give that of the carbonic acid. In this
way the products of respiration might be estimated singly, and
the influence of various kinds of food and drink, or of physical
exertion, on the respiration might be investigated in a manner
hitherto unthought of.
    I have to record the following experiments only in connexion
with this subject. Placing a suitable tube between my lips,                                           I
filled my lungs with air; a stopcock which was interposed between
me and the experimental tube being partially opened, breathed                            I
through it slowly into the latter until the mercury gauge of the
pump was depressed 15 inches. I had, at the time, two assist
ants, C. A. and R. C., and they subsquently breathed into the
experimental tube the same quantity as myself.        In the follow

such small quantities could be directly measured, the action of
air, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, in comparison with that of
the other substances at the same tension, would doubtless be
greatly reduced. With the energetic gases the rays are most
copiously struck down by the quantities which first enter the
tube, the quantities which enter last producing in many cases
an infinitesimal effect. Now                         I
                                    have shown in my last paper
that, for very small absorptions, the effect is sensibly proportional
to the quantity of gas present; and this would seem to justify us
in assuming that for 1 inch of tension the absorption of air,
oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen would be sºoth of the absorp
tion at 30 inches. With                        all
                                 the other gases      have measured         I

                   Radiation   of Heat        by Gaseous Matter.                             283
make it tantamount to a compound, and no doubt this is actually
the case with lampblack; another eminent example of this kind
is referred to in this paper in the section on ozone.         Leslie, how
ever, found water to be a better radiator than lampblack, and
Wells found several substances which were more capable of
being chilled by nocturnal radiation.          On reflection, moreover,
the  following   considerations arise.     The lampblack of commerce
and the soot of a lamp or candle, that is to say, the substances
which have been hitherto employed in experiments on radiant
heat, are copiously mixed with hydrocarbons, which are the
most powerful absorbers and radiators in Nature.                 It might
fairly be questioned whether the reputed experiments with
lampblack really dealt with lampblack at all.               But even the
impure substance is to some extent transparent to radiant heat.
   I  have plates of black glass, rendered so by the solution of
carbon in the glass while in a state of fusion, and which, though
 they are impervious to the rays of the most intense electric
light, allow of a copious transmission of the rays of obscure heat.
 Melloni’s beautiful experiments on glass of this character are
well known; indeed mine are but repetitions of his. Another
of Melloni’s experiments which                   I
                                          have recently verified is the
following. A plate of transparent rock-salt was placed over
 a smoky camphine lamp, and soot was deposited on                   surface          its
 until   it intercepted every ray            brilliant jet
                                                 of             gas. The        of
 plate was placed between        source
                                   a                  of a

 being placed between the salt and the source. As long                  the                as
screen    remained,  the needle      the galvanometer
                                         of                connected with
 the pile stood      zero; but the moment the screen was removed
                    at
the needle promptly advanced, showing the instantaneous trans
 mission across the layer          of

 upon the salt. The actual numbers obtained               this experiment  in

   Let us compare some of the results of this Table of trans
parent vapours with the action of the highly coloured vapour of
bromine.     The absorption of bromine vapour at 1 inch tension
is about  6,  and at 0°l of an inch tension would probably not
exceed    l; hence at 0.1 of an inch tension, bisulphide of carbon
has  probably   15 times the absorbent power of bromine; but
bisulphide of carbon is the feeblest of the compound vapours
that  I have yet discovered.     The strongest of these, boracic
ether, has, according to the above estimate, and at the tension
stated, more than 600 times the absorbing energy of the strongly
coloured bromine.
   The whole of the numbers in the above Table are referred to
atmospheric air as unity; 0.1 of an inch of bisulphide-of-carbon
vapour, for example, absorbs 15 times as much as a whole
atmosphere of air.    Let us compare, for an instant, the action
of boracic ether with that of air. We arrive at an approximate
comparison in this way. The absorption of the tenth of an inch
of boracic ether is something more than that of a whole inch of
methylic alcohol; by diminishing the quantity of methylic alcohol
                                            of its
to one-tenth, we reduce      absorption from 590      109. The                                to

                    should have for 0.01             inch     boracic           of    an           of
ether     absorption

            or
   With the transparent elementary gases               impossible                   it   is                   to
measure  directly the absorption     0°l       inch;   but assuming,
                                                              of          of   an

as before, that up to an absorption of 1 the effect is proportional
to the quantity of gas present, the absorption of each of the ele
mentary gases, at a tension of 0.1 of an inch, would be about
0-0033; hence the absorption of boracic ether of 0°l of an inch
tension is to that of air at the same tension as
                                           620 : 0-0033,
which would give to the ether an energy 186,000 times that of air.

     have already spoken of the blackness of ammonia at 30 inches
tension.   Referring to Table             absorption   I., found its                      is                to   be

only one-thirtieth              of
                       the tension    the  ammonia,    produces

give one entirely new ideas        the  capabilities
                                                  of     matter;   and                of
our wonder will not                  be   diminished             by    the results        to    be    recorded
further on.

   This is the general relation between the velocity and density
at any points of the axis for waves propagated in the positive
direction of z. The relation is the same between the velocity
parallel to the axis and the condensation at points not on the
axis, the velocity at such points being Vf, and the condensation
of. These velocities coexist with transverse velocities expressed

   34. Hitherto the reasoning has had reference to the motion
relative to a single axis of free motion.      An important remark is
now to be made previous to taking the next step towards the
solution of the problem of rectilinear motion perpendicular to a
plane.    Since the law of longitudinal and transverse vibration
relative to an axis was demonstrated generally, and prior to any
supposed case of disturbance, it must receive application, what
ever be the disturbance.        Hence, as a necessary consequence,
any motion arbitrarily impressed on the fluid must be regarded
as composed of motions subject to that law.        This principle being
admitted, and the motion in the instance before us being wholly
parallel to a given direction, it follows that the component mo
tions must be so arranged that the transverse motions destroy
                                                                                       if all
each other.    This will be the case if the axes be           parallel                                      to
the given direction and       unlimited      number, and the phases

 axis is represented  by p j.  "
                                  being any distance from the axis.  It
 is particularly to be observed that, by the demonstration in art.
 28 (Phil. Mag. for August), the free motion is exclusively that
 which is symmetrical about the axis, and the condensation and
 transverse velocity are consequently functions of r. The con
 densation at any point     of the axis at any time being Taºdi'

 time is —      -
                        From these expressions, and by taking
              { %.
 account of the properties of the function f, it will be seen that
 there are positions of maximum condensation, positive or nega
 tive, and of no condensation, and intermediate positions of
 maximum transverse velocity, positive or negative, and of no
 transverse velocity, in fixed cylindrical surfaces about the axis,
 and that the number of such surfaces is unlimited. The maxima
 both of condensation and of transverse velocity continually de
 crease with the distance from the axis; and the intervals between
 their consecutive positions, as also the intervals between the con
 secutive positions of no condensation and no transverse velocity,
go on decreasing till they reach a certain limiting value, which
by the reasoning in art. 30 was ascertained to be

although     this be the character of free motion, it by no means
follows that the motion relative to an axis is necessarily such.
 In fact, the partial differential equations (10) and (11), by which
the values off and a are determined, prove that the motion may
be subject to arbitrary conditions.       But as the motion in every
instance exists originally in the form of free motion, the arbi
trary motion is subject to the limitation of being such only as
may result from modifications of that motion.            For instance,
conceive that the free motion relative to a     given  axis is by some
disturbance separated into two parts; which is an allowable sup
position, because the equations determining the motion are linear
with constant coefficients.      The parts may or may not subse
quently follow the same course. The resolution must take place
in such a manner that the sum of the condensations and the
sum of the longitudinal motions, at corresponding points of the
two parts, must be equal respectively to the condensation and
longitudinal motion at the corresponding point of the original
motion; and the sums of the resolved parts parallel to the axes
of w and y of the two transverse motions, must be equal respect

disturbance be such as to separate the original condensation into
two unequal parts, there will be equal transverse motions in
rectangular directions corresponding to the less, and a portion

symmetrically disposed about the axis, just as in the case of free

disturbance.    This, in fact, is done by means of the equation
(5) in art. 21, which applies accurately to the motion along an
axis of free motion.   From the particular solution of this equation
obtained in articles 22 and 23, it may be inferred that, however far
the approximation be carried, and consequently whatever be the
magnitude of the motion along the axis, the rate of propagation
of the velocity and condensation is absolutely uniform, and such
that no change of the type of the undulations is produced by the
transmission.
   46. But it was found in articles 33 and 34 that the equation
(5) might be satisfied to the first approximation by supposing $
to be equal to the sum of an unlimited number of terms such as
m sin q (2-alt+c), and that, in order to satisfy the conditions of
any given disturbance, it was necessary to express % in this man
ner; which analytical circumstance indicates that the motion is
of a composite character independently of the mode of disturb
ance. From this first approximation we might proceed to the
next by assuming that
                            $=X.          {m    sin q    (2-at--c)}              +    k,

able to give them. The subject is one that cannot possibly be
ignored if progress in theoretical physics be of any moment.

theory of vibrations is evinced by the facility with which it at
once accounts for the more obvious phenomena of light. This

       GENTLEMEN,                     -
Will         you permit me to make a few observations on those
          very remarkable protuberances which are seen to sur
round the sun's disk during the time of his total eclipse ? and if
I am tempted to indulge in speculation, the rare occurrence of
the phenomenon, and the interest attaching to       may perhaps                 it,
be  viewed       apology.

   These strange and startling appearances have now been ob
served     least three times. The first
               at                           these occasions was       of
during the total eclipse                July, 1842, when their

                             the 7th                             of

rouse the attention    astronomers;

very probable that the red protuberances really belonged     the                             to
sun, while, from their vast magnitude, the idea      their being                  of
solar mountains was     once discarded.at
    It  seemed rather       the impression among those assembled
                                   to   be
on    this occasion, that they were connected    some way with             in

               seen     on             Sun's Limb during                 a     Total Eclipse.                     303

pearances consistent with        the presence            of a very attenuated
atmosphere.
  If in such a search we are to be guided by terrestrial physics,
we must look to those phenomena which take place in our own
atmosphere at the greatest elevation above the surface of the earth.
   Now the aurora will undoubtedly occur to us as an appear
ance which both observation and experiment induce us to asso
ciate with the extreme limits of our atmosphere.
   But before discussing the question whether the auroral light
presents those characteristics which observation has assigned to
the red protuberances, I may remark that there is another
reason, besides our unwillingness to extend the solar atmosphere,
which might induce us to resort to this explanation.
   The observations of General Sabine, combined with those of
I)r. Schwabe, give us good grounds for supposing that the sun
exercises a magnetic influence upon the earth.    Now the writer
has endeavoured to show that the terrestrial aurora is the                    in
duced effect in the upper regions of the atmosphere of small but
rapid changes occurring in the intensity of the earth’s magnetism.
    These changes form what is known as magnetic disturbances,
and occur simultaneously with auroras; and it has been shown
by General Sabine that these disturbances have a daily period,
thus discovering their dependence upon the sun, and also a ten
yearly period coincident with that of the relative frequency of
sun-spots.     There is therefore little doubt left in the mind
that these   changes   in the earth's magnetism are due to similar
changes in the sun's magnetic effect, and that both are connected,
directly or indirectly, with those spots which appear on the
surface of our luminary.
    But are we to imagine that those changes in the sun’s mag
 netic effect which, acting through the earth, produce an aurora
in our atmosphere, have no similar effect upon his own f
    Being convinced that we had here grounds for a hypothesis
 regarding the red flames,   I ventured to mention this suggestion
regarding their nature to General Sabine, and was much de
  ighted to learn that the same thought had also occurred to
 him, which he expressed in the following words:—“May not a
                                                                              be all
 solar aurora call forth simultaneous corresponding auroras in
 the planets, proportioned       their strength, although
                                 to                          may    it
 very difficult, ifnot impossible, for         us   to
                                              determine this    ob       by
servation   ?”
  It would thus appear that, priori,  a    have grounds for sup
                                                    we
posing that phenomena similar       terrestrial auroras may occur
                                          to
atthe extreme limits    of
                        the solar atmosphere.
  The question now arises, Can we suppose the red flames                       to
 bethese auroras   have they the requisite characteristics?

    There are indeed many points of likeness between the two.
    In the first place, the extreme height to which the flames rise
above the surface of the sun has already been adduced in favour
of this hypothesis.
    Secondly. The red flames have been shown by Mr. De la Rue
to possess great actinic effect, a quality which Dr. Robinson and
others have also found in light of the terrestrial aurora.
    Thirdly. Their red or violet colour is also in favour of the
hypothesis.
    Fourthly. Their light is unpolarized, which is also the case
with that of the aurora.
    And fifthly. Some of the red flames present a curved appear
ance, similar perhaps to the auroral arch.
     It would therefore appear that the comparison is in favour of
this view, which has also the claim upon our attention that it
may possibly prove of service as a working hypothesis in the
 science of terrestrial magnetism.

was identified with that obtained from other sources.   Linne
 mann has tried the deportment of many other kinds of sugar in
reference to sodium-amalgam, and in many cases observed the
formation of mannite.
    Beilstein, in an investigation of iodopropionic acid*, observed
that, when the silver-salt of this acid was boiled, iodide of silver
and a new acid, which at first was supposed to be lactic acid,
were formed.       He has nowf more completely investigated this
acid, and finds it to be totally different from lactic acid.   It is
best obtained by boiling iodopropionic acid with excess of oxide
of silver, filtering, passing sulphuretted hydrogen through the
filtrate, and evaporating to dryness. A syrup is obtained con
taining fine needles; and by directly neutralizing this syrup the
salts may be obtained. This new acid, which Beilstein names
hydracrylic acid, has the composition C*H* 9", and in          salts                         its

 acid strongly calcined.          This volatilization of tungstic acid
 belongs to the remarkable phenomena recently discovered by
 M. St.-Claire Deville, concerning the action of hydrochloric
acid on the amorphous oxides, and is explained in like manner+.
   Tungstate of lime mixed with chalk is changed in a current
of hydrochloric acid into neutral tungstate of lime, which cry
stallizes in the excess of chloride of calcium formed. The
Scheelite thus obtained had the composition CaO WO", and
the crystalline form of the native mineral.
   Debray also prepared tungstate of iron, or Wolfram, by heat
ing to a high temperature a mixture in any proportions of
tungstic acid and oxide of iron.             All the substance was carried
to the cold     parts    of the    tube,   where were deposited tungstic
acid, magnetic oxide of iron, and tungstate of iron in definite
lustrous crystals, identical in shape with those of nativeWolfram. ”
   Various opinions have prevailed as to the composition of the
crystals formed in the sulphuric-acid chambers.                  Some have
regarded them as a compound of sulphuric acid and binoxide of
nitrogen; by others they have been considered to be a com
                                                 º,
pound of sulphuric acid and nitrous acid; while Otto assumes
that they contain hyponitric acid combined with sulphuric acid.
In a recent research, Weltzien has adopted this view, and assigns
to them the formula 6SO°+2NO++4HO.
   These crystals have been examined by Dr. Webert.                     The
crystals were prepared by passing dry                        acid into con
centrated nitric acid, kept well cool until the mass had assumed
a crumbly consistence; it was then allowed to drain on a dry
porous tile placed under an exhausted receiver.             It is important

which the crystals are not soluble.
   By the action of hyponitrous acid on English sulphuric acid
the same compound is obtained, though less free from adherent
acid. To ascertain the composition, determinations were made of
the sulphuric acid, water, nitrogen, and of the oxygen. The
water was determined by placing at the end of a combustion
tube a layer of ignited magnesia.              On this the weighed sub
stance was    placed,   covered with      magnesia,  and a layer of copper
6 inches long placed in front. The apparatus being heated, a
layer of perfectly dry air was passed through the tube, in front
of which there was a chloride-of-calcium tube. To determine
the nitrogen, the arrangement was the same as in the above case,
                .
except that, instead of air, carbonic acid was passed through the
tube; and instead of the chloride-of-calcium tube, a gas-delivery

Matteucci on the Secondary Electromotor Power of Nerves.                       313
    The author next gives the results of experiments made to deter
mine the influence of various physical and chemical conditions on the
 secondary electromotor power of nerves.         The method he generally
followed was   by comparing   the secondary   currents  caused by the same
pile-current in a natural and in an altered nerve.       He had previously
ascertained that when the same       pile-current  is passed  through two
nerves at once    they   are equally  affected,  and  give when placed in
opposition no differential deflection of the galvanometer, although
singly each might give a secondary current of 40° or 50°. Now by
sending the same pile-current simultaneously through two nerves or
  ortions of nerve, either before or after the one of them has been sub
jected to the particular conditions to be tried, and finally placing the
 two in opposition in connexion with the galvanometer, the occurrence
or absence of differential deflection of the needle will how whether
any or what degree of effect has been produced on the secondary
electromotor power of the altered nerve.          In this way the author
found that both the cold of a       refrigerating   mixture and a heat of
from 50° to 60° Cent. caused a       great  diminution of the secondary
current in the nerves of a fowl. It is greatly weakened also by
 crushing the nerve, or by keeping the nerve long immersed in di
 stilled water; immersion for a few seconds has no appreciable effect.
 Immersion for a few minutes in alcohol, or in a solution of potash
 of gºrg strength, entirely extinguishes the secondary current. Two
 merves subjected to the same exciting current, the one fifteen or
twenty minutes after the other, show no difference in their secondary
currents.   If  an exciting current is passed through a nerve, first in
one direction and.then for an equal time in the opposite direction,
E.
the secondary current produced is weaker than if the pile-current had
been in one direction only. The secondary current increases, within
certain limits, with the duration, and also with the intensity of the
                 Neither the       size nor the number    of the nerves (if united
 y superposition) exercises any influence.              Four similar nerves were
subjected to the same pile-current; three of these nerves superposed
were then placed in opposition to one as a differential pile, but no
differential current was produced.    Portions of nerve of equal length
from a    frog, a lamb, and a  fowl, were subjected to the same pile
current, and when afterwards opposed successively, the one to the
other, gave no differential current; yet singly each gave a secondary
current of 40° or 50°.     A decided effect, however, is produced by
i.
the length of the   nerve; when pieces of different lengths were com
pared, a strong differential current was constantly found to corre
         with the longest portion of nerve; the author remarks that
this result cannot be understood, unless we admit that the secondary
eectromotor power, which is originally greatest in contact with the
electrodes, extends successively to         all
                                         the parts          of

given by various observers, have been collected together by Professor
Loomis, and published in a series of papers communicated by him to
the American Journal of Science and Arts. From all these accounts
there appears to have been two great displays, each commencing at
nearly the same absolute time throughout the globe; the first on the
evening of the 28th of August, and the second on the early morning
of the 2nd of September, Greenwich time.
   Magnetic disturbances of unusual violence and very wide extent
were observed simultaneously with these displays.     These were re
corded more or less frequently at the different Observatories;   but at
Kew there is the advantage of a set of self-recording magnetographs,
which are in constant operation, and by means of which the state of the
elements of the earth's magnetic force may be known at any moment.
   The author then refers to curves, which accompany his paper, and
shows that the first disturbance commenced about 10} on the
evening of August 28th, affecting       the elements simultaneously.   all

 somewhat    abated,   and  things    remained    nearly       this state until               in
 September 2nd,         A.M., about which time another very abrupt

 disturbance simultaneously affected                                   all
                                               the elements, and continued
 with great violence until about           P.M.      the same day, when
                                                                  4               of                                    it
 somewhat abated. The elements, nevertheless, remained                       state                            in   a
 of considerable disturbance until September 5th, and only attained
 their normal positions        September 7th.on         thus appears that we       It
 have two distinct well-marked disturbances, both commencing ab
 ruptly and ending gradually, the first          which began             of
                                                                    the evening                        on
 of August 28, and the second          the  early morning    on September                         of                   2.
    These two great disturbances correspond, therefore,                point                                in          of

   Now Mr. C. W. Walker, in a paper communicated to the Royal
Society (January 31st, 1861), shows that the earth-currents which
accompany auroras are of very short period (say a few minutes), and
the auroras themselves also appear to be of a very fitful nature. We
                              j
cannot, therefore, well imagine how any combination of auroras and
earth-currents could cause the period of seven hours, which the
magnetic curves exhibit; while at the same time we cannot fail to
associate the rapidly reversed earth-currents with those serrated
appearances which the curves present.

   The author suggests the following explanation of these pheno
mena.    The earth itself may be likened to the soft iron core of a
Ruhmkorff's machine, and the lower strata of the atmosphere to an
insulating material interposed between the earth and the upper strata
of the atmosphere,           being very rare, become conducting, and
form as it were the secondary coil of this arrangement.
   Now suppose a primary current, probably in our luminary, to                                                            in
fluence the earth, and suppose        general direction  its
                                                          remain the                             to
same for         at
              least seven hours.     This current would act on the
magnetic matter             of
                     the earth    the same manner during these seven
                                                   in
hours; and would, therefore, account for the magnetic wave      seven                                          of
hours' duration.
   But although this current has been supposed         remain        the                 to                          in

some cases the crucible was placed in a furnace with a low fire so as
to cool much slower, but the separation of the metals did not appear
to be more perfect than when cooled in the usual manner. When
cold the cell was broken, and the top of the alloy separated from the
lower part by a blow of the hammer.

  “On some Gold-Tin Alloys.” By A. Matthiessen,                                                                     F.R.S., and
M. von. Bose. Received August 28, 1861.
      It was observed in a former research” that the gold-tin alloys had
a great tendency to crystallize, and it was deduced from results then
obtained that some of them were chemical combinations.                  With a
view to ascertain whether these would crystallize out from the fused
metals, the following experiments were undertaken.
    The metalst were weighed out in the proper proportions, and
fused together in a crucible over a 4-Bunsen burner, a jet of gas
playing on the surface from above to prevent the oxidation of the tin.
When fused, the lamp was removed and the alloy allowed to cool
(the jet of gas still playing upon        until the surface began   it)solidify,                                        to
when the     liquid alloy  was  poured   off from the    crystals.   Of course
the two metals were always stirred well, and cast several times before
the alloy was crystallized and analysed.
    When the metals were fused together              the proportion       form       in                                      to

                                                   in

                  fusion, for the former has       much higher fusing-point      a
than the latter.      The alloy containing 43.5 per cent, gold behaved
in  the same manner.        The analyses        the different parts         of

  The weight of each of the alloys experimented with was generally
about 260 grims., and that of each crystallization on the average
40 grims. In the last alloy, crystals             fit
                                             for analysis could only                  be
obtained in    the first crystallization. The mother-liquor was, how
ever, crystallized four times, and the last mother-liquor analysed.

   1. “On the Mode of Formation of some of the River-valleys in
the South of Ireland.”     By Professor J. B. Jukes, F.R.S., F.G.S.,
of the Geological  Survey  of Ireland.
   Mr. Jukes's paper contained a description of the physical struc
ture of that part of the South of Ireland south of the limestone-plain
that extends from Dublin to Galway Bay. He showed that the
Rivers Shannon, Barrow, Nore, and Suir, after traversing this low
ground, escaped to the sea by ravines worn through lofty hills of Old
Red Sandstone and Lower Silurian rocks.        He also instanced the
Rivers   Blackwater,  Lee, and Bandon as each suddenly deserting the
low  longitudinal valleys through which they had run for many miles,
and turning at right angles down ravines of Old Red Sandstone,
notwithstanding the fact of the longitudinal valleys being continued
with no apparent obstruction to the course of the rivers. He showed
the connexion of these lateral ravines with the coming of strong
brooks from the higher ridges on the north into the longitudinal
valleys, and also that these brooks probably produced the ravines,
having first begun to erode them over a surface above the present
ridges, and before the formation of the longitudinal valleys.
   He considered the fact proved, that the present “form of the
ground” in the South of Ireland was produced by atmospheric ero
sion on dry land, and that the limestone ground was low because the
rock had been dissolved chemically as well as eroded mechanically,
and that its surface had sunk to a lower level than the other rocks,
like that of a glacier melting in its bed. He proposed to extend
this explanation generally to      dry land.  all

    4. “On the Premolar Teeth of Diprotodon, and on a New Species
 of that Genus from Queensland in Australia.” By Professor Huxley,
F.R.S., Sec. G.S.
    Among a collection of fossil bones from the Darling Down district,
in the possession of Dr. Cotton, F.G.S., the author has observed a
portion of the right ramus of the lower jaw of Diprotodon, and parts
 of the right and left upper jaws, with the anterior grinders in place,
of distinct individuals.     Hence he was enabled to offer some obser
 vations on the dentition of the genus, and more particularly upon the
characters of the premolars.       For the form which he finds distinct
from Diprotodon australis he proposes the name of D. minor.
    5. “On the Old Red Sandstone of Fifeshire.”         By James Powrie,
Esq., F.G.S.
    Having again examined some sections of the Old Red at White
 ness, near Arbroath, and elsewhere, the author is satisfied of a local
unconformity of the Upper on the Lower Old Red, but that no
 other locality in Forfarshire exhibits this want of conformity; and
neither in Fifeshire nor Perthshire does the author find a section
distinct enough to exhibit such a break in the series. Mr. Powrie
alluded to the yellow sandstone of Dura Den, and observed that,
though it is unconformable to the red sandstone beneath, yet he
believes that it belongs to the Old Red Series.          He proceeded to
notice the fossil fishes of Dura Den, of which he says there are six
well-marked genera (including Glyptolepis) with about seven or eight
species.
    6. “On some UpperCoal-measures,        containing a bed of Limestone,
at Catrine in Ayrshire.”      By  E. W.   Binney,  Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S.
    Some red and   purple  strata near  Catrine,  underlying  the Permian
breccia of Ballochmoyle, were referred to in 1856 by the author.       He
has since revisited the locality, and finds that these strata at Balloch
moyle Braes, Catrine, and Sorn represent a coal-field as high as any
in the English series—in fact, similar to those at Ardwick near Man
chester, Uffington, Leebotwood near Shrewsbury,             Buxtaby near
Nuneaton, and Lane End Potteries.           Mr. Binney referred to the
observations made by Mr. Ralph Moore, and by Geikie and Mur
chison, and pointed out how far he differs from them.          Mr. Moore
gives 565 fathoms for the whole series in Ayrshire; the author
finds reason to add nearly 300 fathoms of Carboniferous strata (not
productive of coal) to the above estimate.
    7. “On the Geological Structure of the Southern Grampians.”
By Professor James Nicol, F.R.S.E., F.G.S.
   The author stated that in 1844, and in subsequent years, he in
dicated that the Silurian strata of the South of Scotland are repre
sented in the North by the metamorphosed or so-called primary
strata; and he proceeded to point out that the object of the present
communication is to examine the relation which the three great
formations Clay-slate, Mica-slate, and Gneiss bear one to the other

     On some Natural Casts of Foot-prints from the Wealden.           325
as regular constituents of the crust of the earth, and especially in cer
tain parts of the Scottish Highlands, as illustrated by sections observed
by himself. These he correlated with what is seen in other parts of
the Highlands.
   Contrasting his published sections with the corresponding ones
given by Sir R. I. Murchison and Mr. Geikie, he observes that,
though represented as maintaining the identity of the gneiss of
the west coast with certain mica- or chlorite-slates, yet he has
in former papers, and in his published map, always regarded
them as being identical only so far as both belong to the great series
of metamorphic formations inferior to the red sandstone and quartz
ite, but still as distinct formations with peculiar features, and, it may
be, of widely different age.
   8. “On some Natural Casts of Foot-prints from the Wealden of the
Isle of Wight, and of Swanage.” By S. *H. Beckles, Esq., F.R.S.,
F.G.S.
   Some of these natural casts are nearly 3% feet long, indicating
not merely the imprints of the toes, but also of the sloping meta
tarsals.    The animal must have been of great size and weight,
leaving deep imprints. Little trifid imprints of only 3 inches in
length, with a stride of about 13 inches, occurred to the author also
in the Isle of Wight. He has found, also, trifids of the usual size in
the Wealden of Swanage Bay. Mr. Beckles argued that other
Dinosaurians besides the Iguanodon have left these track-marks;
and he stated that from the first he has been accustomed to asso
ciate them with the various phalangeal bones so abundant in the
Wealden.
   9. “Geological Notes on Zanzibar.” By Richard Thornton, Esq.

   From the coast to the coast-range (600 to 1300 feet high), the
country consists of a series of strata with an easterly dip, namely
(from above downwards) coral-limestone, sandstone, yellow shale,
and sandstone with plant-remains.         The mountain Kilimanjaro is
formed    chiefly of volcanic rocks.     White and altered sandstones,
with easterly dip, are met with also in the Massai Plain.

Esq., F.L.S.
   The author stated that in the section of clay, sand, and gravel
near Leith, described by Mr. Geikie as part of a raised beach
elevated since the period of the IRoman occupation, not only have
mediaeval pottery and tobacco-pipes been found in the pottery
bearing deposit described by Mr. Geikie, but a mediaeval jar has
been met with in the sand beneath.        The so-called “Roman” pot
tery was stated by the author to be of mediaeval age, on the inde
pendent authority of Messrs. Birch and Franks, of the British
 Museum; and he believes that the beds in question are mainly of
late and artificial formation; he does not, however, argue from this
that there is no evidence of a late upheaval of the central part of
 Scotland.

 By Sir William Denison, Governor of Madras, &c. In a letter to
 Sir Roderick Murchison, F.R.S., F.G.S.
    Steaming between Mangalore and Cananore on the west coast of
 India, the author found that for some time after the south-west mon
 soon the sea was offensive with dead fish, killed by the great mass of
 fresh water poured into the sea during the season of the monsoon.

      would appear, from a letter of Professors van Breda and Loge
    man's, published in your Magazine for August last, that they are
still under the impression that the apparatus described and illustrated

ples, and that they attribute my objections to some misunderstanding
on my part in regard to         construction.    its

 REDUCTION         OF CHROMIUM FROM SOLUTION OF THE CHLORIDE.
                          BY CHARLES W. VINCENT.
   In the course of some experiments with amalgam of sodium, the
idea occurred to me that it might be employed with advantage as a
ready means of reducing some of those metals which are not readily
obtained by ordinary metallurgical processes.   By adding to a solu
tion of the chloride of chromium an amalgam of sodium, I have
found that, although there is a considerable waste of sodium, never
theless an amalgam remains of chromium, which, on distillation in a
tube-retort filled with naphtha vapour, yields this metal in a finely
divided state.
   The accompanying Note is an account of the reaction which takes
place with manganese. The subject is still under investigation.

     RRDUCTION OF MANGANESE FROM THE PROTOCHLORIDE BY
              SODIUM-AMALGAM.   BY W. B. GILES.
   When an amalgam of sodium is placed in a saturated solution of
pure protochloride of manganese, a rapid action takes place, hydrogen
is evolved, and finally an amalgam of manganese remains.          The
amalgam appears to decompose slowly in presence of water; and if
exposed to the air for a short time, becomes covered with a brown
film. The amalgam is then taken out of the solution of chloride,
strongly pressed to get rid of the fluid mercury, and then placed in
a hard glass tube closed at one end.      The tube is then heated till
all the mercury is driven off. There remains in the tube a brownish
black powder, which appears to be manganese.       If poured from the
tube while still rather hot, the manganese takes fire, glowing like
tinder tillit is    all
                     converted into oxide.         It
                                                    also exhibits a  splendid

XLIV.        On the Thermal Phenomena which accompany                  the changes
     in volume of Solid Bodies, and on the corresponding               Mechanical
     Work. By M. EDLUND+.
IT theory
   follows directly from the first principles of the mechanical
          of  heat,that theabsorption or disengagement of  heat
which accompanies   any modification of a body, does not depend
 solely on this modification itself, but on the external mechanical
 work which may be created or destroyed at the same time as this
 modification takes place.   The experimental verifications of this
 general theorem are, with reason, classed amongst the most con
vincing proofs which can be given of the great principle of the
equivalence of mechanical work and heat.        Thus, in late years,
physicists have laid great weight on Hirn's experiments on the
heat disengaged by the condensation of the steam of a machine
 in motion, and on the experiments of M. Favre on the total heat
disengaged by the solution of an equivalent of zinc in a voltaic
circuit comprising an electro-magnetic motor. M. Edlund has
proposed to himself the task of investigating, from the same
point of view, a thermal phenomenon as yet little studied—the
disengagement or absorption of heat which accompanies the con
traction or elongation of a metal wire.
   The principle of the experiments consisted in measuring suc
cessively, 1st, the quantity of heat absorbed by a wire which is
elongated during the time in which a weight suspended to
extremity descends          by
                            given quantity; 2nd, the quantity

 same quantity as in the preceding case, in raising the same weight;
 3rd, the quantity of heat disengaged when the wire became
 shortened without raising any weight.         From the mechanical
 theory of heat, the two first quantities ought to be equal, but less
                                      -
 than the third.
    To estimate these quantities of heat, M. Edlund used a thermo
 electric couple of a peculiar construction, which exactly measured
 the diminution or elevation of temperature of the metallic wire
 to which it was applied.     It consisted of a crystal of antimony
 and a   crystal of bismuth (not represented in the figure) fixed in
 two pieces of ivory, h and h' (fig.                          1),
                                         which were themselves fixed

  It  might be feared that the friction of the wire against the
pincer would exercise a considerable disturbing influence on the
results, in consequence of the heat which it developes.  But the
experiments show clearly that there is nothing of the kind; for
they prove that the calorific effects observed when the wire
lengthens or shortens in consuming or in developing the same
external work are exactly equal, and of contrary sign, which
could not have taken place if the heat disengaged by friction in
one experiment diminished the disengagement      of heat due to
elongation, and in the following experiment increased the eleva
tion of temperature due to contraction.
   The first series of experiments was made with a steel wire (a
piano string) of 1.14 millim. in diameter. The results are con

  The equality of the mean values of u and u' in each series of
experiments is the first fact noticed in inspecting this Table.
Thus the heat disengaged by contraction, and the heat absorbed
by elongation, are equal when the contraction and elongation are
accompanied by eaternal mechanical work which is equal, but of
contrary sign.  The proportionality of heat disengaged to the
charge of the lever is no less easy to confirm in the numbers
which precede.     Finally, the proportionality of the elongations
to the charges  is proved  by another series of numbers which are
not given here.
   All these conclusions contain nothing very new ; but it is
otherwise with that which may be drawn from a comparison of
the values of u" with the values of u' and u. The first are always
higher than the second; in other terms, when the wire contracts
without effecting an eaternal mechanical work, more heat is dis
engaged   than when it contracts to the same extent in raising a.
                                                     u+u
weight.   It is easy to see that the expression u<U+017F>"—     may be
taken as a measure of the excess of heat disengaged in the first
case over the heat disengaged in the second ; and the numbers
obtained by experiment show that this excess is proportional to
the square of the charge on the arm of the lever, or (what is the
same thing, since the elongation is proportional to the charge)
proportional to the product of the charge by the elongation, that
 is,

wire contracted while raising a weight. This latter result is quite
in accordance with theory.
   M. Edlund experimented on a second steel wire quite like
the preceding, on a silver wire 1.14 millim. in diameter, on a
German silver wire 1.32 millim. in diameter, on a brass wire
0.87 millim. in diameter, on a platinum wire 1.92 millim. in
diameter, and on a wire of aluminium-bronze”.     All these expe
riments have given results analogous to the foregoing, and which
it appears superfluous to repeat in detail. M. Edlund sums up
his conclusions in the following general laws:—
   I.    If
         a metal is expanded without the limit of elasticity being
eaceeded, it undergoes a cooling proportional to the mechanical
force by which the dilatation is produced.

§ 6.             HAVE
                    now to refer to a class of facts which surprised
            and  perplexed    me when                      I
                                         first observed them. As an
illustration, I will first take the case of alcohol vapour.  A quan
tity of this substance, sufficient to depress the mercury gauge 0:5
of an inch, produced an absorption which caused a deflection of
72° of the galvanometer needle.
    While the needle pointed to this high figure, and previously
                                                 I
to pumping out the vapour, allowed dry air to stream into the
tube, and happened while it entered to observe the effect upon
the galvanometer.         The needle, to my astonishment, sank
speedily to zero, and went to 25° at the opposite side.          The
entry of the almost neutral air here not only abolished the
absorption previously observed, but left a considerable balance in
favour of the face of the pile turned towards the source.          A
repetition of the experiment brought the needle down to zero,
and sent it to 38° on the opposite side.       In like manner a very
small quantity of the vapour of sulphuric ether produced a deflec
tion of 30°; on allowing dry                         air
                                              the tube the needle de
                                                           to       fill
scended    speedily    zero,  and
                             to   swung     60°      the opposite side.
                                                                    to            at
   These results both perplexed and distressed me; for Iimagined,
an on
    first observing them, that had been throughout dealing with
                                                I
   effect totally different from absorption.     thought,    first, that   I             on at
my vapours had deposited themselves          opake films    my plates
                                                                    in
of rock-salt, and that the dry air                         on
                                         entering had cleared these
films away, and allowed the heat from the source free transmission.
   But moment’s reflection dissipated this supposition. The
             a
clearing away      such of film could  a     best but restore the state
                                                                at

                                                       to
produce the negative deflection, which,              the case       ether     of in it           of
vapour, amounted         the vast amplitude
                                  to                60°.   Nevertheless
    dismounted the tube, and subjected the plates                                        of            to

                                           I        thus that        such                        no

               that above surmised took place.        The salt remained
perfectly transparent while        contact with the vapour.

be   aconsiderable fraction of the total heat transmitted from the
source.    Could        that the heat thus imparted

exceedingly, showed that, without resorting                   any source                to                       of

340                    Prof. Tyndall on the Absorption and
   The paradox already referred to is here solved, and the expla–
nation given of the extraordinary effect observed in the case of
the alcohol and ether vapours when dry air entered the experi
mental tube. Dynamic radiation, moreover, and dynamic ab
sorption go hand in hand; and if we compare both with Table
III., we shall find the order of the substances precisely the same,
although one set of results are obtained with a source of heat ex
ternal to the gaseous body, and the other with a source of heat
and cold within the body itself.      Had sufficient time at my  I
disposal, I could develope this subject with advantage. The
results just recorded constitute my first regular series of experi
ments; and, no doubt, augmented experience will enable me to
attain more perfect results.
   I could not well obtain half an inch of my most energetically
acting vapour, namely, boracic ether; but one-tenth of an inch
admitted into the tube and dynamically heated and chilled,
gave—
                                Radiation.                  Absorption.

     Seeing the astonishing energy with which some of these
vapours absorb and radiate heat, it may be asked how far the
quantity of vapour may be reduced before                  action becomes   its
insensible. At    present     will not venture

  that Laplace had no right to his correction, inasmuch as the
  heat developed by the local compression of a mass of air of inde
  finite extension would be instantly wasted by radiation.                 Expe
  riments, he argued, conducted in confined vessels furnish no
  ground for drawing conclusions regarding what occurs in the
  atmosphere, where the heat developed has an indefinite space to
  lose itself. In our experimental tube, though it is mechanically
 closed, indefinite extension, as regards the radiation of heat, is
 secured in one direction, and the means also exist of measuring
 the flux of heat in this direction. What is true for one direction
 is of course true for all, so that the apparatus will inform us of
 what must occur in the open atmosphere. Now, with the most
 powerful radiating gases which I have examined, the radiation
 continues a very sensible time, while the heat acquired by air on
 entering the tube is often a source of inconvenience on account
 of the inability of the air to disperse            heat      radiation. itsThe            by

       §   11.    All      the results here recorded                 had been obtaincd, when,
 turning to De la Rive’s excellent treatise on Electricity, I found
 an allusion to the experiments of M. Meidinger on ozone.      I had
  never previously heard any allusion made to this investigation,
  and was gratified to find in it the record of a very interesting
  piece of work.
     M. Meidinger commences by showing the absence of agree
  ment between theory and experiment in the decomposition of
  water, the difference showing itself very decidedly in a deficiency
 of oxygen when the current was strong. On heating his electro
 lyte, he found that this difference disappeared, the proper quan
 tity of oxygen being liberated. He at once surmiscd that the
 defect of oxygen might be due to the formation of ozone; but
 in what way, was still to be determined. If it were due to the
 great density of ozone in the tube which received the oxygen, the
 destruction of this substance by heat would restore the oxygen to
 its true volume.     Strong heating, however, which destroyed the
ozone, showed        repeated measurements
                            in                    alteration    volume,  no                    of
hence M.     Meidinger     concluded that the defect which           had                              he
observed was not due         the ozone mixed with the oxygen itself.
                                        to
                                                                                             by by
He finally concluded, and justified his conclusion              satisfac
tory experiments, that the loss        oxygen was causedof      the for
mation      peroxide
             of           hydrogen, which was dissolved
                                  of                          the liquid                 in
and thus withdrawn from the electrolytic gas. He was further
led     experiment with electrodes

                                           different sizes, and found
the loss     oxygen much more considerable when

be oxygen              into groups of atoms, which encounter vast
                  packed
resistance in moving through the ether.             sought to decide the    I
question whether it is oxygen or a compound of hydrogen, in the
following way. Heat destroys ozone.             If it were oxygen only,
heat would convert it into the common gas; if it were the hydro
gen compound which some chemists consider it to be, heat would
convert it into oxygen plus aqueous vapour.              The gas alone
admitted into   my   tube would    give the neutral action of oxygen,
but the   gas plus  the  aqueous   vapour   I hoped might give a sen
sibly greater action.      I caused the dry electrolytic gas to pass
through a glass tube heated to redness direct into the experi
mental tube.            I
                   afterwards introduced a drying-tube between the
place where the gas was heated and the experimental tube.

Hitherto have not been able to establish with certainty a dif
ference between the dried and undried gas.            Previously to heat
ing, the electrolytic oxygen had been scrupulously dried; if the
act of heating developed aqueous vapour,           can only say that the    I
experimental means which                       I
                                  have employed are unable to detect
it.   For the present, therefore, hold the belief that ozone

of which, the motion actually produced amounted to nearly the
double of this. It resulted from accurate measurement, that the
11:47 inches were passed over as soon as the temperature had
been raised from 15°.7 to 30°-9.
     A   second glass tube was employedof a similar form, but with
a smaller globe; and with  this, as long  there was only dry air in
the globe, an increase of temperature of from 14°4 to 44°-24
occasioned in the drop of quicksilver a motion of 12.86 Paris
inches; but after a small quantity of water had been introduced
into the globe, the quicksilver moved the same distance when
the temperature was raised only from 14°4 to 31°1. As it
might be imagined that it was possible that, after a longer inter
val of time, the vapour would extend up to the drop of quicksilver
and then produce a different result, the globe was left for a
whole hour in warm water, but the position of the quicksilver
remained unchanged.

 saturation of the space at a temperature of 0°, although the
 aperture of the tube had a diameter of 1:1 Paris lines.
    We are incontestably entitled to conclude from these experi
ments that Dalton's theory, in so far as it assumes that the
air and the vapour existing in the same space are independent
of each other, is totally unfounded; the true view rather is that
the air exerts a pressure upon the vapour and the vapour upon the
air.    I
        make use here of this mode of expression merely in order
to represent the effect.               I
                              hope at a future opportunity to be able
to show that the   humidity     must be regarded as adhering to the
molecules of air, and that the phenomena admit of a simple
explanation by means of a natural hypothesis concerning the
expansion of dry and wet molecules of air.
   If it be desired to apply the theory developed in the foregoing
to the circumstances of the aqueous vapour in the atmosphere,
it is in the first place to be inferred from it that (since the
diffusion of the vapour in the air takes place but very slowly,
and since in different places, according to the temperature and
the magnitude of the surface of the water exposed to the air,
very different quantities of vapour pass into            regard

     “M.  Chaptal first made the observation that when a number
of capillary crystals shoot up the sides of a glass vessel contain

the vessel which is most strongly illuminated.       He was thus
able to cause    crystals  to form on  any  selected side;  and by
placing a screen before the vessel, he found that the line between
light and darkness was distinctly marked by the limit of crystal
lization.   This result is most readily obtained with the metallic
salts.”

that the deposits are sometimes furthes from the sun, and at
other times nearest: these are termed aphelion and perihelion
movements.        Dr. Draper says, “The sun's rays have the
power of causing vapours to pass to the perihelion side of vessels
in which they are confined; but, as it would appear, not at                                                      all

it was found that raw camphor was more sensitive than refined,
and   itwas accordingly adopted.          Common corked and stoppled

 city from a few ounces to a quart and more. These were charged
with various quantities of crude camphor, from 2 or 3 grains to
 100, and were placed in the window on flat supports at the
junction of the sash-bars, and also in various other positions
 with respect to the light as occasion required. An arrow point
 ing to the light was marked on every bottle, and in many cases
 the date when the bottle was first exposed.
    It may here be stated once for all, that the substances which
produce good deposits are ordinary refined camphor, Borneo
camphor,        oil   of
                  camphor, artificial turpentine camphor, chloral,

upon a shelf in a dark cupboard.    No crystals were formed after
many days, on account of the enclosed space becoming saturated
with moisture, and thus preventing evaporation. To prove that
the absence of light had nothing to do with the result, a capsule
containing a few lumps of caustic potash was placed by the side
of the solution, and the whole was covered with a bell-glass. In
the course of a few hours the creeping crystals began to form on
the side of the vessel not covered with the glass plate, just as in
the case of similar solutions exposed to the light. Identical re
sults were obtained when solutions of sulphate of zinc and of
sulphate of copper were placed in the dark enclosed space with
out being covered with the bell-glass, provided the air were kept
dry by means of caustic potash.
    These experiments also serve to explain some facts which
puzzled Dr. Draper.        A bottle of camphor in the dark produces
no deposit, even though left for months, but when put in the
window, it forms a deposit immediately.           One bottle put within
another forms no deposit, even though exposed to the diffused
                                                                           all up

 morning the bottle was taken out and carefully examined; there

366                 Mr. C. Tomlinson           on the Motion        of
was no deposit whatever. The bottle was now wiped dry and
put in the angle of the window on which the sun was shining.
A thermometer placed near it marked 70° and rose to 78°. In
less than 25 minutes there was a copious deposit of small crystals
on the side nearest the sun. The warm woodwork prevented a
deposit on the furthest side: in fact the deposit was formed on
the side of the bottle where radiation was most free, even though
that side was most exposed to the sun.
    The result of this experiment was quite satisfactory to my
mind; but as it is my duty to try and convince the minds
of other men,        Imay be allowed to pile up a few of these
proofs.
    When the surface of the earth and the air resting upon it are
of the same temperature, no dew is formed. If the earth be
cooled ever so little, there is condensation : so also if the
camphor bottle be surrounded by a medium of the same tempe
rature, there is no deposit.        Let that medium be of unequal
temperature, and a deposit is immediately formed on the colder
side.     For example: a bottle containing crude camphor, which
had been kept in a cupboard during some months without showing
any sign of deposit (even when examined by that most delicate of
all  tests,
          a   lighted candle), was taken out, and        circular piece
                                                                    a                            of

                       Camphor towards the Light.                      367
   Whatever, then, protects the bottles from radiation,              either
wholly or in part, prevents the formation of deposits. The
wooden scale of a thermometer hanging in a window a few inches
from a bottle opposite the light, prevents a deposit in a broad
line exactly corresponding with the form of the scale. A bottle
placed near a bar of the window-frame will mark out the form
of the bar by the camphor crystals coming up to within a certain
distance of the bar, leaving that portion of the bottle naked
which coincides with the form of the bar. In such a case as this,
not only does the bar of wood prevent radiation from a portion
of the bottle, but, by absorbing heat from the sun, it acts as a
source of heat for hours afterwards. So also if a glass contain
ing camphor stand on wood, the lower part is permanently
warmer than the upper, as is shown by the repulsion of the de
posit from the lower part, and that chiefly at the back—the front,
where it is exposed to the light, being kept colder from being
nearer the window.     When bottles are tied over with flannel or
india-rubber  cloth, there is no deposit under these flaps. When
glasses are closed with bungs, these retain the heat and keep the
upper parts of vessels warmer than the middle parts, so that no
deposit is made within half an inch or an inch of the bung.
Coloured glass bottles produce furthest deposits, when exposed
to the sun, more readily than white ones, because they sooner
become heated on the exposed side.
   The tinfoil rings of Dr. Draper act as screens in preventing
radiation.  The glass under and for a short space around the
metal is kept warmer than the uncovered portion nearest the
window, and hence no deposit in and about the protected portion.
To prove that this is the correct explanation, it seemed to me that
black absorbent substances would act more efficiently as pro
tectors than bright reflecting ones.      Accordingly      I
                                                           arranged a
number of bottles    containing  crude   camphor,     and attached to
them disks and rings of tinfoil, and of black, red, yellow, and
white paper. The space kept clear by the black paper was many
times larger than that cleared by the tinfoil and the lighter papers,
and these all varied in extent of clearance with their colour. To
show the protecting influence of white paper on a large scale, one
half of a large cylindrical jar containing crude camphor was
loosely covered with white paper in the direction of           its
                                                               length,
and  so placed    in
                   the window,   the  paper   side nearest the light.
There was    anabundant deposit     onthe exposed half     ofthe glass,
which has remained some      months,  but       no
                                               trace  ofa deposit   has
been found on the covered side.
I    think enough has been stated        prove that the motion

The bottles exposed in or near a window will always have one
side colder than the other, and this colder surface will determine
the deposit.    Generally the side nearest the window is the cold
est (seeing how little sun we have, and how long our nights arc),
and here the deposit is most copious; but when the sun shines
on the window, and the side nearest the light is the hottest, a
 deposit is naturally made on the furthest side.         This furthest
deposit, however, is but transient.       It disappears when the sun
goes off the window, because the furthest side ceases to be the
coldest. It goes, in fact, to augment the increasing deposit on
the coldest side, or that nearest the light.       I could always tell
whether there had been any morning sun, by inspecting the east
staircase bottles on descending to breakfast.          During the last
spring and summer there would sometimes be sunshine and
furthest deposits at 5 or 6 o'clock A.M., while clouds or rain would
       on about 8, and the furthest deposits would disappear during
.."
the  day.
   It is scarcely necessary to prove that a large bottle placed in
the window will be hottest on the side next the light when the
sun is shining on the window, and coldest at other times, except
perhaps during some of the warmest days of our short summer, .

Zambra to prepare two thermometers that should range together
with considerable accuracy. These instruments were received
during the very warm weather towards the end of July, and the
results obtained by them struck me as remarkable. A cylin
drical glass 10% inches high, and nearly 3 inches in diameter,
was washed with sulphuric acid and an abundance of water,
dried, and charged with crude camphor. The thermometers
were suspended in the glass, front and back. The readings were
taken at first every five minutes.

    Here again is the fact that on this warm and bright

deposits were insignificant.      This is easily explained when it is
considered   that,  in consequence    of open doors and windows, the
temperatures indoors and out are nearly the same. The condi

raise the vapour, and cold on one side to condense                room                              it.   A

and how are different forces related to each other ? Whereas
the term matter implies the possession, by the object to which it
is applied, of very definite properties, such as weight and exten
sion; the term force conveys for the most part the idea of some
thing unknown, unsearchable, and hypothetical.               An attempt to
render the notion of force equally exact with that of matter, and
so to denote by it only objects of actual investigation, is one

  We will in the first instance take matter, to afford us an
example of causes and effects. Explosive gas, H+O, and water,
HO,    are related to each other as cause and effect, therefore
H+0=      H0. But if H+O becomes HO, heat, cal., makes
appearance              water; this heat must likewise have
                            as             as                                                                           a its

                                         be called a force, a cause is
supposed which produces effects without itself diminishing, and
incorrect conceptions of the causal connexion of things are thereby
fostered. In order that a body may fall, it is no less necessary
that it should be lifted up, than that it should be heavy or possess
gravity; the fall of bodies ought not therefore to be ascribed to
their gravity alone.
   It is the problem of Mechanics to develope the equations which
subsist between falling force and motion, motion and falling
force, and between different motions: here we will call to mind
only one point.     The magnitude of the falling force v is directly
proportional (the earth's radius being assumed =oo) to the
magnitude of the mass m, and the height d to which it is raised;

other.    By the friction of two metallic plates continued for a
very long time, we can gradually cause the cessation of an im
mense quantity of movement; but would it ever occur to us to
look for even the smallest trace of the force which has disappeared
in the metallic dust that we could collect, and to try to regain it
thence? We repeat, the motion cannot have been annihilated;
and contrary, or positive and negative, motions cannot be regarded
as =0, any more than contrary motions can come out of nothing,
or a weight can raise itself.
   Without the recognition of a causal connexion between motion
and heat, it is just as difficult to explain the production of heat
as it is to give any account of the motion that disappears.    The
heat cannot be derived from the diminution of the volume of the
rubbing substances.                       It
                             is well known that two pieces of ice

And what applies to the smallest particles of matter, and the
smallest intervals between them, must also apply to large masses
and to measureable distances. The falling of a weight is a real
diminution of the bulk of the earth, and must therefore without
doubt be related to the quantity of heat thereby developed; this
quantity of heat must be proportional to the greatness of the
weight and                   its
                 distance from the ground.     From this point                                                       of

such an equation is the expression of a physical truth may be
regarded as the substance of the foregoing remarks.
   By applying the principles that have been set forth to the
relations subsisting between the temperature and the volume of
gases, we find that the sinking of a mercury column by which a
gas is compressed is equivalent to the quantity of heat set free
by the compression; and hence it follows, the ratio between the
capacity for heat of air under constant pressure and           capacity                                 its

modified.    During a late visit to the Alps obtained, by help of          I
that distinguished geologist, Mr. Gastaldi of Turin, some import
ant evidence on the subject.
   No true geologist is likely to assert that these valleys have
been mainly scooped out from end to end by ice, for the reason
that, since the disappearance of the ice, running water, in the for
mation of gorges, &c., has comparatively effected so little. Given
sufficient time, and, as old Ray long ago inferred, any amount of
degradation may be produced by rain and running water.          The
Alpine streams have doubtless flowed in their present channels
for long, and, compared with the depth of the valleys, have done
but little.  Long, however, is a comparative term, and in this
instance it may represent a very brief period compared either
with the length of the great glacial epoch, or with that which, pre
ceding     it,
           came after the disturbance                       of

of magnesia is formed, pyrophosphoric acid being liberated; and
this was proved to be the case by dissolving pyrophosphate of
magnesia in nitric acid, evaporating the solution till syrupy, and
then placing it under a bell jar over sulphuric acid; after a time,
nitrate of magnesia crystallized, and the pyrophosphoric acid
could be drained off.
     But although nitrate of            is formed and pyrophos
                                     magnesia
phoric acid set free on the addition of nitric acid to the pyrophos
phate, it is probable that, when this mixture is evaporated and
heated, the products are not always mere mixtures of nitrate of
magnesia and pyrophosphoric acid, but that they are sometimes
compounds; and the reasons for this opinion are, that these pro
ducts are but slightly deliquescent, that nitric acid is less readily
expelled from them than from nitrate of magnesia, and that on
heating these products suddenly, pyrophosphate of magnesia is
volatilized, though it is not under ordinary circumstances a
volatilizable salt.
     In    the ordinary modeof estimating phosphoric acid or mag
nesia, there is great difficulty in obtaining the pyrophosphate of
magnesia perfectly white, except by long calcination, and unless
a few drops of nitric acid have been added.  This plan, which is
often recommended and adopted, is likely, however, to lead to
considerable errors in the estimation both of phosphoric acid
and of magnesia, in consequence of the action above described;
and there is no doubt that this mode of operating has been one
of the causes which have led to the discrepant results of analyses,
and the disputes that have frequently arisen as to the richness
of substances in phosphates.      It was in the course of some
investigations of this kind, some considerable time ago, that the
peculiar action of heat upon pyrophosphate of magnesia and
nitric acid was first observed.

of purified nitrogen gas.   The weight of the magnesium had
increased by about 18 per cent. The substance thus obtained
had an almost pure yellow colour: it was generally contaminated
by the presence of a little magnesia; for the substance rapidly
attracted moisture in the air, forming magnesia and ammonia.
   When this substance was heated with hydrochloric acid, it was
decomposed with the formation of chloride of ammonium and
chloride of magnesium. The analytical results, after allowing
for the magnesia formed, agreed with the formula Mg.” N.

greenish mass, which is slowly oxidized to magnesia in dry air,

chloric acid is then added to decompose the carbonates, sulphides,
and hyposulphites; and to the filtered liquid, nitric acid is added
to remove iodine and bromine. The liquid then contains nothing
but sulphates and chlorides. It is diluted, heated to boiling, and
a saturated boiling solution of chloroplatinate of potassium added.
The precipitate formed consists mainly of chloroplatinate of rubi
dium, which may be purified by treatment with hot water. The
chloroplatinate of rubidium is reduced in a current of hydrogen.
The residue, treated by water, dissolves out chloride of rubidium.
   M. Grandeau has also found rubidium among the salts in
Havanna and Kentucky tobacco, in the ashes of coffee and of

   Cobalt.—This metal is readily obtained pure by the action of
a feeble current on a concentrated solution of chloride of cobalt
to which an excess of alkali has been added.         The metal is depo

ceeds, sulphuric   acid becomes free, and the solution must be
saturated either  by  adding oxide of nickel or ammonia.     In the
first case the solution always remains at the same degree of con
centration; in the latter a double sulphate of nickel and ammonia
is formed, which is scarcely soluble in water, but soluble in water
to which ammonia has been added.        At the expiration of some
time a white brilliant     deposit with a slight yellowish tinge is
obtained. It has also magnetic polarity like cobalt.
   Gold.—A neutral and very concentrated solution of chloride
of gold  is rapidly decomposed even by a single element of weak
electromotive force, metallic gold being used for the positive
electrode.    The metal becomes ductile by being annealed. Alka
line solutions need not be added, but the intensity of the current
must be proportional to the density of the liquid.
   With solution of silver the result is the same: the solution
must be neutral, the current feeble, and a positive electrode is
indispensable.
   Platinum is more difficult to obtain as a coherent mass; the
negative electrode must be of platinum, round which the metal
is often deposited in tubercles.

Crova has made it probable that this may arise from the pre
sence of cupreous acetylene, which detonates at a high tempera
ture or when struck.    The author exposed a quantity of reduced
metallic copper in a flask containing a mixture in equal volumes
of air and acetylene, to which in one case a little ammonia was
added.   The copper became black, and after the lapse of some
time the flask, on being opened under water, showed that about
one-half had been absorbed; the absorption in the flask con
taining ammonia was somewhat greater. The copper was washed
and dried; on being treated with hydrochloric acid, a consider
able quantity of acetylene was disengaged; when thrown on a
heated metallic plate, an explosion was produced, much more
violent than with pure cupreous acetylene.     As coal-gas always
contains acetylene, some traces of air, and even of ammonia, the
formation of the acetylene compound can be readily understood.

  M. J. M. Crafts has investigated the sulphide of ethylene”,
C*H*S. It is best obtained by the action of bromide of ethy
lene on sulphide of potassium.         It forms white crystals, which
distil at 200°, and at 11.2°    solidify, forming a crystalline mass.
It is acted  upon  by  bromine;    and whatever the proportions in
which the two substances are employed, the body C*H*S Brº
is obtained. This is a yellow substance, which is insoluble in
ether or in alcohol.      It is changed by the action of moist                                                  air

dried over chloride of calcium. The oily body thus obtained is
insoluble in water, but readily so in alcohol and ether: it is quite
neutral, and is unacted upon by strong hydrochloric or sulphuric
acids, or by strong alkalies.    Above 200°C. it decomposes with
intumescence. This     body   is as poisonous as coniine, though
slower in its action.    It has the formula C*H*N* 9, and                                                        its

        SIR,                           Guy's Hospital, October 8th, 1862.
 MY         attention having been called to a letter in the May
          Number of the Philosophical Magazine, “On the Changes
 in the Apparent Size of the Moon,” where reference is made to
 my explanation of the phenomenon (Recreative Science, No. 24),
 I  find it necessary to ask your indulgence while          I  make some
 allusion to that reference, as well as to the novel and ingenious
 experiment of your correspondent Mr. Lewis.
     First, with regard to the reference to my explanation, it is
 obvious that, to satisfy the “popular mind ’’ as to the subjective
 character of the phenomenon, it would have been better to have
 quoted my second experiment, that of looking at the rising sun
till an ocular spectrum was obtained, and then directing the eye
 to the zenith, where this spectrum immediately diminished, to
enlarge again on looking to the opposite horizon.               Secondly,
 with   regard   to the  experiment  of Mr. Lewis,    it must be noticed
that, while it necessarily involves the condition of binocular vision,
the phenomenon it proposes to illustrate is equally exhibited to
monocular vision; the experiment nevertheless, so far as I can
judge, very well illustrates that law by which, when two bodies
subtend equal angles, both bodies being of the same size, but
one assumed to be nearer than the other, the (assumed) nearer
appears to be smaller. And though, consequently, the moon in the
zenith would appear smaller if the senses assumed it to be nearer, the
experiment of your correspondent does not hint at the latter
condition.       Now as the gravamen of the evidence lies here, you
will   perhaps   allow me to state briefly why it is that the luminary
(seen with one eye or with both eyes) in the zenith is felt to be
nearer than it is when seen in the horizon.               I say felt, not
reasoned, inasmuch as this is a sensory perception which no
intellection can alter, seeing the setting or rising sun is no less
enlarged to the eye of an astronomer (whose reason rejects the
illusion) than it is to the eye of the fmost uninformed rustic.
    I  propose that the luminary appears nearer at zenith than
horizon, because, first (A), the visible sky appears nearer at zenith

                            Apparent Size                of the Moon.                              391
than horizon, and, secondly (B), the apparent distance of the
luminary accords with that of the sky.
   A. Everything visible is seen by rays proceeding from it”.
Whatever, then, constitutes the visible sky is thus seen.    Now
sky would appear black if atmospheric particles did not reflect
rays; it would appear white if intervals of black space beyond
did not leave points of the retina unexcited; and it appears blue
by a law (experimentally deduced by Da Vinci) that retinal
excitation (by white light) interspersed with retinal points of
rest (derived from the blackness of space) is the sensory condition
blue.   But the (partial) blueness of sky at horizon shows that
the blackness of space is not altogether shut out by intervening
reflecting particles: whence it follows that the furthest reflecting
particles of our atmosphere cannot have their light wholly inter
cepted by the nearer; and that the whole atmospheric area contri
butes, with the blackness of space beyond, to constitute the visible
sky. The whole atmosphere, then, gives the real locality of that
we call visible sky—seen by rays proceeding from it (its varying
shades, from blue to nearly black, in various latitudes, showing
that colour is       its
                  visible accident and not        visible essence). Now,
                                                                       its

argument,      finally, seems irrefragable:         engraver and painter
 succeed in presenting, the one the form, and the other the form
and colour of the sky as we really perceive them by the sense,
their success depending solely on an observed law of perspective,
which mathematically demonstrates the sky they depict at the
horizon to be further considerably than that they represent at
the zenith.      Now the senses, in recognizing the truth of this
representation of the sense-perceived form of the sky, assert
unequivocally what the sense-perception                                         is.

that the element   oxygen  was formed according to a molecular law

formed; and that the mutual decomposition of the two oxides was
determined by the synthesis of the particles of oxygen in opposite

of the conclusions.

                    acid solution    permanganic          of                          acid     decomposed

proportion, according     the equation to
                      Mn, 0.4-5 H, O,-2Mn,0+5H,0+50.
     (2) An alkaline solution                    of   ferricyanide            of   potassium          is     reduced
by the peroxide                 of   barium       to   ferrocyanide,           with the evolution                      of

                                                                          barium                is    reduced          by
the peroxide              of

                 BaClO4-Ba, O,4-H, O= BaCl-H2Ba HO-HO,.
A     similar change takes place,                         as   might          be   anticipated,            with        an

  aqueous solution of chlorine in the acid solution of peroxide of
  barium, but more slowly.         I have elsewhere shown that the action
  of iodine is expressed by the equation
                           I, +Ba,   O. =2|Ba  I-FO,.
     (4) The decomposition of chromic acid is of special interest.       In
  this case there are two distinct reactions, the first of which takes
  place when chromic acid is in excess, according to the equation
                 2Cr, O,4-3H,      O,-Cr, 0,4-3H,0+30,        ;
 the second, which occurs when a large excess of peroxide of hydrogen
 is present, and in which the peroxide of hydrogen loses exactly
  double the amount of oxygen lost by the chromic acid, so that the
 final result is expressed by the equation
                  2Cr, O,--6H, O, = Cr, 0,4-6H,0+O,.
     In  the interval between these reactions the ratio      of the loss of
 oxygen from the peroxide to the loss from the chromic acid varies
 between the limits 1 and 2 according to a definite law, being pro
 portional to the ratio of the masses of the substances employed.         I
 am able to    show,   by   direct  experiment,  that the reaction between
 the extreme limits is the sum of two distinct and simple atomic de
 compositions.
     The alkaline peroxides which produce these peculiar effects of
 reduction,   under other conditions act as powerful oxidizing agents;
 thus an acid solution of ferrocyanide of potassium is oxidized by
 peroxide of hydrogen to ferricyanide.          Hydrated protoxide of man
 gamese is oxidized by peroxide of barium to the condition of peroxide
 of manganese. A concentrated solution of hydrochloric acid evolves
 chlorine from peroxide of barium.
                         I
     This last reaction have made the subject of a special investiga
 tion, with the view of determining the conditions under which the
 two reactions,
                  4H Cl-FBa, O,-2BaCl-H2H,0+Cl,
 and              2H Cl--Ba, O,-2 BaCl-H H, O,
 respectively take place; and I find that when a solution of hydro
 chloric acid is boiled with peroxide of barium, if the solution be con
 centrated, chlorine, if the solution be dilute, oxygen, exclusively is
 evolved; and that for each intermediate degree of dilution chlorine
 and oxygen together are evolved in a constant ratio.
    It is thus seen that those differences in the behaviour of the
 different classes of peroxides, from which an imaginary distinction
 has been drawn between the oxygen respectively contained in them
as positive or negative, are not fundamental and characteristic
differences.    The oxygen in the peroxide of barium is the same as
that in the    peroxide    of manganese, according to the only test of
identity which we can apply, for we can produce with it the same
effects.    Nor are the peculiarities in the reactions of the oxygen of
the alkaline peroxides of such a nature as to need any special hypo
thesis to account for them; for in no case are the combining proper
ties of the particles of matter, like their atomic weights, constant for

on the physical conditions in which the particles are placed, and the

    “On Crystallization and Liquefaction, as influenced by Stresses
 tending to change of form in Crystals.”         By Professor James Thom
son, Queen's College, Belfast.
    In a paper submitted to the Royal Society, and printed in the

 Phil. Mag. for May 1862, directed attention in a note (page 409),
to the question of how the surface of a bar of ice in ice-cold water,
as distinguished from the interior of the bar, may, by the appli
cation of tension to the bar, be influenced in respect to tendency
either to melt away, or to solidify to itself additional ice from the
water; but did not then venture to offer a positive answer. I pointed
out as a matter deserving of special attention, and as affording scope
 for much additional theoretical and experimental investigation, the
 distinction between the application to ice in ice-cold water, of stresses
tending to change         its
                          form, the stresses not being participated                     in    b

                              the water and the ice    alike;  and     pointed I

free to melt and cause an equal quantity of water to freeze to the
other", it will follow according to the axiom, now supposed to be
established, that the application of the stress will cause this action
to occur.
   The case of crystals in their solutions might be stated almost in the
 same words as the case of ice in ice-cold water: but it is to be observed
 that, in their case, the necessity for the translation of one chemical
substance through another (the salt through the dissolving liquid),
and not of heat or cold alone, causes a great slowness of the process,
as compared with that of the yielding of the ice, in ice-cold water,
to applied stresses.
    At an early stage of the considerations which led to the opinions
on the influence of stresses on crystallization and liquefaction described
in the present paper, the question arose to me:–Is a spiculum or
single crystal of ice, which has solidified itself in the interior of water,
and is therefore not colder than the water, plastic               Or would                                                                    it,

                      cannot say; but suppose that, in their yielding,I
their crystalline structure is materially altered, and rendered discon
tinuous where, before, it was continuous.
    In       a mass         of plastic ice,            I incline
                                       to think that the intermal melting,
to which I attribute the     plasticity, must occur at the surfaces of
junction of separate crystals or fragments of crystals; though probably
pores formed by melting, by pressures, or by stresses, may penetrate
crystals by entering them from their moistened surfaces or their
junctions with other crystals.      It now becomes clear, I think, that
the influence of stresses affecting the ice, and tending to make it melt
without there being necessarily any consequent pressure applied to
 the water in contact with the ice, must come to be taken into account
in any theory of the plasticity of ice approaching to completeness.
This view does not, however,                                I

described the most convenient and effective method of obtaining
vibrations and sounds by electrolysis.
    The paper contains a full account of the influence of various cir
cumstances upon the vibrations and sounds: viz., of the electrodes,
the electrolyte,     mechanical circumstances and temperature,        the
electric current-size and number of voltaic elements,        quantity of
the current,    coils of wire in the circuit, induction coils and iron
cores,-electrolytes in the circuit, and of magnetism: also the         in
fluence of the vibrating medium itself upon the electric current.
    The best liquid for producing the vibrations and sounds consists of
 10 grains of cyanide of mercury and 100 grains of hydrate of potash
dissolved in 23 ounces of aqueous hydrocyanic acid containing 5 per
cent. of anhydrous acid.
    The vibrations and sounds occur only at the surface of the negative
mercury electrode, as already described (Phil. Mag. S.4. vol. xxii.
p. 555); and out of a large number of liquids examined, the only
ones in which phonetic vibrations occurred were solutions of alkaline
cyanides containing dissolved mercury; and these only give the sounds
with electrodes (or at least a cathode) of mercury; not with solid
metals nor with fused alloys.
    The vibrations and sounds vary considerably according to the
size and number of the voltaic elements; with a few elements of
large surface, the vibrations were small and the sounds high, and with
many elements of small surface they were much larger and the tone
lower.    The most suitable number of elements to produce them is
either two of Grove’s or five of Smee's.
    The interposition of a coil of stout copper wire in the circuit made
the vibrations wider and the sound more base; and if an iron core was
 suddenly thrust into the axis of the coil, they became still wider and
the sounds still more base, and remained so as long as the iron con
tinued there; but if a secondary coil containing a great length of
 fine copper wire surrounded the primary coil (with or without an iron
core), and the ends of the secondary wire were suddenly united, the
vibrations instantly became narrower and the sounds more high, and
remained so as long as the secondary circuit was closed.
    The vibrations of the mercury and electrolyte make the electric
current which produces them sensibly intermittent, similar to the
influence of a vibrating coil-hammer; and they may be used to some
extent in a similar way to that instrument to produce shocks, &c.
by means of a secondary coil. A strong electro-magnet placed in
various positions near the locality of the vibrations had no perceptible
influence upon them.
    The author considers the vibrations to be of electro-chemical origin,
and to result from an attraction between the mercury of the negative
electrode and the mercury of the electrolyte.       He supposes that to
produce the vibrations, either the voltaic force itself must be of an
intermittent nature, or the resistance opposed to that force by the
liquids employed must be intermittent, and intends to make the
experimental investigation of this question, with other allied matters,
the subject of a future communication.

instead of the galvanometer, a greater number of elements (about
eight Smee's) must be employed, and the difference in the effects is
then less striking.        If
                          a battery of much greater intensity,      say
twenty Smee's elements, is employed, no difference in the vibrations

by closing the secondary coil.

   Do not voltaic currents therefore of equal quantities* from
different sources, or under different external conditions, like heat
and light from different sources, possess different qualities?
   4. From these results (as well as from additional ones that I have
 obtained) it          to me that voltaic electricity, like heat or light,
 may be viewed as consisting of vibrations or successive impulses,
which under ordinary circumstances occupy so minute a period of
time as to be inappreciable, but when acting under suitable condi
tions upon suitable substances, such as the metal and liquid referred
to (1), the vibrations of the current are taken up by the substances,
and the oscillations of the substances thereby produced are gradually
increased by the synchronous impulses of the current until they
become visible and attain their maximum (see paper “On the pro
duction of Vibrations and Sounds by Electrolysis,” paragraph 11),
like visible oscillations of a pendulum produced by minute syn
chronous mechanical impulses.       This       I
                                            beg leave to state as an
hypothesis for the purpose of making the subject more clear and
aiding future inquiry.

    [The results mentioned in this paper are well worthy of attentive
consideration, in relation to that curious and still mysterious pheno
menon which the author is investigating with so much care.             As
regards, however, the conjecture thrown out by the author, while the
importance of such a conclusion as that of the existence of qualitative
differences in permanent electric currents, according as few or many
voltaic elements are concerned in their formation, or of periodicit
as a necessary condition of a voltaic current, if fully established,
cannot be overrated, the conclusion does not seem to be fairly deducible
from the experiments described.        It would rather seem that, from
some cause yet to be investigated, the motion of the mercurial cathode,
or rather the change of figure resulting from the motion, alters the
total electromotive force or resistance (more probably the resistance)
in the circuit, and thus, by altering the current, reacts upon the forces
whereby the motion of the cathode is produced.            In a circuit of
small resistance, it might be expected according to this view that a
smaller motion of the cathode would suffice to bring about a given
change in the current, and a corresponding change in the force pro

   In  the first part of the paper we have described the apparatus used
for the experiments, together with the precautions taken to ensure
correct results; in the second we have given the results obtained with
the pure metals—silver, copper, gold, zinc, tin, arsenic, antimony,
bismuth, mercury—and the metalloid tellurium. The conducting
power of the wires, or bars of each, was determined at about 12°, 25°,
40°, 55°, 70°, 85°, and 100° C.; and from the mean of the eight ob
servations made with each wire (four at each temperature on heating,
and four on cooling), we deduced a formula by the method of least
squares for the correction of the conducting power for temperature.
It was found that the conducting power or resistance of a metal does
not decrease or increase in direct ratio to the temperature, as stated
by Becquerel”, Arndstent, and Siemenst, who assume that the
formula for the correction of resistance for temperature between
 °-100° may be expressed by
                                  A=z-Hyt,
but that, on the contrary, the formula must be
                               A=a +yt+yt”,
where A is the resistance at t degrees, a the resistance at 0°, and y
and y constants.       One fact seems to have escaped the observation
of former experimenters, namely, that when a wire of a metal is

heated for the first time to 100° and again cooled, an alteration in the
conducting power takes place ; with most metals it is necessary to
heat them for several days before their conducting power becomes
constant.     In the third part we have deduced from the results ob
tained, the law that all pure metals in a solid state vary in con
ducting power to the same extent between 0° and 100°C.              In cases
where very great accuracy is required, it is absolutely necessary to
experiment on the conductor itself; for we have found almost the
same differences between formulae obtained for wires of the same
                .
metal as between the mean of those deduced for the different metals.
This behaviour may be attributed to the fact that the molecular
arrangement is not the same even in wires of the same metal; for we
find that copper wires, when kept at 100° for several days, behave very
differently         each other: thus, in the case of the three copper wires
experimented with, wire 1 increased in conducting power almost to the
same extent as if it had been annealed, wire 2 partially so, and wire
3 hardly at all. With bismuth, wire 1 increased           conducting power             its
 16  per cent.; wire        per cent.; and wire
                                  2,    19             per cent. Again,      3,   12                                    in

formula for each wire very different.      On the other hand, the formulae
of  the wires    ofthose metals which, after being kept       100° for some                  at
time, show      avery slight         alteration   orthe   no

on   again being cooled, agree very closely with each other.       Compare
those  of  lead, tin, and mercury.

a socket and by means of a screw-thread, a support penetrates,
which can be adapted to the air-pump.         This support is traversed
by two metallic rods with clamps, well insulated and intended to
receive a small crucible formed of platinum wire about half a milli
metre in diameter, rolled in a conical spiral and closed by a cover,
also formed of platinum wire.      In this crucible the powder is placed.
By means of a battery of three or four Bunsen's elements, the plati
num wire which constitutes the crucible is heated to redness.        The
principal facts observed may be summed up in the following
phenomena:-

the sunrise and sunset on the sea; for, from the purity of the Ionian
sky, sharp pictures were to be expected even on the horizon.
   In fact I succeeded in observing, and often in the most surprising
manner, the phenomenon of condensation, especially of the lines in
the red and yellow of the spectrum, which I had seen in our latitudes,
although much more dimly.         I also observed the increase in the
number of the lines at the setting of the sun.   A single glance into
the spectroscope was enough to convince even non-scientific specta
tors, and hence to remove any doubt as to a possible subjective
perception.     I have repeated these observations not only on the
sea, but also on the continent, in Athens, in Zante, Cerigo, and
Ithaca; and although no measurements could be made, the phe
nomena were so marked, that, from the relative position of the
spectral lines,      I
                   can almost guarantee in this case a one-sided con
densation towards the violet end, just as I have shown it in the case
of hyponitrous acid and chlorophyll*.
   Forspectrum observations, Greece, and especially the Ionian Islands,
are most suitable stations; for the dense layers of vapour observed
almost every day on the coasts of Africa and America, there scarcely
disturb the observer.—Poggendorff's Annalen, May 1862.
MODE OF APPLYING THE ELECTRIC LIGHT FOR MINING PURPOSES.
               BY MM. DUMAS AND BENOIT.
  The apparatus consists essentially        of three parts—a battery, a
Ruhmkorff's     coil,  and a Geissler's tube—the whole arranged so as
to produce   a sufficient light to illuminate the miner, and allow him
to work in atmospheres where other lights fail.
   The light produced is cold, or rather does not heat the tube in
which it is produced; and gas has no access to it: it is quite iso
lated. The apparatus is as compact as ordinary lamps, and there
is no injurious emanation. It can be lighted or extinguished at will.
It can work for twelve consecutive hours without diminution, and
without requiring any change. The workman has only occasion
ally to agitate the carbon by means of a rod.
   The greatest difficulty consisted in being able to associate a bat
tery of such intensity that the weight of the apparatus was as small
as possible, the light produced of the greatest regularity, and                     its

LV.       Tests     of the Truth of the Fluid Theory of the Figure of the

1.          HE
            calculation of the figure of the earth on the fluid
          theory proceeds upon the hypothesis that the earth at
one time consisted of a heterogeneous mass of incompressible
fluid or semifluid materials revolving round a fixed axis, and
that these materials arranged themselves in layers nearly sphe
rical in form ere the mass, or at any rate       surface, became      its
solid

  Hence 3G is the quantity which measures the ratio in which
gravity is diminished between the equator and the poles by this
change of distribution.
   7.  Suppose the earth's mass to be divided into five portions,
viz. four shells each 800 miles thick, and a central nucleus of
800 miles radius.    I will proceed to find the numerical value of
3G for each of the three shells between the outer shell and the
central nucleus.

Substituting in this the values found in paragraph 5, and put
ting e=== (the value given in the volume of the British
       294
Ordnance     Survey) and          m-   sº     we have         for the first shell
G=0.00053, for the second shell G=0.00018, for the third shell
G=0.00003.   Thus the three values of 3G in these three cases
are 0.00159, 0-00054, and 0.00009.
  The increase of gravity, in the actual state of the earth, in
passing from the equator to the poles is 0.00518%.    Hence the
change of distribution of the materials in the above three cases
would produce a decrease of gravity in passing from the equator
to the poles, bearing the following ratios

The  highest  northern station at which pendulum experiments
have been made is Spitzbergen.       There 214 more vibrations are
made   by a seconds'  pendulum   in 24 hours than at the equatorf.
In the three cases under consideration these would be diminished
by 64, 21, and 3; vibrations in the course of the day.       The first
and second of these would be      very easily detected,  though  per
haps not the   third, at so great a distance as Spitzbergen is from
the equator, considering the difficulty of comparing the pendu
lums at the two places or transferring the pendulum from one
place to the other without injury.          The first and second,
however, fully answer my purpose.         They show how sensible
a change would be produced in the variation of gravity by
the slight alteration which I have suggested as a first test.

    and one iodide, and shows the bearing of his observations on
    solar chemistry and other questions.
       Now his experiments, though very valuable and suggestive,
    are far from giving a complete story; and they recalled to my
    recollection some experiments of my own, the record of which
    had never proceeded further than my note-book, but which
   evidently were elucidated by, and were capable of elucidating
   those of the German physicist.        I have repeated and extended
   these  during   the last few days,      I
                                      and send you the results, hoping
   to lead other experimenters into the same field, and perhaps to
   return to it myself when     I have greater leisure.
      The fact is that the    majority  of the lines represented in Alex
   ander Mitscherlich’s diagram of the flame of chloride of copper,
   and which, by the way, are represented in Prof. W. A. Miller's dia
   gram of the same in the Philosophical Magazine for August 1845,
   are common to a large number of chlorides if they are sufficiently
   heated.     In the whole range of spectrum-analysis there is no
  fact better known than that common salt gives rise to the yellow
  double line D; yet it is popularly known that if salt be thrown
  on to the red-hot coals of an ordinary fire it produces violet
  flames.     This is beautifully seen when old ship timber is burnt.
  These    flames,   when analysed, are found to consist, not of the
  yellow light, but of three groups of lines; the first green, and
  extending to the fixed line b; the second bluish green, and blue,
  lying on either side of F; and the third violet, stretching from
  midway between F and G to a little beyond G. When examined
 by a spectroscope of no great power, these three groups have a
 close resemblance to one another, each consisting of four lines
 about equidistant, of which the two middle ones are brighter
 than the outer ones; but when they are more carefully examined
 with a narrow slit, the lines of the second and third groups at
 least appear as bands of a certain width, and are even resolvable
 into double bands, of which the more refrangible are the nar
 rower and fainter.        That they are identical with the lines of
 chloride of     copper was proved, not only by the identity of their
 appearance, but by angular measurement of the more prominent
 ones. No more refrangible rays are seen when this light is
 examined by a spectroscope the lenses and prism of which are
made of quartz.
     Many other chlorides also give the same light when sufficiently
heated.       The flame of a spirit-lamp is enough to produce it with
the chloride of copper; and the chloride of platinum or of gold,
if put into such a flame, gives a bright momentary flash of the
violet light, which, when analysed by the prism, is resolved into
the same bands, those from the platinum-salt exactly coinciding
with those from the copper salt when the two are seen side

Dr. J. H. Gladstone    on the Violet Flame of many Chlorides.      419
by side.    Chloride of mercury in the gas flame from a Bunsen’s
burner    gives  this light also. . . A hydrogen flame is capable
of producing it from the chlorides of nickel and cobalt; but it
requires the heat of red-hot coals to obtain it from chemi
cally pure chloride of sodium, potassium, or barium ; indeed in
the latter case the fire must be very intense, but there is then no
mistaking the characteristic violet. Chloride of zinc also exhi
bited it at this high temperature, and so did chloride of iron,
though less distinctly; but a doubt must rest on such observa
tions made with a coal-fire, as it is quite conceivable that these
chlorides may give up their chlorine to the alkalies or earths of
the ash.     Chloride of silver was doubtful; and I did not succeed
in obtaining the violet colour from either chloride of calcium,
lead, or manganese.
     That this light should be emitted from chemically pure chlo
 ride of barium at a very high temperature has a peculiar interest,
 since it was this chloride which first attracted Alexander Mitscher
 lich’s notice by green lines not belonging to barium, that make
 their appearance when it is ignited in association with chloride
 of ammonium. These green lines do not coincide with those of
 the violet flame.
     The question naturally arises, to what is this violet flame due
 Is it the chloride itself in the gaseous form that emits these rays
 when heated up to a certain temperature, which differs according
 to the metal with which the chlorine is combined? Or is the pecu
 liar flame produced by chlorine when the chloride is decomposed
  by heat? Or does it depend on the combination of the chlorine
  with the carbon or hydrogen of the combustible?             The latter
  supposition is negatived by the fact that anhydrous chloride of
  copper emits these rays equally whether it be placed in a flame of
  hydrogen or of pure bisulphide of carbon. It is difficult to accept
  the second supposition; for though chloride of copper or gold is
  certainly decomposed in the spirit-lamp flame, chloride of nickel
  or iron is so likewise, and chloride of mercury is reduced to the
  subchloride, and yet these last do not exhibit the coloured flame
  at that temperature.      Besides, a stream of chlorine or of hydro
  chloric acid passed into a flame never gives the violet light; nor
  does Dutch liquid, muriatic ether, or chloroform mixed with
   alcohol and burnt in a spirit-lamp.        The rays in question also
   appear to bear no relation to those emitted in Plücker’s       experi
  ments.     The   origin  of this violet   light  evidently,  therefore,
  requires further elucidation.

               following               summary
                                           nature and results of a

                                                of which have been
 communicatcd to the Royal Society.
    The investigations of the Astronomer Royal and of Mr. Stokes
 on the question of straight-crested parallel waves in a liquid are
 based on the supposition that the displacements of the particles
 are small compared with the length of a wave.                 Hence it has
 been very generally inferred that the results of those investiga
 tions, when applied to waves in which the displacements are
 considerable as compared with the length of wave, are only
 approximate.
    In the present paper the author proves that one of those
 results—viz. that in very deep water the particles move with a
 uniform angular velocity in vertical circles, whose radii diminish
 in geometrical progression with increased depth, and conse
 quently that surfaces of continuity and equal pressure, including
 the upper surface, are trochoidal—is exact for                possible dis            all
 placements, how great soever.
    The trochoidal form         waves was first explicitly described
                                       of                                                                      by

as independent of mine.          Considering the very different methods
which we have pursued, the general agreement between us must
be regarded as remarkable.
    The starting-point of Professor Magnus's investigation was the
interesting experiment of Mr. Grove, in which a platinum wire
raised to whiteness by an electric current is suddenly cooled by
an atmosphere of hydrogen.           This action, which we have hitherto

    While, however, in the case of the elementary gases the dis
crepancy between Professor Magnus and myself consists in a
defect on my part, or an excess on his, with the powerful gases
I  obtained a considerably stronger action than he does. Thus
with olefiant gas his absorption amounts to less than 54 per cent.,
whereas in mine it amounts to more than 72.       This last result
is only what might be expected, inasmuch as the length of gas
traversed by the radiant heat was in the one case a little under
15 inches, and in the other 33.
    Professor Magnus has further published an account of experi
ments in which a powerful gas-flame surrounded by a glass
cylinder furnished the source of heat, the latter being aug
mented by a parabolic mirror of polished metal placed behind
the lamp.     In this case the gases were enclosed in a glass tube
 1 metre long and 35 millims. in diameter, the two ends of which
were stopped with plates of glass 4 millimetres thick.
    Two series of experiments were executed with this tube, in
one of which the interior surface was covered with black paper,
while in the other the glass was uncovered within.     The former
method is that    pursued  by  Dr. Franz; and the result obtained
by Professor Magnus in the case of atmospheric air and oxygen
closely agrees with that obtained for the same gases by Dr.
 Franz.    Professor Magnus makes the absorption in the case of
the blackened tube about 2%, and Dr. Franz about 3 per cent.,
for air and oxygen.
    In the case of the unblackened tube, however, the absorption
was found to be much more considerable.    Here the absorp
tion by air and oxygen amounted to 14.75 per cent., and with
hydrogen it reached 1623. This great difference between the
unblackened and the blackened tube is ascribed by Professor
Magnus to a change of quality which the heat undergoes by                          its
reflexion from the interior glass surface.

the knowledge of this fact has rendered me careful to remove my
polished plates every evening from the apparatus, and to keep
them in perfectly dry air.     Still, when it is remembered that
the air on entering the tube is raised in temperature and thus
enabled to maintain a greater amount of vapour, and that the
tube and plates of rock-salt form the channel for a flux of heat
from the radiating source, the likelihood of precipitation occur
ring will seem but small. On examining the plates after the
undried air of the laboratory was experimented with, no trace of
precipitated moisture was observed upon their surfaces.

    It will be remembered that Professor Magnus obtained a
greater absorption with hydrogen than with either oxygen or
air. This result is perfectly explained by reference to the quicker
convection of this gas.                     I
                             operated with hydrogen as     did with                           I
air, first satisfying myself that a column of it 33 inches long
exercised an absorption less than unity: in fact it could not be
measured. The same hydrogen introduced into the first chamber,
and allowed to remain there for two minutes, caused a with
drawal of heat from the source equivalent to an absorption of 65.

 432                  Prof. Tyndall on the Absorption and
 incident on the interior surface being absorbed. Thus the plate
 of glass adjacent to the pile must be much more intensely heated
 with the unblackened tube than with the blackened one.           The
 difference in the amount of heat received      by  the pile-end plate
 in the respective cases is rendered very manifest by the experi
 ments of Professor Magnus himself; for he finds that, with the
 same source, twenty-six times the amount of heat transmitted
 by the coated tube is transmitted by the uncoated one. What,
 therefore, Professor Magnus ascribes to a change of quality by
                              I
 reflexion, would, if am correct, be due to the higher heating
 in the case of the naked tube, and consequent greater chilling by
 the cold air, of the plate of glass close to the pile.  To this must
 be added the effect produced by cooling the distant end of the
 tube itself, to which heat has been communicated from the first
 glass plate by the process of conduction, and the cooling of which
 comes most into play when the tube is uncovered.
    The difference between Professor Magnus and myself as regards
 the action of aqueous vapour admits now of easy explanation.
 His effect being one of convection, and not of absorption, the
 quantity of vapour present in his experiments—probably not
 more than 1 per cent. of the volume of the gas, certainly not 2
 per cent.—vanished as a convecting agent, in comparison with
 the air. .
        It
       is hardly necessary to repeat these reflections with reference
to the experiments of Dr. Franz.       The taking of the chilling of
his plates for absorption has caused him to find no difference of
effect when he doubled the length of his tube. With a tube 450
millimetres long, he finds precisely the same absorption as with
a tube of 900.     He finds the action of carbonic acid to be the
same as that of   air, although at atmospheric tensions the action
of the former is 90 times that of the latter*.         He finds the
vapour of bromine more destructive to radiant heat than nitrous
acid gas, whereas the latter is beyond comparison the most
destructive. The heat rendered latent by the evaporation of the
bromine of course augmented the chill, and thus magnified the
effect which in reality he was measuring.      In reference to heat
ing the glass plates by the flame made use of in his experiments,
 Iwill cite a single passage from the memoir of Dr. Franz.          It
refers to the vapour of iodine produced by throwing the sub
stance on a heated surface in a vessel closed with glass plates.
“The mirror,” he writes, “showed a deflection of only 178.
           sensible equality of

 asevident       by
                Dr. Franz.          “It

that no decided difference would be observed                    between them   ’’ (p. 342).
Similarly, Professor Magnus, speaking    aqueous     of         vapour, writes, “Although
  might beforeseen with certainty that the small                amount  of aqueous vapour
in it   the air could have   no   influence     on   the radiation,” &c. (p. 43).

But as the glass plates through which the heat radiated had not
yet assumed a temperature high enough to reduce the iodine,
which had been precipitated upon them in crystals, to a state of
vapour . . . . . it was necessary to wait, and allow the radiation
of the lamp to continue till                       all

For a given difference of density, is not the mobility of hydrogen
greater than that of the other gases? The experiments above
recorded, where different gases were brought into direct contact
with the source of heat, seem to answer this question in the
affirmative.         I
                 have had no time to pursue the question regard
                                     I
ing hydrogen; but have made a few experiments which show
the influence of density on the mobility of a gas in a very stri
king manner.
    Having first so purified atmospheric air as to render it sen
sibly neutral to radiant heat, I allowed 15 inches of it to enter
the front chamber F, and there to come into contact with the
                                                                                             of in,
source of heat.     Convection of course immediately set            and
its  amount was    accurately   measured        the  quantity         by
                                                                   heat
withdrawn from the radiating surface; this quantity, expressed
in  the units adopted throughout this memoir, was 62.
   The quantity       gas  of the front chamber was now doubled,
                                            in

double the amount         heat; but the fact

be  these velocities, we have
                                     6562

     Thus, while the atoms                        of   the rarer gas travel          62   units       in   a
second, those        ofthe denser gas travel only 34.

case,    of internal resistance.However this may be, the foregoing
experiment enables us to draw some important inferences.
    Storms at great heights must be greatly facilitated by the
mobility of the particles of the air.    In fact storms are cases of
convection on a large scale, and in our front chamber we had one
in miniature. With the same difference of temperature on the
summit of Mont Blanc, the motion of convection would be very
nearly twice as great as at the sea-level.
    In the summer of 1859. I was fortunate enough to induce my
friend Professor Frankland to accompany me to the summit of
Mont Blanc, and to determine the comparative rates of combus
tion there and in the valley of Chamouni.          Six candles were
purchased, burnt for an hour at Chamouni, and the loss of weight
determined. The same candles were lighted for the same time
on the summit of the mountain, and the consumption deter
mined. Within the limits of error, the consumption above was
equal to that below. The light below was immensely greater
than that above, still the amount of stearine consumed in the
two cases was sensibly the same.     Professor Frankland surmised
this to be due to the   greater  mobility  of the rarefied air, which
allowed a freer interpenetration of the flame by the oxygen +; and
the foregoing experiments show that the augmentation of mobi
lity is just such as would account for the observed effect.

           In examining the preceding observations, it will be seen that
      many of them indicate the compound nature of the spectrum, as
      explained in my paper “On a New Analysis of Solar Light”*.
      One of the most curious is the conversion of the blue space into
      violet, indicating that the red rays, which I suppose exist to a
      small extent in the blue space, have been less absorbed than the
      blue, and consequently that the blue space has thus become
      violet.
           M. Bérard, who               does not adopt my views, admits this                           import
      ant fact, but asserts that blue becomes violet by merely dimi
      nishing the intensity of     light. To me     its
                                                     appears   most                it                  a
      extraordinary opinion that       new colour should thus arise, and
                                                     a
      that red rays not previously seen should appear,                created,               or   be
      in  the blue    space     merely   by

448        Prof. Potter on the Definition of the Temperature of Bodies,
strictly scientific definition of the measurements of both caloric
and temperature, and the latter only imperfectly.            At page 20
of his Théorie Analytique de la Chaleur, he defines the unit of
caloric to be the quantity which will convert a unit of mass of ice
at the freezing-point into water at the same temperature; and if
a number C of these units will raise a unit of mass of any body
or substance through a temperature from 0 to 1, then C is the
specific capacity for heat of that substance; and if a quantity of
caloric 2C (where 2 may be positive or negative) is communicated
to the body, then z is the temperature communicated to                and                                      it,

452        Prof. Potter on the Definition                        of the    Temperature             of Bodies,
The discrepancies which were found between the scales led to
the conclusion that the divisions into equal intervals could not
apply accurately to all, though it has been taken to involve
uniform expansion. Thus if V is the volume of a body at any
given temperature, and 6V the increase of volume for each degree
of temperature, then 6W = constant was supposed to involve
uniform expansion. This is undoubtedly incorrect; for the
expansion of a body of volume V is the ratio of the incre
ment of V to V; or putting 8W for the increment, then the
expansion is            y;       and       if   the expansion             is constant or uniform,

46)                 Mr. G. B. Jerrard                    on some Objections
contends for the contradictory proposition that, in virtue of the
equation (ei), Lagrange's theory is not applicable to the case
u-a, v=a”, and he thus in effect treats the objection as a rele
vant one. It appears to me that the objection is not only a
relevant one, but that the proposition therein contended for is
completely proved; at any rate”—observe this —“the issue is
 so narrow a one that it seems useless to argue it further, and it
 is not my intention to do so.”
     By the word objection I have been accustomed to mean, “that
 which is presented in opposition; adverse reason or argument.”
 To me therefore it seems as clear as any axiom of Euclid that
  Mr. Cayley’s objection, in which (to use the very words quoted
  in art. 1) he merely occupies himself in proving what had taken                               I
for  granted, while he leaves untouched the main question to be                                               dis
 cussed, cannot rightly be classed with relevant objections.                                                  No
 matter what the subject in dispute                            is,   an
                                                objection characterized
 as above     is,hold, essentially irrelevant.

LXIII.  Explanations of Phenomena of Light on the Hypothesis of
 Undulations. By Professor CHALLis, M.A., F.R.S., F.R.A.S.*
                   I am about
            explanations              to propose rest on the hypo
THEthesis that the phenomena          of light are visible effects of
the motions and pressures of a continuous elastic fluid the pres
.
sure of which is proportional to the density.          This hypothesis
brings the facts to be explained into immediate connexion with
the hydrodynamical theorems of which                          I
                                               have given demonstra
tions in the Numbers of the      Philosophical     Magazine for June,
August, and October. The references to the theorems will be
       by means of the articles, numbered from 1 to 48, which
make up the three communications. . In the instances of several
of the more common phenomena, the theoretical explanations
are so obvious that little more is required than merely referring
to the articles. With respect to others, it will be necessary to
introduce some special considerations.          It      however,        is,                    to      be
understood   that, whether the  explanations        obvious      not, the
                                                                   be                 or

The distance                   r from
                           the axis is supposed to be always very small
 compared to X (see art. 44), for which reason                  is very nearly
 equal to unity in the expressions for w and a . That supposition
                                                                                           f
 has been made because the investigation of the above equations
 depends on the integrability of udz-H vily-H wax, and this condi
 tion is more strictly fulfilled in proportion as the distance from
 the axis is smaller (art. 20).           It          fact, assumed  is,   in

 It will   be seen from this expression that                            if   the phases c and c be
 the same, or differ by an even multiple of                                  * the two sets of un
 dulations are in exact accordance, and the resulting value of the
 maximum velocity is the sum of m and m'; but if the difference
 of phase be an odd multiple of *. that the undulations                                               are   in

difference of m and m'. In the latter case, if m=m', the velocity                                       of

Hence w and a will each be very small, on account of the small
ratios of y and a to A. And besides this, the dynamic effect of
the undulations in the direction of z must be estimated by the
sum of the values of a within a small circular space about the
axis.   But clearly within such a space the positive and negative
values of the right-hand side of the above equation are equal,
and the sum is consequently zero. Thus we may conclude that
when the difference of phase is an odd multiple of 3. the direct
 vibrations are wholly inoperative.       But experiment has proved
 that the   light perceived  in this case is precisely the same as in
 the other.      Hence it necessarily follows that the perception of
 light is in no degree affected by the direct vibrations, and that
 it is entirely due to transverse vibrations.
     This law being established, we may next conclude that the
 undulations of two oppositely polarized rays produce indepen
 dent luminous effects, simply for the reason that their transverse
 accelerative forces act in rectangular directions.     Also since, as
 is known     by experience, the luminous effect of a series of undu
 lations is independent of phase, it follows that the combined
 luminous effect of two oppositely polarized series is independent
 of difference of phase. Thus the theory explains the experi
 mental fact, that oppositely polarized rays having a common path
 do not interfere, whatever be the difference of their phases.
    It is shown above that the undulations of two oppositely
 polarized rays into which a primitive ray has been separated
 produce, when they have a common axis, the same luminous
 effect on the eye as the undulations of the primitive.        Hence,
 as the two rays are equal, the intensity of each polarized ray is
just half that of the primitive ray. This law may also be deduced
 from the principle that intensity is measured by the square of the
 velocity of vibration of the ather.    For, on this principle, if the
 velocity in the primitive ray be called $(r), and r make any
 angle a with the axis of w, the total intensities in the primitive
 and the polarized rays are respectively measured by

latter integrals are each equal to half the other.
    Having recently found that the resolution of a polarized ray
into two parts admits of a much more simple treatment than
that referred to in art. 42,                   I
                                propose to introduce here the dis
cussion of that  problem.    There are only two conditions which
the resolved parts of a polarized ray are required to satisfy, viz.
that the sum of their condensations at corresponding points be
equal to the condensation at the corresponding point of the
integral ray, and that the velocities at corresponding points be
the parts, resolved in directions parallel and perpendicular to the
 new plane of polarization, of the velocity in the integral ray at
 the same corresponding point.      Let that plane make the angle
6 with                                        of let               a2    be

Since, therefore, both the required conditions are satisfied by
means of the equations a 1–s cos” 6 and a 2–ssin” 6, it may be
concluded that these equations are true.
   From the above results it appears that the intensities of the
resolved rays are in the ratio of cos” 6 to sin” 6, and that the sum
of their intensities is equal to the intensity of the original ray.
If  6=45°, the two intensities are equal, and we have also

   The two rays of this second polarization, like those of the first,
produce independent luminous effects on the eye, because their
vibrations are in planes at right angles to each other. Hence, if
their phases be different, the total luminous effect will remain
the same.    The compound ray is not, however, identical in                                             its

nation of the development of heat caused by sudden compression
of the air was, the simple fact that the compression brings sud
denly fresh atoms into the space through which it extends, and
that these instantly become additional centres of secondary heat
undulations, as explained in my Mathematical Theory of Heat
contained in the Philosophical Magazine for March 1859. The
primary waves from which the secondary are produced, are the
heat-bearing waves traversing the space under the ordinary cir
cumstances of steady temperature. The new waves destroy for a
time the calorific equilibrium, and by propagation from their
centres are expended in raising the temperature of                     neighbour               all

system polarized perpendicularly to the plane of incidence will be
quite independent of each other, and the equality between the radiation
incident externally and that proceeding in the contrary direction, and
made up partly of a refracted and partly of an externally reflected radia
tion, must hold good for each system separately.          In this case, then,
(2) will split  into two  equations,  each of the form  (1), R now standing
for half the whole     radiation, and  R', A', &c. standing  for R,      &c.,         A,
or  R,  A,  &c.,   as the case  may  be.   It need hardly  be remarked that
the value of A is different in the two cases, and that R' has a value
which is no longer, as in the case of an isotropic medium, alike in all
directions.    In determining according to Mr. Stewart's principles the
internal radiation in any given direction within a uniaxal crystal, no
limitation is introduced by the restriction of equation (1) to a principal
plane, since we are at liberty to imagine the crystal bounded by a plane
perpendicular to that containing the direction in question and the
axis of the crystal.
    Mr. Stewart further reduces equation (1) by remarking that in an
isotropic medium, as we have reason to believe,                     A'-A,
                                                                and that the
same law probably holds good in a crystal also, so that the equal
factors 1—A, 1–A' may be struck out.               Arago long ago showed
experimentally that light is reflected in the same proportion exter
mally and internally from a plate of glass bounded by parallel sur
faces; and the formulae which Fresnel has given to express, for the
case of an isotropic medium, the intensity of reflected light, whether
polarized in a plane parallel or perpendicular to the plane of incidence,
are consistent with this law.       In a paper published in the fourth
volume of the Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal (p. 1),
I  have given a very simple demonstration of Arago's law, based on
the sole hypothesis that the forces acting depend only on the positions
of the particles. This demonstration, I may here remark, applies
without change to the case of a crystal whenever the plane of inci
dence is a plane of optical symmetry.         It may be rendered still more
general by supposing that the forces acting depend, not solely on the
positions of the particles, but also on any differential coefficients of the
coordinates which are of an even order with respect to the time,           a
generalization which appears not unimportant, as it is applicable to
that view of the mutual relation of the ether and ponderable matter,
according to which the ether is compared to a fluid in which a number
of solids are immersed, and which in moving as a whole is obliged to
undergo local dislocations to make way for the solids.
   On striking out the factors 1—A and 1–A', equation (1) is re

whole, neglecting as insignificant the chromatic variations of reflecting
power.     Let p be the fraction of the incident light reflected at the
first surface of a plate. Then 1–p may be taken as the intensity of
the transmitted light*. Also, since we know that light is reflected
in the same proportion externally and internally at the two surfaces of
a plate bounded by parallel surfaces, the same expressions p and 1–
will serve to denote the fractions reflected and transmitted at the
second surface.  We may calculate p in accordance with Fresnel's

whence the equations     (6), (7) are easily verified. This verification
seems   necessary in logical strictness, because we have no right to
assume à priori that it is possible to satisfy (6) and (7) for general
values of the variables; and in deriving the equation(10), the equations
(6) and (7) were only assumed to hold good for general values of
m and infinitely small values of n.
   The equations (13), (14) give the following quasi-geometrical
construction for solving the problem:-Construct a triangle of which
the sides represent in magnitude the intensity of the incident, reflected,
and refracted light in the case of a single plate, and then, leaving
the first side and the angle opposite to the third unchanged, multiply
the angle opposite to the second by the number of plates; the sides
of the new triangle will represent the corresponding intensities in the
case of the system of plates.        I say quasi-geometrical, because the
construction cannot actually be effected, inasmuch as the first side
of our triangle is greater than the sum of the two others, and the
angles are imaginary.
   To adapt the formulae (13), (14) to numerical calculation, it will
be convenient to get rid of the imaginary quantities.            Putting

     In this case it is evident that each of the 2m reflecting surfaces
 might be regarded as a separate plate reflecting light in the proportion
 of p to 1, and therefore we ought also to have, writing 2m for m and
p for r in the denominators of the equations (19),

     The following Table gives the intensity of the light reflected from
or transmitted through a pile of m plates for the values 1, 2, 4, 8,
 16, 32, and oo of m, for three degrees of transparency, and for certain
selected angles of incidence.        The assumed refractive index u is
 1:52,    5–1—e-4T is the loss by absorption in a single transit of a
plate at a perpendicular incidence, so that 3–0 corresponds to per
fect transparency. The most interesting angles of incidence to select
appeared to be zero and the polarizing angle watan- p. ; but in the
case of perfect transparency the result has also been calculated for an
angle of incidence a little (2°) greater than the polarizing angle,            4,
denotes the intensity of the reflected and i<U+017F> that of the transmitted
light, the intensity of the incident light being taken at 1000.              For
oblique incidences it was necessary to distinguish between light po
larized in and light polarized perpendicularly to the plane of inci
dence; the suffixes 1, 2 refer to these two kinds respectively.              For
oblique incidences a column is added giving the ratio of b, to b,
which may be taken as a measure of the defect of polarization of the
transmitted light. No such column was required for 6=0 and                i-w,
because in this case     <U+017F>º- 1000.
   * From a paper by M. Wild in Poggendorff’s “Annalen' [vol. ix. (1856) p. 240]
I  find that the formulae for the particular case of perfect transparency have
already been given by M. Neumann. His demonstration does not appear to have
been published.

  “On the Motions of Camphor on the Surface of Water.” By
Charles Tomlinson, Esq.
  The object of this paper is to show that the phenomenon in ques
tion is a much more general one than is commonly supposed; that
the explanations hitherto given of it have been insufficient or erro
neous.    The author endeavours to explain the real nature of the
  henomenon in a series of experiments and observations, and to esta
blish the following propositions:—
   I. That the camphors, or stearoptens of the volatile oils, present
phenomena of rotation and progression when thrown on the surface of
clean water in a chemically clean vessel.
      II.
        That these phenomena belong also to certain salts, and to a
variety of vegetable and other substances containing a liquid that
diffuses readily over the surface of water.
      III.That solutions of camphor in benzole, in some of the essential
oils, &c., present phenomena of rotation and progression on the sur
face of water—a property which also belongs to creosote, and to some
other liquids that do not contain camphor.
    IV. That the motions of camphor may be imitated by placing on
water miniature rafts or coracles of inert substances, such as talc,
tinfoil, paper, &c., smeared with or containing the elaeoptens of vola
tile oils, or indeed any volatile liquid, such as ether, alcohol, chloro
form, &c., provided there be some communication and adhesion be
 tween such liquid and the surface of the water.
    V. That the camphors, &c., being slightly soluble in water, that                                             is,
                         of of of

 contact therewith.
      VI. That  the dimensions and form            this film depend     ofthose                            on
 of the piece            of
                  camphor operated            and,                 on
                                                       general, the film sepa
                                                                    ;         in
 rates more easily from broken surfaces and angles               the fragment                    of
 than from     smooth natural surface, just

                                                                         broken                        or

                                         is       perfect  crystal.     a
    VII. That such films being constantly detached from the cam
 phor      long
             so              contact with the water, displace each other;
                              as    it   is

                                                                              of of
 the   preceding  film   being    conveyed away         the adhesion         the                            of
                  lines,  these produce motion,                        the frag       by              on
                                                                                 a by
 water       in

                        rotate after the manner           Barker's mill.
    VIII. That these radial lines jets being unequal intensity, the

    IX. That the jets                     camphor can         of                           be

 by                              fixing the camphor partly submerged
                                                                                                                 be a in
     various means—as

 made visible, which films                               or
                                      jets cause the camphor, when free
 to move,         to
              rotate on vertical axis.    a

   X. That the motions of the fragments of camphor on water are
greatly influenced and complicated by their mutual attraction and
by the attraction of the sides of the vessel.
   XI. That the film of camphor diffused over the surface of the
water is very volatile, disappearing as fast as it is formed, chiefly into
the air, only a very small portion being retained by the water.
Hence camphor wastes away much more quickly at the surface of the
water than in water alone or in air alone, because at the surface the
film is being constantly formed at the expense of the camphor, and
is spread out to the united action of air and water.
   XII. That whatever interferes with evaporation lowers or arrests
the motions of the camphor and the allied phenomena; so, on the
contrary, whatever promotes evaporation exalts these phenomena.
Effects which are displayed with great energy on a bright and sunny
day, are produced either sluggishly or not at                wet, dull,        all    on   a                    or
foggy one.
   XIII.That    fixed   a         oil
                          forming film              a              on
                                             water will displace the
camphor film, and     permanently arrest the motions
                            so                             the cam                             of
phor; but volatile
               a              oil
                        will only arrest the motions while      pre                                  it   is
sent and undergoing evaporation.
   XIV. That the presence                 of
                                   the camphor film        water will,                on                         in
some   cases, prevent  the formation      other  films,  the liquids that
                                                        of
would otherwise form them     remaining  lenticular.
   XV. That the camphor film, and other films,          many cases repel        in
each other on the surface of water.
    XVI. That the motions
                                                              of on
                                 camphor of    the surface       water are                      of
accelerated        by
                 the action          of
                               the vapour       benzole, and some other
volatile substances: such vapours, condensing         the liquid form      in                                    on
the camphor, and then being diffused         the adhesion    by the water,                     of
 react   on
          the camphor.

   2. “On a Deposit containing Diatomaceæ, Leaves, &c., in the
Iron-ore Mines near Ulverston.” By Miss E. Hodgson.
   The object of this paper was to show that this deposit, which was
first described by Mr. Bolton in the Society's Journal, vol. xviii.
p. 274, and considered by him to be of lacustrine origin, was
deposited in a large cavern or chain of caverns by a subterranean
stream, originating probably in a brook called the “Poaka Beck.’
The authoress first described in detail some of the various caverns
and swallow-holes which abound in the limestone of the district;
and then alluded to the current belief of their communication
with    each other, and with springs.         Miss Hodgson also remarked
that, prior to the year 1842, the Poaka Beck, after having become
 partially engulfed at Inman Gill, is said to have taken a sub
terranean course.        Since the above-named date, its course has been
diverted.     Mr. Bolton's sections were then critically examined; and
the paper concluded with a list of the Diatomaceae found in the
deposit, with notes on the places where they occur in the streams
of the district, and with some remarks on the vegetable remains.

By Capt. F. Applegath, Madras Army.
    The sections in the country west of the Palair River and north of .
the Kistna River, described by the author, show the existence of a
synclinal in which the following rocks occur, beginning westward
and ascending :-Dark-coloured Schist, Red Schist, Black Lime
stone, and Variegated Schist, the last forming the uppermost bed;
from thence descending and proceeding eastward:—Limestone,
Micaceous Schists, and Olive and Brown Schists.                 The last bed
lies unconformably upon Flagstone, which is succeeded by coarse
Sandstone, and Gneiss forms the basement bed.

Kingston.”        By J. G. Sawkins, Esq., F.G.S. In a letter to Sir R.
I. Murchison, F.G.S. &c.
    The occasion of this letter was the discovery by the author of a
granitic formation traversing Jamaica in a direction from S.E. to
N.W., being the same as that of the earthquake-shocks.              It pierces
the Carbonaceous        series, and also the    Tertiary  strata, whence the
author concludes that it is of Tertiary age.             It usually contains
 copper-ores, and is often more or less decomposed.

ON    THE MODIFICATIONS WHICH THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT EX
    PERIENCES IN GLASS AND MANY OTHER BODIES UNDER THE
    INFLUENCE OF HEAT.             B.Y. M. H. FIZEAU.
Th; following
       shortly   to be
                       is an analysis of the more complete memoir which is
                        published   in the Annales de Chimie et de Physique.
    In the first  part  several  experiments   are adduced relative to inter
 ference-phenomena, observed with the yellow light emitted by a
 monochromatic lamp.           Making the experiment of Newton's rings

with this light, the two surfaces between which the interferences are
produced could be removed to a distance of 15 millimetres, and still
the existence of distinctly visible rings was confirmed.        The differ
ence between the path of the rays was then about 50,000 undula
tions.      Similar observations could be made with plates of glass
whose faces are virtually parallel; and by observing in a perpendicular
direction the light reflected from their surfaces, very beautiful inter
ference-fringes could be seen even when the thickness of the glass
amounted to 10 millimetres.
    Under these circumstances the temperature is seen to exert a very
marked influence on the position of the fringes; so that, heating the
glass a certain number of degrees, the fringes on the surface are
displaced a quantity proportional         to the excess of temperature.
This     displacement,   which    may  be accurately measured, may be
referred to two      very   distinct actions of heat: first, to expansion,
which increases the thickness of the glass and consequently the
 difference in path of the two rays; secondly, to a modification in
the velocity of light, and hence in the refractive index.     But, knowing
the coefficient of the expansion of glass and the temperature, we can
calculate by how much the fringes ought to be displaced by this
 cause alone, and then compare the result of calculation with that
 of observation.
    Thus there are          all

 fications which may         produced.
                                  be
    This furnishes      method which may without difficulty

parallel faces.
     The second part          of
                        the memoir contains the results        several                 of

ON MAGNETIZING STEEL NEEDLES BY THE CURRENT OF A LEY DEN
                 JAR. BY DR. PAALZOW.
   From the fact that a steel needle, by the discharge of a Leyden
jar, may be abnormally      magnetized, that is to say in a direction
contrary to that required by Ampère's rule, Savary and Helmholtz
concluded that there must be an alternating motion of the electricity
in the circuit of a Leyden jar. I imagined I had found in the phe
nomena of Geissler's tubes a means by which it could be decided
whether the discharge was simple or alternating; with             help                                  its         it

  From Wiedemann's experiments, needles in which the magnetism
could be increased or reversed by striking must have been previously
magnetized in the opposite direction; only one discharge of the bat
tery had magnetized the needles, and therefore these discharges must
have taken place in opposite directions.     Hence it appears to me
justifiable to regard the occurrence of abnormal magnetism as a sign
 of the alternating direction of the discharge of the Leyden jar.—

      NOTE ON THE          LIMIT OF THE CHARGE OF CONDENSERS.
                                 BY M. GAUGAIN.
   The charge of any given condenser placed in connexion with the
ground depends on the greater or less time during which the action
of the source is continued; at least this is the case when the dielec
tric is a solid body.   Hence in the case of solid dielectrics, the ex
pression representing the quantity of electricity accumulated on the
armatures of a condenser ought to be a function of the time during
which the condenser is placed in connexion with the source. But
although, theoretically speaking, the state of equilibrium ought only
to be established after the lapse of an infinite time, in point of fact
the increase of the charge becomes inappreciable after a certain
number of hours, which is never very considerable when the dielectric
 is not very thick; hence it might be proposed to determine experi
 mentally the value of the greatest charge which a given condenser
 could take when the action of the electrical source is infinitely pro
 longed.    The determination of this limiting charge presents no par
 ticular difficulty; it only requires considerable time, seeing that a
 single experiment may last several days.
    I generally worked with small insulating discs with plane surfaces,
 and with plane metallic armatures applied directly on the solid
 dielectric.
    I first endeavoured to ascertain the relation between the limiting
 charge and the thickness of the dielectric, and I found that this
 thickness is quite indifferent.     This result appeared to be opposed to
 that obtained when the air is taken for a dielectric ; in this case I
 have already shown that the charge is almost inversely as the thick
 ness of the layer of air, at least when this thickness is very small in
 reference to the surface of the armatures.       But it is not difficult to
 explain this divergence, from considerations which I have presented
 in a previous note. In fact, an air condenser is a simple condenser,
 while a condenser with a solid dielectric is really a battery by cas
 cade. The imaginary solid dielectric (sulphur, shell-lac, or gutta
 percha) is a true conductor.       The dielectric is really the air which
 separates the insulating disc from      its
                                           armatures.      Regarding matters
 in  this light, it will    be

 charge, but only the time necessary           obtain equilibrium; and

 fact, to  obtain    limiting charge, the time required

       LXVI.     On Asterism and Brewster's Luminous Figures.
                        By Prof. von KobrLL*.
                            [With Three Plates.]
            beautiful phenomena of asterism, which were long only
THE      known in the case of sapphire and garnet, have been
further studied in the investigations of Brewster+, Babinett, and
VolgerS, and have been shown to exist in many minerals. Babinet
has described them as phenomena of gratings; and the simpler
of them may indeed be easily produced by cutting suitable
systems of close parallel lines either in a smooth copper plate, or
by ruling them on a glass plate covered with copper or silver.
By means of a candle in an otherwise dark room, and with one
system of such lines, one band of light is seen which cuts the
lines at right angles; with two systems of lines crossing at right
angles, a rectangular luminous cross is seen, or, if the bands cut
at an acute angle, it is oblique; with three systems drawn to the
 sides of a triangle, a six-rayed luminous star; with radial lines
 proceeding from a centre, a parhelial circle is seen under certain
 angles of incidence.
    The last phenomenon is often seen through a piece, about an
 inch long, of an ordinary glass rod (one-third of an inch thick),
 the ends of which are polished quite smooth. Viewed at a cer
 tain distance from a candle-flame, the glass being slightly
 inclined, a circular luminous ring is visible through these ter
 minal faces, in which the flame always stands in a point of the
 periphery.       In polarized light such glass cylinders show the
 cross through the faces mentioned.           A cylinder of homogeneous
 glass which does not polarize does not give the phenomenon; but,
 on the other hand, it is not every polarizing glass which does. In

 498                 Prof. Kobell on Asterism and
 crystals and aggregates of crystals a perfectly closed parhelial circle
 is seldom witnessed.     But Professor Plücker has a calcite which
 even shows   through   the cleavage-planes two such circles or rings
 of light, which touch in the image of the flame of the candle, and
 which, according to the inclination of the crystals, are either seen
 near one another or in one another.       Babinet has ascribed such
 phenomena to a fibrous structure, and to the corresponding
 cleavage of the crystal. Volger has noticed that veryoften the junc
 tion-faces of a twin crystal are the cause, and that the asterism of
 a striated external face often changes when such a face is ground
 away and then the polished faces are looked through.          Neither
 of them mention the investigations which Brewster made on the
 subject simultaneously with Babinet, and in which partly he
 observed corroded faces of natural occurrence, and partly, by
 superficial corrosion (Aetzen), or by rough polishing, made the
 inner structure active for the light. In this manner Brewster
 has examined crystals of topaz, garnet, amphibole, aximite, bora
 cite, Liparite, magnetite, amethyst, diamond, and by corrosion
 crystals of calcite, alum, Liparite, apophyllite, acetate of copper
and lime, sulphate of potash, &c.
 • In the corrosions, in which he used water, hydrochloric        acid,
nitric acid, and also hydrofluoric acid, he observed that, accord
ing to the nature of the corroding agent, the figures are changed,
and that by mechanical grinding on a polishing-stone, or with a
rasp or file, similar figures are produced, though not pure, and
remarkably altered in position as compared with those formed by
corrosion. These figures appear in reflected light (of a candle
flame), and also in transmitted light; and if the corroded face is
printed in isinglass, may be investigated in transmitted light.
    Brewster has investigated more accurately only the crystals of
the tesseral, hexagonal, and quadratic systems; he could obtain
no definite results for the rhombic, klinorhombic, and klino
rhomboidal systems.
    The following observations may serve as a contribution to the
knowledge of this asterism.
    When crystal-faces are to be observed by corrosion, care is to
be taken that these faces are smooth and reflecting, and to begin
with the feeblest corrosion.      For salts very soluble in water, I
have used the     following  process.   I moistened a piece of fine
cloth with paper and left a part near it dry; I then laid the
crystal face upon the dry part, and moved it into the moist part
and immediately back again: according to circumstances, this
was repeated several times.      The cloth is laid on a piece of glass.
The observation is made with a candle-flame, and best in a room
which is otherwise dark; and the crystal is held between the
thumb and fore finger of both hands, close to the candle, in order

                              Brewster's Luminous Figures.                                                 499
that the incidence of the light may be as nearly normal as possible.
The crystal is then turned until the image of the reflexion of
light is distinctly seen on the surface, and thereby the eye
brought as near it as possible. On the table, and at the place
above which the crystal is seen, a dead-black paper is laid.         If
the  transparency  is enough  to allow transmitted    light to be seen,
the crystal is held with the thumb and forefinger as previously
described, so as to cut off the lateral light as much as possible
close to the eye, and the flame looked at through                                         it.    It   is   to   be
observed that the luminous figure        mostly first distinctly seen
                                                                      is

                                          three steps from the flame.
In  judging the luminous image,                  considered whether
                                                          it               be

only one face,               or   at
                        the same time         parallel, was corroded,
because the latter often gives the picture        the first inverted;      of
thus, for example,                 in
                         one corroded face     three-rayed star        a                                   is   to

                                                     if
roded.
        The images are very beautiful when the crystalline laminae
are fastened    piecesin   cork, and the flame looked
                                        of               through                                at

former, by superficial corrosion, a rectangular cross is produced,
and in the latter a luminous band lying in the short diagonal of
the dodecahedral surface.     These images are not changed by hy
drochloric acid. The rectangular cross upon the hexahedral sur
face shows itself parallel to the sides and to the diagonals of the
surfaces; the first remains rectangular even with obliquely inci
dent light, the latter becomes acute-angled. Potash-alum, ammo
nia-alum, and chrome-alum comport themselves quite in the same
way.    The three-rayed star of the octahedral surfaces are also
often seen in natural crystals of Liparite and magnetite.
   If an octahedral face of Liparite is rubbed smooth upon a rough
broad file, and then the surface purified with water and dried,
the three-rayed star is also seen in incident light, the rays directed
to the angles of the triangle.     On a hemitropic crystal of nitrate
of strontia an inch  long, the star on the octahedron faces was like
fig. 4 (corroded with water), and the rays did not proceed at
right angles to the junction edge of the octahedral or cubic faces,
or to the angles of the octahedral face, but were at an acute
angle thereto. By repeated corroding with water the cubic faces
showed fig. 5.

   In the quadratic system, distinctly observed, upon looking at
a candle-flame through the basal face of the tabular crystals of
the apophyllite of Fassa, a luminous cross in the direction of the

   On the faces of the quadratic pyramid in phosphate of ammonia
and arseniate of potash, after slight corrosion with water, the
reflected image of a three-rayed star is seen; the rays of which,
however, do not proceed to the angles of the triangle, as in the
case of the octahedron, but towards the sides, and cut under
angles of two kinds, as do the normals to these sides.
   In the hexagonal system, calcite, by corrosion with hydro
chloric and nitric acids, presents beautiful phenomena, which
Brewster has already partially described.      The crystal is dipped
in the acid and then in the water, and dried with a soft piece of
linen.   By immersion in hydrochloric acid (one volume of acid
to seven of water) the luminous figure 7 is obtained on the surface
of the cleavage-rhombohedron; the short ray r proceeding to
the corner edge often lengthens like the rest, by being corroded
in the manner described, and luminous rays result, becoming
broader outwards, which are seen with great beauty in trans
mitted light. The change which fig. 7 undergoes when the
crystal is immersed in nitric acid (diluted with one volume of
water) is very surprising; fig. 8 is then seen.      By this figure it
may easily be recognized whether a crystal has been immersed

                       Brewster's Luminous Figures.                                          501
in nitric acid or not; and hydrochloric and nitric acid can be
distinguished by means of the figures.     In such corrosion,
microscopic triangles are formed upon the rhombohedral surface,
one point of which is directed towards the vertical solid angle,
and therefore opposite the ray r. These triangles arise from
depressions which correspond to a three-sided pyramid (the
vertical top-piece of a rhombohedron).
   In transmitted light the phenomena are as follows:—When
one face was corroded with hydrochloric acid, a star was seen con
sisting of three pencils of light becoming broader on the outside;
when at the same time the opposite parallel face was corroded,
the star appeared six-rayed.     If two parallel faces were corroded
with nitric acid, on looking through the crystal an acute-angled
cross was seen, with spots of light in the obtuse angles.                 The
deportment of the so-called Streifenspath is also interesting: it is
a hemitrope of a rhombohedron in oscillatorial repetition, where
the face of rotation is —#R.        One surface of the cleavage-rhom
bohedron is striated in the direction of the long diagonal, the
rest are smooth.        If a candle-flame is looked at from some
distance through the latter faces, by holding the principal
section (through the vertical solid angle) in a vertical position,
rhomboids appear like fig. 9, whose point of intersection show
the flame partially with prismatic colours. Through the striated
surface this face is only seen distorted.         If such a crystal is cor
roded, the smooth faces also appear corroded like fig. 10, face
b and c; and on looking through against a flame, a band of light
appears cutting these lines at right angles, in which the flame
appears in spots of light at equal distances.

gonal of the face; on the basal surface a regular three-rayed
star is also seen, whose rays are directed to the junction edges
with the rhombohedron of cleavage.        Sometimes a fourth ray
goes through the star, dividing the angle of 120°.
   The phenomenon presented by dolomite is like that of calcite
when a cleavage-piece is corroded with hydrochloric acid, by
leaving it for a few days in the acid, or accelerating the action
by heating. But the reflected image is different from that of
calcite, in that the angle a between the rays is notably obtuser,
and that the ray r is very short, and not, as in calcite, turned
towards the lateral edge, but towards the vertical edge.         In this
corrosion, dull and striated bevelled edges are observed on the
vertical faces.
    With nitric acid I only obtained distorted pictures; even with
rough polishing I could not obtain the bandoflight as with calcite.
    ln the magnesite of Snarum in Norway, when a cleavage piece
is boiled for some time in hydrochloric acid, the image of reflexion
islike that of dolomite—though the angle between a is still greater,
and the ray r very short but also turned towards the vertical
solid angle.
    Siderite (from Nassau), when boiled in hydrochloric acid,
behaved like dolomite.
    In the rhombic system I observed in the basal faces of tolerably
large crystals of tartrate of soda and potash, which had been
moistened with water and then rubbed over with a dry cloth, the
beautiful reflected figure 12, which by frequent corrosion under

    In formate of strontia there is a cross in the direction of the
diagonals of the rectangular tabular crystals.         In the tabular
crystals of ferridcyanide of potassium, when corroded by being
breathed upon, there appears a beautiful oblique luminous cross
towards the junction edge with the pyramid, and a band at right
angles to the axis like fig. 15.        By further careful corrosion
fig. 16 appears.    On the surface small rhombohedra are visible
in the position indicated by figs. 15 and 16. The luminous
figures are seen of especial beauty in incident light when the
crystalline lamina is held in a blackened piece of paste

    In the klinorhombic system, could observe beautiful crystals
of sulphate of magnesia and ammonia. The lateral faces of the
 prism of 109°, 12° show the reflected images Plate IV. fig. 17,
 and in the following order:-the faces 1 and 2 adjacent to the
klinodiagonal principal section on the front side of the hendyop
 hedron (hence the terminal face inclined towards the observer);
the parts of the cross a inclined upwards towards the obtuse lateral
 edge on the terminal face, but b inclined downwards; in like man
 ner, but turned in front, these crosses show themselves upon the
 surfaces 3 and 4 at the back of the hendyochedron.            The iso
 morphous compounds, sulphate of nickel and ammonia, protosul
phate of iron and ammonia, sulphate of nickel and potash, and the
 corresponding cobalt-salt, exhibit a similar deportment.
     In a very beautiful crystal of sulphate of manganese and am
 monia, the right half of the cross-arm c in the face 2 was shorter,
 and limited by an elliptical spot; the left arm of the cross cor
 responding to face 3 was similar.      Sulphate of owide of copper and
 potash showed this figure of reflexion but indistinctly.
     When a plate of gypsum is dipped for a few days in water, or
 for a shorter time in dilute hydrochloric acid, the perfect cleavage
 plate in reflected and transmitted light shows a beautiful band of
 light, rectangular or almost rectangular to the cleavage-face,
 which is characterized by the conchoidal fracture fig. 18.
     In the klinorhomboidal    system, I observed sulphate of copper,
 fig. 19. With a very slight corrosion there was exhibited on the
 face p' a cruciform ray of light, fig. 20; on p a band of light
 (fig. 21) rectangular to the edge of the prism; and on the terminal
 face o the reflected image fig. 22; in a certain direction the
 trefoil inclined towards the solid angle ee. These images were
 observed    in two very beautiful crystals with smooth faces; in
  general the faces of this crystal are not smooth enough.

 figures are distinctly shown; in many salts which I further

roding substance than water is necessary.
   Leydolt's microscopic observations of corroded surfaces have
indeed shown that crystals consist of molecules whose forms
belong to the crystalline series of the regularly built aggregate;
and the investigations of Volger and Scharff have proved that
the structure is manifold and complex: Brewster’s luminous
figures show this in a still higher degree.       How must a position
of the molecules and a difference in their     particles  be constituted,

corroded with nitric acid to what it does when corroded with

Hence the ratio of the increase of gravity between the equator
and the poles, under this new arrangement, to gravity itself
=#(e–Am): and the ratio which this increase bears to the
actual increase as determined by pendulum experiments

The effect, then, would be to reduce everywhere the gain of the
seconds' pendulum over the rate at the equator by very nearly
one-half the number of beats at present observed.
    Experiment shows no sudden changes, nor any marked devia
tion from a regular increase, varying as the change in the square
of the latitude, in the rates of the pendulum in passing from the
equator to the poles. Hence the excess of matter above the
homogeneous spheroid cannot be distributed irregularly.               If we
suppose it distributed in exact spherical shells, as above, the
effect on the pendulum would be very great, and therefore very
perceptible. Any departure in the strata from the spherical
form, not towards the oblate spheroids of the fluid theory, but
in the opposite direction, would produce a result still more dis
cordant with experiment; whereas every approach in the distri
 bution towards those spheroids will bring the calculation into
 nearer accordance with fact. No stronger testimony can well be
 borne to the truth of the fluid arrangement, and therefore also
to the fluid theory, as we cannot otherwise conceive what cause
can have made the interior strata to bulge out at their equators.

 the points which has given him most anxiety had been the selec

 these instruments, and that his present remarks were confined to
 the great Theodolite with a horizontal circle 3 feet in diameter,

Paris. The inquiries I made in various quarters satisfied me that
this metal possessed most valuable qualities, but I failed in my
endeavours to obtain reliable numerical data for comparing it
with other metals.       I therefore instituted experiments on the                             it,

 not quite sound.
    “In the above-cited report Mr. Anderson gives a higher ten
 sile strength to gun-metal than before, namely, 17 tons (38,080
 lbs.) for the average of the ‘best specimens’ tested at the gun
 factories.
    “Combining the results, we have the average breaking tensile
 strength of the two metals as follows:—

the ratio being 1 to 0:48, or rather more than 2 to 1, in favour
 of aluminium bronze.
    “For the purpose of comparing the tenacity of the new alloy
 with steel, we have data given by Mr. Anderson in a lecture” on
 Materials for Rifled Cannon, in which he states that cast steel
 varies in tensile strength from 114,000 to 67,000 lbs. per square
 inch; but he objects to the higher qualities as liable to brittle
 ness, and prefers, where great strains are in question, an average
 quality of cast steel breaking at 80,000 lbs. ; and he adds that
 specimens from a gun made of Krupp's famous cast steel, cha
racterized by “softness” (which Mr. Anderson considers favour
 able to tenacity) and ‘perfect soundness,” gave 72,000 lbs. per
square inch, which we see is 1185 lbs. less than the average
 strength of aluminium bronze above given.
    “(2) Resistance to Compression.—Mr. Anderson reports on
this as follows:—
    “‘The ultimate amount of compression applied was 59 tons
2 cwt. 1 qr. 4 lbs. (132,416 lbs.), under which the speciment
became too much distorted to permit of more weight being
applied with any true result. Compression was not perceptible
until 9 tons 2 cwt. per square inch (20,384 lbs.) was applied,
when the specimen suddenly gave to the extent of 006 of an
inch, and on the weight being removed an elasticity of "001 was
observed, which gives the first permanent compression as ‘005
of an inch.”
    “The compressive strength of cast iron varies a good deal.

under compression is so different, cast iron yielding suddenly
and almost totally, and the new alloy more gradually and par
tially. Astronomical instruments, however, are more dependent
on the rigidity or resistance to a transverse force than to any
other quality.
    “(3) Malleability.—Mr.  Anderson states on this head:—
    “‘The qualities of this   metal for forging-purposes would
appear to be excellent; with the exception of the part heated
to a red heat in the shade,    show that        all
                                                  good workable             it   is   a

    “I  may add that there were specimens        the Exhibition,                  in
showing that the alloy could                          be
                                  drawn out under the hammer

   “Hence aluminium bronze would appear        times more                            to   be   3
rigid than gun-metal, and upwards 44 times more rigid than        of

parative one.     Messrs. Simms found that aluminium bronze                      ‘

   “(8)    Resistance    to atmospheric       influences.—Messrs. Simms
state, ‘it  does not readily tarnish.’         This, likewise, is entirely a
relative  question.     Absolute     inoxidizability,      however desirable,
is hardly to be expected.        Suffice it that the new alloy tarnishes
 much less   readily  than   any  metal usually employed for astrono
mical   instruments,     viz., gun-metal,       brass, silver, cast iron, or
steel.
   “(9)   Fitness   to   receive graduation.—Messrs.           Simms state,
‘Aluminium bronze takes a fine              division,    and it will not be
necessary to inlay another metal, as is usually done, to receive
the graduation.” This opinion is fully justified by the specimen
of graduation executed by Messrs. Simms, the lines of which are
remarkably pure and equable, characteristics never presented, in
the same degree, they inform me, by lines cut on any other cast
metal.    May not this superiority indicate that the alloy in ques
tion is   peculiarly   homogeneous           The lines are very distinct
under the microscope, notwithstanding the yellow colour of the
metal.
   “(10) Elasticity.—I possess no direct experiments bearing
on this point.     But that the alloy has considerable elasticity is
unquestionable.       I  may here state that an eminent Parisian
instrument-maker informed me that, of all the wires tried for
the suspension of Foucault's pendulum for illustrating the rota
tion of the earth, none, not even those of steel, were so durable
under that severe ordeal as wires made of aluminium bronze.
It would appear, therefore, to be the most proper material for
the suspension springs of clock pendulums.
   “(11)    Fitness for being made into tubes.—It admits of every
process   necessary for this purpose.              It can be soldered with
either silver or brass solder; it can be rolled into sheet metal;
and it can be hammered and drawn.                Hitherto telescope tubes,
the cones of transit      axes, the    pillars   of altazimuths, &c., have
been made almost exclusively         of yellow brass, a metal very defi
cient in rigidity.      Gun-metal does not admit of being rolled,
and has therefore never been used for the tubular parts of instru
ments, for which the new alloy seems pre-eminently suitable.
   “(12) Specific gravity.—The specific gravities of alloys of
aluminium and copper, as determined by Messrs. Bell, are
                   ,
            3 per cent. of aluminium

   “The present price of the English-made 10 per cent, alumi
nium bronze is 6s. 6d. per lb.; but there is reason to believe
that, as the process of extracting the aluminium becomes more
largely practised, and the demand for the metal increases, the
price will fall. The above price is four or five times that of gun
metal. A much smaller quantity, however, of the new alloy than
of gun-metal will give the same strength; and when it is con
sidered how small a ratio the cost of the material bears to the
cost of workmanship in refined apparatus, it will be found that

     To investigate two spectra which are not very complicated, two
tubes containing the respective solutions are brought near one
another into the flame of a Bunsen's burner.     But if the spectra
are very complicated, or if other circumstances prevent their
being simultaneously introduced into the flame, the following
arrangement is adopted:—Two Bunsen’s burners are placed in
front of one another before the slit.    Over that burner nearest
the slit a piece of iron plate is fixed somewhat larger than the
flame, and about level with the centre of the flame.         In this
way the upper half of the second flame sends         light over the                  its
other; and               by
                 placing the platinum bundles,     glasses contain                  of

Saussure found that ammonia as well as nitrous acid were
formed when hydrogen burnt             air, and Schönbein had shown

certain        substances             no      nitrite     is   perceived,           though           it   may have

522      M. Ullgren       on the Determination     of Carbon in Iron.
been produced. This is the case when the combustible produces
a strong acid, phosphorus for example, in which case the acid
formed expels the NO” and combines with the ammonia.    Schön
bein shows that, when small pieces of phosphorus are burnt in a
bell-jar over a plate containing water, the water always con
tains traces of ammonia.  He has also found that the combus
tion of arsenic, which takes place at 200°C.,            is attended with
the formation of ammonia, and that the same               is the case with
the combustion of sulphur.
   Schönbein thinks that in all these cases the           combustion of a
body produces nitrite of ammonia only in so      far that it is a
source of heat, and that the process of oxidation in and for
itself has nothing to do with the production of the nitrite.   He
holds in general that nitrite of ammonia is always produced
whenever   a space containing aqueous vapour and atmospheric
air is in any way suitably heated.
    The Messrs. Rogers showed, in 1850, that carbon, even in the
 difficultly combustible substance graphite, could be oxidized com
pletely by means of a mixture of chromate of potash and sulphuric
acid; and Brunner subsequently improved the method.            Ullgren
has made a communication* on the subject. The method has
the inconvenience that it is difficult to .# when the whole of the
carbon is oxidized; for when strong sulphuric acid and chro
mate of potash are used, as is necessary for graphite, an almost
insoluble anhydrous chrome-alum is deposited, which partly
prevents the oxidation, and partly prevents any unoxidized par
ticles from being seen. This evil is remedied by using chromic
acid instead of chromate of potash.        During the operation, too,
a  large   quantity of oxygen   gas is disengaged  along with the car
bonic acid, and hence it is necessary to pay special attention to
the complete absorption of the latter. This is effected in the
following manner.' About one part of caustic potash is dissolved
in four parts of water kept heated at 100°, and pumice in small
pieces is added and stirred with it until the whole mass is nearly
dry, when it is transferred to stoppered bottles. With this mate
rial the absorption-tubes are filled. It is excellently adapted for
the purpose, as it absorbs carbonic acid even when disengaged
with extreme rapidity.
    Ullgren gives a description of the apparatus which he uses for
effecting the oxidation, for which the original paper must be
referred   to, where  a figure   ofit   given.

taining potash prepared as described above.     The difference
between the weight of this after an experiment and before, gives
the weight of carbonic acid produced by the oxidation of the
carbon.
   With some kinds of carbon perfect oxidation is very slowly
effected; in such cases it is better first to separate all carbon
with neutral sulphate of copper, and then to oxidize the residue,
which consists of carbon and copper with chromic and sulphuric
acids.   The author has found that the carbon which is contained
in chemical union with iron, as in white cast iron, is very diffi
cult to oxidize.  To this question, as well as to the examination
of the carbon in steel and in wrought iron, the author intends to
return. With respect to the quantities used, there must in
general be sixteen parts by weight of chromic acid for each part
 of the carbonaceous substance to be oxidized, and for each
 gramme of chromic acid 1-5 cubic centim. of strong sulphuric
 acid should be used. Water should in most cases be added, in
 the proportion of 2 cubic centims. to 3 or 4 cubic centims. of
 sulphuric acid.
   From recent experiments which have established the presence
of nitrogen in cast iron, steel, and wrought iron, it appears that
it is present in two conditions: in one case it is liberated as
ammonia when iron is dissolved in hydrochloric acid, inas
much as the nitrogen unites with hydrogen in statu nascenti;
and in the other it is left in the carbonaceous mass which remains
when iron is dissolved in hydrochloric acid, or when it is heated
with sulphide of mercury. It is very probable that the presence
of nitrogen greatly affects different qualities of iron, and an easy

thus found to contain 0-103 per cent. of nitrogen,     a result
which agreed very closely with that obtained by determining
the ammonia which escaped when the same quantity of the same
iron was dissolved in HCl, and by determining that remaining
in the liquid.

graphite when iron has been dissolved, Boussingault has pro

   In this way a specimen of the graphite from the iron used in
a previous experiment was found to contain a quantity of nitrogen
equal to 0-605 per cent. of the iron, which, with the quantity of
nitrogen found as ammonia, 0.103 per cent., makes 0.708 per
cent.
   The method of determining carbon in iron by dissolving it in
chloride of copper always gives too high results, because the
carbon, thus separated, contains nitrogen.    If the quantity of
nitrogen in the graphite be added to the quantity of carbon
found by the chromic acid method, that       4.332+0-605, the           is,

when the quantity of carbonate of baryta formed is so great as
to hinder the passage of the gas, the clear liquid is decanted and
the operation repeated.   In this way a solution is obtained which
 is strongly charged with pure neutral binoxide of hydrogen,
which may be concentrated under the air-pump receiver.         It is
 necessary that the current of gas be very rapid, so that it be in
excess as regards the binoxide.

   mixture filtered. To the filtrate a small quantity of water is
   added, which separates a viscous mass; this, treated with a large
   quantity of water, is resolved into a white powder, which when
   dried is quite homogeneous.
       The mass thus obtained is insoluble in alcohol or ether, or in
   a mixture of the two.
        If
         in the above process a larger quantity of nitric acid be used,
   and the temperature be not allowed to sink too rapidly, a per
   fectly transparent solution is obtained, which thrown into water
   gives a less caseous and more pulverulent precipitate. This,
   washed and dried, constitutes a new compound; for, unlike the
   other, it is soluble in a mixture of alcohol and ether.
       Both these substances have the composition C*H* NO”, or
   C*H* 0° NO”: Bechamp names the former mononitric starch,
   and the latter isomononitric starch.
       A dinitric compound is obtained by dissolving starch in 12
   parts of nitric acid, and then pouring into it 8 parts of concen
   trated sulphuric acid. The whole mass is then poured into a
   large quantity of water, by which a pulverulent product is sepa
   rated, which is thoroughly washed and dried. This body con
   sists of dinitric starch in two molecular modifications: one of
    these is insoluble in strong alcohol, but soluble in a mixture
   of alcohol and ether; the other, isodinitric starch, is soluble in
   alcohol. The composition of both is expressed by the formula
   C12H8O82 NO5.
       These substances when heated give off red vapours and de
    flagrate; the mononitric compounds are more stable than the
   dinitric ; and the insoluble modification more so than the
   soluble.
       When one of these compounds is heated with protochloride of
   iron the starch is regenerated, binoxide of mitrogen is liberated,
   and peroxide of iron deposited.        The reaction in the case of
   the mononitric    compound   is this:
                               º
C12H909 NO3 + 6 Fe        Cl- HO-Fe2O3+2Fe3Cl3+ NO”--C12H909HO.
   The body produced has             all

   starch.
      Soluble starch      is        dextrogyrate; and the nitric deriva
   tives are also dextrogyrate,   but with     intensity decreasing with
                                                      an

      M. Bechamp considers these compounds nitrates analogous

        The formula      of   quinine,   C*H*N*0°,         only differs from that
   of   cinchonine,   C*H*N*0,             in   containing one atom more oxygen.
   The same relations obtain             as   between glycolic acid, C*H*0°, and

acetic acid, C*H*0°. Kekulé has shown” that the latter acid
may be transformed into the former by a method which has since
then received extensive applications to other acids.          It consists
in first replacing an atom of hydrogen by chlorine, iodine, or
bromine, and then treating this body by potash, or oxide of silver
and water, by which the atom of hydrogen is replaced by HQ.
H. Streckert has applied this reaction to cinchonine in the ex
pectation of changing it into quinine. Bibrominated cinchonine,

chlorate of cinchonine. This was treated with alcoholic potash

  By the action of ammonia on chloracetic acid, glycocol,
G*H*NO”, is obtained; by substituting in this reaction me
thylamine, CH*N, for ammonia, Wolhard* has found that sar
cosine, G'H7NO”, is formed, the base which Liebig obtained
as a product of the decomposition of kreatine.
    Chloracetic ether was mixed with an excess of concentrated
aqueous solution of methylamine, and the mixture heated in
closed tubes to 125°.    It was then boiled with baryta water until
all  methylamine   was removed,  the baryta separated by sulphuric
acid, and the filtrate therefrom evaporated to dryness on the
water-bath.     From this mass, on recrystallization, pure hydro
chlorate of sarcosine was obtained.

30 grammes of milk-sugar and 60 of bromine were enclosed in
a champagne-bottle with # a litre of water; the bottle was closed
by a caoutchouc stopper which was wired down, and the whole
heated in boiling water until the mixture was colourless.      The
product was treated with oxide of silver, the filtrate treated with
sulphuretted hydrogen, and the filtrate from this converted into
the cadmium salt, which crystallizes in small masses.         From
;
this salt the acid was obtained by treatment with sulphuretted
hydrogen. When evaporated to a syrup, it crystallizes in groups
    needles, which, dried over sulphuric acid, are pulverulent.
The acid is highly hygroscopic; it is soluble in alcohol, but not
in ether; heated on platinum, it burns with the smell of sugar.
It reduces silver-solutions and alkaline solutions of copper. The
formula of the acid is Gº H190°.
   The ammonia-salt, Cº H9NH* 9°4-3H* 9, and the soda-salt,
Gº Hº Na 9°4-3H*O, crystallize well; the potash-salt is highly
deliquescent. With the exception of a lead-salt there are no
other salts than those with                       l
                               equiv. of base, although it is very
improbable, from the large quantity of oxygen it contains, that
it is monobasic.              It has the              same formula as           Wurtz's diglycol
ethylenic acidº, and for the present the authors propose for                                            it
the name Isodiglycolethylenic acid.     is probable that in      It                                     its
formation milk-sugar takes     bromine,           up

    2. DURUMA.—A portion of a stone, weighing somewhat over
 1 lb., partially coated with a blackish-brown   crust, is deposited
in the mineralogical collection in the Museum of the Univer
sity of Munich: the accompanying label merely states that it
fell on the 6th of March, 1853, in Duruma, Wanika-land, East
Africa. Nothing more appears to be known, even at Vienna, or
by Dr. Buchner of Giessen, respecting this stone. Ascertaining
from the MS. Catalogue that this meteorite had been presented
by a Dr. Barth of Calw in Würtemberg, I wrote at once to that
gentleman, and received the following reply:—“The meteoric
stone fell during a violent thunder-storm in the district of Du

    6. PLEscowitz, Bohemia, 22 June 1723.—This specimen,
 also a unique one if correctly labelled, is deposited among the
 meteorites in the British Museum. There is strong reason for
 supposing this is really a portion of the Tabor, 3rd July 1753,
 meteorite; the physical characteristics are nearly the same, both
 belonging to the bluish meteorites of Reichenbach (see Note).
The Plescowitz is a very ancient and rather obscure fall; no spe
cimens are known to be preserved in Europe, while Tabor is one
far better known, and of which specimens are not uncommon.
   7. MARMANDE, Lot-et-Garonne, France.—This is represented
by a small and unique specimen in the British Museum; it was
purchased by myself last year from the late M. Boubée, a
geologist and mineral-dealer of Paris; the specimen is without
any crust, and is accompanied by a label stating it to have been
part of a stone which fell near Marmande, July 4th, 1848; M.
Boubée knew nothing more about         than that          it,

 B Auriga and a Gemini.
       Manchester,      12th December.
                           Note on Bluish Meteorites.
    There seems good reason for believing that the class of bluish
 meteorites, of which the Barbotan stone may be considered the
 type, differs from the whitish meteorites, represented by the
 Château-Renard stone, chiefly by reason of the stony portion
 containing a smaller proportion of soluble silicate in the shape
 of olivine, and a larger proportion of minerals of the augitic and
 felspathic class, which are insoluble in acids. There is also more
lime in the Barbotan stone than in the Château-Renard stone;
and this lime evidently belongs to the felspathic element, rather
than to the olivine.       Perhaps the amount of lime and alumina
contained in a meteoric stone may fairly be considered as an
index or exponent of the relative quantities of these two minerals
present, and especially of the felspar as compared with the
olivine.    We have, moreover, a regular gradation, as it were, in
meteorites—that           is,
                           regards their non-magnetic constituents—

established the three following important conclusions in regard to
the magnetic disturbances: viz., 1. That these phenomena, whether
of the declination, inclination, or total force, are subject in their
mean effects to periodical laws, which determine their relative fre
quency and amount at different hours of the day and night. 2. That
the disturbances which occasion westerly and those which occasion
easterly deflections of the compass-needle, those which increase
and those which decrease the inclination, and those which increase
and those which decrease the magnetic force have               distinct and                     all
generally different periodical laws.       That there exists periodical

  orary suspension of investigations which are now admitted to have
   en of very high interest; but by the liberality and public spirit of
the British Association, and by the aid of occasional grants of money
from the Royal Society, apparatus for their resumption was com
pleted at the Kew Observatory in 1857, and the investigations were
recommenced on the 1st of January, 1858.        The results obtained
from the photographic records of the Kew declinometer in 1858
and 1859, with a full description of the methods and processes
employed in their elicitation, were communicated       to the Royal
Society in 1860, and are printed in vol. xxii. of the Phil. Mag.
pp. 310–324. The two years which have since elapsed have fur
nished similar results for the years 1860 and 1861, strictly compar
able with those of 1858 and 1859, having been obtained with the
same instruments and by the same methods.       We have now, there
fore, the observations of four consecutive years from the Kew Ob
servatory, and we are thereby enabled to infer, by the comparison of
.*:-
the aggregate amount of disturbance in each of those years, the pro
gression of the decennial variation up to the close of 1861.     The
           amounts of disturbance in the four years were severally as

The observations of preceding years had led to the expectation that
1858, 1859, and 1860 would be the three years of maximum, in which
the aggregate amounts of disturbance would differ but little, and
that 1861 would be the first year of medium, showing an aggregate
amount of disturbance considerably below 1858, 1859, and 1860.
This expectation has been realized; and we have now before us the
prospect that the present year, 1862, will prove to be the second
year of medium, with an aggregate amount of disturbance nearly
resembling that in 1861, but a little less; and that 1863, 1864,
and 1865 will be years of minimum, differing little from each other
in the amount of disturbance, and                     or all

      records of the Kew Observatory, with as little change as may
    practicable in the instruments and methods which have been
employed during the first portion.
   The Table which is printed in Phil. Mag. vol. xxii. p. 312, shows
the aggregate values of the disturbances in 1858 and 1859 distri
buted into the several solar hours of their occurrence, and distin
guishing between the disturbances which produce westerly and those
which produce easterly deflections of the compass-needle. It also
exhibits     the ratios     of disturbance at the          several hours         to the mean
of the 24 hours taken as the unit. The subjoined Table contains the
same particulars for the four years, 1858 to 1861, inclusive.               It has
of course a somewhat higher authority than the earlier table, inas
much as ratios obtained from the records of four years are to be pre
ferred to those derived from two years only.            But the principal point
of interest in comparing them with each other is the evidence which
their correspondence affords, of the substantial truth of the two first
of the three general conclusions adverted to in the commencement of
the present communication, viz., the periodicity of the disturbances in
respect to the several hours of solar time, and the distinct character of
the laws which regulate the disturbances producing westerly deflec
tions, and those producing easterly deflections. The principal features
of both classes of disturbance are the same, whether viewed in the
record of the two or of the four years.            Regarded from either point
of  view,  both classes follow      progressions   manifestly dependent upon
the hours of solar     time,  the  progressions   of the westerly and those of
the  easterly   deflections   being  as manifestly    governed by distinct and
different laws. The        westerly   deflections have their chief prevalence
from 5 A.M. to 5     P.M.,   or  during the hours of the day, the ratios at                    all
 the other hours being below unity. The easterly deflections,                  the        on
 other hand, prevail chiefly during the hours                   of
                                                           the night, the ratios
 being for the most part below unity            the hours when the westerly
                                                     at
 are above   unity,  and,  conversely,   above when the westerly are below.
 The   easterly  have one decided maximum                   P.M., towards which

   In discussions published elsewhere the preponderance of westerly
over easterly deflection, or the converse, has been inferred to be a
geographical characteristic rather than an accidental feature.                                  All
the stations in North America, at which investigations have hitherto
been made, concur in showing a considerable predominance of easterly
deflections, whilst at Pekin in Northern Asia the converse is ob
servable.       Regarding Kew as the only representative station in the
British Islands (the only one in which this investigation has been
made), it is deserving of notice, that we find in this locality no con
stant or decided predominance of either class of disturbance over the
other.      There is indeed a slight preponderance of easterly values on
the  average     of the four years, but not of such amount or regularity
as to    give it the character of a decided feature.

of   a magnificent crimson colour.
   It may be useful to quote here the passage” of the paper referred
to, in which the formation of the colouring matter is mentioned.
“On submitting a mixture of 3} parts by weight of aniline and
 1 part of bichloride   of carbon, both in the anhydrous state, for
about   thirty hours to a temperature of 170° C., the liquid will be
found to be converted into a black mass, either soft and viscid, or
hard and brittle, according to time and temperature.
   “This black mass, which adheres firmly to the tubes in which the
reaction has been accomplished, is a mixture of several bodies.    On
exhausting with water, a portion dissolves, while a more or less solid
 resin remains behind.
     “The aqueous solution yields, on addition of potassa, an oily preci
 pitate containing a considerable portion of unchanged aniline; on
 boiling this precipitate with dilute potassa in a retort, the aniline
 distils over, whilst a viscid            oil
                                         remains behind, which gradually
 solidifies with   acrystalline   structure.     Washing with cold alcohol

    #.  monacid chloride dissolves more readily in moderately strong
hydrochloric acid than in water. . If this solution, gently warmed,
be mixed with very concentrated hydrochloric acid, it solidifies, on
cooling, into a network of beautiful brown-red needles, which have
to be washed with concentrated hydrochloric acid and dried in vacuo
over sulphuric acid and lime, since water decomposes them with
reproduction of the monacid compound.       The salt obtained by the
action of concentrated hydrochloric acid is the compound with three

   Exposed to 100° this salt gradually loses acid, the brown crystals
becoming indigo-blue; and if the exposure be continued until the
weight becomes constant, the original green salt with one equivalent
of acid is reproduced, which was identified by analysis.

    The water may be expelled at a higher heat; but the temperatures
 at which the water is lost and the salt commences to be decomposed
 are so close to each other, that it is not quite easy to obtain the salt
 in the anhydrous state. I have not been able to procure an oxalate
 with a larger amount of acid.
    Acetate of Rosaniline.—This is probably the finest salt of the series.
 Mr.Nicholson has obtained it in crystals an inch in diameter, which,

    The acetate is one of the more soluble salts, both in water and in
 alcohol; it cannot be conveniently recrystallized.
    The Formiate of Rosaniline is similar to the acetate.
    Of the remainder of the salts of this base I may mention the Chro
 mate, which is obtained by adding chromate of potassium to the solu
 tion of the acetate in the form of a brick-red precipitate, becoming a
 green, crystalline, almost insoluble powder on ebullition with water.
    The Trinitrophenate also deserves to be noticed; it crystallizes in
 beautiful reddish needles, likewise very difficultly soluble in water,
 which contain

and dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid, when sulphur, together
with impurities, are left behind.            The dark-brown solution thus

commercial colouring matter, is either brown or yellow.              Washing

necessary to repeat the process of dissolving in dilute and reprecipi

solution, before the last addition of concentrated acid, be heated to
ebullition, the liquid remains clear, and the new chloride crystallizes
out only on cooling. The crystals are beautiful, white, rectangular
plates, which are, however, always very small. Recrystallization from
water, in which they are extremely soluble, renders them perfectly
pure. Or they may be dissolved in alcohol and precipitated by ether,
in which they are quite insoluble.
   The chloride thus purified yields, on addition of ammonia, the
leucaniline as a dazzling white powder, which assumes the faintest
rosy tint when left for some time in contact with the atmosphere of
the laboratory.       It is scarcely soluble in cold, very little soluble in
boiling water, from which it is deposited, on cooling, in the form of
small crystals.       It is very soluble in alcohol, and, although less so,
in ether.    I   have not been able to get it in good crystals from these
solvents.     The best solvent appears to be a solution of the chloride
above     described,   in which leucaniline is freely soluble, and from
which, on cooling, it is deposited in the form of interlaced needles,

transformed into rosaniline; in most of the processes which give rise
to this substance, it is accompanied by several other bases, the study
                                                I
of which is not yet completed. Nor am at present in a position to
offer any definite opinion regarding the constitution of the new com
pounds, tempting though it appears to venture on speculations.         It
is in the hope of rendering the formulae of the new bases more trans
parent that         I
               have commenced to examine some of the products of
decomposition.     Their study is likewise far from being completed;                  .
but       I
        may mention, even now, that both rosaniline and leucaniline
when in nitric solution, are powerfully acted upon by nitrous acid,
new bases being thus generated, the platinum-salts of which are
remarkable for their fulminating properties.      A splendid crystalline
base also deserves to be mentioned, which, associated with aniline,
appears among the products of distillation of rosaniline.
  The results obtained in the further prosecution of these studies                I
propose to lay before the Royal Society in a future communication.

moon, embracing the whole, and signalizing special parts, have been
repeated by Riccioli (1651), Cassini (1680), Lalande (1787),

meeting the wants of “Selenography,” is about equal to that in which
the maps of England of the last century satisfy the requirements of

inch Ordnance Map of 1862 is superior to the old Chart of 1800, so
should be the new drawings of the features of the moon to the older

He has lately preferred to use for his eye-draughts a fine achromatic
by Cooke, of York,+the same instrument which has been turned with
such unexpected results to a scrutiny of the solar spots.
  Professor Smyth of Edinburgh, and Professor Challis of Cambridge,
made examinations and preliminary sketches of the Mare Crisium,
Plato, and other interesting objects; the former artist employing                           oil
colours in his scene-painting.

   9. Meantime a new and beautiful art was making itself auxiliary to
the delineation of the moon,-first by the silver plate of Daguerre,
afterwards by the increasingly sensitive collodion surface. The great
achromatic       of Cambridge, U.S., under the hands of Bond and
Whiffle,       results of much promise; at first the light-pictures
            gave
were of the full moon, 2 inches diameter on daguerreotype plates *;
afterwards we saw larger representations of the crescent moon, with
stronger lights and shadows on the ridges and in the hollows, several
inches across (1851–53).
    10. While observing with the great reflector at Birr, every one was
struck with the probability that almost instantaneous pictures could be
obtained of the moon, stars, and planets, by the amazing quantity of
light brought to the focus of that magnificent instrument.        Some
trials had indeed been made in 1852 by the distinguished constructor
and Mr. Woods; but I am not aware of the results of later experiments
with the great reflector.   In 1853 I gave much attention to the use of
collodion, and employed an apparatus attached to my achromatic
 (of 11 feet focus and 6 inches diameter), by which at first pictures
of 1:2 inch diameter, and finally others from 2 to 3 inches were ob
tained, in times gradually reduced from 5' to 30" and less.         still               I
possess many of these pictures; the best, however, was destroyed in
attempting to print from              it.
    11. Somewhat earlier than these trials of mine were the first
efforts of Mr. De      Rue,
                       la       which of was not aware.
                                                 I         These efforts
have from year      to year been rewarded with still increasing success,

instrument to an observer interested in the survey of the moon, and
willing for a limited time to
                          use his exertions for the accomplishment of
a definite object. In my own case I feel sure that this would succeed;
     I
and believe that my case is essentially that of many intelligent obser
vers of the moon accustomed to extra-meridional observations.
   16. The first desideratum then is an Equatorial Instrument, con
structed with the conditions of ample optical power,-great steadiness,
—delicate adjustment, including a sufficient range for latitude,-the
usual circular and micrometrical readings,     clock-movement, &c.,
so that it may be in every point of view adapted for special obser
                                                                                                     -
vations of the moon (sun, planets, comets, &c. may also be observed),
and be available for many years, in the same optical and space-mea
suring condition.    According to my view, founded on experience
with various instruments, it must be an achromatic, mounted on a
transportable solid stand, placed under the roof of a removeable ob
servatory, capable of holding a clock and, if need be, a small transit.
The object-glass should be of 6 inches diameter, the focal length 16
or 17 diameters.
    Such an instrument has actually been made by my direction; it is
 finished, and stands complete in the workshop of the skilful artist,
whose name is a guarantee of excellence, Mr.T. Cooke of York. Thus
the first requisite to give effect to my proposal is practically reached.
    17. The second desideratum is that the instrument shall become
the property of some scientific body constituted for long endurance,
and endowed with so much influence as to be able to give effect and
gain adherence to a plan of continuous work, by definite persons,
for such periods of time as each in succession may command. The
instrument to be confided to each in succession, and mounted in a
convenient manner for his use, at his home, during the time
appointed. Each observer to furnish, at least once a year, an
account of          his
                    observations, with drawings            the plan alreadyon

 years, would gradually and not very slowly grow up to complete
 eye-draughts of the moon, under the conditions of sunrise, mid
 day, and sunset; and would themselves be again a starting-point
for the guidance of even closer scrutiny, with the greatest telescopes
 and the sharpest eyes.
    20. Finally, my proposal, if allowed to make one, would be, that,
for the purpose of securing a series of satisfactory drawings of the
physical features of the moon, a six-inch achromatic, by Cooke, con
 structed for the purpose, be purchased out of the funds of the
 Government Grant Committee, and held by a Board composed of
three Members of the Royal Society, to be nominated in the first
instance and the number afterwards filled up by the Council of the
 Royal Society, in trust for the use of observers to be appointed by
the Board, each for a limited period, and for a defined area of work:
the drawings and observations to be communicated, at least once a
year, to the Board.        Cost of the instrument not to exceed 320
guineas, of a moveable house not to exceed £50.

oN THE    solar ENERGY As MANIFESTED IN THE AUTUMN of 1861
  AND   A Portion of THE SPRING of 1862. By w. R. BIRT, Esq.
   During the summer of 1860, both previous to and in connexion
with the great outburst of solar energy that occurred towards the
end of June in that year, I noticed a very marked monthly maximum
and minimum of solar spots; and while there existed indications of
an intermittent action of the solar force, I was satisfied that the
maxima and minima       I  had frequently noticed were dependent on the
rotation of the Sun.
   Regarding each group of spots, single spots, if unattended by
smaller ones, or separate nuclei if they were sufficiently distinct to
warrant the appellation, as centres of energy, I laid down from time
to time curves of which the centres of energy were the ordinates.
   Taking the solar meridian turned directly towards the Earth at
 noon of the 9th of July 1861 equal to 270°, and employing the
 period of 27° 7' 10" as that of the synodical rotation of the Sun, I
set off 27 abscissae, each being distinguished by a Roman numeral 1.

 to xxvii. preceded by the zero; and as the rotation of the Sun ap
 parently carries a meridian about 13° 19 westwardly per diem, each
 ordinate may represent any solar meridian within the limits of
  13°19; thus the zero may represent any meridian between 353°41
 and 6°59, and xiv. any one between 178°02 and 191°20, and so
 Oil.
     I have the pleasure of submitting to the Society the curves of five
 synodical rotations from observations in August, September, and
  October 1861, and April and May 1862*.                Each presents a well
  marked   maximum,      and the indications of minima are also apparent.
 The maxima        are,  without exception, acuminated, showing in each
 case not so much a diminution of energy as a removal from observa
 tion of the active solar surface by rotation.
     The most instructive feature of the curves consists of the portions
 of the surface of the solar globe indicated as manifesting the greatest
  energy.     1861, August, the meridians 23° to 208° manifested the
 greatest energy during the period; indeed, a much greater activity
 than the opposite hemisphere.           During the next rotation the energy
 was    greatly  subdued;     the  curve,  nevertheless, exhibited an increase
 of force between 125° and         297°;    and by projecting the September
 under the      August    curve,  the  similarity  of features, as regards the
 increase and diminution of        activity,  is unmistakeable.
     The October curve, after presenting us with a solar hemisphere
 perfectly quiescent, meridian 42°, gives us increased action from 108°
 to 293°; indeed there had been an increase of activity since 42° was
 central.     Collecting these areas of increased energy, we have a por
 tion of the solar surface extending over 274°, manifesting consider
 ably more energy than the remaining portion of 86°. The following
 are the meridians of maxima:—August, 156°; September, 138°;
 October, 200°; and this extent of 62°, or thereabouts, may be re
 garded as the locality of greatest energy for those months, as referred
 to heliographic longitudes. The heliographic latitudes of solar energy
 are  well known.
     1862, the   April curve exhibits subdued energy from meridians        14°
 to 173°, then increased energy to 332°, with a maximum at 292°.
 The May curve manifests during its earlier portion more activity than
 the April, with a minimum at 156°. This was the meridian of maxi
 mum in August; so that the activity on the hemisphere, of which 156°
 is the central meridian, is now greatly reduced; in fact the direction
of the curve is reversed. From this meridian the curve manifests
increased energy.         The two curves for April and May present as
perfect an agreement in their features as those of August, September,
and October 1861.          At the present time the hemisphere of greatest
energy is marked by the central meridian 300°, or thereabouts.-
