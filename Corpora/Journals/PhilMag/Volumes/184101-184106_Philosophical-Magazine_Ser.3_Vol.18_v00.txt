paper in your Number for December.                am most happy to     I
find that the   very  clear explanation    given   by Mr. Tovey has
delivered me from the necessity of remarking on the reasoning
in Mr. Potter's paper, and I shall now proceed with my sup
plementary investigation as an attempt at the extension of the
received theory.

    Suppose, for instance, a circular plate 1 foot in diameter is
placed to interrupt a stream of light; a screen is placed 10
feet behind it; to find the diameter of the bright spot.
    Here h = 120 inches, a = 6 inches; A may be taken for
mean light = 0:00002 inch. , Substituting in the expression
above, we find the diameter of the bright spot =0.000308 inch,
or less than stºn inch, regarding the visibility of which in
common experience we need not to disquiet ourselves.
     If
      the diameter of the circular plate had been taken linch,
the distance of the screen remaining the same, the diameter
of the spot would have been 0-0037 inch, a speck difficult even
for a philosopher to discover under these circumstances.                                         If
the diameter of the plate were 0.1 inch, the diameter of the
spot would be 0.037 inch, a very             subject for experimental

  cation of Huyghens's Principle in Physical Optics, inserted
  in the Lond. Edinb. & Dublin Phil. Mag. for October last;
  vol. xvii. p. 243. By Richard Potter, Esq., B.A.
  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
     GENTLEMEN,
       BEG to return Mr. Tovey my thanks for keeping alive the
      discussion on the capability of the undulatory to explain
facts; by such discussions we may entertain hopes that some
sound progress will eventually be made in physical optics.
                              I
   Mr. Tovey says have mistaken a luminous line for a                                          lu
minous space, and consequently my conclusions have, in
reality, no foundation.          He ought unquestionably to have
given us his proof.
   In the investigations for a small opake disc and a small
circular aperture, it was considered, by the most eminent ma
thematicians who have adopted the undulatory theory of light,
as quite sufficient to find the intensity along a line drawn per
pendicularly through the centre of the aperture or disc, and
their results were brought forward as strong proofs of the truth
of the theory. When, in the same way, I have applied a more
correct analysis, for             all
                              magnitudes       circular discs and aper
                                                                of
tures,         objected
             a it                  to,
                               without showing where the limit be

               is         small magnitude lies, and
                             a                               what point       at
the method becomes inaccurate.

conclude that there can be no maxima and minima                  the line          in
before-mentioned without          accompanying      ones      the plane       in
perpendicular           to
                     that  line,  and such has    tacitly been received
with respect       former investigations.
                       to                       With this the undula
tory theory also accords.          How Mr. Tovey could suppose
that there         reality
                  is   in      any   case only
                                    in             luminous line,    a                     it   is
not easy      account for;
                 to                           he
                                      had been acquainted with the

                              would not have made the objection.
   The case of the fixed stars shows that the smallness of the
angular magnitude             of
                            the luminous body         the eye         barat         is    no

  One of these platinum wires was then connected with the
outside of a Leyden jar, the other with an insulated discharger.
   The Leyden jar, containing about 100 square inches armed
surface, was now charged by means of fifty revolutions of a
twelve-inch glass plate, and then discharged through the tube
as usual.   The glass tube acted exactly as an imperfect con
ductor, interrupting the conducting wire, which connects the
two surfaces of the jar, like a piece of wet cotton thread, or
portion of glass tube moistened inside. The jar was perfectly
discharged by the first touch, with that peculiar hissing noise
and reddish fascicular stream of electricity which invariably
occur under similar circumstances. The temperature of the
sand-bath was now gradually raised, and at every 5 degrees
a similar electric discharge from the Leyden jar was passed
through the tube. The same results were obtained until the
                                           At this point, by dis

charging the jar, a small red spark was obtained, instead of
the          fascicular stream, and the jar was found to be en
tirely discharged, although the noise occasioned by the spark
was scarcely audible, compared with the loud clap produced
by the discharge of the jar under ordinary circumstances.
   After the temperature had been elevated to 405 degrees,
the contents of the jar discharged with the usual brilliant
spark and loud report, and at the same time the spark was
seen passing through the tube.        At this time no moisture
could be detected in the tube, and the water-gas contained in
it had entirely ceased to be a conductor of electricity, at the
same time giving less resistance to the passage of the spark than
common air, the striking distance having been elongated from
 half an inch to one inch and a quarter.      When the tempera
ture was reduced below 405 degrees, the discharge passed
as before mentioned, either as a small red spark, or in a fasci
cular stream, according to the temperature. When above
405 degrees the spark passed as usual, until the temperature
rose to 443, when the tube burst, which prevented me from
ascertaining      weight with and without the water; the differ

     From the preceding experiments we may conclude that
steam, pure and free from contact with water, has,like all
other gases, the property of being a non-conductor                                             of elec
tricity.
  The facility with which the spark passes through the water
gas seems to be worthy of attention; the striking distance of
the spark having increased from half an inch to one inch
and a quarter; for, according to Mr. Harris's discoveries,
the striking distances are, in ordinary cases, in the inverse
ratio to the density of the gas.

condensed steam                is,

          Mr. Redfield         on the Tornado                 of June            19, 1835.                 21
fluence      of calorific expansion accompanying the condensa
tion of vapour.
  It is    remarkable that up to this period the evidences                                            of the
rotation, or other characteristic action of tornadoes, appear
not to have been recorded, nor to have received the distinct
consideration of scientific observers.        We are, therefore, left
to seek out the    peculiarities  of their action, by examining the
direction of the     prostrations   and other effects of the wind:
and from a careful induction from the effects which are thus
registered as by the finger of the tornado, we may hope to
arrive at satisfactory conclusions.
   If  the numerous prostrations of trees and other objects,
which may be observed in the path of a tornado, be the
effects of a violent whirlwind, it appears most reasonable to
infer that this whirl had the common property which may
be observed in all narrow and violent vortices, viz. a spirally
involute motion, quickened in            gyrations its   approaches              as   it
toward the centre          axisor   the  whirl,
                                            of  and there continued
(in the case       of
                   the whirlwind)    spirally upward,  but gradually
expanding again          in    its
                            spiral course     ascending towards the
                                                            in
 extreme height         of
                      the revolving mass.
                                                 this whirling body,
                                                                 we on of
  If   we now contemplate the action
 while                  of
                       rapid   progression,       the several objects
          in in
             astate
found      distinct portions           path,
                                           of    its
                                                  may expect     wit                                  to
 ness effects      much complexity, particularly
                   of                                    regards the                  as
 lines  ofdirection; and, also, that amid this apparent com
plexity some clue may                 beobtained that will serve   indicate                 to
or establish the true character of its action.                 Some of the
effects which may              be    expected,     observed, will
                                                         or            here                      be
considered.
   1.  We may expect                 to   find   in    the path              of   the whirlwind,
strong evidence          of
                   the inward     vorticular           or                          course      the    of
wind: the violence of which inward motion                                         is clearly indi
cated      by
         the force with which various objects, often       much                                  of
weight, are carried spirally upward about the axis       the re                                 of
volving body.
   Now the effects of this inward vorticular motion           the                                     at
surface     the ground, are clearly manifested

   greater portion of the prostrations on the reverse side of the
   axis should be found in a backward direction: and so they
   would undoubtedly be found, were it not for the inward and
   the progressive action. But the force is here so far lessened by
   the reverse action above noticed, that in most cases only a small
   portion of the trees exposed will be thus prostrated: while
  the greatest force of the whirlwind, on this side, is felt near
    its last      closing portion and towards the apparent axis,
                      or
   where the inward, together with the rotative and progress

rent is connected with considerable magnitude of the electro
motive force; but one which points to the cause so clearly as
the iron circuit, might perhaps not easily be found a second
time.
   Hitherto the author has only succeeded in discovering one
pair, and that moreover less prominent, analogous to the zinc
iron circuit. This is a circuit of amalgamated zinc and common
zinc. This produces (the size and distance of the plates being as
above, charged with diluted sulphuric acid, and merely closed
by a multiplier-wire 11 feet long) a more powerful current, than
under similar circumstances, one of amalgamated zinc and cad
mium or tin.       Since cadmium and tin are more negative than
zinc, consequently the electromotive force of the latter circuits
greater than that of the former, it is evident that the greater
intensity of current of this can likewise solely be founded on
its slighter resistance                to
                              transition.            likewise conceivable

     The author remarks, in conclusion, that amalgamated iron
 (which is obtained without difficulty by immersing iron in a
 solution of the chloride of mercury, or in metallic mercury to
 which a dilute acid has been added), combined with zinc and
 acid, produces a considerably weaker current than, under simi
 lar circumstances, the non-amalgamated iron: it              however,                  is,
 still much more powerful than that from zinc-copper cir                    a

ary action, although       under particular arrangements it sepa
 rates and becomes visible;—I showed that the galvanic agency
 was greatly increased by dissolving minute quantities of potash
 in the alcohol, so small a quantity as Tººwoth part having a
 decided influence; this effect being, as I conceived, due to an
 increased conducting power of                     and to the disposing
 affinity of the potash for the products of the secondary action
of the oxygen. Notwithstanding the very insignificant quantity

     To obtain a satisfactory result, we ought to dissolve a some
what   larger quantity of potassium in the alcohol, and employ
a still more energetic electric current, and foils approached to
one another in the same plane, when the quantities of hydro
gen liberated from the two fluids will be found to be very
nearly equal in amount; and the comparison is best instituted
during the early stages of the action, because the potash gets
saturated with the secondary products of oxidation, and the
conducting power diminishes, whilst the electric energy is also
on the decline.
     Istill consider the experiments, now and formerly detailed,
to afford the only direct experimental proof which we yet have
of the existence of water, as such, in absolute alcohol. The
          j
oxidation of potassium in alcohol, with evolution of hydrogen,
is perhaps the nearest approach of other experiments to such
evidence; but still the tendency to form aether, and the affinity
of potash for that substance, might give rise to the evolution
of hydrogen. But it appears to be quite impossible, on elec
tro-chemical principles, to suppose, that under electric agency
a part of the hydrogen of the alcohol should go to one pole,
and the remainder, with its other constituents, to the other,
there being no evidence of any one substance at the positive
pole,           could have been in combination with hydrogen
as an electrolytic compound; and, besides, we have direct
proof that it is oxygen which passes to the positive pole,
because the effects which take place there are effects of
oridation, and under particular arrangements that oxygen
becomes even visible.      We have thus oxygen going to the
one  pole   and  hydrogen  to the other, and the latter in the pro
portion in which it exists in water; and it is only a truism to
say that the direct voltaic decomposition of any substance can
not take place, unless that substance previously has a distinct
and substantive existence.

Mr. W. G. Armstrong                   on the   Electricity of Effluent Steam.         51
   The insulation of the boiler was                   effected by       lifting the   en
                                                               i.
gine with screw-jacks,         until the wheels were raised about six
inches above the rails, and then supporting it upon four insu
lators which rested upon logs of timber.                     insulator con
sisted of three       separate    pieces  of baked    wood,     coated with
pitch, and having layers of pitch and brown paper placed be
tween them. The middle piece was made larger than the
other two, so as to project beyond them, and thereby increase
the surface without adding to the height of the insulator,
which would have been dangerous; and the three pieces when
put together formed a block, of which a representation is an
nexed (fig. 1.).
    As soon as the engine was placed on the insulators, the
boiler was filled with water, and                       Fig. 1.
the fire  lighted,   and as the    press
ure gradually rose in the boiler,
 the steam was occasionally suf
fered to escape.
    The engine indicated no elec
 tricity whatever so long as the
steam was confined in the boiler,
but became negatively electri
fied as soon as any escape was permitted.                  A very trifling
 escape proved sufficient to render the negative electricity of
 the .#.       sensible, and when the steam was very freely dis
 charged the negative development became exceedingly power
       i.
 ful.   The sparks never much exceeded an inch in length, but
 Were         large and brilliant, and, owing no doubt to the
 magnitude of the body from which they were drawn, they pro
 duced effects fully equal to those obtained by the use of an
 average-sized Leyden jar.            Some idea of their potency may
 be formed from the         fact,  that when not more than half an
 inch in length, they easily ignited a piece of cotton wool filled
 with powdered resin.
     The greatest care was taken to ascertain whether the ex
                                                               it all

 when the     discharge     from the valve was          regulated

                          the boiler increased      little with the press

52     Mr. W. G. Armstrong              on the Electricity         of Effluent       Steam
could no longer be obtained from the conductorheld in the
steam, but the negative electricity of the boiler continued to
produce sparks until the steam was entirely exhausted, or as
nearly so as possible.    These results appear to indicatethat
a jet of high-pressure steam is not in reality much more elec
trical than one of low-pressure steam, but merely that the
electricity of the high-pressure jet is more easily collected.

   The insulation of the boiler undoubtedly had the effect of
diminishing the positive electricity

                                               from the steam,

 by reference to the figure.         The cylinder, and a great part of
  each of the    tubes,   were  enveloped     in flannel, so as to prevent
  condensation as much as possible. The chief object of this
  apparatus was to test the electrical condition of the steam be
  fore it issued into the air, both when the boiler was insulated
 and when it was connected by a conductor with the earth.
  An iron bar was then placed against the engine to establish a
 communication between it and the ground, and the cock being
 opened, a current of steam mixed with water issued from the
 tube E. Under these circumstances both pairs of balls re
 mained stationary, the electricity being probably carried off
 by the water which escaped with the steam.                  As the tubes
 became heated the quantity of water discharged with the steam
was reduced to a mere spray, and both pairs of balls then
 slightly diverged with positive electricity, the upper pair ex
 panding rather more than the lower pair; but upon partially
 closing the cock both pairs of balls expanded fully three times
as much as they had done when the cock was fully open; and
then gradually converged, arriving at their        -
                                                         original position
after the lapse of about a minute.
      I
      was at first exceedingly puzzled how to account for this
 singular effect of attenuating the steam, but I now think it
may be explained as follows.            It is probable that the moisture
of the steam when the cock is fully open is sufficient to enable
it to conduct great part of the electricity of the jet back again
 to the boiler; but that as soon as the temperature of the steam
 is reduced by the attenuation below the temperature which
the tubes have previously acquired from the high-pressure
               of its
 steam,       dryness          is   so
                               far increased            prevent the trans

mission        electricity from the jet          the boiler, but not from
                                                         to
the jet      the cylinder, which
               to                          much nearer object. As the
                                                is   a

back      to
           the boiler.
    The iron bar was then removed from its contact with the
boiler     so      restore the insulation, and the engine was ren
                    as   to

the   safety-valve.      The cock      being    again  fully opened,  both
pairs     ofballs diverged strongly with negative electricity; and
 by  diminishing the escape from the valve                   certain point,
                                                                        to

positive, and the lower ones negative electricity.               When the
escape from the valve was entirely prevented and the cock
fully opened, both pairs                 of
                                   balls remained          collapsed state,
                                                                   in   a
 but      on
          partly   opening   the cock    they   both diverged    for short
 time with positive electricity                 to
                                         much the same extent          they       as a

54   Mr. W. G. Armstrong       on the Electricity of Effluent Steam.
      .
had previously done while the boiler communicated with the
earth by means of the iron bar.
    It is important to state that when the balls were repelled
with negative electricity, they collapsed very considerably when
the         was touched by the hand, but when they diverged
with positive electricity no effect was produced by touching
 the cock, which strongly favours the supposition that the
positive electricity manifested by the lower pith-balls, was
 conducted to the cylinder from the jet.
     A coil of lead pipe, immersed in a glas jar filled with wet
 snow, was then placed upon the insulating stool and connected
 with the tube B, after the brass cylinder had been detached;
 and the iron bar was again placed against the boiler to suspend
 the insulation.      Upon opening the cock to the full extent,
 little or no   electricity could be discovered in the coil, but
 when the cock was partly closed, positive electricity appeared
 for a short time and then faded away exactly as in the expe
                       .
 riments with the brass cylinder.        Upon removing the con
 nexion between the boiler and the earth and raising the valve
 the coil became highly negative, but upon closing the valve
 the negative electricity vanished.
     I have little doubt that the predominance of the negative
 over the positive electricity in the above experiment is attri
 butable to the conducting power of the steam causing more
 negative electricity to be conveyed to the coil from the boiler,
 than the coil would acquire if the steam were a non-conductor.
  When negative electricity was in like manner so strongly
 manifested by the               in the experiments with the brass
 cylinder, it was noticed, that after closing the cock, while the
 interior of the tubes were bedeved with moisture, scarcely
 any negative electricity was transmitted to the balls, so that
 the conducting power must have been in the steam, and not
 in the mere dampness on the glass.
     A vertical glass tube, about an inch in diameter, and be
 tween two and three feet long, was then screwed on to the
 cock in substitution of the tube B. The lower part of this
 tube contained a number of pointed wires for the purpose of
 abstracting and imparting to the cock any electricity which
 the steam might possess on entering the tube. When the
 cock was now fully opened, flashes of light began to dart
 through the whole length of the tube, from the cloud above
 it to the cock, and continued to do so as long as the cock re
 mained open, both when the boiler was insulated, and when
 it was connected with the earth. The steam in the tube was
 perfectly transparent, and no moisture could be seen on the
 inner surface of the glass.

     The visible transmission of electricity from the jet to the
cock, in this experiment, furnishes convincing proof that the
positive electricity which we find in the jet is not developed
until the steam assumes the form of a visible vapour; and it
shows also that the steam, even in     transparent state,      its                                              is,   as

    We learn from experiment that development                  a        negative               of

   These conclusions are entirely incompatible with the theory
of   two electric fluids, but are quite reconcileable with the
hypothesis        of single fluid.

to  sustain that condition when the water                    converted into

   Upon the same principle, if the boiler be insulated, the water,

 Anniversary Address of the Marquis of Northampton, President,
                             November 30, 1840.
     GENTLEMEN,
IN Iaddressing you at the termination of this, the second year that
     have had the honour of presiding over your Society, my first
duty is to return my thanks to those gentlemen whom you have
nominated to be my Council. They have rendered an onerous duty
comparatively light and easy by their unremitting attendance and
zeal; and have, as I trust, prevented your affairs from suffering from
any incompetency on my part. In making my report of the trans
actions of the last year, I know of nothing to regret, except the loss
of some of our valued Associates, who between the end of last No
vember and the present time have paid the debt of nature.
   Among the new members enrolled in our body, it will perhaps
be right to mention the name of the Bishop of Norwich, as being
President of the Linnean Society, one of the oldest branches that
may be considered as thrown off from our parent stem. Also that
of the Duke of Richmond, as President of the two newest Asso
ciations founded for the promotion of science, the Royal Agricul
tural and Botanical Societies.    We have one new member of still
higher rank, who has honoured us by becoming one of our Fellows,
H. R. H. Prince Albert, the consort of our beloved Queen and
Patroness.   As your organ, Gentlemen,          I
                                             will venture to say that
you duly appreciate the honour conferred on yourselves; at the
same time while His Royal Highness gratifies us by joining our
body, we entertain no doubt that he does so from the just conviction
that the patronage and advancement of science are national objects
of the deepest importance.
   The Antarctic Expedition, to whose departure I adverted in my
                                                                its its
last year's Address,   is,
                        I  trust, now successfully pursuing      career
of scientific research. Already     portion
                                    a           of
                                                the fruits of  labours
has reached us, and promises         an
                                      abundant and valuable harvest.
 The fixed Magnetic Observatories         on
                                         the territories   Her Majesty

    58    Royal Society :—Anniversary Address of the President :
   the assistance of observations made at the same instant of time, and
   on the same system as our own.            I have the satisfaction to state,
   that these observatories exceed forty in number *.
      While these researches are being made by our own and other states,
   private enterprise is not idle.       Mr. Enderby, to whom geography
   is already  indebted, has sent out a vessel for the purposes of discovery
   in the Antarctic seas, with the object of approaching as near as may
   be to the Southern pole.       His ship is navigated by Mr. Mapleton,
  an officer who had been selected by Her Majesty's Government to
  take a part in Captain Ross's expedition ; but he had not returned
  to England before that Expedition had sailed. We may well hope
  that he will merit this double confidence, and that he will, if his life
  be spared, add another wreath to the laurels of England, won by a
  Parry and a Ross, a Cooke and a Vancouver.
       You are aware, Gentlemen, that previously to the departure of the
  late expedition, the Council of the Royal Society was requested by the
  government to draw up a statement of the most desirable objects in
  science to which the attention of the officers employed might be
  directed.     With this request, as you might also know, the Council
  immediately complied; and in the execution of the duty thus de
  volved on us, the assistance of the Scientific Committees was our
  principal means of success. Since that time it has occurred to us,
 that the same recommendations, in rather a different shape, might
  be of great use to other scientific travellers.      We have accordingly
 taken considerable pains in perfecting these suggestions, which we
 have caused to be printed for the public in generalt. We have
 already furnished copies to the Commander of the Expedition to the
  Niger, and I hope that, in addition to his higher objects, he may be
 enabled to promote our acquaintance with the details of the geo
                                     ë.
 graphy and natural history of those imperfectly known parts of the
 globe.
      I have the satisfaction to inform you, that by desire of the Council
 Mr. Shuckard has completed a                    of the valuable manuscript
 letters in our library, among which are many from Ray, Willoughby,
 Newton, Boyle, Hook, and other eminent men, which we trust may
 serve as a useful aid to those. Fellows who may wish to consult do
 cuments of so much interest and value.
      You will also be glad to know that Mr. Halliwell, one of our
 Fellows, has undertaken and executed the task of making a cata
logue of the miscellaneous manuscripts in our library; a labour for
which I am sure you will feel much indebted to the author. In this
collection the Society possesses one most valuable manuscript, the
Principia in the hand-writing of the immortal Newton.
      The Royal Society, Gentlemen, was founded for the advancement
of natural knowledge, not for any purposes of private advantage or
vain glory. It must, therefore, always hail the foundation and
                         º".

prosperity        of new bodies of scientific men, brought together by the
same object in particular branches of science, either in the abstract,
or connected with important arts and manufactures.      It cannot but
rejoice, therefore, at the continued prosperity of the British Associ
ation, and in the formation of new societies for Microscopical Re
search”, and for the improvement of Botany and Agriculture.
    With respect to the last of these, we must look with satisfaction
to every effort to carry the torch of science, to light up the intrica
cies and doubts of an art, the first probably in age, and certainly the
first in importance to civilized man. As to the Botanical Society,
we cannot but be glad that the want of a public and national Garden
should be in some measure supplied, and we may indulge a hope
that the example may, at a future time, lead our Government to pro
vide an establishment commensurate with the wealth of Great Bri
tain, with the magnitude of the metropolis, and with the extensive
colonial empire from which it might be supplied with the produc
 tions of the most varied climates.
    With the continued and increasing prosperity of the British As
sociation, I may the more boldly call on you to sympathize, as the
                            of its
greater part of        most active and talented members are also among
 the most valued       our own Fellows.         had this year      great addi

     Award of the Royal, Copley, and Rumford Medals.                       61
which you have also turned your acquaintance with Galvanism to
the most important practical purposes.
     PROFEssor DANIELL.
  In confiding to your charge,    as our Foreign Secretary, the Rum
ford Medal which the Council has awarded to M. Biot, I am sure
that every cultivator of the higher and more abstruse branches of
science will feel that it is bestowed on a philosopher, whose optical
researches on the curious and interesting subject of Polarized Light
are of the highest value. You may, at the same time that you for
ward the Medal, assure M. Biot of the anxious wish of the Royal
Society that he may be long enabled to carry on inquiries so honour
able to himself, and so important to more than one branch of
science.
                         I
    Professor Daniell, hold in my hand, and deliver to you one of the
Copley Medals, which has been awarded by us to Professor Liebig.
 My principal difficulty, in the present exercise of this the most
agreeable part of my official duty, is to know whether to consider
 M. Liebig's inquiries as most important in a chemical or in a phy
siological light. However that may be, he has a double claim on
 the scientific world, enhanced by the practical and useful ends to
 which he has turned his discoveries. I hope that he may long be
 able to follow at the same time the paths of scientific research and
 practical utility.
     Professor Daniell, I have again to call on you, in your official
 capacity, to transmit a Medal to the Continent.          The gentle
 man to whom we have adjudged it is M. Sturm, for his valu
 able mathematical labours, the fruits of which must be important,
  not only to mathematics, but also to those other high and abstruse
  sciences to whose advancement algebraical analysis is a necessary
  instrument.    In his solution, therefore, of a problem which has
  baffled some of the greatest mathematicians that the world has pro
  duced, he has well earned the gratitude of every lover of natural
  knowledge.
   You will, Gentlemen, hear read an account of the eminent men
 connected with our Society whom we have had the misfortune to
 lose since last November.      Having confided the task of enumerating
 them to one of    your  Members,    more able than myself to do justice
 to their merits, I shall not further touch upon the subject than to
 express my deep regret at the decease of one who had been my
 predecessor in this Chair, and to whose counsel         Imight have looked
 for aid in   any  conjuncture    of  difficulty,  with full reliance on his
 good sense and ability, and also on his zeal in any matter in which
 the interests of the Royal Society were at stake. I may also be per
 mitted to express the condolence of       of all
                                                the Members     of  the Royal

 62     Royal Society :-Anniversary Address of the President :
room, without feelings of deep regret for the loss of his services and
of affectionate respect for his many virtues: it is hardly necessary
for   me to add that   I refer   to our late associate and former President,
Mr. DAvies GILBERT".
  He was the only surviving son of the Rev. Edward Giddy, of St.
Erth in Cornwall, and his mother, whose maiden name was Davies,
was the representative     of several ancient and distinguished families
in that county, and the heiress likewise of very considerable           pro
perty. His early education, which was almost entirely domestic, was
chiefly superintended by his father, who was an accomplished clas
 sical scholar; and in 1785 he became a gentleman commoner of
 Pembroke College, Oxford, where he attended the lectures of Dr.
 Beddoes on chemistry, Dr. Sibthorp on botany, and Mr. Hornby
on geometry and astronomy, and devoted himself with very unu
sual diligence to the study of mathematics and the natural sciences.
 He used to boast in after life, with very becoming pride, that he was
the first student of his class in the University of Oxford, who had
ever read the Principia of Newton.
    In 1791, he was elected a Fellow of this Society, and became as
 sociated from that time forward with the most eminent men of sci
ence in the metropolis.    He had, in very early life, appreciated the
extraordinary combination of poetical and philosophical genius in
his friend and fellow-countryman Humphry Davy, at that time in
a very humble capacity; and by recommending him, first, as an as
sistant to Dr. Beddoes in his experiments on the medical effects of
gaseous inspirations, and, secondly, to the Royal Institution, he had
the merit and good fortune of contributing to rescue from obscurity
one of the greatest discoverers in modern chemistry t. In the year
 1804, he became Member of Parliament for Helston, and in 1806
for Bodmin, a borough in his own immediate neighbourhood, which
he continued to represent until the era of Parliamentary Reform in
 1832. He was emphatically the representative of scientific interests
in the House of Commons, and contributed by his exertions to carry
many very important projects, including amongst them the great
breakwater at Plymouth and the bill for the revision of weights and
measures; a bill founded upon the report of a commission of which
he was a member, in conjunction with Captain Kater, Dr. Young
and Dr. Wollaston."
    Mr. Davies Gilbert was the author of Papers in our Transactions
“On the Mathematical Theory of Suspension Bridgest,” with parti
cular reference to the Menai bridge, which was at that time in pro
gress, and the curvature of which was considerably modified in con
formity with the results of his calculations:—“On the Progressive
Improvements made in the Efficiency of Steam-engines in Cornwall,
with investigations of the methods best adapted for imparting great

known to men of science what is termed the duty of steam-engines,
from the correct observation                     of which so many important practical
improvements have followed     :—“On the Nature of Negative and
Imaginary Quantitiest,” which contains many ingenious views, al
though they have been in a great measure superseded by later
speculations on this subject<U+017F>.   Mr. Gilbert was a mathematician of
the old school; but the papers to which we have just referred are
very creditable specimens of the clearness with which he appre
hended the bearing of some simple theoretical truths upon very
important practical questions.
   He became President of this Society in 1828, on the resigna
tion of Sir Humphry Davy; a situation from which he retired in
1831. He continued, however, for the remainder of his life, to take
a prominent part in the concerns of the Society; and there are few
of my brother-Fellows, whom I have now the honour of addressing,
who have not had opportunities of observing and appreciating his
constant zeal for the interests of science, the variety and philoso
phical character of his conversation, the simple and unaffected elo
quence of his public addressess, and, above all, that sweetness of
temper and kindness of heart which beamed forth in the expression
of those truly classical and benevolent features, which one of the
most accomplished of our artists (himself a brother-Fellow) has so
happily perpetuated in the portrait which adorns these walls. The
very absence of that inflexibility of purpose and of opinion which
some might consider essential to the perfection of the character of
a philosopher, seemed, in his case, the proper developement of that
 natural benevolence and humanity which made him so justly beloved
 in every relation of life, whether as a husband, a father, and a brother,
—as a master, a landlord, and a friend.
    Mr. Gilbert was the author and editor of several antiquarian and
 other works relating to his native county, whose interests he always
 laboured to promote with more than common zeal and patriotism.
 He was President of the Cornish Geological Society from the period
 of    its
         first establishment       1814, andin     never omitted attending
                                                                     he

 compelled        resign the chair
                     to                   his friend and countryman Sir
                                                      to
 Charles Lemon.           1808, he married Miss Gilbert, and assumed

64 Royal Society:—Anniversary Address                                             of the President:
borne to the grave by his own labourers, and followed by his widow
and family in that primitive and unostentatious form which best
suited the simplicity and natural humility of his own character.
    Dr. SAMUEL Butler, Bishop of Lichfield, was born in 1774, at
Kenilworth, which was likewise the birth-place of two other contempo
rary prelates of our church. He was educated at Rugby, and became
afterwards a member of St. John's College, Cambridge, where he
gained the highest classical honours which the University could
confer.    In 1798 he was made Head Master of Shrewsbury School,
over which he continued to preside during aperiod of thirty-eight years.
His great acquirements as a scholar, his eminent skill as a teacher,
his active interest in the welfare of his pupils, and the tact and
knowledge of character which he showed in their management,                                                all
contributed           to
                 raise the school    the highest reputation, and
                                                 to                 give                            to
it, during many years, the pre-eminence over every other school                                            in
the kingdom           in
                   the number and rank                             of

which were gained                by
                          his scholars.  The date       his elevation               of                     to
the Bench was nearly contemporaneous with the appearance             that                           of
fatal disease which, after three years       the most depressing suffer
                                                             of
ings, borne with most exemplary patience and resignation, brought
him      the grave.
        to             He was man           a             of
                                          great cheerfulness     temper                        of

life, and justly the object                of
                                the grateful attachment and love      his                            of
numerous pupils.

       His activity whilst resident at Benares             has more the air of ro

66 Royal Society —Anniversary Address              of the President :
education at York, under the care of his uncle, he became a student
at the Hunterian School of Anatomy, in Windmill Street, under
Dr. Baillie and Mr. Cruikshank, where he attracted the particular
notice of John Hunter.        He subsequently became a resident pupil
of Mr.    Henry  Watson,    one of the most eminent surgeons in the me
tropolis, whom he succeeded at the Westminster Hospital in 1793.
In 1800 he communicated to our Transactions a paper “On a Pecu
liarity in the Distribution of the Arteries sent to the Limbs of Slow
moving Animals.” This was followed by many others on various
points of comparative and human anatomy, including his papers
 “On Muscular Motion,” and “On the Arrangement and Mecha
 nical Action of the Muscles of Fish,” which formed the Croonian Lec
 tures for 1804 and 1806.       He was the author likewise of many com
 munications in the Transactions of the Linnean and Horticultural
 Societies and in other contemporary journals, on different branches
 of natural history and physical science".
     “An Essay on the Connexion between Anatomy and the Fine
 Arts," led to his appointment, in 1808, to the Professorship of
 Anatomy to the Royal Academy, a situation which he filled with
 great advantage to the students during a period of sixteen years.
     Sir Anthony Carlisle was not less distinguished for his know
 ledge of anatomy, physiology, and natural history, than for his
 professional merits, and for his patience and skill as an instructor
 of medical students. As a practitioner, he was invariably kind and
 attentive to those who were entrusted to his care, and eminently
 liberal in devoting his professional services to those who had no
 adequate means of repaying them.
     Mr. Nicholas Aylwa RD VIGoRs was born in 1787, at Old
 Leighlin, in the county of Carlow, where his family had long re
 sided.     After the usual preparatory education, he proceeded to the
  University of Oxford, where he became a very diligent and success
  ful student. On quitting the University, he purchased a commis
 sion in the Guards, and distinguished himself highly at the battle
  of Barossa, by continuing to bear the colours of his regiment after
  he was severely wounded.          On his return from the Peninsula, he
  was prevailed upon, by the earnest entreaties of his family, to quit
  the army; and he devoted himself afterwards, with characteristic
  ardour, to scientific and literary pursuits.
     Mr. Vigors was one of the founders and the first Secretary of the
  Zoological Society, to whose museum he gave his very valuable
  collections of ornithology and entomology, which were the two
  branches of natural history he had most carefully studied.            He
  was the author of a very elaborate paper in the Linnean Transac
  tions +, “On the Natural Affinities which connect the Orders and

                  Deceased Fellows                :-Mr.        Vigors, Mr. Rickman.                    67
sketched out in his Horae Entomologicae, in a more general way,
as applicable to the whole animal kingdom.          He afterwards pub
lished, in conjunction with Dr. Horsfield, another very valuable
memoir" on the Birds of Australia, grounded upon a rich collection
from that country, in the possession of the Linnean Society, which
they described and arranged according to their natural affinities.
He was likewise the principal editor, during several years, of the
“Zoological Journal,” in which he wrote many memoirs, chiefly de
voted to the further exposition of his views with respect to the
affinities of birds, but some of them descriptive of new or rare
Mammalia, or new forms of exotic insects or birds +.
   Mr. Vigors was a man of very considerable attainments as a
scholar as well as a naturalisti, and made a liberal use of an ample
private fortune in the promotion of those sciences which he culti
vated: he was the representative in Parliament, for some years be
fore his death, first of the city, and lastly of the county of Carlow.
   Mr. Rick MAN was born in 1771, and educated at Westminster
School, from whence he proceeded as a student to Christ Church,
Oxford. Early in life he was recommended by Dean Jackson as
Secretary to Mr. Abbott, the Speaker of the House of Commons,
and was chosen to examine and digest the Parliamentary returns
under the first Population Act in 1800, a duty which he continued
to perform at the three succeeding decennial periods, and was pre
paring to discharge it for the fifth time during the present year,
when he was attacked by the disease which terminated in his death.
He was appointed second Clerk Assistant to the House of Com
mons in 1815, and subsequently Clerk Assistant, an office which
he continued to hold for the remainder of his life.
   The introductions to the “Population Returns,” of which he was
the author, are remarkable for the very able analysis which they
contain of the general condition, changes and prospects of       classes                    all
of the population                 $.
   Mr. Rickman was an excellent classical scholar, and was,          ad                           in
dition     many   to
                  other attainments, extremely  well acquainted     with
many branches       engineering and practical mechanics.
                                 of                             He was
the intimate friend, and after his death the executor,         the late                of
Mr.  Telford, whose  autobiography      published, with     he
                                                           preface   and          a

 68 Royal Society:-Anniversary            Address of the President:
    Sir Jeffrey WYATTville, member of the Royal Academy and
 a  distinguished  architect, was a member of a family which has long
 been   honourably    connected with the arts. He was born in 1766,
 and   acquired  a knowledge    of his profession under the instructions
 of his father and     uncle,  and was subsequently employed, during
 many years, in the somewhat ambiguous capacity of architect and
 builder in the execution of many considerable works. In 1824 he
 was selected by George IV., to whom he had been formerly known,
 to design and superintend the magnificent alterations and additions
 to Windsor Castle, a truly royal and national work, in which he
 succeeded in combining uncommon external grandeur and strict
 architectural propriety with great convenience and splendour of
 internal arrangements.       Sir Jeffrey Wyattville, besides many im
 portant original works, made very extensive additions to the princi
 pal mansions of our nobility, including Chatsworth, Longleat, Wo
 burn, Badminton, and Ashridge. He was a man of sound judg
 ment and great integrity, and was very generally beloved for the
 remarkable simplicity and frankness of his manners, his great kind
 ness of heart, and cheerful and unaffected good humour.            He died
 in February last, and was buried in St.George's Chapel, at Windsor,
 in a vault which he had himself prepared for the reception of the
 remains of a beloved daughter, who died in the flower of her age.
    Captain   Charles Phillipps, of the Royal Navy,        was the author
 of several inventions of great value in navigation, and in the equip
 ment and management of ships: such are his methods of suspending
 compasses so as to avoid concussions in time of action; his improve
 ment of the pump-dale of ships, and more particularly the capstan,
 which bears his name, and which is in general use in the Navy. He
 was an active and enterprising officer, who had seen much service
 during the last war, had been eminently successful in rescuing
 slaves off the coast of Africa, and had nearly fallen a victim, in
 common with the greatest part of his crew, to that pestilential cli
mate.
    Sir Robert SEPPINGs received his education as a shipwright under
the late Sir John Henslow, Surveyor of the Navy, and continued
in connexion with the important service of our dock-yards during a
period of fifty years.     He was the author of many important im
provements in our naval architecture, including his system of dia
gonal bracing and trussing, which formed the subject of two memo
rable Papers in our Transactions in the years 1814* and 1818t, and
which attracted an unusual amount of public attention. The great
principle of this method was such an arrangement of the principal
timbers as would oppose a powerful mechanical action to every
change of position of the ribs and other timbers in every part of
the ship ; thus firmly compacting together the entire fabric, and
   * On a New Principle of Constructing His Majesty's Ships of War.—

preventing that perpetual racking of beams and working of joints,
which, in the ancient system of ship-building, produced hogging,
creaking, leakage, and rapid decay; and filling up likewise every
vacuity between the timbers, which were occasionally the unavoid
able receptacles for foul air, filth, vermin, and various other
sources     of rottenness and        disease.
    These important improvements, though opposed to the inveterate
 prejudices of the older shipwrights, a body of men who have not
 sufficiently valued and understood, in this country at least, the just
 principles of mechanical action, in the practical operation of ship
 building, were universally adopted in the Navy under the enlight
 ened administration of Mr. Charles York, and the powerful advo
 cacy of Sir John Barrow * : and the merit of their author was ac
 knowledged by his appointment as Surveyor of the Navy, and by
 the award of the Copley Medal of this Society.
    This was not the only important improvement which Sir Robert
 Seppings introduced into our system of naval architecture.         The
 Admiralty presented him with £1000 as a reward for his simple
yet most useful invention of an improved block for supporting ves.
sels, by which their keels and lower timbers were much more easily
and promptly examined and repaired.        His plan for lifting masts
out of the steps, which superseded the employment of sheer hulks
for that purpose, has been the means of saving much expense and
labour. His new mode of framing ships has led to a much more ex
tensive use of short and small timbers, which were formerly of little
value ; but the most valuable of all the reforms of construction for
which the Navy of England is indebted to him, was the substitution
of round for flat sterns, which afford increased strength to the frame
work of the ship, greater protection against pooping in heavy seas,
an almost equal power of anchoring by the stern and by the bow, a
more secure and effective position for the rudder, and a stout platform
for a powerful battery, embracing a sweep of more than 180°. This
capital improvement was strenuously opposed by many distinguished
naval officers, who regretted the loss of those magnificent cabins,
which were better suited for purposes of state than of service; but
the good sense of less prejudiced judges happily prevailed, and se
cured for our ships of war an additional claim upon the respect of
our enemies.
   Foreign nations have not been tardy to acknowledge the value of
these important improvements, and their author received many sub
stantial proofs of their sense of his merits; and we may safely affirm,
that in the national record of the great benefactors of their country,
there are few names which will deserve, and, we trust, continue to
receive, a more grateful commemoration than that of Sir Robert
Seppings.
  It has long been the practice of the Royal Society to associate
with  its
        body those persons     our country who are most eminent
                                       in

in this employment, and the reputation of his professional and other
attainments, secured him the appointment of Extraordinary Pro
fessor of Medicine in 1776, and of Ordinary Professor in 1778, a
situation which he continued to hold for nearly sixty years.
   His lectures comprehended Natural History, Comparative Anato
 my, Physiology and Pathology, on all which subjects he published
many      valuable memoirs and other works, more particularly his
admirable       Manuals, which have long enjoyed an extraordinary
popularity, and which have been translated into nearly every great
European language.
    The first of this series of publications was the “Handbuch der
Naturgeschichte," which appeared in 1779. In his “Institutiones
Physiologicae," a work equally remarkable for the originality, pre

any remarkable phaenomena that might occur.                   Their zeal in the
prosecution of these researches had been stimulated by the recent
discovery of Herschel, as well as by the revival of a suggestion
made by Kepler of the probable existence of a planet between
Mars and Jupiter, in conformity with one of those mystical ana
logies, which might have been treated as the visionary dreams
of an enthusiast, if they had not been so intimately connected with

     His well-known method of calculating the orbits of comets, which
 has been so generally used by German astronomers, was published
 at Weimar in 1797*, with a commendatory preface by his zealous
 friend the Baron de Zach.          This memoir, independently of         other                                           its

                    Deceased    Fellows:–M.       Poisson.                    75
gress which he made at this celebrated school surpassed the most
sanguine expectations of his kind patron, M. Billy, and secured him
the steady friendship and support of the most distinguished of his
teachers.
    In the year 1800, he presented to the Institute a memoir “Sur
le nombre d'intégrales complètes dont les équations aux différences
finies sont susceptibles," which cleared up a very difficult and ob
scure point of analysis.        It was printed on the recommendation of
 Laplace and Lagrange in the Mémoires des Savans Etrangers, an
 unexampled honour to be conferred on so young a man.
     Stimulated by this first success, we find him presenting a succes
 sion of memoirs to the Institute on the most important points of
 analysis, and rapidly assuming the rank of one of the first geometers
 of his age. He was successively made Répétiteur and then Professor
 of the Polytechnic School, Professor at the Collège de France and
 the Faculté des Sciences, Member of the Bureau des Longitudes,
 and finally, in 1812, Member of the Institute.
     His celebrated memoir on the invariability of the major axes of
 the planetary orbits, which received the emphatic approbation of
 Laplace, and secured him throughout his life the zealous patronage
 of that great philosopher, was presented to the Institute in the year
  1808.     Laplace had shown that the periodicity of the changes
 of the other elements, such as the eccentricity and inclina
  tion, depends on the periodicity of the changes of the major
  axis; a condition, therefore, which constitutes the true basis
  of the proof of the stability and permanence of the system of
  the universe.     Lagrange had considered this great problem in the
  Berlin Memoirs for 1776, and had shown that, by neglecting certain
  quantities which might possibly modify the result, the expression
  for the major axis involved periodical inequalities only, and that
  they were consequently incapable of indefinite increase or dimi
  mution.    It was reserved to Poisson to demonstrate a priori that the
  non-periodic terms of the order which he considered would mu
  tually destroy each other; a most important conclusion, which re
  moved the principal objection that existed to the validity of the
  demonstration of Lagrange”.
     This brilliant success of Poisson in one of the most difficult pro
  blems of physical astronomy, would appear to have influenced him in
   devoting himself thenceforward almost exclusively to the application
   of mathematics to physical science; and the vast number of memoirs
  and works (amounting to more than 300 in number) which he pub
      * The publication of this memoir recalled the attention of this illustrious
   mathematician to a subject which he had long neglected, and gave rise to
   three of his noblest memoirs.    Poisson, in his “Mémoire sur le Mouve
   ment de la Lune autour de la Terre,” has not satisfactorily      shown that
   the major axis of the moon's orbit contains no argument of long period
   amongst the terms which involve lower powers of a certain quantity m,
   which denotes the ratio of the sun’s mean motion to that of the moon,
   than the fourth; a demonstration of this most important proposition has
   been given by Sir John Lubbock in the Philosophical Magazine for the
   present year. [L. E. & D. Phil. Mag. vol. xvii. p. 338.]

76 Royal Society —Anniversary Address                 of the President:
lished during the last thirty years of his life, made this department
of mathematical science, and more particularly whatever related to
the action of molecular forces, pre-eminently his own. They compre
hend the theory of waves and of the vibrations of elastic substances,
the laws of the distribution of electricity and magnetism, the
                                                                            pro
pagation of heat, the    theory   of  capillary    attraction,  the attraction
of spheroids, the local magnetic attraction of ships, important pro
blems on chances, and a multitude of other subjects, which the
time allowed for this notice will not permit me to mention.                 His
well-known treatise on Mechanics is        incomparably      superior  to every
similar publication in the clear and decided exposition of principles
and methods, and in the happy and luminous combination of the
most general theories with their particular and most instructive
                                                                             ap
 plications.
    Poisson was not a philosopher who courted the credit of propound
ing original views which did not arise naturally out of the immediate
subjects of his researches; and he was more disposed to extend and
perfect the application of known methods of analysis to important
 physical problems, than to indulge in speculations on the inven
tion or transformation of formulae, which, however new and elegant,
 appeared to give him no obvious increase of mathematical power in
 the prosecution of his inquiries.         His delight was to grapple with
 difficulties which had embarrassed the greatest of his predecessors,
 and to bring to bear upon them those vast resources of analysis, and
those clear views of mechanical and physical principles in their most
 refined and difficult applications, which have secured him the most
 brilliant triumphs in nearly every department of physical science.
    The confidence which he was accustomed to feel in the results of
 his analysis—the natural result of his own clear perception of the
 necessary dependence of the several steps by which they were de
 duced—led him sometimes to accept conclusions of a somewhat
 startling character: such were his views of the constitution and finite
 extent of the earth's atmosphere, which some distinguished philoso
 phers have ventured to defend".          It is not in mathematical reason
 ings only that we are sometimes disposed to forget that the conclu
 sions which we make general are not dependent upon our assumed
 premises alone, but are modified by concurrent or collateral causes,
 which neither our analysis nor our reasonings are competent to
 comprehend.
     The habits of life of this great mathematician were of the
 most simple and laborious kind; though he never missed a meet
 ing of the Institute, or a lecture, or an examination, or any other
                                   other occasions,

 years,  he   denied access   to     visitors, and remained           his study

devoted to such constant study, and the total neglect of exercise and
healthy recreations, finally undermined his naturally vigorous con

made that he was labouring under the fatal disease of water in the
chest. The efforts of his physicians contributed for a time to mitigate
the more serious symptoms of his malady; but every relaxation of
his sufferings led to the resumption of his labours; and to the
earnest remonstrances of his friends, and the entreaties of his family,

form is irregular, but in some cases it has the appearance of six
sided tables, which approach a regular form ; these scales are raven
black, and reflect a very bright green, and yield a green powder.
Separately examined they are flat and shining, their lustre is vitreous
like the diamond, with very brilliant aggregated faces. They are not
translucent, but when very small they are transparent.                     It is diffi
cult to state their   cleavage     and    flexibility;      their specific gravity is
3: ; hardness on Mohs's scale = 3.                   It is therefore harder than
the mica of two axes, but less so than the pearly mica; it is rather
brittle; it is rather hard to the touch, but less than pearly mica,
Heated to redness by the blowpipe, it becomes of a tombac brown
colour, with the metallic lustre of magnetic iron ore. It gives a
bottle-green colour to borax, dissolves readily in nitric and hy
drochloric acid, and the silica remains in soft pearly scales and cry
stalline form, like the mica of one axis.               It yielded by analysis

   In some of its characters this mineral resembles a species of mica
which M. Breithaupt has described under the name of Sideriscker
Felsglimmer, or Raben Glimmer; but as the analysis of this has
not been given, it is difficult to ascertain whether these two minerals
belong to the same mineral species.—L'Institut, No. 352.
           HYDROTELLURIC AETHER.                 B.Y.   M. F. WOHLER.
   The existence of this compound is interesting, as affording a fresh
proof of the remarkable analogy which exists between sulphur and
tellurium, and as showing that the latter substance may, like sul
phur, enter into the composition of organic compounds, and replace
oxygen in them.
   This aether is readily prepared by the double decomposition of
sulphovinate of barytes and telluret of sodium ; it is sufficient for
this purpose to submit solutions of these two substances in water to
distillation.   The telluret is prepared by the calcination of tellurium,
or the native telluret of bismuth with carbonate of soda, mixed with
charcoal; and, in order to avoid oxidation, the rough product is im
mediately conveyed to the retort which contains the boiling solution
of sulphovinate.     The hydrotelluric aether distils with the water,
yielding, at the beginning, much froth in the retort.
   This substance is a liquid of a reddish-yellow odour, approaching
the colour of bromine, but lighter; it is heavier than water, and this
dissolves only a trace of
                                 it;    its
                                      odour    disagreeable, extremely
                                                   is

to be very poisonous.        Its boiling point is below 212°; it readily
takes fire and burns with a brilliant white flame, terminated by a blue
which is quite peculiar, and it yields a very thick white vapour of
telluric acid. This aether, when exposed to the air, is soon covered
with a pellicle, which is at first yellowish, becomes afterwards white,
and is eventually converted into tellurous acid.            If it be exposed in
a vessel to the direct    rays  of the  sun,  it immediately    exhales vapour,

 are contained.       To my astonishment, however, I found both
 this, as well as the next portion distilled, free from every trace
 of nitric acid, or any other oxide of nitrogen; on the contrary,
 the residuum in the retort was considerably more contamina

 Barruelº had already drawn attention                      to,

4    ounces        of

               to               taking  the precaution         change the     to
 receivers frequently.         The first three ounces distilled were
 very watery, and contained much nitric acid and little sul
 phuric acid; the succeeding two and three ounces consisted
 almost solely          sulphuric acid, which contained but little
                         of
 nitric  acid, the next two ounces still contained trace              nitric
                                                                         a          of

 pure sulphuric acid distilled over. An acid then passed over,
containing traces          oneof       of

                                                       of
the distillation was discontinued.
    The residuum          the retort was coloured yellow, and disen
                            in
gaged, when mixed with water, nitric oxide, which changed,
 on  coming into contact with atmospheric air, into nitrous acid.
 To observe this more distinctly, some the acid was conveyed
                                                       of

strong dark colouring; the other portion, treated in the same
manner, did not exhibit this at all.    Had the residue con
tained nitrous  acid, nitric acid must have formed on dilution
with water, and I must have obtained in the boiled liquid a
reaction of nitric acid.   I have subsequently always tested in
this way,  and have found it to be the best, when I wished to
learn whether nitric oxide or nitrous acid was combined with
                º

   The   sulphate   of the  protoxide     of iron is a most excellent
reagent for the slightest traces of nitric oxide, nitrous and                                              ni
tric acids; but it is absolutely essential always to add a con
siderable             of pure sulphuric acid, as otherwise small
traces might easily be overlooked.
   Nitric oxide and nitrous acid may be very well distinguished
in concentrated sulphuric acid from nitric acid, by the addi
tion of a dilute solution of the bichromate of potash, for both
reduce the chromic acid to oxide, while they themselves are
converted into nitric acid. The liquid is thereby coloured
green; it        is,

      If
     this crystalline saline mass was treated in a dry glass
gradually with water, nitric oxide was evolved, and there was
formed, according to the quantity of water, a green, blue,
and lastly, a colourless liquid. The crystalline mass dissolves
in concentrated sulphuric acid without decomposition; and,
if the solution be subjected to distillation, the superfluous sul
phuric acid, contaminated by some sulphate of nitric oxide, first
passes over, and then the concentrated solution of the sulphate
of nitric oxide in sulphuric acid, which can be distilled over
several times without decomposition. This solution, as well as
the crystalline mass, was tested for nitric and nitrous acids
in the manner previously described, without, however, a trace
of them being discovered. As a counter-experiment here like
wise, as always subsequently, a drop of nitric acid was added
to the one half of the diluted solution, and both portions were
boiled for an equal length of time.       In the portion to which
nitric acid had been     added,    naturally         I

aqueous solution traces        of
                               nitric acid were constantly detected;
this slight trace undoubtedly arose solely from the adherent
mother-liquor, from which cannot    it            be
                                             separated. The nitrous
acid seems     have been decomposed
                to                                     on
                                                     passing through

combining with the sulphuric acid, while the latter is present
in great quantity in the mother-liquor. It is hence evident,
that the crystals formed in this manner are contaminated either
by nitric acid or by the nitrate of nitric oxide.
     I now prepared         these crystals by passing sulphurous acid
and nitric         oxide into a large vessel filled with atmospheric air,
into which, by means of a glass tube, I could spurt water or
blow air.   With the presence of some water and an excess of
nitric oxide, the crystals formed immediately, and covered
partly the inner sides of the vessel, partly appeared in the
centre in crystalline flakes, quite similar to snow.            Decom
posed by water, nitric oxide was abundantly evolved; but if
this solution was boiled with sulphuric acid and water, and
then solution of copperas and pure sulphuric acid added to                                  it,
it evinced         no
                reaction             of
                             nitric acid, but this must necessarily
have been the case        the crystalline mass consisted

                          nitric acid had been formed           diluting        by
with water, and that these crystals therefore did not consist                               of
nitrous acid and sulphuric acid, but                      of

 88      M. Adolph     Rose on the Combination       of Hydrated
 to see that sulphurous acid is constantly present in sufficient
 quantity in the chamber.
     The quantitative analysis of these crystals, as well as of
 those which originate on passing nitric oxide into sulphuric
 acid, and which is connected with some difficulties, I intend
 communicating in a subsequent paper.
    The solution of the sulphate of nitric oxide in sulphuric
 acid is so analogous to the red fuming nitric acid, that it is
 not improbable that the latter may be with more reason re
 garded as a solution of the nitrate of nitric oxide in nitric
 acid, in favour of which, moreover, is the fact noticed by Gay
 Lussac, that crystals are formed on mixing the red fuming
                          .
 nitric acid with fuming sulphuric acid, which are undoubtedly
 the sulphate of nitric oxide.     If  the solution of the sulphate of
 nitric oxide in  sulphuric    acid be distilled, the superfluous sul
 phuric acid as above-mentioned first passes over, and then
 this concentrated solution, which can be distilled several times
 without decomposition.         When heated, the concentrated so
 lution becomes yellow; diluted with water it is changed, un
 der evolution of nitric oxide, according to the quantity of
 water, into a green, blue, and colourless liquid, just as is the
 case with fuming nitric acid. Both this, as well as the fuming
 nitric acid, cannot be                 decomposed by mere dilution
 with  water, for if the diluted solutions of both be kept for any
 length of time, they still decolorate the solution of the perman
 ganate of potash.      But by heating, nitric oxide is expelled
 from   both, only  in fuming     nitric acid quicker.    Both can be
 prepared by merely passing nitric oxide into sulphuric acid,
 or into nitric acid.
    Berzelius" considers it quite as probable that the fuming
nitric acid is a solution of a combination of nitric oxide with
nitric acid, as that it is a combination of nitrous acid with ni
tric acid in excess of nitric acid; and the first view un
doubtedly acquires greater probability from the existence of
an analogous combination with sulphuric acid.
    It now appeared to me still of interest to learn how it is that
at present the sulphuric acid is so frequently contaminated
with the sulphate of nitric oxide, for contamination with nitric
acid perhaps seldom occurs.            I diluted pure sulphuric acid
with water so long till it had a spec. gr. of 1.2 (of which con
centration it is generally drawn off from the lead chambers),
and treated a portion of it with the sulphate of nitric oxide, a
portion with a solution of the same in sulphuric acid, a portion
with pure nitric acid, and another portion with fuming nitric
acid. Upon this I heated each portion separately in a retort un

    In the distillation of sulphuric acid several precautions have
 been proposed to avoid the sudden jerks (stossweise) in the boil
 ing of the acid, yet most of them are by cautious equal heat
 ing, even the platina wire, unnecessary, and I have at last even
 distilled without this over an open fire, without ever meeting
 with an accident. But it is very necessary that the neck of the
 retort is not too long and is as broad as possible, and that the

                  the Ores  of Iron, and Crude Iron.              91
 tities. The quantity of peroxide is ascertained in the manner
just indicated.     To determine the quantity of protoxide the
 whole of the iron must be brought into the state of peroxide,
 and from the amount of the peroxide thus obtained must be
 deducted the quantity of peroxide in the first experiment, and
 the remainder reduced to the protoxide by calculation.
     The following precautions must be observed in order to
 obtain accurate results. The copper must be in a state of
                   i.
 purity. The hydrochloric acid must be also pure, tolerably
 concentrated, and employed in excess.        Nitric acid should not
 be used for bringing the iron to the state of peroxide, but either
 a stream of                or what is preferable, chlorate of pot
 ash. Upon adding the piece of copper to the solution it must
 immediately be brought to the boiling point, and kept there
 in order to prevent access of air. Previously to removing the
 undissolved copper from the solution, hot water is to be added
 till the vessel is quite full; this is to be poured off and fresh
                                                    ...}
  hot water to be added: the copper, which is generally covered
  with a brownish coating, is then carefully                 in cold
  water, dried at a gentle heat, and then weighed.         The fore
  going process has this advantage; that the substances ordi
  narily met with in iron ores,-such as silica, alumina, mag
  nesia, lime, oxide of titanium, oxides of manganese, the phos
 phoric and sulphuric acids, &c.—do not in any way interfere
  with the accuracy of the results.        An iron ore containing
 arsenic, however, cannot be analysed on this principle, as
  blackish gray scales of arseniuret of copper are deposited on
  the metallic copper.                                              -
     This process is applicable to the examination of cast iron,
  or iron of other kinds, and also for the comparison of one sort
  of iron with another.
      Among many experiments which were made, M. Fuchs
  relates the following.                                            -
      Exp. 1, 50 grains of very soft English iron were dissolved
  in hydrochloric acid, and brought to the state of peroxide by
  chlorate of potash; 85.8 grains of pure copper were boiled in
  this solution, of which 56.2 grains were dissolved.      Therefore
  as 31-7:28:: 56-2:49:46, which is equal to 98.92 per cent.
  of pure iron; a repetition of this experiment gave 99.19 per
  Cent.
     Exp.  2. 50 grains   of pianoforte wires were examined, which
  indicated 98.75   per  cent, of pure iron. The iron in this expe
  riment was    peroxidized   by a current of chlorine; a consider
  able  deposit  of carbon was formed during the process of so
  lution in  hydrochloric   acid, which, however, disappeared upon
  passing chlorine through the solution.

XVII.                                By John WILLIAMs, Esq.
           On the Electricity of Steam.
  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
         GENTLEMEN,
EARLY   in November last, I read in your Journal a com
   munication from Mr. Armstrong, of Newcastle-upon
Tyne, on the subject of the electricity observed in a jet of
steam issuing from the boiler of a high-pressure steam engine +.
I felt much   interested on reading this account, as    doubt not                  I
that it will eventually lead to some valuable discoveries relative
to meteorology and atmospherical electricity, subjects which
have occupied much of my attention for more than forty years
P ast.
    Volta's experiment of dropping a red-hot coal into a vessel
of water placed on the insulated cap of an electrometer,                                   was
repeated by me in various ways and on a large scale; and
from the results,        I
                      came to a conclusion that the positive elec
tricity observed in the steam-cloud on                           its
                                               immediate formation
was simply the effect       evaporation, and not,
                                  of                     some elec               as

XVIII.     On the Circumstances under which Steam developes                                                  Po
      sitive Electricity. By Dr. CHARLEs SchAFHAEUTL*.
  N                   Mr. Bradley of the Adelaide Gallery,
      a conversation with
   he informed me that steam issuing under a pressure of
about 40 atmospheres, from the boilers of Mr. Perkins's
steam-gun, was able only slightly to move the gold leaves of a
voltaic condenser.      On my expressing an opinion that the
electricity of the issuing steam had some relation to the form
ation of the deposit or incrustation in the boiler, he invited
 me to make some experiments at the Adelaide Gallery, in
 order,    if
           possible, to elucidate this point.
    As Mr. Perkins's boiler is constructed so as to prevent
 any incrustation forming, I selected for my experiments a
 common Marcet boiler, consisting of a globular iron vessel
about 5 inches diameter, in the vertical axis of which is
 inserted a mercurial gauge, and at an angle of 45 degrees
from       it,thermometer on one side, and on the other side
jet, with        a a
               stop-cock.    The lower part           the boiler was              of                          of a

course occupied         quicksilver,      the top         which distilled              of
water was    poured      the height           inch.                     1%

                   a                                    inches diameter        of   9

     After the greater part of the water had been evaporated
 the boiler was opened, the deposited salt removed, and after
 being well washed filled again with distilled water. After the
 steam had reached a pressure of 31 inches, as in the first                                                in

  ing that peculiar condition of the steam which produces the

  be caused solely by the sudden boiling of the water, and the

   with a  dry  folded silk handkerchief, but the omission of all
   these precautions did not in the slightest degree affect the

  in the glass bell could not be contained in the steam during

98        Dr. Schafhaeutl   on the Circumstances   under which
the increase of the wind rose to the highest degree of wet;
the thermometer at the same time falling, which was followed
immediately by a separation of water and a flash of lightning,
either at the same moment, or following each other at short
intervals.     It therefore appears that the column of vapour
rising from the crater of a volcano seems to be in a similar
 condition to the fluttering steam issuing from the jet of
 Marcet's boiler, and the flashes of lightning attributable to
 the separation of the liquid water from steam and smoke, as
I   hinted in my first communication on this subject, before I
 was enabled to make these experiments.
     In continuing the above-mentioned experiments, found    I
 that the bundle of wires connected with the electroscope for
 the absorption of the supposed electricity of the steam, might
 be dispensed with, and nothing more was necessary than to
 hold the glass bell against the jet of issuing steam; and as
 soon as the peculiar rushing noise commenced, the jet of
 steam at the same time changing from transparency to a milk
 white opacity, the interior of the bell became immediately
  charged with electricity, whether the bell was 9 or 18 inches
 distant from the metallic jet.       Ifthe inside of the bell be
  brought whilst in this state into contact with the knob of the
  electroscope, the gold leaves immediately diverge very widely,
 and by repeating this experiment several times, a spark may
 easily be obtained.
     A copper wire inserted through the jet into the boiler,
  forming the axis of the pencil of issuing steam, such wire
  approaching even within an inch of the glass bell, did not in
  the slightest degree affect the results described; a further
  proof that the free electricity which manifested itself was not
  contained in the issuing steam, but was developed during con
  densation in the glass bell.    A tinfoil, coating on the outside
  of the bell, reaching within an inch and a quarter of the edge,
  very considerably diminished the quantity of electricity. When
  an inch and a half of this coating was removed, the bell acted
  the same as when entirely uncovered, which may, perhaps, be
  simply ascribed to the steam on rushing out of the bell coming
 into contact with the foil when it is so near the edge.
     Ifthe water in the boiler was saturated with common salt
 or with sulphate of lime, and even a slight excess of sulphuric
 acid, the angle between the diverging gold leaves remained
 the same as if distilled water was used.
    From these experiments we may safely infer that the ob
 served free positive electricity in this case was solely attribu
 table to the sudden condensation and separation of water from
 steam, caused in my experiment by           its
                                             coming into contact

                     Steam developes Positive Electricity.                                         99
 with the internal surface of the glass bell, on the superficial
 contents of which the quantity of electricity developed greatly
depends.      On a larger scale, as in a steam-engine, the air in
 which the cloud originates has the same function as the glass
 surface. In thunder storms the currents of            rushing towards  air
the centre       of
                the nascent    cloud,    produce   the peculiar sudden
condensation and separation             water-gas similar

   Sericate of Silver.—This salt may be prepared by double
decomposition in the same manner as sericate of barytes.
   When it is newly precipitated, it is a bulky white powder,
which speedily acquires a lilac colour by exposure to light.
To avoid this it must be washed in the dark. It is insoluble
in water, but very soluble in a solution of caustic ammonia,
from which it may be obtained, by spontaneous evaporation,
in large transparent colourless crystals. It melts upon the
application of heat, but at the same time undergoes decom
position.

that a   quantity  of carbonic acid always passed into the appa
ratus, containing potash.     This gain was generally about one
third of the potash employed, two-thirds still remaining in
combination with the alkali.        By subtracting this from the
weight of the carbonic acid obtained in the experiment, and
calculating the potash as a neutral carbonate, we cannot be
far from the truth. This has been done by Redtenbacher + in
his researches upon stearic acid, and is the only one at pre

From    which results the formula Cºo Ho Oz, which was
adopted by Berzelius and most other chemists; and the
acid being bibasic, the formula for the anhydrous acid was
Czo Ho; Os. As, however, in organic analyses the hydrogen is
valued a little too high, Liebig proposed lately the formula
Czo Ho; Oa. In order to decide upon the constitution of these
bodies, M. Redtenbacher commenced a complete investigation
of them at Liebig's request.
   The result was that the stearic acid was found, by a careful
series of analyses executed on it in                        its
                                       hydrated condition, and

olive oil, is identical in constitution, being when hydrated ex
pressed by Cai, Hsi O, or when anhydrous, by Cai Has Os.
   The margaric aether consists of an atom of margaric acid
and one of aether, Cs, Hs Oa-HC, H, O,
   Warrentrapp analysed the margarone which is produced
when margaric acid is distilled with lime.         Its formula is
Cs Has O, or it is formed by the loss of the elements of one
atom of carbonic acid.
   From these results, however, it follows equally, as from the
older, that the carbon and hydrogen is the same in the stearic
and the margaric acids, which differ only in the proportion of
oxygen,
        1 equivalent of Stearic acid         = Css Hog Os
        2 equivalents of    Margaric   acid = Css Hº Og
and hence Berzelius's idea is still quite true, that if we ex
press Cai Hss by R, then
    º
 Margaric acid = R +Os, like sulphuric acid S-I-O,
 Stearic acid     = R,+O, , like hyposulphuric acid S,--O.
  But it still remains to be shown how destructive distillation,
which is in general not an oxidating process, changes both the
stearic and oleic acids into margaric acid. This has been
explained by Redtenbacher.        Besides margaric acid there
are

large proportion, so that the process consists in four equiva

   The action of nitric acid on stearic acid has been accurately
studied by Bromeis, and has produced extremely interesting
results.  In the first instance an equivalent of anhydrous
stearic acid is converted into two equivalents of anhydrous
margaric acid, by the absorption of an equivalent of oxygen,
Cos Hog Os, and O producing twice Cs, Has Os.
   When the action of the nitric acid is continued, suberic
acid is produced in large quantity, the formula of it being
Cs. He Os--Aq.

margaric and suberic acid. The mother liquor from which
these have separated contain the pimelic and adipic acids dis

tained a different result, viz. C14 Ho Oz +2 Aq.

large tables, and melts at 112° Fahrenheit.      It is easily solu
ble in  alcohol, from which it  separates in crystals like benzoic
acid. It is also soluble in aether. These solutions react acid.
   When elaidic acid is treated with a great excess of caustic
potash it is completely decomposed, and a new acid formed
identical with that which Warrentrapp had found oleic acid to
give under the same circumstances: with carbonated alkalies
it produces, however, soaps from which it separates on the
addition of a stronger acid unchanged.
   The elaidates of silver, lead, and barytes are voluminous
white precipitates; that of silver may be obtained crystallized
from an ammoniacal solution.”

that in this distillation it is only the oleic acid which pro

              decomposition, the sebacic acid.     Neither gly

quantity of carbonic acid, sebacic acid, a large proportion of
a liquid having the composition of olefiant gas, and some
charcoal remains: thus

                                                         articulate sounds.
    This  part         of
                     acoustics   may   conveniently          called the pro  be
vince   of phonetics.
    How far the articulate sounds are systematically related                                          to
each other; how far and                what cases they run into each
other; how far the chain                     of in
                                        relationship       lineal, and how

    is    circular;    how far vowels and         consonants,     mutes and
liquids differ        kind from each other; these questions, and
                       in
questions similar        these, constitute the province
                              to                                   phonetics.      of
    These     investigations    must                 be
                                              distinguished,         the one        on
hand, from those              of
                          physiology, and                       on
                                                    the other hand, from
those    of etymology.
    The science        phonetics determines how two given articu
                         of
lations are related; the science                       of
                                                physiology inquires how
they are produced.
    Phonetics tell us that between two articulations an immu
table and essential relation exists; whilst etymology observes
that under certain circumstances one articulation                   changed
into another.        Very   often  etymology      does   more;       assumes       it is
the alliance from the change.
    Now      itdoes not follow,          etymology, that because
                                               in                                                in   a
given language one sound changes                       another, those two
                                                                to to
sounds    are,   therefore,  naturally    allied     each other; although
such    isoften (far, however, from always) the case.
    Nor yet has been proved
                         it                   physiology that the sounds
                                                     in
                                                                             by
 which   to  the ear sound     alike,  are  produced            like disposi a

a   correspondence exists          highly probable.

    The truth           is,
                      that the special study          phonetics, instead

                  by
 mological and physiological classifications, have been applied
 where acoustic principles alone ought              have been recognized.

 for the most part been gratuitously assumed; and more than
 this,  in those cases where the three tests have not coincided,
 the  disposition    has been         sacrifice the phonetic test
                                         to                                the                  to

     The Phonetic test stands thus—Two sounds are allied, be
cause,   to the ear, they sound alike.
    The  physiological   test thus—Two sounds are allied, because,
in the mouth and larynx, they are formed alike.
    The etymological test thus—Two sounds are allied, be
cause, under certain circumstances, one is changed to the
other.
    Expressed in Latin axioms, the etymological test                                                                     is,

sound of   g  (as in ga).
   The sound of w (as in wa) is to the sound of v (as in va)
in a certain degree of relation; and, through this, it is allied
to b (as in ba), in a manner determinable
                                                  by the relation of

                    was left to consider what really was                and                       G,
whether such a sound either actually existed or was capable
of existing.
     Idrew the distinction between the actual and the possible
existence of a sound for the following reason. It is very evident
that although an articulation may be capable of being both
formed by the larynx and distinguished by the ear, it may
not exist in any spoken language; in other words, it does not
follow that because a sound exists in posse it exists in esse
also.    If the French were the universal language, the sound of
the   English   thwould exist only in the capabilities of the ear
and   larynx;    it would be a sound in posse, or a latent sound.
   Now against G, being a possible sound,                 knew of no rea      I
son except the accident of                         its

                           Correction in his pap
     The pressure p, corresponding to 6 =                              + is that part which
is common to every point of the surface of the sphere. Hence
the pressure which tends to put the sphere in motion, or
p—p, , is
                                 b m     r   cos   6 cos b t.
This, by the remark made at the commencement of the rea
soning, is the same pressure as when the fluid is stationary
and the sphere in motion, and is identical, if very small quan
tities be neglected, with the value obtained by a very different
process at the bottom of p. 465 of my communication to the
December Number. The consideration of the lateral press
ure does not therefore lead to any variation from the former
result.
    The force of this explanation will, perhaps, be more clearly
seen by the following remark.      Supposing the sphere at rest
and the fluid in  motion,   the velocity  at the position corre
sponding to 6 = 0 is nothing.        But as the lines drawn at
any instant in the direction of the motion of the particles
through which they pass nowhere intersect the surface of the
sphere, it follows that the particles about that position are
successively carried along the surface            position corretill   at   a
sponding      to
              6        =         they acquire the velocity                        of   the stream.

the air was discharged, as to yield sparks fully a quarter of
an inch long.     I afterwards tried the same experimenta great
number of     times,  and, strange to say, the electricity of the
vessel, though generally negative, occasionally proved to be
positive. Sometimes the electricity was very strong, and some
times very weak, and frequently I could get no electricity at
all. By means of an insulated conductor terminating in a
number of points,             I
                        also obtained electricity from the ejected
air, and found it to be positive every time tried                    I              it.

improbable that evaporation may even here             the source          be                          of
the electricity.    am  I          by   no

success when the receiver was cold and damp, was not mere

scribed in the catalogue of the minerals in Trinity College
Museum, drawn up in 1807 by the late Rev. Walter Stephens,
no specimen of Irish tin-stone is mentioned; and even at a
later period, in 1818, when my respected friend, Dr. Whitley
Stokes, published his catalogue, Irish tin-stone is not to be
found in the list.
   These circumstances would almost induce us to suspect
that some other substance must have been mistaken for tin
stone by the directors of the works at the gold mine.
   The next notice of this metal being found in Ireland is in
the catalogue of Irish minerals in the museum of the Royal
Dublin Society, published in 1832 by the late Sir Charles
Giesecke.   No. 213 is thus described: “tin-stone of a hair
brown  colour,  accompanies frequently, in small grains, the
native gold found in streams at Croaghan mountain, county
Wicklow.”
 Ever since                I have turned
                               my attention to mineralogy,      have                         I
anxiously sought for a specimen of Irish          ore,     our public   tin        in
museums,        well  as     several private collections
                                    as   in                     Irish                    of
minerals, but was unsuccessful          discovering any such spe

coils and those of the other parts of the circuit, must, in order to
produce the maximum effect with the least expenditure of power, be
varied to suit each particular case.
   In the concluding part of the paper the author points out several
other and very different methods of effecting the same purpose; and
in particular one in which Faraday's magneto-electric currents are
employed, instead of the current produced by a voltaic battery: he
also describes a modification of the sympathetic instrument, calcu
lated to enable it to act at great distances with a weaker electric cur
rent than if it were constructed on the plan first described.
                 ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY.
               February 14, 1840.   Annual Meeting.
               Ertracts from the Report of the Council.
  “Twenty years have now elapsed since this Society was             in
stituted : during which period, the advances in Astronomy, both
theoretical and practical, must be evident to the most ordinary
observer.    For, not only have public and private observatories been
multiplied beyond any former example, but a great impulse has,
generally, been given to every department of the science. There is
now scarcely a single branch of astronomy that is not pursued in
detail by one or other of the many active astronomers of the pre
sent day; whether requiring the laborious exertions of the ob
servatory, or the equally arduous investigations of the closet.      In
the construction and manipulation of instruments also, great and
important improvements have been made, which have introduced a
system of accuracy and minuteness unprecedented in former times.
If this Society has not, indeed, been the originator of this happy
state of things, it has at least cordially assisted in the impulse: and
let us hope that the next twenty years will be distinguished by
similar exertions, and crowned with equal success.
    “Amongst the losses by death, during the past year, the Council
have to announce the decease of his Majesty the King of Denmark,
 one of the honorary members of the Society, and a great patron of
the science of Astronomy.      In the year 1832, his Majesty founded
a gold medal, for the first discovery of a telescopic comet not
previously known; and in November 1835, the conditions on which
 the medal was to be awarded were read at the meeting of this
 Society, and published in the Monthly Notices.          It is somewhat
remarkable, that from that period till within a few hours of his
Majesty's decease, when the recent comet was observed by M.
 Galle at Berlin, no discovery of the kind had been made ; although,
 some years previously, a considerable number of comets had made
their appearance: and his Majesty's liberal intention had, conse
 quently, been nearly frustrated. It will be gratifying to the Society
to know that his Majesty's successor, the present King of Denmark,
 is also a patron of our science; and it     is,  therefore, with much

 142      Royal Astronomical Society :-Deceased Members :
 pleasure, that the Council propose that he be elected an honorary
 member, in the place of his late predecessor".
    “The other losses that the Council have to deplore, are those of
 Mr. Davies Gilbert, Professor Rigaud, and Mr. Epps.
    “Mr. Davies Gilbert was born on the 6th of March, 1767, in the
 parish of St. Erth, in the west of Cornwall.         His father was the
 Rev. Edward Giddy, his mother Catherine Davies, a descendant of
 William Noye, attorney-general in the reign of Charles the First.
 The subject of this memoir was reared with great care and attention
 as a child of promise but not of robust health.      His early education
 was conducted at home    by   his father, who was well qualificd for the
 task as a   scholar, and as a man of acknowledged ability and at
 tainments; but his pupil's taste soon led him to prefer the study of
 the severer sciences to the elegancies of classical literature; and
 these studies were pursued with an ardour not to be repressed.        As
 he grew up it was thought expedient to place him in the grammar
 school of Penzance (of which the Rev. James Parkin was then the
 master); and for that purpose, his parents removed for about
 eighteen months to that town.        In the year 1782 they removed to
 Bristol, where their son's studies were assisted, for a time, by Mr.
 Benjamin Donne.      In the year 1786 he was matriculated at Oxford,
 after having been entered as a gentleman-commoner of Pembroke
 College.    He had already made himself master of considerable
 mathematical and physical knowledge, and had acquired the greater
 portion of it by almost unassisted application.     His efforts had been
 guided and aided, indeed, by a very friendly intercourse with the
 Rev. Malachy Hitchins, vicar of St. Hilary (whose connexion with
 the late Dr. Maskelyne and the ‘Nautical Almanac' is well known),
 from whom, as he has himself recorded, he obtained, whenever it
 was asked, information “in those sciences which afforded him unin
terrupted entertainment and delight throughout the whole conti
                                                                 -
 nuance of a protracted life.’
    “During his residence at Oxford, he was a regular attendant at
the lectures on anatomy and mineralogy of Dr. Thomson, at Christ
 Church. He likewise attended with assiduity the lectures on che
mistry and botany of Drs. Beddoes and Sibthorp, and formed with
them alliances of reciprocal friendship, which terminated only with
 their lives. His society was, in fact, courted by his seniors, and
included a long list of the most eminent among the professors and
other distinguished men of the University.
    “He took the honorary degree of M.A., and continued to reside
much in his college, until, in 1793, he returned to Cornwall to
serve the office of sheriff, where his time was divided between the
cultivation of science and literature, and the duties of a magistrate
in a populous and busy county.
    “Soon after this, we find him brought into closer contact with
the world, and enabled to display, upon the wider stage of the me

 fixed copious memoirs of Bradley himself. This work contains, be.
 sides several other unedited papers of Bradley, his original observa
 tions for the determination of the constants of aberration and
 nutation.    These observations had been lost sight of for upwards of
 seventy years; and, but for Mr. Rigaud's zeal and exertion, would,
in all probability, never have been recovered. Fortunately, however,
it came to his knowledge that several MSS. of Bradley still existed
among the papers of Dr. Hornsby, then in the possession of his fa
mily, by whom they were readily given up on application from the
 University. Mr. Rigaud was requested to undertake the office of
editor; a task which was not an easy one, owing to the confused
state of the materials from which he had to derive his information.
He succeeded, however, in producing a work which will ever be re
garded as a most valuable record in the history of our science.               So
highly was it esteemed on the Continent, that in the very next year
after  its publication, the Royal Academy           Sciences       Copenhagen

 the more sterling qualities of his character.    For many years past,
 however, he had entered but little into society. His almost constant
 residence, for nearly half a century, was Oxford; and there he has
 left a large circle of friends, who had abundant opportunities of
 knowing his virtues, and who will long regret his removal. In him
 the University has lost a most devoted son; and it is now a conso
 lation to remember that he was ever foremost among those whom she
 delighted to honour.
     “Mr. James Epps was appointed Assistant-Secretary of this
 Society in 1830, and during the eight years he officiated in that ca
 pacity, he not only merited the approbation of the Council by the
 ability and zeal with which he discharged the duties of his office,
 but also rendered himself acceptable to the Fellows at large by his
 uniform urbanity, his cheerful disposition, and his readiness to
 oblige on all occasions.    Although he had not the advantages of a
 regular education, and the occupations of his early life left but little
 leisure for the cultivation of the sciences, he had acquired, never
 theless, very considerable knowledge both of theoretical and practi
 cal astronomy; and he had also much skill and experience in astro
 nomical computation.       He was the author of several papers printed
 in our Memoirs; namely, one in the fourth volume, accompanied by
 some useful tables for computing the azimuthal         deviations of a
 transit instrument from the observed passages of two stars through
 the vertical it describes; another, in the same volume, on the errors
 of the same instrument occasioned by the inclination of the axis to
 the horizon; one, in the sixth volume, on the method of ascertaining
 the comparative rates of chronometers; and one, in the ninth vo
lume, on the investigation of formulae for reducing observations
 made with the annular micrometer. He likewise recently contributed
another paper on the errors that may be produced in determining
 differences of longitude by observations of moon-culminating stars,
when there are no corresponding observations; accompanied by a
table of results deduced from comparisons of such observations, with
the places given in the ‘Nautical Almanac,' which has been ordered
by the Council to be printed in the forthcoming volume.
    “In 1838, Mr. Epps resigned his office in the Society, and re
moved to Hartwell to superintend the private observatory of our
excellent Treasurer, Dr. Lee.      For this appointment he was emi
nently well qualified.      He entered on its duties with his usual
ardour; thus meriting the friendship and esteem of his patron,
which he continued to enjoy without interruption to the hour of his
death.     On his removal to Hartwell, he was elected a Fellow of
this Society.
    “Mr. Epps was a man of varied accomplishments and extensive
general information; and knew well how to turn theoretical know
ledge to practical account.      He was born in 1773, of humble but
respectable parents residing in Kent; and died at Hartwell on the
10th of August last, regretted by all who knew him.
    “In the Report of the Council to the Society in the year 183s,
it was stated that the pendulum observations made by the late

                              Anniversary      of 1840.                             147
   lamented Lieut. Murphy in Asia, had been received, and placed in
   the hands of Mr. Baily, for examination and reduction.  Since that
   period, the pendulums themselves have arrived, and Mr. Baily has
   repeated his experiments on them, for the purpose of comparing the
   results before and after the voyage, with those made by Lieut.
   Murphy.     A Report on the whole of these experiments, and on
   their general result, will be made by Mr. Baily, and read to the
   Society at one of the evening meetings.  These pendulums are now
   entrusted to Capt. James Clark Ross, as already mentioned, for the
   purpose of making further experiments at such places as he may
   find it convenient, during his present scientific voyage : and they
   are thus, for the third time, placed in active operation.
        “As connected with this subject, it may be mentioned that when
  Mr. Maclear departed for the Cape of Good Hope, to take the
  superintendence of the Observatory there, he took with him one of
  Kater's invariable pendulums, that had been previously swung in
  this country by Mr. Baily.       That pendulum has recently been
  returned to this country, together with a detail of Mr. Maclear's
  experiments.    The whole have been placed in the hands of Mr.
  Baily, who will, in this case also, report upon the general result.
    “In alluding to the labours of Mr. Maclear at the Cape of Good
  Hope, the Council may mention also his intention of remeasuring
  the arc of meridian formerly measured by Lacaille.       Already have
  the stations of Lacaille been satisfactorily identified, and the lati
  tudes of the extreme stations been observed, as we have seen by the
  paper recently read to this Society: and the requisite apparatus has
 been sent out       for finishing what has been so auspiciously begun.
   Under the direction of this able and zealous astronomer, there is
   every reason to expect a satisfactory result to so important an
   operation.
      “The Council have great pleasure in stating that the eleventh
  volume of the Memoirs of the Society is now in the press, and that
  considerable progress has been made in the printing. Amongst the
                                                                                    he all

    “To   the British Association also, astronomers are indebted for
another work of a similar kind: namely, the reduction of all the
observations of stars made by Lacaille at the Cape of Good Hope.
It is well known that only 1942 of those stars were reduced by La
caille himself, and formed into a catalogue, which is printed at the
end of his ‘,Calum Australe Stelliferum :’ but the great mass of his
observations, consisting of upwards of 10,000, have never yet been
reduced, although they are of equal authority with those in the pub
lished catalogue.    The execution of this work is proceeding under
the direction of Professor Henderson of Edinburgh, who has been
kind enough to supply the elements for the reduction, and to super
intend the process of the computations: and there is every reason
to believe that Lacaille's new and enlarged catalogue will, as far as
the stars in the old catalogue are concerned, be more entitled to
confidence (since it is founded on more accurate elements) than the
original catalogue published by Lacaille himself.    It will, moreover,
contain a great number of other stars of equal authority, unknown
to astronomers till the appearance of the recent catalogue of Sir
Thomas Brisbane.
    “Connected with this subject is another work of great interest,
likewise proposed by the British Association; namely, a revision of
the nomenclature of the stars, and of their division into constella
tions.   It is well known that much confusion at present exists in
the notation that has gradually crept into practice : a notation now
without order, system, regularity, or uniformity. Hevelius was the
first to break in upon the arrangement of the constellations as pro
pounded by Ptolemy; and Flamsteed (or his editors), although he
did not disturb the order or number of the constellations in the ca
talogue of Hevelius, yet introduced some confusion by inserting
stars in one constellation that had previously been considered as
belonging to another: Bayer's mode of indicating the relative mag
nitudes of the stars in each constellation was in a great measure
lost sight of ; and thus the way was led for that mass of confusion
which is contained in Bode's large catalogue of 17,240 stars. In
the southern hemisphere, we find Halley and Lacaille introducing
totally new constellations, frequently overlapping each other, and
the stars themselves indicated by such a profusion of letters (many
of them precisely similar and several times repeated in the same
constellation), that it is often difficult and not always possible to
identify them. With the view of applying a remedy to this species
of scientific annoyance, the British Association has appointed a
Committee, and placed funds at their disposal, for a new arrange
ment and classification of the stars; preserving as much as possible
the old constellations, and Flamsteed's system of numerical order;
but correcting gross errors in such arrangement, and confining
the adopted constellations to known and definite limits.           The
present time appears peculiarly favourable for such an undertaking,
when so many catalogues are about to be formed into one uniform
system.     Those only, who have had much experience in such mat
ters, can fairly estimate the convenience and advantage to be gained
by such a reform.     It is to be hoped that one of the leading mem

bers of the Committee will favour this Society with his views and
proposals on this subject, in order that it may have the opportunity
and benefit of a free discussion, prior to the adoption of so important
an alteration.
   “From amongst the several distinguished names that were pro
posed for the Medal this year, the Council have selected that of
M. Plana, for his elaborate treatise entitled “Theorie du Mouvement
de la Lune: ' and they trust that this award will meet the approba
tion of the meeting. The medal will be delivered in the usual man
ner at the close of the meeting ; and the President will, in his ad
dress, explain the grounds on which the Council have formed their
decision.”
The President (Sir         J.
                        F. W. Herschel, Bart.) afterwards addressed
 the Meeting on the subject of the award of the Medal, as follows:–
    Gentlemen,       The Report of the Council to which we have just
listened (with the painful exception of the losses the Society has
sustained in the persons of those respected and lamented members
who have been so ably commemorated in that Report) is one calcu
lated to afford most lively satisfaction; and it is so full and complete
on every point as to have left me nothing to say, except on that one
subject on which, by ancient usage, it has been considered right for
the Chairman of this meeting to add a few words of explanation—I
mean the award of the Medal for the year.
    The award of our medal for this year, gentlemen, to Signor Plana
is an act, as it may at first sight appear, of somewhat tardy justice.
Those great works on the lunar theory (for which that award is
made), and on the perturbations of the planets, especially of Jupiter
and Saturn, have now been so long before the public, that it may

Professor Hansen's general researches in physical astronomy, the
other on Professor Bessel's and Mr. Henderson's observations on the
parallax of those remarkable double stars, 61 Cygni and a Centauri
—observations        which it would appear, beyond question, have
brought us to the very threshold of that long-sought portal which is
to open to us a measurable pathway into regions where the wings
of fancy have hitherto been overborne by the weight or baffled by the
vagueness of the illimitable and the infinite.
   M. Hansen's researches on the lunar and planetary theories are
every way most remarkable, and seem likely to lead to results of the
utmost generality and importance.               He has attacked the great
problem of three bodies (extended, in the conception and application
of his methods, to the mutual perturbations of four) by a method
entirely novel in its idea, although based on and starting from La
grange's idea of the variation of the elements.             Of this method, it
would not be easy, in words unaided by symbolic expression, to give
any distinct account; but its principle may be stated in general
terms, as assuming not the elliptic elements, but the elliptic time, to
be subject to perturbation; or, in other words, as considering the
perturbed co-ordinates, each to arise from the combination of inva
riable elements with a varied or perturbed time, the amount of whose
variation shall exactly account for                             all
                                               that the variation          the ele                of

he will not long leave them so.
    On the other subject to which I alluded—the parallax of the
fixed stars—it would be doing an injustice to the valuable report of
Mr. Main, which, as a beautiful specimen of astronomical history,
I hope to see ere long adorning our Transactions, if I were to avail
myself more largely of it on this occasion than is absolutely neces
sary. It has long been understood by astronomers, that the research
of parallax ought not to be confined to the largest stars, but that,
in order to determine our choice of stars for this research, other
primd facie grounds for suspecting a proximity to our system ought
to be taken into consideration; such as great proper motion, or, in
the case of a double star, great apparent dimensions of the orbits
described about each other.             In the case of the double star 61
Cygni, both these indications combine to point it out as deserving
inquiry. In that of a Centauri they also conspire; for it is well
known that this fine double star has a considerable proper motion ;
and my own observations prove, that the mutual orbit described by
 its individuals about each other,                 unusually large angular
                                                                  is   of                                          di

 tenour, and leading to almost exactly the same numerical value of
the parallax, and not yet communicated to the public. Under these
circumstances, it became the duty of your Council to suspend their
decision.    But, should the evidence finally placed before them at a
future opportunity justify their coming to such a conclusion, it
must not be doubted that they will seize with gladness the occasion
to crown, with such laurels as they have it in their power to extend,
the greatest triumph of modern practical astronomy.
   M. Plana is well known to the astronomical world as the director
of the Observatory at Turin, from which have emanated some valua
ble series of observations.    In conjunction with M. Carlini, he also
carried on that extensive and important triangulation of the Savoy
Alps, which have made his name celebrated as a geodesist.             His
works, too, on many other subjects, both astronomical and purely
analytical, are of great importance; particularly his investigations
on the subject of refraction prefixed to the ‘Turin Observations,’
from 1822 to 1825, published in 1828; those on the motion of a
pendulum in a resisting medium, &c.        But it is of his researches on
the lunar theory for which our medal has been actually awarded;
 and of these it behoves me now to speak; and I cannot do so in
 more clear, concise, and discriminating terms, than those used by
 Mr. Airy in his Report already alluded to :—
    “The method pursued by Piana, in his “Theorie de la Lune,” is
 slightly, but not importantly, different (I mean in the fundamental
 equations) from those of his predecessors, Clairaut, Laplace, and
 Damoiseau.      He first starts with the method of variation of ele
ments, and pursues it to such an extent as to ascertain generally
the form of the expressions connecting the longitude, the latitude,
and the time.        He then reverts to Clairaut's equations; and, as
these equations require for the successive substitutions an approxi
mate expression for time in terms of longitude, he adopts a peculiar
form (suggested by the variation of elements) for the principal part
of   it,and attaches       that principal part
                                 to               subordinate part marked

tween the author's results and those of Laplace is investigated with
the same clearness which prevails through the other operations.
    “In one respect, the plan of investigation differs much from
those of his predecessors, as well as from Hansen's.      The investi
gation is wholly symbolical : no numerical value is introduced, and
no consideration of relation of values entertained, till the final sub
stitutions are made.     As an example of theory, there can be no
doubt of the beauty of this process.    As a subject for practical ac
curacy, it may not be so certain whether it is advisable.     The con
vergence of the series is sometimes extremely slow. As far as I can
observe, the accuracy of this method is exactly and properly that of
successive substitution: but, in various parts of the lunar theory
(in     all
        places where the terms rise two orders        integration), the                 by
                                      not sufficient;     fact,     ne

                                            in
this method,  however,  the author has pushed         far as, probably,                 as
itwill ever be carried. The whole       worked      the fifth order, and
                                                                is              to it
some parts            to

   “Finally, the author has determined from observations the prin
cipal constants which require          substituted         be

                                                     these two authors,          of

   It cannot but be agreeable to this meeting to know that our
award is duly appreciated by M. Plana himself, and regarded by him
in the light which it is ever most desirable it should be, as a
stimulus to fresh researches and further exertions of his powerful
talents in the same line where they have already reaped so rich a
harvest.   No sooner had the Council decided on their award, than,
as in private regard no less than in public duty bound, I communi
cated to him the result; and his reply, which breathes the warmest
spirit of attachment to the Astronomical Society, and of undimi
nished zeal in his own peculiar line of research, is now before me.
In the absence of any personal friend to receive it for him, I shall
now, therefore, present our medal to Mr. Rothman (in the absence
of our Foreign Secretary, Captain Smyth), in his name, and request
him to forward it to him, with our best wishes for his health and
happiness.

ANALYSIS       CHYLE AND LYMPH. BY G. O. REES, M.D., F.G.S.,
                OF
                                 ETC.”
        following analyses of chyle and lymph have lately been made
THE  by Dr. Rees, with the view of ascertaining what those ingredi
ents of chyle are which disappear from the lymph, and which are
consequently of most service for the nourishment of the body. The
fluids were both obtained from the same animal immediately after
death. The subject of experiment was a young ass, which was killed
by a blow on the head about seven hours after taking a full meal of
oats and beans. The chyle was taken from the lacteal vessels before
entering the thoracic duct, and was therefore free from lymph ; the
lymph was from the absorbents of the lower extremity.          Analysis
yielded the following results:—                     Chyle.  Lymph.

throws out the suggestion, whether this peculiarity in the locus of
iron may not in  some way relate to the absence of the red colouring
matter of the blood. The colour of chyle has been generally sup
posed attributable to the fatty matter contained in it; Dr. Rees,
however, is of opinion that the white matter mentioned above as
analogous to that existing in the saliva, has a considerable share in
the production of the opake milky character of the chyle.
NEw MINERAL FROM LANGBANSHYTTA, NEAR FAHLUN;                                             DE
  SCRIBED AND ANALYSED BY PROFEssoR o. B. Küh N                                           of
  LEIPZIG.
  This mineral lies immediately on a grayish-black mass, of a me
tallic lustre, which contains oxide of iron, but no trace of arsenic;
and this mass itself lies on fine-grained bitter-spar.
   The colour of the mineral is in some places like pale honey, in
others dirty white; but there are no definite limits between two dif
ferently-coloured parts. It is of a waxen lustre. Its specific gravity,
determined in water, is 2.52; its hardness between 5 and 6; it is
brittle and easily pulverized; only in one direction could I perceive
foliated cleavage; in that one the fragments are tolerably even, but
in all other directions it splits unevenly.
   Heated by itself with the blow-pipe it becomes gray, but does not
melt even at the edges; heated in a glass tube it does not yield the
smallest quantity of water; with borax and phosphoric salt it effer
vesces, and a smell resembling that of arsenic is evolved; both glasses
are, when melted on platina, transparent, and in every respect nearly
colourless; with soda there is, in like manner, effervescence; and
indications of manganese are more or less strongly marked in differ
ent specimens.
    In nitric acid it is perfectly soluble, with greater or less efferves
cence, in different specimens, though it is in        but trifling
                                                                 all    the      :   in
fluid we can detect     lime, magnesia,  some  manganese,   besides trace          a
of iron and much arsenic acid also          :trace of chlorine.
                                                         a         Fluorine

deficient of the rays of greatest refrangibility, or rather from the
 singular crimson character of the portion occupied by the red ray,
it appeared as if the spectrum was doubled on itself, and the violet
mingled with the less refracted rays. The very remarkable appear
ance and situation of the bow necessarily attracted the attention of
many persons, and some who saw it from Falmouth harbour, de
scribed it to me as being nearly in a line with the sun.
    It is necessary to notice, that no rain was falling : the day was
unusually fine for the season; and the temperature, which had
during the day been above the freezing point, was then certainly
below        it.
              Over the hill                           on

slowly spreading the lightest possible veil        vapour,     thin that                   of                  so
a  casual observer would have stated that the      rays were painted on
the most transparent air.         has been suggested, that the phaeno

 of  the clouds behind the orb itself, and      certainly appears      me             it                                  to
highly probable that such was the case; and from            similarity                                its
some           of
             the phaenomena      have observed      my experiments

     For elliptically polarized light, on the hypothesis of sym
 metrical distribution, we can follow out results analogous to
 those above obtained.   We should have instead of the form
 (21.),
                                 n°h    =       m >   [p 2 sin” 6];                                (57.)
 and instead        of    (25.),
                                 n°h =          m >    [p] 2 sin” 6],                              (58.)
which is identical with the former, whence we have p                                              = p';
also,

The formula (27.)             is      thus reduced          to

   Had the question been one of private, rather than of public
interest, I should certainly have followed the course pursued
by others, who have been honoured with Mr. Sturgeon's cen
sure, and have shown by my silence how little          I

being still carrying out in several of H.M. ships,         I
                                                         feel my
self called on to afford a clear elucidation of certain circum
stances intimately associated with this highly important ques
tion, which have been lately much misrepresented; moreover,
the subject is one of increasing interest, and intimately con
nected with an important department of physical science.
    In the year 1780, the French began to turn their attention
to the more effectual defence of their buildings and shipping
from the effects of lightning.
    Mons. Le Roi was sent to visit Brest and the various sea
ports of France for that purpose. His memoir in the Histoire
 de l'Académie des Sciences for the year 1790, will be read
 with advantage by every one interested in the subject.
    Impressed with the necessity of adopting some more per
 manent security than was derived from the use of chains,
 temporarily applied in the rigging, he endeavoured to place,
 he says, such conductors in ships as might be deemed
“fixed and durable.”           With this view long linked rods of
small dimensions were led from a point at the mast-head
along a part of the rigging, and fixed to plates of metal at
the ship's side communicating with the sea. These, however,
he admits did not stand the working of the rigging, and were
broken in a storm; so that he was induced to change them for
similar linked rods of small size led in divided stages along
the masts.
   This form of conductor   was fixed in the French ships of
war   Etoile, Resolution, Experiment,     Boussole, Astrolabe,
and in some ships destined for America. Although Mons.
Le Roi had reason to believe that it was sufficiently secure
from the effects of mechanical violence, yet it was eventually
abandoned in the French service, probably from         still be

174                  Mr. Snow Harris                     on    Lightning Conductors,
of conductor ever generally used by the English, consists of
links of small copper rods under the form of a flexible chain
triced up, as occasion required, to the mast-head and                                                               al
lowed to touch the sea, a contrivance recommended by the
learned Dr. Watson in the year 1762, in a letter to Lord
Anson, then First Lord of the Admiralty.
   The damage, however, which, notwithstanding every sug
gestion of the kind, continued to occur to shipping from at
mospheric electricity, and especially to our navy, showed that
such methods had not fully met                                   all

fence, differing essentially from those hitherto tried.      Now
that system which experience indicated evidently embraced
the following principles.
      The conductor should
      1.                         permanently fixed,       be                                       so     as   to   be

the   damage   done to the Rodney, copied from the newspapers
of the day, of a few extracts from the statements made by
naval officers who had witnessed the protecting effects of my
conductors, and of a few desultory remarks on those state
ments; here then are thirteen pages to begin with, containing
no kind of scientific research whatever. The next three pages
and a half contain a few ill-contrived repetitions of Priestley
and Cavallo's experiments, made above fifty years since, on
the residual electricity of a Leyden jar, and which Mr. Stur
geon, by a most unhappy blunder, has taken as a lateral dis
charge produced at the instant of the primary discharge *.
“This residual electricity (observes Cavallo) should be care
fully considered in performing delicate experiments +”.
  The remaining 15 pages contain merely ill-digested remarks,
resting on the above fallacy; designing appeals to the fears of the
uninformed; an account of a few common-place and inevitable
results of ordinary electrical action on a kite; and a proposal
to place copper rods in various ways about the rigging of a
ship as a defence against lightning, in open defiance of his own
previous admissions; with a few considerations of the expense
attendant on it.
   How such a paper as this can fairly come under the deno
mination of “Theoretical and Experimental Researches in
Electricity,” when not above two out of thirty-two pages, or
about one sixteenth of the whole, contain any experiment at
all,—the experiments not original, and the reasoning upon
them a fallacy,            I
                        am really at a loss to determine.
   In my former communications, which appeared in this
Journal in December, 1839, and February and May, 1840,
I have given a complete exposition of these and other points
contained in this memoir; so that but little more remains to
notice than the deceptive colouring in which Mr. Sturgeon
has thought         fit disguise my experiments, and his illiberal
                          to
dealing with every one holding opinions adverse               him                 to

 178               Mr.       Snow   Harris   on   Lightning Conductors,
 I   was called upon, for instance, to show what had been the
  general laws of the action of lightning on ship-board; that the
  connexion of my conductors with the sea through the metallic
  masses in the hull was in no way detrimental to their action,
  or liable to objection; that, in short, electrical discharges might
  find their way and become as safely dispersed in the sea by
  the metallic bolts driven through the keel and keelson, and
  other parts of the vessel, as by a chain in the rigging.
     I  was further called upon to show, so far as possible, how
  a  system,  such as I proposed, would operate in this way under
  various positions of the masts, and that the circumstance
  of their motion upon each other would in no way interfere
  with the action of the conductor.          In order to meet the views
  of the officers of the Board, I naturally enough resorted to
  such practical illustrations as were within my reach.            By way
  of showing the operation of my conductors            through   the bolts
  in the hull, strong charges from twenty-five square feet of
  coated glass were passed over a vessel's mast fitted with the
  conductors and floating in the sea, the negative side of the
  battery being connected with an interrupted circuit passing
  over a small gun placed in a boat (in some instances) forty
  fathoms from the vessel.            Percussion powder was placed
 over the joints of the conductor on the mast, and in an                        in
 terrupted circuit at the mast head. The sliding masts were
 placed in various positions, and occasionally were put
 in motion at the time of the experiment; but in                         all
                                                                     cases
at    the instant        of
                        completing     the  circuit, the whole    charge,
 equivalent        to
                  fuse fifteen feet          of
                                         small iron wire, passed freely
 through the conductor and the sea                 in    all
                                                  positions         of
                                                               the masts
 without   igniting   the  powder    placed  over the  joints, but firing

candid   erplanation   of my experiments before the Navy Board
at Plymouth.
   As he gives every one who in any way treated this question
with fairness, a most liberal credit for ignorance, he thinks I.
ought to have explained to the Board that a wire could be
made red-hot by electricity, and if then brought into contact
with gunpowder would ignite it ; together with some other
truisms of a similar form.       Now, however ignorant Mr. Stur
geon may suppose the officers of the Board to have been,
they certainly understood the question much better than he
appears to do; they entered very completely into                   merits,                      its

only, &c. &c., and “at a distance of fifty feet from the di
rect discharge;” and in sect. 200, he admits that a discharge
from such a jar would “imitate a flash of lightning striking
a similar conductor on the mast.”
  Here then is an experiment which at once brings to the
bar Mr. Sturgeon's own position; and I appeal to any one, if
 what he has thus advanced has any foundation, whether “an
 electrical accumulation not merely from a jar of a quart ca
 pacity, but from twenty-five square feet of coated glass highly
 charged, and equivalent to destroy fifteen or twenty feet of
 small iron wire, should not have ignited the powder and
 caused the mast to be blown in pieces. Yet such was not
 the case, and never can be so long as the continuous con
 ductor remains on its surface. When the exterior conductor,
 however, was removed and a similar charge thrown on the
 model, then the mast was blown in pieces, proving, that if the
 discharge had under any form pervaded the interior, this
 effect would have resulted in the first case,
    Now Mr. Sturgeon roundly asserts, that “this experiment
happens to have no bearing on the subject whatever,” not
withstanding that in sect. 200 he actually refers to the passing
of electricity over-conductors placed in given directions, and
 says, “ that the discharge of a jar of only a quart capacity
 would imitate a flash of lightning striking a similar conductor
 on the mast:” this is very one-sided reasoning indeed.
    In a subsequent communication he inquires if                mean to          “I
be considered as a philosopher or necromancer by endeavour
ing to persuade the British Association that blowing asunder
two pieces of wood by gunpowder was a true representation
of the effects of lightning on a ship's mast.”

of settling the question by extending the levels as above stated,
I need not say more, but leave the question to be decided, as
I hope it soon will be, by such extension of the levels.
     I
     do not mean to dispute Mr. Whewell's theory as to the
mean levels of the tides, supposing there were no obstructions
to their free action; but I do conceive that it is very possible
that circumstances may operate to prevent the mean level of
the tides from being at the same elevation at every part of the
COast.
     My object is to prevent any general conclusion with respect
to tide-levels from being acted on until the fact be placed be
yond doubt; and whatever may be the result of the inquiry,
the levels which may be determined will be available for esta
blishing the elevations of certain fixed points or bench-marks,
which will always be much more useful for reference than any
determination depending on the tides.

     XXXV.               of the Oils of Elemi and Olibanum.

           of the resins contain, as is well known, volatile oils,
MOST  to which they owe their peculiar odours. A considerable
number of these oils have been carefully examined, but there
are several, and among the rest those of elemi and olibanum,
which, as far as I am aware, have not previously been sub
jected to analysis.
     Iwas induced therefore to prepare a quantity of each of
them for this purpose.

    In order to determine the atomic weight of the acid the aether
 was prepared in the usual way, by                      a portion of stearic
 acid in alcohol and saturating it with muriatic acid gas.
    The aether is a semi-transparent crystalline body, very like
 stearin.      It was repeatedly washed with hot water to free it
from muriatic acid.          It was then carefully dried and sub

    When cacao butter is distilled it              yields  no   appreciable
quantity of sebacic acid, but when the uncrystallizable acid
 which remains in the alcohol out of which the stearic acid
 has crystallized is subjected to distillation, traces of sebacic
acid are readily obtained.          This indicates that the quantity
of oleic acid contained in cacao butter is by no means very
considerable.
    I   have every reason to believe that besides the stearic and
oleic acids, cacao butter contains a third acid, which has a
melting point of about 140°Fahr., and which may probably
be the margaric.” Its nature, however, must be the subject
of sqme future investigation.

         HEN in the summer of 1835 undertook the researches     I
       which form the subject of the preceding memoir 4th?
upon the theory of electromotors,                               I
                                          intended to treat of only
two of the experiments adduced by Professor Faraday in sup
port of the theory of M. de la Rive; namely, of the electric
currents obtained by the immersion of platina and zinc in sul
phuric acid, not placed in contact with each other in those
parts not immersed in the liquid; and of the spark obtained
by bringing the copper wire attached to a large copper plate
immersed in acid, in contact with the zinc wire attached to a
zinc plate immersed in the same liquid. The third fact brought
forward by Professor Faraday is the positive electrization of
copper, when, joined with iron, it is immersed in a solution of
sulphuret of potassa.                 I
                           did not wish to speak of this as being
at      all
       analogous     the other facts already adduced
                               to                             M.                               by        de

                                I      shown       no  way favoured        in
the new theory.      But having seen that Dr. Fusinieri laid
great stress upon this same fact,        began      examine    I and        to                  it,
with the assistance      clear and  of
                                     easy   experiments,     think                         I             I
have shown that this also was not more favourable than the
others     the theory

194       Prof. Marianini's Earamination of an Experiment
ance to this experiment, declaring it of itself demonstrative.
And as after such a judgement it may be believed by some
that I am of the same opinion, and that for this reason I have
                            j.
been silent on the subject, I think it incumbent on me to dis
cuss it in this article, which may therefore be considered as a
continuation of the foregoing memoir 4th.
   The experiment now            consideration is that in which,
by agitating with a feather the liquid in which are immersed
the zinc and the copper of a voltaic pair, the electric current
is strengthened.      And to explain such increase of strength,
Professor Faraday observes that the neutralized acid stratum
adhering to the zinc is removed, the acid stratum in contact
with it is renewed, and thence the chemical action acquires
new force.
   By stirring with a feather the liquid in which the voltaic
pair is immersed, the neutralized acid stratum adhering to the
zinc is removed when the electromotor has been a short time
in action; but when the electric current operates for some
time, half an hour, for example, the greater part of the neu
tralized acid stratum remains still adhering to the zinc, not
withstanding the agitation of the liquid. I will suppose, then,
that an experiment is here treated of in which the circuit is
completed only for a few minutes, in which case, by this agi
tation, the neutralized acid stratum covering the zinc is in
great part removed.
    By means of the above-mentioned operation, if it is per
formed when the electric circuit is interrupted, the current is
considerably strengthened when the circuit is again completed;
but whenever the circuit is completed many times, and espe
cially when the liquid is water, acidulated or strongly saline,
the liquid may be agitated with a feather as much as may be
desired, since the electric current does not acquire more
strength, as is shown by the constantly decreasing deviation
of the galvanometer.          And this is very natural, since if on
the one hand, the agitation of the liquid removes some of the
neutralized acid stratum from the surface of the zinc, the elec
tric current causes it to adhere again, and probably in greater
quantity than the agitation of the liquid subtracts. It is other
                     of stirring the liquid with     feather, the sur
      of if,
wise,     instead                                a
face     the zinc     lightly
                     is         scraped  with the  angle     ofplate
                                                                  a   of
glass; since,   in that case, detaching from the metal more neu
tralized acid than that which the current causes             to
                                                             adhere   to
it   inthe same   time,  the electric current  is   in  degree

 strengthened. But here      it
                             is     said that the current    strength

ductibility of the apparatus, an increase observed and noted
by M. de la Rive, and by myself many years ago *, the ex
planation of the phaenomenon will become easy and natural;
and whoever wishes to see this verified has only to repeat the
experiment, which       I now proceed to describe.
    Having plunged a voltaic pair into two cups of acidulated
water, as in the experiment of the preceding paragraph, I put
the liquid of the cup in which the copper was plunged in
communication with a third cup, containing some of the same
liquid, by means of an arc formed by a plate of copper; and
in this cup was plunged another plate of copper, which formed
one of the extremities of the galvanometric wire; whilst the
other was dipped, by means of a plate of copper, into the cup
containing the zinc plate of the pair. All being thus arranged,
I  closed the circuit, and the needle deviated nearly to the
fortieth degree, and then stopped at the eighth; and after a
minute,    I interrupted the circuit and held it open for half a
 |.
minute; after which time the needle was stationary at zero,
and having completed the circuit again the needle deviated
          to thirty degrees, and then stopped again at the eighth
  egree. Hitherto the liquid was not agitated; but a minute
after the needle became stationary, I opened the circuit, I
stirred the liquid in the third additional cup, that namely, in
which was plunged one end of the arc of copper joined to the
pair, and one plate of copper attached to one end of the wire
of the galvanometer, and after half a minute, the circuit being
completed, the needle deviated to the thirty-fifth degree, and
stopped afterwards upon the ninth.
    If instead of stirring the liquid the plates immersed in it
are slightly touched with a feather, the increase of strength is
observed without interrupting the circuit. In one of the ex
periments made in this manner, the needle was stationary at
the sixth degree, and after brushing the plate of copper an
nexed to one end of the galvanometric wire and immersed in
the third cup, the needle moved to nine degrees, whence it
turned quickly to six. The same thing happened upon brush
ing gently the plate which served as an arc in the part im
mersed in the cup containing the zinc plate of the pair.
    Now in such experiments those plates of copper served only
to convey the electricity put in motion by the voltaic pair;
then the agitation of the liquid or that light friction upon the
plates of copper, strengthens the current in proportion as the
power of conducting or transmitting the electricity is strength
ened in the apparatus.

200            Prof. Marianini's Eramination of an Experiment
    VIII. We may conclude         from what has been said, that the
fourth experiment of Professor Faraday, which, according to
Signor Fusinieri, is itself demonstrative of the truth of M. de la
Rive's theory, is at least inconclusive.
    And here it may be asked, whence then comes that altera
tion in the conductibility of the apparatus? And M. de la
Rive will reply that the agitation of the liquid or the cleansing
of the plates increases the transmissibility for the electricity
of the same; and I shall add that the alteration in the relative
electromotive faculty, or, which is the same thing, in the elec
 trotism of the plates, also concurs in this. By the current,
indeed, the electrotism of those plates in which the electricity
 enters, becomes positive, and those from which it proceeds to
 pass into the liquid negative, and that alteration proceeds
 from the matter which the current collects upon the plates
 themselves. Now by the agitation of the liquid, and brushing
 the plates gently with a feather,                  part    all   or

     MM.   Dumas and Stas have published a second treatise
 on chemical types".          The principal subject of this treatise
 is the action of potassa on the various kinds of alcohol,
 both those which are evidently similar to the wine alco
 hol, and also on those substances which have been consi
dered as analogous to alcohol, as for instance, glycerin, &c.
 In many cases it is possible to convert an alcohol into                                                its
 equivalent acid; but yet chemists have not been able                 con                        to
 vert     an
          acid into             of its
                            corresponding alcohol.        The discovery

   After continued rain, a heap of coals which lay exposed to
the weather was observed to smoke, and to be on fire in the
interior; when separated it was found in the middle to be in
full combustion.   In the neighbourhood of this part the coals
were half-roasted, forming an almost compact mass, and be
tween them was    found a bright yellow, soft, saltlike substance.
This proved on examination to be sulphate of magnesia; the
ashes of coals contain magnesia, the burning pyrites afforded

former receives much support from the phaenomena presented by
the fossil trees found near Manchester, and that it affords in return
great assistance in explaining the peculiarities of their position.
Mr. Bowman does not deny that plants may have been carried into
the water from neighbouring lands, as in the instances of fern-fronds
and other remains scattered through the sandstones and shales; but
he conceives it is difficult to understand whence the vast masses of
vegetables necessary to form thick seams of coal could have been
derived, if drifted'; and how they could have been sunk to the bot
tom, without being intermixed with the earthy sediment which was
slowly deposited upon them. He is of opinion also, that without a
superincumbent layer of mud or sand, to retain the hydrogen during
the process of bituminization, ordinary caking coal could not have
been formed.       Another difficulty, connected with the drift theory,
Mr. Bowman       says, is the uniformity of the distribution of the vege
table  matter,  throughout    such great areas as those occupied by the
seams of   coal,  extending   in the instance of the lower main seam of
the great northern coal field, over at least 200 square miles; and in
that of a thin seam below the gannister, or rabbit coal, in a linear
direction of thirty-five miles from Whaley Bridge to Blackburn.
On the contrary, he believes, that it is much more rational to sup
pose, that the coal has been formed from plants, which grew on the
areas now occupied by the seams, that each successive race of
vegetation was gradually submerged beneath the level of the water,
and covered up by sediment, which accumulated till it formed an
other dry surface for the growth of another series of trees and plants,
and that these submergences and accumulations took place as many
times as there are seams of coal. He also explains the thinning
out of the seams and other strata of the coal measures, by irregu
larities in the mode or extent of the depressions.
    Mr. Bowman then proceeds to the examination of the phaenomena
presented by the fossil trees discovered on the line of the Manchester
and Bolton railway, and described by Mr. Hawkshaw in his paper
read on the 5th of June, 1839, (see L. & E. Phil. Mag. vol. xv. p. 539.)
and in the preceding communication (see vol. xvii. p. 541.): it will
be necessary to notice therefore only those points which did not
 claim that gentleman's more particular attention.         Mr. Hawkshaw
 describes generally the markings on the internal casts of the trees;
 but as it is difficult to convey a correct notion of their waved and
 anastomosing characters either verbally or by reduced drawings, Mr.
 Bowman applied paper to the surface of the stems and carefully
 traced the grooves or furrows by following them exactly with an        in
 strument.    The only indications of scars, which he could find after a
 long and close search, were at one point near the base of the largest
 tree, and though indistinct, his practised eye recognized them to be
 those of a Sigillaria.     He detected also in some parts, on the ribs
 of the same   tree, the fine wavy lines so often visible on decorticated
 specimens of that family.       In describing the second tree, he alludes
 to a deep wedge-shaped rift on the south-east side, which had been
 coated with coal, and is strongly marked with wavy lines, like those

214          Geological   Society:—Mr. Bowman           on the
on the surface of the alburnum of a gnarled oak.        On the fifth tree,
he discovered a     longitudinal  concavity   on the north side, and he
 states that it resembles the   impression  which would be left in a   di
 cotyledonous tree, by the pressure of a parasitic plant.     The charac
 ters of the roots are also detailed at considerable length, particularly
 their mode of bifurcation, and position with respect to the horizon.
    From a careful consideration of the phaenomena presented by the
 fossils, Mr. Bowman is convinced that they stand where they origin
 ally flourished; that they were not succulent, but dicotyledonous,
 hard-wooded forest trees; and that their gigantic roots were mani
 festly adapted for taking firm hold of the soil, and in conjunction
 with the swollen base of the trunks to support a solid tree of large
 dimensions with a spreading top.
    Towards the close of 1838, in forming the railway tunnel at Clay
 cross, five miles south of Chesterfield, a number of fossil trees were
 found, standing at right angles to the plane of the strata. The tunnel
 passes through the middle portion of the Derbyshire coal measures,
 which there dip about 8° to a little north of east. The bases of the
 trees rested upon a seam of coal fifteen inches thick.      The exterior
 of the stems consisted of a thin film of bright coal, furrowed and
 marked like the Sigillaria reniformis; and the interior consisted of a
 fine-grained sandstone.      Mr. Conway, who supplied Mr. Bowman
 with an account of the    discovery, infers, from the information which
 he   obtained, that there must have been at least forty trees found,
 and   judging  by the area excavated, he is of opinion that they could
 not have stood more than three or four feet apart. There were no
 traces of roots, the stems disappearing at the point of contact with
 the coal.    Several specimens of Stigmaria ficoides were also noticed
 by Mr. Conway, lying horizontally, and about three feet in length.
    With reference to fossil trees in general, and especially to those
 near Manchester, Mr. Bowman proceeds to show still further; 1st,
 that they were solid, hard-wooded, timber trees, in opposition to the
 common opinion that they were soft or hollow ; 2nd, that they ori
 ginally grew and died where they have been found, and consequently
 were not drifted from distant lands; and, 3rd, that they became hol
low, by the decay of their wood, from natural causes, similar to those
 still in operation in tropical climates, and were afterwards filled with
 inorganic matter, precipitated from water.
    1. In stating his reasons for believing that the coal measures' casts
 were solid timber trees, Mr. Bowman alludes to the rifting of the
bark of modern forest trees, in consequence of the expansion caused
by the annual addition of a layer of wood between the bark and the
alburnum; and to the thickening or swelling of the base of the trunk
 and main roots, and the apparent lifting up of the latter out of the
soil, in old trees, by the greater annual increase of the upper part or
that nearest to light and heat. These phaenomena in vegetation were
illustrated by a diagram, which exhibited the form of the base of the
stem and the root of a sapling, and of a full-grown tree. The author,
in applying these characters to the fossils of the Manchester and
Bolton railway, alludes to the irregular, longitudinal and disconti

   Manchester     Fossil Trees, and on the Formation         of Coal.   215
nuous or anastomosing      furrows on their surface, to the swelling out at
the base of their     stems, and to the divergence as well as the angle
of   dip or downward direction of their roots.       These characters, he
says, are not observable in soft monocotyledonous trees, their stems
never expanding laterally, and being as thick when only a few years
 old and a foot high, as when they attain the height of 60 or 100 feet.
Their roots also, instead of being massive and forking, generally pre
 sent a dense assemblage of straight succulent fibres, like those of an
 onion or hyacinth.      Analogy, therefore, as far as outward shape and
 habit are concerned, he adds, is strongly in favour of the fossils
 having been solid timber trees.
     Mr. Bowman then combats the view, generally entertained, that
 fossil stems with perpendicular furrows, as in the Sigillaria, were
 succulent or hollow plants”. He states, that good specimens of de
 corticated Sigillariae exhibit fine straight, and curled or gnarled striae,
 similar to those on the alburnum of many modern forest trees; and
 that this character, in conjunction with others, renders it almost cer
 tain, that the fossils had a separate bark,+a feature which is consi
 dered in vegetable physiology to be a proof of a woody structure.
 He also alludes to the existence in many of the decorticated parts of
 these fossil trees of little prominences like those in barked timber;
 likewise to the scars left by the disarticulation of leaves; and he ac
 counts for the general absence of the latter on large and old trunks, by
 their having been obliterated, in consequence of irregular expansion
 from the deposition of new layers of wood: he notices moreover the
 absence in small Sigillariae of the irregular furrows observed on large
 specimens, and due in his opinion to the unequal expansion by the
 addition of new layers of wood.        In support of these proofs of the
 original solid nature of the trees, Mr. Bowman exhibited polished
 slices mounted upon glass of portions of a similar fossil tree dis
 covered in sinking a shaft 300 or 400 yards N.W. of those found on
 the line of the railway. The slices were made from a portion which ex
 hibited within the carbonized bark, a patch browner, heavier, and more
 compact than the rest.       In these slices, made under Mr. R. Brown’s
 direction, that gentleman discovered in the transverse section, the
 uniformity of vascularity which is evidence of coniferous structure;
 and in the longitudinal section parallel to the medullary rays, the ex
istence of these rays.       The slices therefore exhibit proofs of dico
tyledonous structure, and considerable probability of that structure
being coniferous.       The important evidence however of coniferous
structure deducible from discs in sections parallel to the rays, was not
obtained,     the vessels having apparently undergone some altera
tion.
    2.  With respect to the second point, that the trees grew and died
    * Specimens of recent dicotyledonous wood from New Zealand, Ient to
the author by
                 Mr. R. Brown, were exhibited on the table of the Meeting
Room.     They displayed both upon the bark and the naked wood, longitu
dinal ribs and intermediate furrows as regular as those on Sigillariae;  and
therefore prove that these characters are not incompatible with a dicotyle
donous structure.

on the spots where they are now found, and that they were not drifted
from distant lands, Mr. Bowman says, the arguments in favour of
the formation of beds of coal by a series of subsidences of the sur
face on which the vegetables that produced the coal grew, naturally
lead to the inference that the trees associated with the coal also
flourished on the same spots. In opposition to the opinion that trees
would naturally float in an upright position in consequence of the
greater specific gravity of the base and roots, he asserts, that the

 he conceives the fossil trees were        gradually    submerged—their        upper
branches torn off—their interior removed                by  natural  decay,+their
bark converted into coal,—their central cavities filled with sediment;
and the whole buried beneath the stratum of shale or sandstone                                                               in

mulation of the vegetable matter; and, 2ndly, what thickness of
vegetable matter was necessary to form the stratum of coal nine
inches thick, over which the trees stand.    Mr. Schomburgk is of
opinion that a dicotyledonous tree which would require in temperate
climates one hundred years to attain a certain diameter, would arrive
at the same dimensions within the tropics in sixty or eighty years.
The largest of the fossil trees forming the immediate subject of the
paper is equal in circumference to an oak of 130 years growth in
this climate, or about 100 for a climate equal in temperature to that
of the tropics. Allowing therefore that some time elapsed after the
commencement of vegetation on the surface of the then dry land
before the trees began to grow, Mr. Bowman infers, that 100 years
must be the minimum of time which would be required for the
production of the vegetable matter out of which the nine inches of
coal were produced.      With respect to the depth of the stratum of
vegetable matter from which it was formed, Mr. Bowman takes for
his data, the thickness of the bed of coal, nine inches; the distance
between the top of the seam and the bottom of the trunk under the
arch formed by the roots, fifteen inches; and for the distance to the
surface of the ground, four inches, or in         twenty-eight inches;  all
whereby   he infers that the thickness  the solid coal  equal

Cilfay hill and the Town-hill range from Swansea to the Bury river,
there occur many irregular conglomerate beds, formed of innume
rable pebbles and small boulders of coal, sometimes four inches in
diameter, mingled with sand and pebbles of ironstone; and there
have been also found in them small boulders of granite and mica
slate.     Many impressions, coated with coal, of Sigillariae and other
plants, occur in the mass; and the difference of age between this coal
and that of the pebbles, he says, is beautifully illustrated in numerous
cases, where the softer coal of the plants has been pressed down
upon the harder coal of a layer of the pebbles, by the cleavage of
the former, however distorted the plant may be, presenting an uni
form parallelism, while the cleavage of the coal forming the pebbles
is parallel with the sides of the pebbles, which are inclined in all
possible directions.
   The pebbles consist principally of the common bituminous coal of
 the neighbourhood, but two have been found composed of cannel
 coal, the only seams of which, existing in the lower measures, occur
 about 2000 feet below the conglomerate bed.
   The Cilfay sandstones and the measures at Penclawdd, in which
 the first-mentioned pebble was found, form part of the Pennant grit;
 and there is reason to believe, that throughout the whole of this
 great mass of sandstone, about 3000 feet thick, occasional beds of
 coal pebbles are to be met with : but Mr. Logan has not seen any
 associated with the lower measures.

tremity of the peninsula, on the farm of Balscallock, constituting a
dyke of amygdaloid greenstone which cuts through the graywacke
and is lost in the sea; and the other is near Loch Connell, where a
mass   of greenstone extends in a westerly direction for nearly two
miles.   At both localities, the trap intersects the graywacke; but at
neither point could the author find it in contact with the coal or over
lying breccia.
   3. Coal Measures.             A deposit
                                    consisting of beds of red and white
sandstones, clays and micaceous shale, similar to those of the coal
field of Ayr, has been long known to exist in the district, and has
led to several fruitless researches for coal.      The deposit may be
traced for about nine   miles, forming  a narrow band parallel to Loch
Ryan. The beds are in general moderately inclined to the E. or
S.E. In a quarry on the farm of Clachan, Mr. Moore found re
mains of Stigmaria ficoides, and in another, on the farm of Chal
lock, an abundance of Calamites.
   4. Red Breccia.     This rock extends from the bay of Sloughna
garry to the farm of Dumlae, a distance of eight miles, forming a
ridge from 200 to 300 feet high, between the coal measures and the
shore of Loch Ryan. It consists entirely of irregular fragments of
graywacke cemented by a red clayey sand, but in some places it
passes into laminae of red sandstone. The beds are nearly horizon
 tal
 or    dip slightly   the S.E., and rest

Beche, in his memoir on Tor and Babacomb Bays, also states that
the limestones of that district rest on old red sandstone; and in his
Report on Cornwall and Devonshire (1839), he says, “that those
who rely very exclusively on the character of organic remains would
probably feel disposed to consider the Torbay and Plymouth beds as

the beds from which they had been obtained and the mountain lime

                        Age     of the Limestone of South Devon.                                           225
distinct testacea, that he suggested the South Devon limestones
would prove to be of an age intermediate between the carboniferous
and Silurian systems, and consequently of that of the old red sand
stone.    In alluding to Professor Sedgwick and Mr. Murchison's
adoption of the suggestion in 1839, and their bold application of it
to all the older sedimentary rocks of Devon and Cornwall, the au
thor states, that the fullest testimony is borne in the papers, con
taining their present views of the structure of those counties, of the
source whence the suggestion was derived.
   Appended to the notice was a list of fossils, necessarily very                                          in
complete, from the limited nature of the materials at the author's
command.      It consisted of sixty-three species; twelve considered
common to the Carboniferous and Devonian limestones, forty-two
peculiar to the Devonian strata; and nine, seven of which are corals,
common to the Devonian and Silurian formations; doubts were,
however, entertained respecting the identification of the two species
of shells. The author then observes, should it be urged that it
was unjustifiable to assume, from organic remains alone, the age of
the Devonshire limestone, it may be replied, that in a district of
which little in 1837 was positively known, which is cut off by the
granite of Dartmoor from the only base line of the country, the
culm measures of central Devon, proved in 1836 by Prof. Sedgwick
and Mr. Murchison to be the representative of the true coal mea
sures, organic remains were the only test by which the age of strata
so situated could be determined; and in support of his argument,
he advanced the recent establishment in Cutch and the Desert to
                    it,                               fossils brought

seek the aid of the philosophical zoologist, who can teach him to

which it is liable,_the changes which such accidents may produce,
or the means provided by nature to resist them,-and on the effects
which a permanent alteration in the inhabiting medium may work

    Of the importance of organic remains in identifying districts less
widely separated, the two following instances were noticed.         In
M. Dumont's work on the geology of the province of Liège, pub
lished in 1832*, and justly valued for unravelling the structure of a
most intricate country, the strata immediately beneath the mountain
limestone are divided into three systems, but without any definite
comparison with the formations which underlie that deposit in
England. At the meeting of the Geological Society of France, at
Mezières, in September, 1835, Dr. Buckland proposed the following
first comparison between the systems of M. Dumont and the sub
divisions of the Silurian system established by Mr. Murchison                            :-
Système     calcareur supérieur.         Mountain limestone.
                                          . . .   . .
                                            (Old red sandstone wanting.)
Syst. quartzo-schisteur supérieur.. The Ludlow rocks.
Syst. calcareur inférieur. . . . . . . . The Dudley and Plymouth lime
                                      Stone.
Syst. quartzo-schisteur inférieur.. The Caradoc sandstone.
                               (Builth and Llandeilo flags wanting.)
Terrain Ardoisier.
  This comparison was principally founded on the resemblance
of the corals with those obtained at Dudley and Wenlock. M.
 Constant Prevost pointed out the resemblance of the calcaire bleu
{".
of the  système calcareur inferieur of M. Dumont with the Plymouth
limestone, and of the marble of Heer, subordinate to the système
                    supérieur, with the limestones of Babacombe.
  Ir. Greenough, however, doubted the identity            the Plymouth  of
and Dudley limestones, and                   he
                                    stated that                   he
                                                    had remarked the
total absence       the Dudley Trilobites
                     of                                      in
                                                the système calcareur
inférieur.   During   the Mezières   meeting,  Dr. Buckland identified
certain beds beneath the mountain limestone near Namur,                                   Di
nant, and Huy, and         Engis, with the old red sandstonet; and
                                at

        ordinary meeting       the Geological Society

December, 1837, M. Rozet repeated his belief, that the old red
sandstone      well developed between Dinant and Namur; and M.

meeting, determined its existence                       in
                                           those districts.       1838,           In

Silurian region; and on his return to Belgium,         he laid before
the    Royal  Academy of Bruxelles a table, differing from that of
Dr. Buckland only in drawing more closely the terms of com
parison, and in identifying the two upper divisions of the Terrain
Ardoisier with the Cambrian system. He stated also, in a report
which accompanied the table, that the old red sandstone was
most probably wanting in Belgium, or, if it exist, that it must
be considered as a great development of the superior part of the
Upper Ludlow Rock. In M. Dumont's work, before mentioned,
lists are given of the fossils from each system; and on examining
them, for the purpose of determining how far the comparison of the
Belgian and Silurian systems could be established by organic re
mains, the author of this notice ascertained, that out of twenty-two
species, only four could be considered as peculiar to the Silurian
system; and of these he believes two may be erroneous identifica
tions; that five species are common to the Belgian beds and the
mountain limestone, and thirteen to the Belgian and Devonian
systems.     These lists, Mr. Lonsdale states, are small, but, he adds,
they bear internal evidence of having been carefully drawn up with
out any preconceived theory; and he conceives that they afford
sufficient proof that the beds from which they were obtained do
not belong to the Silurian system, but partake of the same inter
mediate character as the Devonian limestones.         The other case,
alluded to in the paper, refers to the older beds of the Bas Boulon
nais.     These strata were identified by M. de Verneuil in 1838,
with the Silurian series of England, particularly a bed of limestone
 containing corals and other fossils with the Wenlock limestone;
and M. Dumont, who examined the country with M. de Verneuil,
states in his report to the Bruxelles Academy, that his four systems
 occur in the Boulonnais.      The above bed of limestone, M. Rozet
 had also, in 1828, placed below the old red sandstone; but in a
 subsequent memoir, published in the Annales des Sciences Naturelles
 (xix. p. 145. 1830), he assigns it to the old red sandstone. At
 the Meeting of the Geological Society of France at Boulogne, in
 Sept. 1839, and at which some of the Fellows of the Geological So
 ciety of London assisted, the identification of the Boulonnais beds
 with the Silurian system was fully admitted. When, however, doubts
 were recently thrown out respecting the age of the formations in the
 Liège districts on account of the nature of their fossils, Mr. Mur
 chison, who was present at the Boulogne Meeting, stated to the
 author of this notice, that if the Liège country had been wrongly
 identified, the older beds of the Boulonnais had been wrongly iden
 tified also. To determine the question, as far as fossils would assist,
 Mr. Murchison procured, by the kind assistance of M. Dutertre
 Yvart, a collection of specimens in the Museum at Boulogne.        An
 examination of these specimens with published lists, proved that the
 inference was just, and that there exists in the Bas Boulonnais, the
 same mixed assemblage of mountain limestone, Silurian and Devo
 nian, or peculiar fossils, as in the province of Liège and in Devon
 shire.

      Mr. Áusten commences by noticing the two theories which have
  been proposed to account for the introduction of the bones of ani
  mals into caves—one, which accounts for their presence on the belief
  that they were dragged in by hyaenas or bears inhabiting the caves;
  the other, which supposes that the bones were drifted in by diluvial
  waters.       He then proceeds to give his own explanation of the phae
  nomena presented by Kent's Cave and Yealmpton Cavern; but he
  says it is not his intention, by doing                  propose      so,

 of    the Hyaena are now better known than formerly, and there                                                         is

and other caves;    and if it should be urged that the most powerful
lion could not    carry off the bodies of the great Pachyderms, Mr.
Austen    says, that an examination of a very large proportion of the
remains taken from Kent's Hole has proved that the bones and teeth
of the Elephant belonged to young animals; and he quotes Dr. Buck
land's statement, that the ten elephants' teeth discovered in Kirkdale
Cave belonged to extremely young animals. (Rel. Dil. p. 18.)
   The conclusions, therefore, which Mr. Austen wishes to draw are,
1st, that the carcases were dragged into the bone caves by powerful
feline animals; and 2ndly, that hyaenas picked and gnawed the bones
after those animals had satisfied their hunger, and while they were
absent. He also objects to the belief that some of the German caves
are filled with the animal matter of countless generations of bears,
as the decomposition of one carcase, he says, would have driven the
living bears from the cave; but he believes the prevailing fossil re
mains in each locality indicate only what animals were most abun
dant in the district, and consequently most frequently fell a prey to
the powerful Felidae: thus in the low grounds about Yealmpton,
Kent's Hole or Kirkdale, herbivora may have been most abundant,
and bears in the region of the Hartz”.
   April 8th.-A paper was first read,                      “On the Great Fault, called
the Horse, in the Forest of Dean Coal                     Field;" by John Buddle, Esq.,
F.G.S.
     The term fault is            used     in this paper in the miner's signification,
or for any interruption in the regular deposition or range of a bed.
The Horse Fault, therefore, is not a displacement of one part of the
stratum by a dislocation, but a local thinning out of a bed of coal,
and a substitution of sandstone for it.
   The Horse has been traced in the Coleford High Delf seam, the
23rd in the descending series, or the 3rd from the bottom, and the
only one in which it is clearly developed, for about two miles; and
its known breadth varies from 170 to 340 yards. The only point
at which it has been tunneled through in a transverse direction, is
under Barn Hill enclosure, between Brixslade and Howler's Slade
                 ofits
valleys, and    width   there about 200 yards.

of   the seam             coal,    a       considerable     distance on each side      of   the

tions on the surface of the coal were occasioned by the action of the
water when the lake was discharged; and that the Horse occupies
the bed of the stream by which the complete drainage of the lake
was effected.  The sandstone of the roof, and that which fills the
lows, he conceives, on account                          of the fineness of the grain, were tran
quilly deposited.
   A   paper was then read, entitled, “Remarks on the Structure of
the Royal George, and on the Condition of the Timber, Iron, Cop
per, &c., recovered during the operations of Col. Pasley, in the Sum
mer of 1839;” by Mr. Creuze, of Her Majesty's Dock Yard, Ports
mouth, and communicated by Captain Basil Hall, R.N., F.G.S.
    The Royal George was accidentally sunk at Spithead on the 29th
of August, 1782, and as the specimens described in the paper were
recovered during the summer of 1839, they had consequently been
immersed in a tide-way of salt water fifty-seven years. She was
the first ship of war built on the principles recommended by the
committee appointed to inquire into the superiority of the vessels
in the Spanish and French navies; and was commenced at Wool
wich in 1746, and launched the 1st of February, 1756. The Royal
George was consequently, when sunk (1782), twenty-six years old.
    The great agent in the work of destruction of the timbers had
been “the worm.”           This insect had gradually, by           innumerable                 its

bition, a portion of each of which was presented to the Society's
Museum.
     A letter,
            dated November, 1839, was afterwards read, addressed to
Dr. Mantell by Mr. C. Hullmandel, “On the Subsidence of the
Coast near Puzzuoli.”
   In 1813, Mr. Hullmandel resided during four months in the Ca
puchin Convent, which is situated at the entrance of Puzzuoli, and
on the seaward side of the road towards Naples.            The oldest friar,
styled il molto reverende, then ninety-three years of age, informed
Mr. Hullmandel, that when he was a young man, the road towards
Naples passed between the convent and the sea, but that from the
gradual subsiding of the soil it had been obliged to be changed to
its present course.   During Mr. Hullmandel's residence, the refec
tory and the entrance-gate were from six              twelve inches under   to
water, whenever strong westerly winds prevailed.              Thirty years
previously such                an
                     occurrence never took       place.    The small wharf
at  Puzzuoli was also constantly under water during westerly winds.
Mr. Hullmandel therefore infers, that               not probable the archi
                                                                  as it   is

Mr. Lay says, if he understood his informant rightly, a large supply
of fuel might be obtained from the island.         Lignite is also found
by the natives in sandstone in a deep     valley or ravine, not far from
Borneo city, and believed by the author to be that called Kianggi.
The bed extends obliquely from one side of the ravine to the other,
forming an angle of about 45°, with the direction of a rivulet,
which flows through the valley; and it is stated to be more than
two yards in breadth.        The valley is accessible by a path called
Jalan-subrek, and conspicuous from the palace of the Sultan, but it
is steep, rugged, and narrow.      The distance from the water-edge is
less than two miles.     The whole of the peninsula lying on one side
of the river is formed of very steep hills, which gradually become
more lofty towards the south-west.       Upon the main land, or oppo
site side of the river, the ridges are supposed to range at right angles
to the mountains.      They are composed, generally, of a soft sand
stone, alternating with clay; but on the summit of one of the
hills, Mr. Lay noticed the outcrop of a hard red sandstone, formed
of round and angular masses of quartz, particles of black mica, and
a ferruginous cement.
      A paper was last read, “On some Geological Specimens from
  Syria;" by Mr. W. C. Williamson.
      The specimens were sent to England by Mr. Heugh, to whom
  the author states, he is indebted for a few notes respecting the local
  ities, whence they were obtained.       The chief districts are the vici
  nity of Beyroot, especially Mount Gebeel Suneen, which forms the
  part of the Lebanon range immediately above Beyroot.             The tri
 angular tongue of land, on which that town is built, is about four
 miles in extent from the mountains to the coast, and it presents an
 undulating surface, some of the higher points attaining 500 feet
 above the level of the sea. The formation of which it is composed,
 is a hard cream-coloured limestone, which exhibits in the cliffs along
 the sea-shore numerous veins of flint; and it is in one part of the
 coast overlaid by a soft calcareous rock, occasionally 100 feet thick.
 The latter stone is easily wrought, and is employed as a building
 material, being better able to resist the effects of the earthquakes
 than the harder and more compact rock.
     On ascending Gebeel Suneen from the flat plain, which extends
along  its   foot, and
                    is    400 feet above the level  of  the sea, the follow
ing rocks are passed over:--
     Compact limestone..............................      to

       hydrated oxide    of iron .....................   50

  Compact limestone, forming the summit of
    the mountain, about ........................                 100 feet.
  In   a break in the side of Gebeel Suneen, and extending for some
distance  along the upper  part  of the lower conglomerate, is a basaltic
dyke, which shoots upwards into the compact limestone. It is about
100 yards wide, and begins, as well as terminates, very abruptly.
Except a small hillock near the sea of Tiberias, this is stated to be
the only trap seen by Mr. Heugh or his friends throughout the
whole of Syria.
   The fossils from the middle bed of limestone are generally casts,
but are assigned by the author to the genera Dolium, Buccinum,
Nerina'a, Turritella, Venus, Crassatella 2, Hippurites, Trigonia,
Cardium, Lucina, Nucula, and Spatangus.
   In a soft limestone at the village of Ba-abda, and also on the banks
of the Zamies, are found large drusy geodes of quartz, and some
times of chalcedony.
    Among the other fossils contained in the collection, are specimens
of Clupea brevissima (Agassiz, Tab. LXI., f. 6–9.). They occur
in great numbers a little above Tripoli, on the way to the Cedars,
and about thirty miles north of Beyroot.
    None of the fossils, except the fishes, having been identified with
described species, Mr. Williamson does not venture to determine
 the precise age of the beds from which they were obtained; but he
is of opinion that the fossils are more nearly allied to the organic
remains of the cretaceous series than to any other.        The Dolium,
he says, bears a strong resemblance to the D. nodosum of the En
glish chalk, and a species of Venus to the V. angulata of the green
sand. Nerinaea, he states, on the authority of Mr. Daniel Sharpe,
are found near Lisbon associated with Hippurites.

  Jan. 20.-Mr. Grove on a powerful Voltaic Combination.
  In reviewing the history of the voltaic battery from its first dis
covery to the present day, Mr. Grove showed how the chemical
theory had led to            all
                            the improvements            of

which   is explained by the chemical theory.           third defect was the

PHoSPHATE of CoPPER FROM HIRSCHBERG, ON THE SAALE, IN
        RUssi AN voicTLAND. ANALYSED BY KüHN.
    This mineral is of a nodular appearance; the internal structure is
 concentrically fibrous, with conchoidal fracture; in colour it resem
bles malachite. Its specific gravity cannot be determined on account
 of the impurity of the material.         The matrix is a brown iron stone,
interspersed with veins of quartz, and containing here and there
 groups of quartz crystals.
    The analysis was gone through in the following manner: some of
the purest pieces, amounting to 0.407 gramme, gave 0.031 loss by
ignition. After           its
                         solution       dilute nitric acid, there remained

  Although minium has been an object of research by several chemists,
opinions are still divided, not only as to its analysis, but also as to
the manner in which its true constitution ought to be represented.
  M. Levol states that, having had occasion to examine several
samples with respect to the commercial value, his experiments tend
to confirm the views generally entertained with respect to this sub
stance, namely, that it is not a peculiar oxide, but a definite compound
of protoxide and peroxide.
   M. Levol agrees with M. Dumas, and it may be added also, with
the previous determination of Dalton, that the composition of minium
is represented by PbO3 + 2 PbO, and he finds that this is also                                                           its

  The following considerations induced M. Levol to believe that
minium is a compound of two oxides.   In supposing that minium is
a peculiar oxide intermediate between these oxides, it is inexplicable
how it happens that minium cannot be converted into binoxide by
calcination with chlorate of potash, an effect which it readily pro
duces with the protoxide of lead.
   Oxalic acid constantly converts binoxide of lead into protoxide,
but does not alter minium; and this is at once a method of purify
ing, and a good characteristic of minium.    As this acid, as well as
protonitrate of mercury and sulphurous acid, reduce the binoxide
of lead to protoxide, and has no action on minium, it may be in
ferred, not only that minium is a compound of the two oxides, but
that it is a compound of remarkable stability.—Ann. de Chim. et de
Phys., 75, 108.
ACTION OF ANHYDROUS PHOSPHORIC ACID UPON ANHYDROUS
           CAMPHORIC ACID. B.Y. M. P. WALTER.
   The action excited by anhydrous phosphoric acid upon anhydrous
camphoric acid, in nowise resembles that of Nordhausen sulphuric
acid upon anhydrous camphoric acid : the anhydrous sulphuric acid
acts, so to speak, in a less destructive manner; it re-acts according
to the rules of substitutions.    Instead of taking carbon from the
camphoric acid, it adds the elements of sulphurous acid, and from this
re-action a new acid arises; whereas, in causing anhydrous phos
phoric acid to act upon camphoric acid, it attacks it in        mole                  all     its
cules and gives rise        several compounds.

the smaller quantity of carbon, found in my analyses, is due to the
presence of a little phosphuretted hydrogen, which it is difficult to
separate from the carburetted hydrogen. In the latter case, in order
to explain the formation of this carburetted hydrogen by means of
the formula for anhydrous camphoric acid, the formation of water
must be admitted in the re-action.      I should have decided this
question long since, if the quantity of carburetted hydrogen, ob
tained during the re-action, had been more considerable than it ac
tually was.—Ann. de Chim. et de Phys., 75, 212.

XLI.    On the Voltaic Decomposition of Aqueous and Alcoholic

place in solutions in the principal solvents under voltaic agency,
and having, I conceive, attained some general results,             pro                 I
pose at present to give a condensed view of these experiments
and conclusions, the more detailed account of them being

after  forty minutes’ action not     trace                       of

  ought to have been liberated, and the blue colour produced
  in one or other of the tubes before reversed; but as this change
  did not occur till after reversal, the effect was due to nascent
  hydrogen at the negative pole. This hydrogen must have
  combined with bromine if the bromide is dissolved as such,
  as is usually held, and is most probable; or with oxygen if
  the whole or a part of it decomposes water, forming hydro
  bromic and iodic acids ". The appearances of effervescence
  lead to the same conclusion.           The oxygen liberated at the
  positive pole in B before reversal must have come from water,
  and implies an equivalent quantity of hydrogen passing into
  A, and uniting with the oxygen of water in the course of de
  composition in A. Now as this hydrogen did not appear on
  reversal of the battery, it must have been employed in                 li
  berating iodine.
     The next case to be considered is that of the oxyacids.
  When we observe the radical of such an acid solution sepa
  rating at the negative pole and oxygen at the positive, we are
  at first sight inclined to suppose that the acid itself has been
  the subject of direct voltaic decomposition; and accordingly
  it has been often thought that sulphur and phosphorus, when
  they are observed in such circumstances, are the result of
  direct decomposition of the corresponding acids.                 In like
  manner we might conclude that the iodine which instantly
  separates at the negative pole when a solution of iodic acid is
 acted on, is the result of primary decomposition;                  but a
 simple experiment at once shows the action to be secondary.
 A mixed solution of iodic acid and of starch was placed in
 the tube B, fig. 1, and a solution of starch in A, the con
 nexion being by asbestus moistened with the latter solution,
 and B made positive and A negative by fifty pairs of two-inch
 plates.     Effervescence ensued from both poles, but after half
 an hour's action no formation of blue was observed anywhere
 in either tube. The battery was then reversed in the manner
 above described.        In two minutes blue matter was formed on
 the now     negative  foil in the acid solution with little or no ef
 fervescence at that pole, but effervescence from the positive
foil.    Thus in the first position of the battery, as there was
 no direct decomposition of the acid, iodine did not pass to
 wards the positive pole; whilst after reversal, iodine imme
 diately appeared by the reducing action of hydrogen derived
from directly decomposed water.              The analogy of this ex
    * When both poles are plunged into the solution, and the battery is in
fresh action, there is effervescence at both poles, a part of the hydrogen
only being engaged in producing the secondary action.

                 of Aqueous    and Alcoholic Solutions.                          245
periment may evidently be extended to sulphuric, phosphoric
and other oxyacids.
    This result may be further illustrated on the principle of
the voltameter.        A current of the same power as above was
passed through a solution of iodic acid, and one of sulphuric
acid diluted with twelve parts of water. Iodine without any
elastic fluid separated from the negative pole of the iodic so
lution, and from the other poles the following quantities of
gas were collected.

     This result can      scarcely  be  explained    except    on the idea
 of the direct decomposition of water only; for similar quan
tities of oxygen were liberated from both solutions, notwith
standing the difference of atomic constitution of the two acids;
and whilst a corresponding quantity of hydrogen was evolved
from the sulphuric solution, that from the iodic did not ap
pear, and was plainly occupied in reducing iodine.
     In like manner when the same current was passed through
 dilute sulphuric acid and a solution of boracic acid, it was
found that very nearly the same relative quantities of oxygen
 and hydrogen were evolved from both solutions in the same
        notwithstanding the difference in the atomic constitution
 time,
 of the two acids. There was therefore little doubt that in
 both solutions the water and not the acid had suffered decom
position.
     We turn now to the hydracids. When a solution of mu
 riatic or hydriodic acid, not too weak, is acted on under or
 dinary circumstances, there is an immediate liberation of
 chlorine or iodine without oxygen at the positive pole, and of
 hydrogen at the negative. The first view which strikes one,
 is that the hydracid is directly resolved into            its
                                                           elements; and

towards the positive side reacted with the hydrogen of the
 water in B, it is plain that the hydracid so formed should
have been immediately decomposed again, and the chlorine
or iodine should have speedily appeared at the pole in a se
parate form, and that before acid appeared; whereas in the
                                 j
case of muriatic acid, the chlorine did not appear till consi
derably after acid had passed into B, and much later than
iodine appeared in the case of hydriodic acid, although the
constituents of the latter are less decidedly opposed to one an
other in electric nature than those of muriatic acid, and there
fore ought reasonably to be of more difficult voltaic decom
position.    The quantity of chlorine or iodine which appears is
not in  proportion   to the absolute quantity of acid which passes
over, but to the facility with         that acid is reduced. The
fair and natural interpretation of the whole phaenomena, is
evidently afforded on the view of a secondary action on the
hydracid.
    The experiment with hydriodic acid was varied
                                                       º  COnnect
ing two tubes, B and C, fig. 2, each filled with distilled water,
with the tube   A,   containing the hydriodic solution, the power
being seventy pairs of four-inch plates. Slight effervescence
ensued at both poles, but during forty minutes' action no dis
coloration appeared in either tube. Soon after a brown tint
appeared in C, with acid reaction at the positive pole.         In
ten minutes more the battery was reversed, when iodine
without any gas instantly appeared in A. All these appear
ances are quite in conformity with the above views.
    In regard to metallic oxides it is not easy to obtain such
direct experimental evidence, because the metals of such as
are soluble in water react on the solvent; but we may take
the decomposition of metallic oxides as contained in solu
ble salts, during which the metal frequently appears at the
negative pole, as illustrating the action on solutions of such
oxides as are dissolved by pure water. It is now pretty ge
nerally admitted, that when metal appears in solutions of
metallic salts at the negative pole, it is due to the reducing
action of nascent hydrogen; and this opinion I have verified
directly by finding, that when solutions of sulphate of copper,
or muriate of zinc or nitrate of silver, were made positive
fifty pairs of two-inch plates, and connected by asbestus wit   º
distilled water which was made negative, neither metal nor
oxide was carried towards the negative pole during half an
hour's action; whilst on reversal of the battery, the non-nega
tive foil in a quarter of an hour was found to be more or less
covered with reduced metal.         Thus the circumstance that
in the one    position   nascent hydrogen   was produced in the

metallic solution, and in the other in the distilled water, evi
dently was the cause of the difference of the result.        The
experiment with muriate of zinc and nitrate of silver was
varied by placing the solution in a bent tube and pouring
distilled water over                       it,
                           the negative wire being alternately
plunged           in

as     the experiments with asbestus; the only difference being,
        in

  I  conceive that a sufficient number of cases has been                                                           in
vestigated to warrant the general conclusion, “that when
aqueous solutions of primary combinations of elementary
bodies are submitted to voltaic agency, the dissolved substance
is not decomposed by the current, but only the solvent.”

XLII. A              new and more general Theory of Multiple Roots.
  By       J. J.    SYLVESTER, F.R.S. &c., Professor of Natural                                                Phi

I SHALL        begin with developing the theory of polynomials
    containing perfect square factors, one or more.
   First,        let
                 proceed  us                     to
                            determine the relations which must
exist between the coefficients     such polynomials, and afterof
wards show how they may         broken      into others be                   up                         of    an   in
ferior degree.
  A   parallelogram filled with letters standing      one row                                  in                   is
intended       express the product
                  to                    the squared difference          of
of   the quantities contained.                                Thus  (        a    Dº) indicates             (a-b)
(a     5   2)    is        used         to   indicate      (a-b). (a–c)”. (b–c),                            and     so
forth.
   Suppose now that two    the roots          belonging

      former paper                  (Poggendorff, Ann. xlvii.)  I have en
INdeavoured
       a
            to show                   that a relation subsists between the
vou mes in which bodies unite in forming chemical com
pounds, in addition to that which is known to exist with re
spect to their weights.  Gay-Lussac had already shown that
gaseous compounds combine with one another according to
volumes; but this observation had not been extended to solid
or liquid compounds.     Hence the object of my inquiries was
to examine the atomic volumes in which the latter combine,
in contradistinction to their atomic weights; to which atten
tion had hitherto been exclusively directed in examining their
chemical composition.
   The numbers representing the atomic volumes of bodies
are proportional,    just as the atomic weights are; and
the atomic volume of any body may be deduced from                                                            its
atomic weight, merely

                             dividing the latter             specific               by       its
gravity. But        evident that these numbers must

   The carbonates of zinc and magnesia, mesitine, the car
bonates of iron and manganese, dolomite and calcareous spar,
are a group of bodies which possess both an analogous con
stitution and an equivalent crystalline form. The crystalline
form of all of them is that of a rhombohedron, but the axes a
in them are unequal and the angle R different.                             If we adopt the
mean of the observations already given as the atomic volume
of each of these bodies, we find that the axis a of the rhom
bohedron increases, that the angle R diminishes, whilst the
atomic volume increases.

   From the differences occurring between the specific weight
observed and calculated, we can conclude whether the sub
stances found in their natural condition are rendered impure
by substances specifically heavier or lighter; but with those
minerals which occur in a state of purity, the specific gravities
ascertained by observation and calculation approximate very
closely.     In the case of dolomite the specific weight obtained
by experiment is always greater than it is found to be by cal
culation; but analysis shows that it is always rendered impure
by the oxides of iron and manganese. The carbonate of

the glass bell against the jet of wet steam, it frequently happened
that the water dropping down from the edges of the bell flowed
in a continuous stream, and served as a conductor for the elec

    Now      in this experiment the development                  electricity   of                  is

of the water showed        the slightest traces of electricity.      It ap
pears, therefore, that steam, the caloric of which is derived
from the water from which it separates, developes no electricity.
   The temperature, for example, of the laboratory during one
experiment was 45° Fahr. The temperature of the issuin
wet steam at a distance of one-eighth of an inch from the
of the jet was 150°; at three inches further the temperature
of the steam sunk to 120°; in the bell itself it was 110°; and
the collected and condensed water in the bell measured 100°,
the steam escaping from this water showing only between
60° and 70°.             -
   The temperature of the steam and the water in the boiler
was under a pressure of thirty-two inches, of course about
253°. After opening the stop-cock, the water released par

                  pressure was converted, till the stop-cock was

scarcely possible that the envelope of these little globules could
be of an equal or lesser density than the air in which the clouds
are suspended.    Further, he considered the swiftness of their
movement   entirely  irreconcilable with their vesicular state,
as the friction caused by such movement through the air would
soon set them at rest.    Finally, he explains, as the air in the
vesicles must be in a state of condensation, as it has to resist
the tendency of the water molecules to unite themselves in
a drop, the globule would finally disappear, as a soap bub
ble will swiftly diminish and disappear when the tube on which
it is suspended is removed from the mouth.                But this latter
case only takes place when the film forming the soap bubble
is very thick, viz. in the beginning of                         its
                                                   formation, and can

     In further considering the equilibrium               the cloud, we    of
must not     only  bear        in

 268    Prof. De Morgan's Suggestion relative to Barrett's
 higher temperature than the surrounding air, and that this
 heated and rarefied air, together with the water globules, con
 stitutes a body of equal or less density than an equal mass of
 the surrounding air. But if we take into consideration the
 slight expansion of gaseous bodies for every degree of the
 thermometer, and compare the very great difference in den
 sity between air and water, and therefore the mass of heat
required to keep only a small quantity of water in suspension
for such a considerable time; further, if we ask, why b
 such an elevation of the temperature of the air in contact wit
the water globules the capacity for saturation of this air may
not increase with the temperature, and the minute water glo
bules be not converted into water gas again;–all these cir
cumstances present difficulties almost -insurmountable           in
adopting this theory.
    M. Saigey finally declares, that the equilibrium of the clouds
is only apparent;        º:
                        the minute globules of water in the cloud
were indeed    constantly falling, but immediately as they left
 the cloud were again converted into water-gas by touching
 the surrounding non-saturated air, which rising and cooled
 down again, restored again         water    its
                                              the cloud,     to
                                                              that                    so        all
 these clouds were     constantly  losing  water        one and re          on
ceiving it      on
                 the other side. This explanation can only                                      be
correct under certain circumstances, that            when the cloud    is

    He has considered the conditions presented by different
cases of elasticity of the aether within crystallized and uncry
stallized media, and, in particular, traces the consequences
of a supposition of this kind in modifying the formula for
waves so as to give rise to elliptic or circular polarization in
rock crystal, and refers to a peculiar arrangement of the               vi
brating molecules in that substance as influencing the right             or
left-handed direction of the rotation*.               I
                                                 But cannot find that
he took    up  such an idea     upon    any more general grounds: in
other   words,   I think he cannot be said to have shown generally
a connexion between the arrangement of the molecules of
ather in space,—the forms assumed by the differential equa
tions accordingly,–and the consequent rectilinear or elliptic
character of the vibrations.          I am still of opinion, therefore,
that the credit of first      establishing  such a general relation is
due   entirely   to Mr:   Tovey.

XLVII.        Report on the Memoir on Electric Currents in Warm
    blooded Animals, by Prof. Zantedeschi and Dr. Favio, pre
    sented to the Royal Academy of Sciences and Belles Lettres
    of Brussels,   on the 4th   of April,  1840.  By M. CANTRAINEf.
      HE    memoir which is addressed to us relates to electro
       physiological doctrines, and the object of the experiments
which these gentlemen have made, is to ascertain whether
electric currents exist in warm-blooded animals; to endeavour
to find their connexion with life; their intensity, their              di
rection, their number, and in what way they may be disco
vered.      Electricity, whether considered as the cause of the
phaenomena of life, or as the special and intimate effect of life,
is in some measure a new subject: few persons have attended
to it; the difficulties also which surround such researches are
 numerous, and we must acknowledge with the authors, that
in this case the concurrence of natural philosophy and the
 medical sciences is indispensable, as much on account of the
 apparatus which should be used, as for the perspicacity ne
 cessary to penetrate into the mysteries of the vital organism.
     These gentlemen set out with the principle enunciated by
 Pucinotti and Pacinotti, the learned Professors of Pisa, which
 is based upon the experiments and the observations also made
 by those Professors. It maintains that in living animals there
 exists an electro-vital or neuro-electric current, the character of

 whilst into another part of the same animal is plunged (en

 it furnished with an insulating handle.              It is understood that
 by means of the interposition of the animal, the circuit of the
galvanometer is thus complete.
    At the moment when the two stylets are plunged (enfoncé)
 into the two parts of the animal, there is disengaged from the
 torrent of animal life, by the effect of a vital reaction, an elec
 tric current, which, diverted from                          its

they should call them vital, and supposing that this name
should      begiven them, what should                  understood     be  vital                by

     Besides this electro-vital current, they have verified                the                  in

274       Report on Zantedeschi and Favio's Memoir
(chimisme)    of the organic and animal life which resides in the
substance of the organs and tissues.
   In order to distinguish these currents, they apprise us that
we should not take as the electro-chemical current in relation
with life, that which is obtained by sounding (sondant) the dif
ferent products and the different secretions of the organs; such
a current is named the common electro-chemical, whilst the vi
tal electro-chemical current is that which is developed in the
internal animal chemism, which is not subject to the common
chemical laws; a current which they are not willing to sup
pose to be the cause of life, but which may be regarded as the
special effect which life alone can produce.
   By this it is evident that the common electro-chemical cur
rent is obtained by simply placing the stylets in contact with
the secretions, or with the surfaces of the organs moistened
with heterogeneous products.
   The second, on the contrary, is only obtained by penetra
ting with stylets even into the intimate assemblage of the or
ganic tissues, and by exciting in them a strong reaction by
means of this deep perturbation.
   Consequently, if we look upon this last current either as
drawing      its   origin from the chemical and proper action  life                  of
on matter,         or    as

   Such are the conjectures which the authors have thought
they might publish, and which new experiments will come to
destroy or corroborate.   They have described them without
any sectarian spirit, and only as physiological hypotheses,
which, if they are found not unworthy of mature examination,
may serve as guides for new experiments.

        Black Substance from Sulphuric Acid and Alcohol.
    HE nature of the peculiar black substance originating from
       the action of sulphuric acid on alcohol was first pointed
out by O. Z. Erdmann, who concluded from his experiments
that it was composed of a substance nearly approaching the for
mula   C*H*   O'S, and of an incombustible residue consisting
of sulphatic salts. Subsequently, L. Lose, who had obtained
this substance whilst preparing the isaethionic salts, was                                   in
duced to examine      and obtained somewhat different results,

but hygroscopic   water; further, that the citric acid which
Crasso  separated  from the residuous acid heated until the
disappearance of white vapours, and which he found by ana
lysis to be Ci + 3 Aq, must no longer be considered as citric
acid dried at 100° C., but is the usual crystallized citric acid
which has remained unchanged.
    Wackenroder likewise contradicts the assertions of Robi
quet and Crasso respecting the insolubility of citric acid in
aether: he found that rectified aether, dry as well as moist,
dissolved abundantly the melted acid, that the solutions did
 not become milky in closed vessels, and on evaporation gave
a syrup which but slightly reddened dried litmus, and which
on standing exposed to the atmosphere gradually passed into
the crystallized state.
    Before quitting this subject we may notice the observations
of Berzelius (Arsberettelse, No. xviii.) on the views of Liebig
and Dumas on the constitution of organic acids: he rejects
them entirely, and states that the citrate of soda when heated to
 190° may be a compound of two atoms of citrate of soda, and
one atom of aconate of soda.           In a remarkable paper “On
 certain Questions of the      Day   in Organic Chemistry,” pub
lished in Poggendorff’s Annalen, xlvii. p. 289, which is prin
 cipally directed against Liebig’s article “On the Composition
 of Organic Acids,” Annalen der Pharmacie, xxvi. p. 113,
 Berzelius observes with regard to citric acid, that he has
 found that when the citrate of soda dried at 190° C. was dis
 solved in water and placed aside to crystallize, regular crystals
 of citrate but no aconate of soda was produced. As citrate of
 soda is insoluble in alcohol, but aconate somewhat soluble,
he tried to extract the latter from the metamorphosed citrate
 by this means, but he obtained much less than the theory
required.     Citrate of silver when just precipitated is white
 and   voluminous;    it has then the formula Aq C. H. O', but
 by heating, or even by standing in the fluid, it becomes hea
 vier, granular and crystalline, and has a composition similar
 to that of the metamorphosed soda salt. The metamorphosed
 silver salt was treated with alcohol and a quantity of hydro
 chloric acid not sufficient to decompose the whole of           it;the
 mixture was well shaken until there was             no   more hydro
 chloric acid   in  the alcohol.      The alcoholic solution when
 evaporated left     aperfectly uncrystalline syrup, which, dis
 solved in  water,   letfall   trace
                               a     of  citrateof   silver; out  ofthe

                           a           syrup,   similarto  the aconitic
 acid, and which when saturated with carbonate            of soda gives

  When a solution of this salt is treated with sulphate of soda,
a new compound separates in needles.      This is also obtained

by decomposing the first salt by dilute sulphuric acid, nitric
acid being expelled.   A solution of this salt yields no preci
pitate with nitrate of barytes, but gives            of barytes
when an excess of nitric or muriatic acid is added.         analysis                                                    Its

    In this confused state of our knowledge of so interesting a
class of bodies,               I
                       think it right to publish some facts with
regard to their origin and constitution which I had discovered
a long time ago; for after having completed my researches
on the mercurial compounds formed by ammonia,                      com                                 I
menced the       analogous   examination of the       platinum   bodies,
and had formed many new substances, among others the mu
riatic and oxalic salts of Gros, when his memoir appeared.
I  then thought that he would pursue the subject further, but
as it would be useless for two persons to be losing time doing
the same thing, and I thought that he was ahead of me in time,
I  laid the subject aside, and passed to other matters.          I have
lately resumed that investigation, and combining my old re
sults with those which I since obtained,             consider that the             I
nature of those bodies      may  be now    explained.
    I formed these salts originally, not as M. Gros did, from
Magnus's salt, but by acting with ammonia on the perchloride
of platina. There are produced a series of bodies, which it is
not my object to describe here, but ultimately a colourless
solution, which gives with alcohol a white precipitate, which
is the basis of Gros's salts, that he had endeavoured in vain to
isolate.     Its composition is Pt Cl N. He O + 2 Aq. Its solu
tion in water gives with acids             Gros's salts. Now  all                                           in   its
formation the series                     of
                              decompositions from the perchloride
Pt   Cl, fully developed. And
                is                           important also that
                                                             it   is                                             by

 looking upon Gros's salts, the sulphate for example, as con
 taining the bichloramide of platina united with two equiva
  lents of sulphate of ammonia (Pt Cl, + Pt Ad) + 2 (NHA.
  O + SO3). As to the objection made by Gros to the exist
 ence of common sulphate of ammonia, that neither the acid
 nor the base can be directly detected, it is well remarked by
 Berzelius that the view taken by Gros does not in the slightest
degree render it easier of explanation.           We find, however,
many analogous cases. Thus in the double oxalate of chrome
and potash, a very trifling quantity of the oxalic acid is shown
on the addition of a salt of lime.

     consider that it is not calculated to advance science, when,
in order to avoid difficulties in the rational explanation of the
constitution and properties of any substance, the theory of or
ganic radicals is employed as unreservedly as it appears now
to be by many chemists.       It gives an air of simplicity to re
actions, very attractive at first sight, and very convenient for
explanation, but which, by making us satisfied by surface re
semblance or plausibility, may retard important investigations.

                              not, however, avoid being struck
with some inconsistencies in the reasonings adduced; and
should these be a sample of what we are generally to meet with,
we may account in good measure for the reluctance manifested
by our countrymen to adopt every new theory that may be
put forth, even under the sanction of men whose reputation
stands deservedly so high. Theories now succeed each other
with such surprising rapidity, that scarcely has one been
blazoned to the world ere another is proposed to supersede
it,and this experiences,    may be,     dominion it   still shorter     a                        of

 To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
    GENTLEMEN,
                the Daguerreotype                  process has long excited
ALTHOUGH
  intense interest in the scientific               world, we have not as
yet had an explanation of the wonderful effects produced.                                                         I
believe that even M. Arago has failed to elucidate the theory;
and not only has this great philosopher been foiled, but the                                                    in
ventor of the process is unable to solve the problem; with
these facts before me,                 I
                              feel it almost presumptuous in so hum
ble a   votary  of science as myself to attempt an explanation
of the cause of the production of Daguerreotype pictures, but if
my attempt has the effect of directing attention to the right
path for arriving at a solution of the question,                 shall be sa                 I
tisfied.    We           all

imperfectly crystallized surface of the iodine, which being in
a measure powdery and offering no determinate angle of re
            j
flection to the eye, the mercurial vapour adheres, but in no
flat surface or continuous determinate angle capable of re
flecting a mass of light; it may be said it is here unpolished.
   Again, may not the angle under which it is necessary to
view a Daguerreotype picture be that of the facet of the iodic
crystal,      this be a further confirmation of my theory? The
mercurial vapour covers the whole of the iodine, and thus
protects it from the further action of light.
    Such are the crude views I have formed on this subject, and
 I trust they may lead to a further elucidation.

             which might better have been called “A description              of

  on first turning over the uncut leaves, and meeting with zenith and
  madir of crystals, and north-east, north-west, and other meridians,
  have supposed that the object of the book was to create a laugh
  at the expense of the cultivators of that science; but recollecting the
  cost of publishing a rather bulky octavo volume, we felt compelled
  to suppose the author serious, and we accordingly began at the
  preface to separate some of the leaves.
     The first line of the treatise defines crystallography to be “the                           art
 of   describing crystals.”     But this, according          to

to   a few extracts and remarks.
    The preface begins thus “There are many systems
                                       :                              crystal   of

 “The different     systems,”    it proceeds, “hitherto published have
failed to  satisfy the wants of the public.” We do not know to what
public Mr. Griffin refers.      Surely not to those by whom the tens of
thousands of     copies  of ‘Nicholas Nickelby' and “Jack Sheppard’
are   eagerly  purchased,   or the novels of fashionable life as eagerly
perused; and if not to these, what reading public is to be found,
and more especially where the cultivators of science, whose wants
the existing works on Crystallography have failed to satisfy:
    The different systems to which our author alludes are, he con
tinues, “either too difficult to learn, or, when learnt, too troublesome
for service. Hence,” he says, “crystallography is little studied by
chemists or mineralogists; and the consequence              that for want                      is,                                 of

L. & Ed., was read.
   Dr. Barry, in reference to the memorandum of Mr. Wharton Jones,
claiming for himself the contemporaneous discovery of the germinal
spot in the mammiferous ovum, states that, after having bestowed
considerable pains to ascertain who was the original observer of a
structure which has proved to be of great importance, he had men
tioned incidentally in his paper the result of his inquiry, namely, that
the merit of the discovery was due to Professor Rudolph Wagner; but
observes that the inquiry may be resumed by                    all
                                                       who will take the

F.R.S. L. & Ed.”.
   In the paper referred to, the author had shown, that after the ovum
of the Rabbit has entered the Fallopian tube, cells are found col
lected around            its
                   thick transparent membrane      “zona pellucida”;                or
which cells,            by
                 coalescing, form thinner membrane—the incipient
                                                          a
chorion. He now adds, that the formation      this thinner membrane           of

              is
after the thinner membrane has risen from        The fluid space also,        it.
 between the “zona” and the thinner membrane, presents             large

              cells            or
                       discoid objects, each     which contains     bril      of                                 a a

 at the periphery, for the thickening      the chorion. They seem

of this naturalist (the “central nervous system” of Reichert) is not
simultaneous with, but anterior to, that of the chorda.
   The author then reviews the observations of Rathke and Reichert
on the chorda dorsalis, which contain internal evidence, he thinks,
of a process in the development of Fishes, Reptiles, and Birds, the
same as that which he has observed in Mammalia; namely, the ori
gin of the embryo out of the nucleus of a cell.
   And it is his opinion that this observation may assist to solve a
question on which physiologists are not agreed; for it shows, that if
the nucleus of a cell is a single object, the first rudiments of the
embryo are not two halves. The author thinks that unless the very
earliest periods are investigated, it is in vain that we attempt to
learn what that                 is,   of
                       which the rudiments        the embryo are com                 of

  cell. These views he now confirms; and in the present paper shows
  that they admit of being extended to the corpuscles of the blood.
     He then compares appearances observed in the latter with those
  he had traced in the ovum.      These relate to the number of parts of
  which the nucleus is at different periods composed,—the nature of
  the nucleolus,   the communication between the nucleolus and the
  exterior of the cell,—the formation of the contents of the cell out of
 the nucleus, -the final division of the nucleus into the foundations
 of a limited number of young cells, destined to succeed the parent
 cell,—and the escape of the young cells for this purpose. It follows
 from these investigations, that the corpuscles of the blood are gene
 rated by a process essentially the same as that giving origin to those
 cells which are the immediate successors of the germinal vesicle, or
 original parent cell; it being also by a continuation of the same
 process that the corpuscle of the blood divides itself into the minuter
 objects figured by the author in his former paper on the blood.
     He adds, that in its form and internal state, the blood-corpuscle
 found in the adult of certain animals, very much resembles that ex
 isting only in the foetal life of others. It is incidentally remarked,
 that the foetal brain, at certain periods, appears to consist almost
 entirely of objects very much resembling those which, in some stages,
 form the nuclei in the foetal corpuscles of the blood.
. The author concludes, by expressing his opinion, that the mode
 of evolution of the minute mammiferous ovum is deserving of close
 attention, in connexion with some of the processes by which nourish
 ment is communicated, and the growth of the body effected, at all
                                   --

   April 29, 1840-A paper was first read, “On a few detached
 laces along the coast of Ionia and Caria; and on the island of
  hodes;” by William John Hamilton, Esq., Sec. G.S.
                                                  +.
   The localities described in this paper are, 1. Fouges (anc. Phocaea);
2. Ritri (anc. Erythrae); 3. Sighajik (anc.              4. Scalanuova,
near Ephesus; 5. Boodroom (anc. Halicarnassus); 6. Cnidus; 7.
Island and shores of the Gulf of Syme; and 8. Rhodes.
    1. Fouges is situated in a small bay at the northern extremity of
the Gulf of Smyrna, and      all  the formationsin   itsneighbourhood ex
amined    by  Mr. Hamilton are volcanic. On the north side            of the
bay, a  range   ofhills, from 300   to 400 feet high, extends several miles
to the eastward, and consists      inthe uppermost part,   of
                                                            beds of  smooth
semivitrified red and gray trachyte, containing numerous cavities
lined with mammillated chalcedony.            The trachyte passes down
wards into  a  soft, white, pumiceous sandy rock. The greater part
of  the hills   tothe north   of   the bay are composed    of  the same for
mation, traversed,   in   several  places by  north and  east,  narrow trap

 dykes, which have altered the adjacent rocks into an imperfectly
 banded jasper.      About one mile to the north-east of Fouges, Mr.
 Hamilton noticed a mass of black hornstone, and to the west and
 north-west, near the water's edge, trappean and amygdaloidal rocks,
 overlaid by the pumiceous sandstone.
     2. Ritri is situated on the shores of the bay of Erythrae, opposite
 the island of Scio; and the geological structure of the neighbouring
 district consists of red crystalline, apparently stratified trachyte, and
  of blue or gray, more or less, crystalline limestone, with associated
  sandstone. The two latter rocks are of anterior date to the trachyte,
  but Mr. Hamilton could not determine their relative geological age,
  as they appear to be destitute of organic remains.         The beds of lime
  stone are sometimes vertical.      On the shore near the Acropolis the
  author noticed also vertical strata of indurated shale and jasper, and
  near the juncture of the trachyte and limestone, to the north of the
  Acropolis, that the calcareous beds were much shattered. The two
  long islands which form the anchorage, are also composed of blue
  semi-crystalline limestone, without traces of bedding.
     3. Sighajik-A rich alluvial plain, connecting the harbours of
   Sighajik and Teos, gradually rises to the eastward, towards the
  mountainous district, which extends to Smyrna.               To the west the
  plain is separated from the sea by a range of hills composed of
  thickly-bedded, white, cretaceous limestone, resembling closely the
  limestone near Smyrna, described by Mr. Strickland”. In some
  places it is underlaid by beds of sandstone, and sand containing cal
  careous concretions.      Just above the ruins of Teos, the limestone is
  very thinly bedded, with slightly micaceous marly way-boards, the
  inclination of the strata being 15° to the west; and near the ancient
  harbour the white limestone is underlaid by a hard, brown, micaceous
  sandstone, associated with beds of hard nodular limestone, evidently
  belonging to a much older formation.          Low undulating hills of this
 sandstone bound the plain to the north-west.             One of the two insu
  lated remarkable hills, seen from the anchorage, also consists of                               it,
  the other being composed              of
                                   vertical beds                    of
                                                       blue marble, probably
  belonging    to the same formation.       To the north-west         the plain,       of
 this marble passes into       beautiful breccia, associated with strata
                               a                                                                  of
 brown sandstone. Mr. Hamilton saw                             no
                                                   igneous rocks        situ, but      in
 numerous blocks         of
                         greenstone are scattered about the country.

 semi-crystalline limestone, part                 of

and Mount      Prion,  where         associated with beds
                                    it       is                   yellow mica    of

 pale red jasper, the strata dipping 50° north-west; but in some
 places they are curiously contorted. The jasper increases in quantity
 towards the north-west, the limestone becoming less prominent.
 Mr. Hamilton did not land on the north side of the Gulf, but several
 points appeared to him, viewed from the sea, to consist of a brown
 arenaceous conglomerate.
    8. Rhodes.—The northern half of the island, the portion visited
by the author, consists chiefly of tertiary marine deposits, of se
 condary limestone and of scaglia, with sandstones and conglome
 rates,   No igneous rocks were observed in situ, but numerous
pebbles of greenstone and other traps were noticed in the conglo
merates near the centre of the island.
    TERTIARY STRATA.—These consist of a shelly testaceous lime
 stone, sandstone, and conglomerates, and extend in a zone of varia
ble breadth, having a quáquàversal dip, along those parts of the
island visited by the author. At the north-east end, the tertiary strata
rise into high and considerable hills, which stretch across the island
from east to west.
    The following is the order of succession                     :-
    1. Summit of the hills three miles, south-south-west of the town
of Rhodes.
         Sandy gravel and conglomerate consisting of                                Feet.

         Sand, with bands of marl . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
    2. These beds repose on an extensive formation (considered to
be from 200 to 300 feet thick) of yellow, calcareous, shelly conglo
merate, the beds of which dip 10° to north-east.                            It contains nume
rous shells of the genera Pecten, Cardium and Venus, and it is the
stone principally used in masonry. It extends to the town of Rhodes,
and re-appears to the south of the table-land in nearly horizontal
beds, some of which are very arenaceous.                               It is extensively de
veloped in several places along the coast, as far as Lindo, where
it rests unconformably against the secondary limestone.
   3. A bed of sandy marl, containing thin bands of calcareous marl.
Thickness not great.
   4. A thick bed of conglomerate and gravel, extending a consider
able distance to the south and south-west, and rising into lofty hills,
which form steep and broken cliffs on the western coast of the
island, several miles from Rhodes.                      It thins out gradually further
south, resting at the entrance of a deep valley, upon upraised beds
of blue and white scaglia and sand.

   Near Archangelo, half-way between the town of Rhodes and
Lindo, a similar system of tertiary rocks is extensively developed.
   About one mile north of Lindo Mr. Hamilton noticed between
the tertiary and secondary series a thick bed of large limestone peb
bles, with sometimes quartz pebbles and boulders, cemented by a
hard calcareous paste.       This conglomerate rests immediately on
the blue  limestone, filling up                 its
                                   interstices; and     considered               it   is                    by

hinder extremities as well developed as in the generality of Sau
rians. Of these extremities, as well as of the anterior and of the
head, there are no traces.
   Mr. Owen then proceeds to determine to which division of Sau
rians, having ball and socket vertebral joints, the fossil should be
referred. In the Crocodilian or Loricate group, the transverse costi
gerous processes are elongated, and three, four, or five of the verte
brae which precede the sacrum are ribless, and consequently reck
oned as lumbar vertebrae : in the Lacertian Sauriae there are never
 more than two lumbar vertebrae, and those which have ribs support
 them on short convex processes or tubercles.
    In the fossil from the chalk, the ribs are articulated with short
 processes of the kind just mentioned, resembling tubercles, and they
are attached to the sides of the anterior part of                  the vertebrae,    all
except the one immediately preceding the sacrum. These charac

    LIV.    Remarks on Professor Challis's Reply to Mr. Airy's Ob
      jections to the Investigation of the Resistance of the Atmo
       sphere to an Oscillating Sphere.     By GEORGE BIDDELL
      AIRy, Esq., M.A., F.R.S., Astronomer Royal.
      To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
         GENTLEMEN,
    I HAVE         not had leisure earlier to notice the remarks of
         Professor Challis in your February Number, upon my ob
    jection to his investigation of the resistance to a spherical
     body oscillating in an elastic medium.         I beg to express my
     sense of the courtesy with which Professor Challis has replied
     to my objection, and to avow my opinion what a discussion
     conducted in this manner cannot but be advantageous to the
    interests of science.    With this feeling,             I
                                                      think it right again
    to state that the considerations urged by Professor Challis in
     his last communication, do not at             all
                                               remove my objection                     to
     the fundamental    parts      of
                                 his investigation.     And trust that,I
     by  putting my own reasoning            different form, shall
                                            in                                         be

322                       Mr. Airy in                        reply to Prof. Challis
confine myself to another mode of investigation, of which the
results will be beyond doubt, namely, that by rectangular co
ordinates.
   The point in dispute may be well stated in Professor Challis's
words:     “I have certainly considered it possible that the velo
city of the fluid at a given distance from the centre to or from
which it is directed, may, at a given instant, be different in
different directions from the centre, provided there be no
abrupt variation.”
   Now I undertake to show that,
    1st.  Ifthe motion of the particles be directed to or from a
centre (or approximately so, the whole investigation being
approximate), the motions must be the same in                directions,                             all
in  phase      well
           If,as                 as

                            coefficient.
   2nd.          order
                   in        support Professor Challis's expression
for the movement            the particles          from      centre, we      to    or                a
suppose other movements perpendicular                   these radii                        to
coexist, then                                be                                                             of             a to

And the method of testing the possibility of any assumed
system     of movement, or of discovering the conditions which
must be satisfied by the system of movements, will be, to form
the expressions on the right-hand side of these equations, and
to try whether they satisfy the equations which must hold

impart peculiar interest to the inquiry, and render it worthy
of zealous pursuit.
    In the hope, therefore, of promoting an investigation which
appears to me to possess so much interest and importance,                                   I
have recently undertaken a series of additional experiments,
both on the electricity of expanding air, and on that of efflu
ent steam, and         Itrust that the results which I have now to
communicate will be found deserving of attention, and condu
 cive to further discovery.
     These experiments will be treated in the following pages
 under two heads; the first embracing the experiments on ex
 panding air, and the second those on effluent steam.
     In my last communication to the Philosophical Magazine”
I   stated—
     1st, That I had succeeded in producing a powerful elec
 trical development by discharging highly compressed air from
 an insulated receiver of considerable capacity.
     2ndly, That on repeating the experiment a great number
 of times, I found the electricity manifested in the receiver to
 be generally negative, but occasionally positive.
     3rdly, That the intensity of the development had proved
 exceedingly unequal, the receiver having sometimes been so
 highly electrified as to yield a spark a quarter of an inch long,
 while at other times             electricity had been feeble, and that
                                    its
 frequently    I   could detect           no
                                      electricity     all.  at
      4thly, That the electricity         the emitted air had been posi
                                               of

                                          I                it.
      5thly, That      I had more frequently succeeded           producing  in
    an electrical   development     when the receiver was cold, and
 contained        little
                   a     moisture,   than when       was warm and dry.
                                                           it
      Having thus briefly recapitulated what                 have already
                                                                     I

330         Mr. Armstrong on the electrical      Phaenomena
the compressed air, appears to have little tendency to aug
ment the effects.            I
                  This infer from the following experi
ment.
   After thoroughly drying the interior of the receiver I intro
duced a quantity of caustic potash for the purpose of absorb
ing the moisture of the condensed air. I then charged the
receiver, and set it in a cold place, where I allowed it to re
                            j.
main for about twelve hours, to afford sufficient time for the
potash to produce the desired effect.     After this I insulated
the receiver and discharged the air, and found the effects to
be nearly the same as       no precautions were taken to ex
clude moisture.
     Whether the receiver be wet or dry, I find that a rapid
discharge  of the air is indispensable to the production of the
phaenomena.      The    effects are always strongest when the cock
for discharging the air is fully opened; and when by only
partially opening the cock the emission of the air is prolonged
 beyond the period of about a minute, no electricity appears to
 be developed.
    My former experiments, of which the results were so ex
 ceedingly capricious, were made in very frosty weather, but
 those of which    I   am now speaking were made when the
 weather was mild and damp, and were much more uniform in
 their results; but whether the singular fluctuations observed       º
 in the first set of experiments were owing to the state of the
 atmosphere, or to some other cause which has escaped my
 detection, I feel quite unable to say.
    In my latter experiments the electricity of the receiver was
 uniformly negative, and the intensity of the electrical develop
 ment did not vary considerably.     When the receiver was not
insulated, the electricity of the effluent air was always posi
 tive; but when the receiver was supported upon an insulated
stand, it frequently happened, especially if the receiver were
not internally dry, that the gold leaves of the electroscope
connected with the pointed conductor, by which the electri
city was drawn from the jet of air, separated, first with positive
electricity, then closed, and opened with negative electricity.
This effect might, with much probability, be ascribed to the
formation of a conducting communication between the insu
lated receiver and the pointed conductor, by means of watery
particles ejected with the air; only, if this were the case, the
pointed conductor would not retain         its
                                            electricity, as inva
                                                              it
riably does when the receiver    isnot insulated.
    Sometimes the development         of
                                      electricity does not take
place until the air     almost
                       is      wholly   discharged, and then the
pith balls suspended from the receiver, and the gold leaves
of  the electroscope attached    tothe pointed conductor, ab

         attending the Efflux                of condensed Air and Steam.                         831
ruptly start open, the action being accompanied by a peculiar
sound indicating the ejection of drops of water from the tube
through which the air is escaping. It would be a curious fact
if the sound thus occasioned were proved identical with that
which Dr. Schafhaeutl mentions as uniformly accompanying
the development of electricity in his experiments on the
steam evolved from a Marcet boiler.      This sound, however,
often occurs after the electricity has appeared, but it is uni
formly the signal for the electroscope to open when the de
velopment has not previously taken place.     I cannot say that
I  have ever noticed a similar noise in any of my experiments
On Steam.
     I
     am wholly at a loss for an explanation of these singular
phaenomena.   It is well known that a copious precipitation of
vapour, and a greatly accelerated evaporation, are the simul
taneous effects of the sudden dilatation of condensed air in a
receiver—the precipitation being caused by the extreme cold
produced by expansion, and the increased evaporation by the
diminution, which the precipitation occasions, of the quantity
of transparent vapour contained in the air—and to the agency
of these two principles                 I
                            was at first inclined to attribute the
effects in question, conjecturing that the variation in the
kind of electricity developed in the receiver, might be owing
to the predominance, sometimes of evaporation, and some
times of precipitation.      The remarkable influence of heat
and moisture, and the effect of a slow evacuation of the re
ceiver, by which precipitation is known to be prevented, seem
to point out the connexion of the phaenomena with one at least
of the principles I have named; but find so much difficulty      I
in accounting for many of the effects I have recently observed,
by reference to both or either of these causes, or to any other
cause I can think       that am  of,  present unable
                                            I          at form any                    to

of  tests, which gave the same result         every instance.
                                                            in
I     made numerous experiments                            to
                                             ascertain what the con
ditions were under which the transmutation took place, and
am led    to  believe, from the following circumstances, that                                           an

          attending the       Efflur of condensed Air and            Steam.            333
overheated state of that part of the boiler which contains the
steam, is one, at least, of the causes which induce the effect.
It will be readily perceived, that by closing the door of the
stove a considerable increase of temperature would be occa
sioned in the upper part of the boiler where the steam was
lodged, and I found that in almost every instance in which this
was done, the negative electricity of the boiler, and the posi
tive electricity of the steam, began to decline, and continued
so to do until they vanished entirely, and then positive elec
tricity gradually appeared in the boiler, and negative electri
city in the emitted steam.         A diminished state of the water in
the boiler would also, of course, favour the accumulation of
heat in the higher region of the boiler, and such a state of the
water proved to be likewise conducive to the conversion of the
electricities.      I have reason, however, to think that there are
other causes by which a change is effected in the electrical
states of the boiler and steam-cloud; but before any definite
opinion can be formed on this point, I consider further ex
periments to be necessary.
   I   shall now speak of the effects of pressure, first, when the
steam-cloud evolves positive electricity, and secondly, when
it liberates negative electricity.
     In experiments to ascertain the comparative intensity of
 the electricity evolved by steam at different pressures, it is of
 course essential that equal weights of steam, and not equal
 volumes, should be emitted in equal times; and to effect this
 condition it is necessary that the discharging aperture should
 be diminished in the same proportion that the pressure is                              in
 creased, and vice versa.       The safety-valve is in this respect
 a self-regulating apparatus, because it permits an escape of
 steam precisely equal to the production, which, with a uni
 form fire, is the same at              all
                                   pressures.     Another requisite
                                                                                        of in

but under these circumstances                       I
                                       could detect no electrical de
 velopment beyond what was attributable to the combustion of
the fuel, which always produced sufficient electricity in the
evaporating apparatus to affect the gold leaves of the electro
 scope, when a condensing plate was used.              then restored         I
the valve, and when the pressure scarcely exceeded one pound
on the square inch, the gold-leaf electroscope, connected with
the boiler, gave the first indication of electricity distinguish
able from that produced by combustion.             The slightest ad
dition to this pressure caused an excessive increase of electri
city, and at three pounds on the square inch, small sparks
could be drawn from the boiler at the rate of five or six in a
minute. After this each successive equal increase of pressure
produced a less augmentation of electricity than the prece
ding one. I should say that the electricity manifested at three
pounds on the square inch, was not doubled until the press
ure became fifteen pounds per square inch ; not trebled until
it reached fifty pounds; not quadrupled until it was raised to
 120 pounds; and that when the pressure was augmented to
250 pounds on the inch, which was as high as ventured to                          I

         The lowest pressure at which I could detect positive elec
     tricity in the boiler, was much the same as that at which ne
     gative electricity first appeared; and an increase of pressure,
     as far as about thirty pounds on the inch, augmented the          in
     tensity of the development in the same ratio, apparently, as
     when the boiler was negative; but further additions to the
     load on the valve were attended with very variable results,
     sometimes increasing, and sometimes diminishing the electri
     city. The most remarkable circumstance, however, was that a
     considerable increase of pressure always produced in the first
     instance a temporary recurrence to negative electricity in the
     boiler, which lasted for a minute or two, and then again
     gave place to positive electricity.      I suspect that this curious
     effect is occasioned by the steam and water acquiring an          in
     creased temperature more rapidly than the metal of the upper
     part of the boiler, so that when the boiling point correspond
     ing to the load on the valve is again attained, the metal in
     contact with the steam is not at first hot enough to reverse the
     natural electrical state of the boiler.      Ifthis view of the sub
    ject be correct, it follows that the degree of heat which is ne
     cessary in the metal to render the boiler positively electrified,
    has reference to the boiling point of the water, and the tem
     perature of the steam.
        When the pressure was considerable, the tendency to ne
    gative electricity in the steam-cloud was greatly increased by
    passing the steam through the copper pipe acted upon by the
     fire; so much so indeed, that I could frequently obtain a jet
     of steam negatively electrified from the pipe, at the same time
     that a jet of steam positively electrified was escaping from the
     valve.   At low pressures, however, the effect of passing the
     steam through the pipe was rather the reverse of what I have
    mentioned, and    I   therefore scarcely know whether to regard
    the result as favourable or adverse to the agency which              I
    have ascribed to heated metal.
        By much the most powerful effects were obtained when
    the steam was discharged through a short glass tube inserted
    in the boiler. When the tube was long a considerable con
    densation took place within        it,
                                         which greatly diminished the
º   electricity of   the jet.    The  electricity  was seldom so   strong
    when the boiler was positive, and the steam-cloud negative,
    as   when they were        the opposite and usual states.

                                       or
    evinced  by   the electricity of the jet not being abated     bypass
    ing the steam through the copper pipe, which was ten feet
    long, and only three-eighths        of   an
                                             inch  in diameter.

336         On the Electricity of effluent                       Air    and Steam.
    The superior intensity of the electrical development which
accompanies the emission of high-pressure steam, and the fact
of the upper or distended portion of the jet being more highly
electrified than the lower or unexpanded part, seem to favour
the supposition that the evolution of electricity in the steam
cloud depends upon the dilatation of the steam.                      I have al
ready adduced, in former communications, reasons for reject
ing this hypothesis; but feeling anxious to remove                        doubt                   all
upon the subject,         I resorted        the following method

produced the development                electricity, the steam would have

                               in
 its electricity     passing through the holes, and thus the steam
                    in

 think is inevitable, that the electricity which is excited in the
 evaporating vessel on the emission of steam, is independent
 of concomitant evaporation.        I should observe, that the elec
 tricity which appeared in the boiler after, as well as shortly
 before, the exhaustion of the water, was uniformly positive.
     Under these circumstances,                               I
                                        think there are certainly
grounds for supposing that the same cause which excites
 electricity in the steam-cloud, produces also the contrary elec
 tricity of the boiler; but if this be so, am not aware that there      I
is any known principle upon which the effects can be ex
plained, especially as the electricity of the boiler appears
 quite independent of the proximity of the jet.
    The transmutation which, under certain conditions, takes
 place in the electrical states of the boiler and steam-cloud, is
a part of the subject embarrassed with difficulty.              What
possible change can the steam undergo in the boiler, either
 by contact with heated metal, or otherwise, which can cause
it to evolve, on                     its
                          subsequent condensation, the opposite
electricity      that which

In his reply he modestly states that he had no design of doing
this, “being, as you will at once perceive, no               person for                      fit

840                      Mr. W. Kemp          on the Moraines
Gala house (see No. 2, A.), in a fine sheltered situation, where
the vale extends to the south for a considerable distance, at
a lateral opening between the hills.
   Nearly parallel with the Gala there is a lateral moraine,
which divides the town from Gala house and parks, and be
hind that there is a series of beautifully formed mounds,
ranging nearly parallel one with another. These are not con
tinuous, although some parts are of considerable length: one,
called the long knoll, being about 700 feet long, of a serpent
ine form, averaging 35 feet high; others are like small hil
locks, from 20 to 40 feet high, with narrow trough-like val
leys between. To use a simile, I thought, while examining
these interesting relics, that to convey the clearest conception
of that place, would be to imagine portions of the rolling waves
of a troubled sea to be instantly arrested in their course, while
the intervening parts passed onward for a little space, and
  were then likewise immovably fixed.
    Such seems to have been the action of glaciers in the vale
 of Galashiels, as to have scooped out the basin in some places
 to an unknown depth, which had afterwards been filled up by
 impalpable sedimentary sand, over which there is a covering
 of gravel varying from four to six feet deep, so that a great
 part of the town may literally be said to be built upon a quick
 sand”.
    There are many lateral moraines along the valley of the
 Tweed; but the only remarkable terminal ones I have yet
 observed, are two, one at Dryburgh, the other at Holilee.
 The first is upon the Dryburgh side of the river, and memo

LVII.    An Examination of the Phaenomena of Conical Re
  Jraction in Biaval Crystals. By R. Potter, Esq., B.A.”
THE      verification of the two species of conical refraction,
      which were discovered by Sir William Hamilton to be
results of Fresnel's analytical expression for the wave surface
in biaxal crystals, forms an epoch in the progress of the
conversion of the scientific world to a belief of the undula
tory theory of light. Many waverers were confirmed in their
belief by so singular a coincidence of theory and experiment;
and Professor Lloyd, who made the experiments, had a har
vest of reputation from them, such as is seldom reaped in the
field     of science.
     I joinedwith the scientific world, in the confidence which
it gave   to Professor Lloyd's investigations; and although                               I
had seen the undulatory theory fail in so many important
cases, yet I believed that the true law of refraction in biaxal
crystals had been discovered by Fresnel, as certainly as that
of uniaxal crystals has been by Huyghens; but in both cases
from wrong premises.      It was from a desire to view these                         in
teresting phaenomena, that I availed myself of an opportunity
are sometimes found in the rock, but in places remote from running waters,
and where the form of the surface will not permit us to suppose that any
cascade could ever have existed.          In other cases, a long, sinuous, dry,
water-worn gutter or channel is observed, the course of which runs across
instead of along the natural declivity of the ground.            The study of the
glaciers has enabled Agassiz to find a key to these enigmatical phaenomena,
which had perplexed previous inquirers.          Streams of water flow along the
surface of a glacier, and when one of these falls into a fissure which is open
to the bottom, if it forms a cascade, it cuts a round cavity in the rock with
the gravel and sand which it either finds there or carries down with                it,   as
some      ofour rivulets work out the hollows termed caldrons.               the gla

of purchasing       some crystals of arragonite, in order to have
 pieces of larger dimensions than I possessed before, and which
 from perusing Professor Lloyd's paper, in the seventeenth
 volume of the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy”, I
 conceived to be necessary.            The prepossession I had con
 ceived in favour of Fresnel's       law,  as expressed in the equation
 to the wave surface in such crystals, was, however, changed
 into distrust, when I was enabled to observe the phaenomena.
 I  employed a different mode of experimenting from Professor
 Lloyd, on commencing; and possessed more confidence in the
 properties of an eye-lens. Such a lens exhibits to the sight
 what takes place at the focus of the eye and the lens, as an
 optical combination, when there is a real image; and when
 there is a virtual image, it is exhibited such as would have
 really arisen if the rays of light in falling upon the eye-lens
 had proceeded in a similar manner from a real image.                  The
 transition from a virtual to a real image, and vice versä, occa
 sions no difficulty; for both arise from the form of the pencil
                                                                          is,
 of rays, as it falls on the eye-lens; which               fact, the thing

to the optic axis, I found it on emergence giving the ring and
central spot. In this experiment the angle of the incident
cone was rather more than 4'.
   In this experiment the light was reduced to a small pencil
by apertures in thin metal plates, but I have seen the same
phaenomena when the incident pencil arose from a luminous
point formed by a lens of short focus, at some distance from
the crystal. The results of Professor Lloyd's method of ex
perimenting were, that in the first instance he found the angle
of the emergent cone about double what the calculation                                             from
theory gave, but by reducing the diameter of the aperture on
the second surface this observed angle was reduced also;
until with a very minute aperture an approximation to the
calculated angle was obtained; and a hollow cone was seen,
as required, in place of a solid cone, which appeared in the
 first instance.
    It appears, that in order to obtain any tolerable approxi
mation to the calculated quantities, an aperture was required
to be applied to the second surface, so as to cut off              the ring            all
and    a  large   portion          of

very small; for then, when we desire to obtain the ring with
 maximum distinctness, we can see, that as one portion of it
 becomes more distinct the other becomes less so, on varying

     A popular explanation of the formation of the ring, and
 consequently of the two series of cones, may be thus given:
 any physical point being taken in the small hole on the first
 surface of the crystal, it will have two images polarized in
 planes at right angles to each other; these are two points at
 the extremities of some diameter of the ring; and every other
 point having similarly two images, the locus of                these images           all
 forms the ring. Speaking more correctly,                             call            if       we        E.

fications of secondary action due to the presence of hydro
carbon. In short, as respects voltaic agency, an alcoholic so
lution may be regarded as an aqueous one, in which a foreign
substance is present retarding the principal action, but afford
ing an additional source of secondary agency.
   Accordingly, when the alcoholic solution of an ordinary
salt is acted on, the acid and alkali go to their proper
poles, as in an aqueous solution, but much more slowly, and
the hydrogen of the water of the alcohol is evolved at the
  negative pole, whilst the oxygen enters into secondary
  combination.     When the base is of easy reduction, metal re
  duced   by  hydrogen    appears at the negative; whatever sub
  stance is dissolved,  if it is not of a nature to afford room for a
  secondary action with hydrogen, that element is given off in
 the same proportion as from water, due regard being had to
  some circumstances connected with the conducting power of
  the solution which have been formerly pointed out".             This
  fact was verified for alcoholic solutions of alkalies, haloid
 salts, and oxyacid salts.
     It was also found, by experiments similar to those with
  aqueous solutions of hydracids and haloid salts, that when
  iodine appears at the positive pole in alcoholic solutions of
  hydriodic acid or of iodides, it is due to secondary action.
  Absolute alcohol was charged with dry hydriodic acid gas, and
  placed in A, fig. 2, (p. 243) and water in B and C, A being
  made negative, and C positive by seventy pairs of four-inch
 plates. Effervescence soon arose from both poles, but no disco
 loration was anywhere observed, nor acid in B or C until after
 the lapse of twenty minutes, when a slight brown discoloration
 from liberated iodine commenced in C with acid reaction.
 In half an hour the battery was reversed, when the hydriodic
 solution was instantly discoloured without elastic fluid from
 the pole in that solution, and with effervescence from the
 other.    This experiment would of course have had more ana
 logy to those with water, if B and C had contained alcohol;
 but the feeble conducting power of that liquid, and the risk
 of interfering with the reactions if any substance was dissolved
 in  it,prevented     its
                       employment.          }. appearances are, how
 ever, best explained        on
                              the view that the water  of  the alcohol
only suffers direct decomposition.
    Analogous experiments led          to the same view in   regard   to
iodides.
    The appearances with           positive pole
                                   a             of  zinc led    to the
same conclusion.            Whensaturated solution

                   absolute alcohol was thus acted          on   by

vescence at the positive.             The de
position of oxide at that pole is in
conformity with the view of the direct
decomposition of water.
   With a similar solution of dry
chloride of lithium, oxide of zinc soon
separated at the negative pole, with effervescence from that
pole, but none from the positive; and it was somewhat uncer
tain whether any separation of oxide took place at the positive:
but little doubt could exist that the oxide originated, as in the
case of iodide of potassium, by the action of oxygen of the
water of the alcohol on the zinc, and was subsequently dis
solved and transferred to the negative pole.
    The principal condition of the deposition of oxide of zinc
at the positive pole, whether in aqueous or alcoholic solutions,
 appears to be a pretty rapid formation, from brisk action;
and the less powerful the acid, and the less                 quantity drawn  its

direct decomposition of the muriatic acid by the voltaic cur
rent; for when I recollect that pure aether resisted very power
ful voltaic currents, and that even potash, which has so won
derful an effect in promoting the galvanic decomposition of
the water in absolute alcohol, did not make aether more sus
ceptible of electric agency, I cannot allow myself to suppose
that the decomposition in the case of an aethereal solution of
a hydracid is that of water entering into the constitution
of aether, but adhere to the original view, that aether con
tains no water, and that alcohol consists of aether and of
Water.
    IV.   On the state in which the Haloid Salts are dissolved by
 Water and Alcohol.-The question whether haloid salts are
dissolved by water as such, or decompose it and assume the
state of hydracid salts, is one on which chemists are still              di
vided. The action of voltaic electricity on such solutions
appears to me to decide the matter: during such action it is
frequently difficult, particularly in the case of iodides, to ob
serve any acid reaction at the positive pole, when both poles
 are plunged directly into the solution, on account of the re
ducing action of oxygen on the acid formed; and even in
 those cases in which acid is observed, that circumstance will
 not of itself prove the haloid to be dissolved as a hydracid
 salt, because it might be held that acid is formed by secondary
action at the negative pole, from whence it is drawn to the
positive.    In this way only, on the hypothesis of solution as
a haloid, and direct voltaic decomposition of water alone, can
 the separation of reduced metal at the negative pole be ac
 counted for.     A doubt might also exist whether the acid re
 action at the pole might not arise from an oxyacid formed by
 secondary action at the positive.      All such objections are,
 however, obviated by placing the poles beyond the solution,
 so as to get quit of secondary actions; and if in such circum
 stances we can show that the acid and the base go to their
 proper poles, and that this acid is a hydracid, we have, I con
 ceive, sufficient evidence that the salt has been dissolved as a
 hydracid salt; for even laying aside for a moment the experi
 ments by which I have endeavoured to show that the haloids,
  if existing as such in water, are not directly decomposed,
 let us take the different views of the nature of the galvanic
 action which suggest themselves when both poles are plunged
 into the solution in the ordinary manner, and consider them
  on the supposition that haloids are dissolved as such.             First,
  let us suppose that one or other of the two substances, water
  or haloid, it matters not which, is decomposed, it is evident
  that we cannot account for the producti              : acid        where

  In regard to sal-ammoniac,

                                      found that it was resolved
               alkali in the above circumstances, a result
showing that in solution at least it is simple muriate of an
monia, and cannot justly be regarded as chloride of ammonium.
The     same  reasoning above applied to the results with com
mon    haloids,  can be readily extended to the hypothetical
chloride of ammonium; and to complete the evidence on this
         I
point, found that a solution of muriate of ammonia yielded
the definite quantity of hydrogen from the negative pole.
   The experiments with a positive zinc pole lead to the same
result, at least when taken in conjunction with those showing
that the haloids, if viewed as existing as such in solution, are
not directly decomposed. The oxide of zinc which is dis
solved ...} transferred, must have been taken up by acid
which had been previously drawn to the positive side.
   The analogy of the action with a positive zinc pole in     al
coholic solutions of haloid salts, as formerly described, leads
by similar reasoning to the view, that in moderately strong so
lutions of that description also, such as that of chloride of     li
thium, iodide of potassium, and moderately saturated alco
holic solutions of chloride of calcium, the haloid decomposes
the water of the alcohol, and exists in solution as an oxysalt.
 Many phaenomena of the voltaic action on such solutions will
 thus receive a more ready explanation than on the idea of
these salts being dissolved as haloids; such as the appearance
of alkalies and earths at the negative pole, which will thus re
 sult directly from the decomposition of a hydracid, instead of
supposing the secondary action of the hydrogen and reaction
 of the metal on water.
    We cannot easily get the same evidence on this subject by
 the method applied to aqueous solutions, of placing the poles
 in water beyond the solution, because, from the inferior con
 ducting power of the alcoholic solution, less acid will be se
 parated if it truly exist in the liquid, and we cannot distin
guish whether it may not come from the point of junction of
the alcoholic solution with the water in which the poles are
placed.
   If alcohol dissolves haloid salts as hydracid salts, there can
be little doubt that pyroxylic spirit does the same:     I incline
to think that the greater solvent powers of the latter fluid than
the former in regard to some substances, such as barytes, are
due to       its
             greater absolute quantity     of
                                           water, although not
greater atomic proportion.

                 Conducting Powers    of Solutions.          36 l
bestowed on water by dissolved substances is exactly propor
tional to the degree of chemical change under voltaic action re
sulting from the dissolved body, there seems in every instance
in which increased conducting power is bestowed some chemical
change, or at least voltaic transference, attending the increase
of conduction. This chemical change may result either from
the direct action of the current or from secondary agencies;
and both circumstances lend their aid, where they occur, in
augmenting conducting power.
   In the case of salts the voltaic separation of acid and alkali
at once explains the result, and in many of such cases we have
an additional effect from secondary action at one or both
poles.
    Acids alone in solution, as is now generally known, and as
I  have myself verified experimentally for sulphuric acid and
the hydracids, undergo transference to their proper pole,
which circumstance appears to be the principal cause of their
promoting conduction.        In some instances secondary action
at the  poles  also contributes to the result.
    To ascertain whether alkalies have a similar action by suf
 fering transference, a moderately strong solution of caustic
potash was placed in a tube B", connected by asbestus moist
ened with distilled water, with two tubes, A and C, containing
 the latter fluid, A being made negative, and C positive by
seventy-two pairs of four-inch plates.           The whole tubes
 were covered with a close glass covering, a piece of turmeric
paper having been introduced into the liquids A and C be
tween the asbestus and the poles. In a few minutes alkali was
indicated at the negative pole, and went on increasing during
half an hour, whilst the test paper in C was not discoloured,
showing that the effect in A was not owing to capillary action.
 The experiment was then stopped, when the water in A, al
 though not alkaline to test paper throughout, became de
 cidedly so by concentration, whilst that in C showed no alkali
 even after concentration.
    In the experiments also already detailed, in which acid and
 alkali were separately drawn to the poles in distilled water
 from saline solutions, the alkali usually reached the pole as
 soon as the acid.
    There can thus be no doubt, that by voltaic action, the alkali
 in an aqueous solution is transferred to the negative pole.
    Water coloured by bromine gives sensibly more efferves
 cence under galvanic action, showing a superior conducting
 power of the solution.
    The manner in which such simple substances increase the

 conducting power of water requires a little investigation.
 Chlorine, bromine, and iodine are generally admitted to be
 non-conductors themselves; and even if a little doubt may
 exist as to iodine in a state of fusion, it is scarcely possible that
 the minute quantity in an aqueous solution -
                                                      can operate in
 that way.
    To ascertain whether such substances were capable of
 transference in solution, an aqueous solution of bromine, with
 a little undissolved bromine at the bottom, to maintain a state
 of saturation, was placed in the tube B, the arrangement being
  in  allother respects the same                the last-described experi

  É.   connecting the rules regulating the voltaic decomposi
tion of solutions and the transference of substances held dis
solved, we observe that no substance, when in a state of trans
ference, suffers direct voltaic decomposition.   Acids and                              al
kalies suffer  transference, but not direct decomposition.  On
the other hand, salts, whether oxyacid or hydracid, are not
transferred, but are resolved into their constituent acid and
alkali.
      We cannot, however,                  say that every substance which
                                                               is
not transferred is directly decomposed. Thus we can hardly
doubt that such compounds as bromide of iodine do not suffer
voltaic transference, seeing that their constituent elements are
not transferred; and we have further seen that this combina
tion is not directly decomposed in solution.       Probably also
some cases of chlorides exist, in which, from peculiarity of
atomic constitution, or other circumstances, there is neither
transference nor direct decomposition.

     GENTLEMEN,

the plan of your publication, I am induced to send you a

                                                                                        in

and   conversely,  some     our   simple
                                     of   consonants are used                            to
represent compound sounds, while others are used             differ          on
ent occasions      the representatives
                        as                               of
                                            more than one simple
 or compound sound.
  *   Long after these experiments were made and conclusions drawn,
observed that M. Becquerel had also found that bromine and iodine                       in I
solution unite with hydrogen under voltaic action.—Institut, Juin, 1840.

3G4.              Mr. H. Wedgwood      on the  Natural
    The letter C has in    some situations the pronunciation of K,
in others of S, and may therefore be considered superfluous in
a system of which the object is the arrangement of sounds alone.
The    same may be said of Q, which is only used       in combina
tion with U, to represent the sound        KW;     and of X, which
is pronounced GS, or KS.
    The sound of S in leisure, pleasure, or of Z in azure, is a
simple articulation, identical with the French pronunciation
of the letter  J,   but having no exact representative in the  En
glish alphabet, in which the sound of        J or G soft is a com
bination of the last-mentioned sound with a D immediately
preceding.
    The simple sounds expressed by double letters are those
of SH ;    TH    in thin, and TH in then, and NG in bring, hang.
    In addition to the foregoing, the guttural articulations
GH, CH, which we do not possess in English, are also simple
sounds. Of these, the former is very common in Dutch (in
which it is the pronunciation         both of G and CH) and
Gaelic; the latter in German and Lowland Scotch.
    The following, then, will be found to be a complete list of
 the simple consonantal sounds arranged according to the or
gan employed in their pronunciation.
      º
    Gutturals: K, G, NG, CH, GH, H, pronounced by a
constriction of the upper part of the throat and base of the
tongue.
               P, B, M, F, V, W, pronounced by the motion of
  |
the  lips.
    Dentals:   T, D, N, TH (in thick), TH (in this), L, pro
nounced     by  the pressure of the front of the tongue against the
teeth or front of the palate.
    Palatals: S, Z, R, SH,     J  (French), Y, pronounced (as it
appears to me) by the pressure of the sides of the tongue
against the palate, leaving a passage for the air more or less
free through the middle.
    The first relation of which we shall take notice between
sounds of the same organic class in the foregoing arrange
ment, is that which distinguishes the classes of Tenues and
 Medials, as they are commonly called; for which, however,
a more characteristic appellation would be spirants and
sonants, respectively; inasmuch as the former class are pro
nounced by a mere expiration not falling within the musical
scale; the latter, by a fundamental note of the vocal instru
ment, the organic articulation being in other respects the
same in corresponding consonants of either class.
    The consonants commonly arranged under the heads of
Tenues and Medials, are the following only       :-

  It could      not, however, altogether escape notice, that the                                            fol
lowing sounds stood in precisely the same relation to each
other:—

     Chemists.      By Messrs. W. FRANCIs and H. C.RoPT.
                        [Continued from p. 293.]
             Benzoënitric and Cinnamomitric Acids.
  N the Annalen der Pharmacie, vol. xxx. p. 341, is a paper
   on Balsam of Peru, by Plantamour, in which a peculiar acid
is mentioned, viz. the carbobenzoic; in vol. xxxiv. p. 297, is
a treatise by Mulder on the benzoënitric acid; and in the
Journal fir Praktischen Chemie, vol. xxii. p. 193, one by Mit
scherlich on cinnamonitric acid.   These three papers are so
intimately related that it is better not to separate them at all,
but to consider them in one report.
    When benzoic acid is boiled with excess of nitric acid, it dis
solves and colours the fluid red; binoxide of nitrogen is given
off.   The development of gas ceases after boiling for several
hours, and the solution becomes colourless.            From the cold
solution    crystals similar to benzoic acid are deposited, the
fluid eventually becomes one solid crystalline mass, from which
the benzoënitric       acid may be extracted by boiling water
 (Mulder).      According   to Mitscherlich, the evolution of bin
oxide of nitrogen is accidental; it arises from the action of
nitric acid on the already formed benzoënitric acid; it is
therefore not necessary to boil the fluid for any length of
time.
    The same acid is produced by the action of nitric acid
on several substances which have been said to be converted
into benzoic acid by nitric acid.       Some substances first form
benzoic acid, as is the case with cinnamic acid and oil of
cinnamon when treated with dilute acid.             Plantamour did
not discover the     mitrogen  in this acid : he   gave  the formula
 Cls Hio Os; Mulder and Mitscherlich’s formula is C14 Hs O4
 + Nº O', or Cl* Ho O. Nº — He O.
     This acid separates from water as a crystalline mass, it is
 easily soluble in boiling water, and if there is not sufficient to dis
 solve it all, an oleaginous substance is formed which is heavier
 than water; benzoic acid has the same property. At 10°C. 400
 parts of water dissolve one part of the acid, at 100° ten parts.
 It is easily soluble in alcohol and aether; melts at 127°, and
 begins to sublime at 110°; the pure acid sublimes unchanged;
 chlorine has no action on       it. Benzoënitric acid       not easily

  then contains       acid which gives      soluble salt with baryta.

warmed give off nitrobenzid.       The potash salt crystallizes
in acicular   crystals, and, by heating  gives much nitrobenzid;
the soda salt is deliquescent (Mulder), easily crystallizable
(Mitscherlich). The ammonia salt easily loses ammonia and
forms a bisalt.    The lime salt is acicular, and contains two
atoms of    water,  which are driven off at 190°. The baryta
salt loses four atoms of water at 100°.     The strontia salt loses
two atoms and a half at 130°.       When acid nitrobenzoate of
ammonia is dropped into a solution of sulphate of zinc, a ge
latinous basic salt is formed, the filtered solution gives lamel
lular crystals, C*H* Nº O' + ZnO + 5 Aq. The basic salt
contains four atoms of base to one of acid. The manganese
salt crystallizes with one atom of water. The copper salt is
a blue powder soluble in hot water; contains one atom of
water. There are two salts of lead, a simple benzoënitrate
and a benzoënitrate, 5 (C++H" O' N* + PbO) + Pb O. The
silver salt is partly soluble in water, gives much nitrobenzid
when carefully heated, &c. &c. (Mulder).
     The cinnamonitric acid is formed by adding pulverized cin
namic acid to strong nitric acid; the temperature must not rise
above 60°. The cinnamic acid is at first dissolved, the mix
ture soon becomes hot, and a crystalline substance separates;
 it is washed with water, dissolved in and crystallized from al
cohol.    It is white with a trace of yellow, melts at 270°;
heated above 270° it boils and is decomposed.        Almost inso
luble in boiling water. At 20° is soluble in 327 parts of al
cohol, and by this property may be easily separated from other
acids. Cinnamic acid is soluble in 4-2 parts, benzoic in 1.96,

    Cinnamonitric acid, when boiled with        small quantity                     of
water, does not form the oily body mentioned above;                                is
somewhat soluble         boiling hydrochloric acid without de
                                in
composition.              Its
                    salts with the alkalies are easily soluble; the
other salts are either difficultly soluble               or
                                                   insoluble.   The
potash and soda salts form verrucous crystals; when           excess         an
of potash    added
                 is      the potash salt, prismatic crystals are
                                to
obtained.   The ammonia salt decomposes like the benzoate.
Of the others the magnesia salt the most soluble. These
      all                                          is
salts explode.

   Several acids of similar composition give crystallizable
aethers; the most beautiful is that of benzoënitric acid
(C. H." O, C*H* Nº O'). The following crystallize well:
picrinnitrate and anisinnitrate of aethyloxide, and the benzoë
nitrate of methyloxide.
   Cinnamic acid may be very easily distinguished from ben
zoic acid by the formation of the cinnamonitric acid. The for
mula is Cls H* Nº Oz, or Cl*Hi! O + Nº Oy           Hº O. The                                  –
uncombined acid is C18H4+. Nº O”.
       If more
             than one part of cinnamic acid is added to eight
parts  of nitric acid, the temperature rises above 60°, and ben
zoënitric and another, as yet unexamined, acid are formed.
The crystallized acid (benzoënitric) contains one atom of
water, according to Mulder; he calls it “acide nitroben
zique:” benzoënitric is more applicable.
    Cinnamic acid does not combine with sulphuric acid as
benzoic acid does.       By distilling cinnamic acid with lime,
carbonate of lime and carbon remain béhind, and the product
is a mixture of several substances; it smells like benzin, but
is fluid under 0°; it perhaps contains some benzin, but is
certainly a mixture.      The same is the case with the products
obtained by passing camphor and              cinnamon through        oil      of                                  a

  380         Mr. Weaver's View of Ehrenberg's Observations
    In   the preceding Table we see that of the forty-three genera
   of   Zoocorallia,   there are eight which are found fossil; the
   living species amount to 151, of which fifty-four exist in the
   Red Sea, and forty-nine of these have been observed by the
   author, five remaining unproved.            Of the forty-three genera
   of Phytocorallia there are        twenty-seven    which are found fos
   sil; the living species amount to 235, of which sixty-six exist
   in the Red Sea, and sixty-one of these have been observed by
                                                                                                in is,
   the author, five remaining unproved.            The general result
   that out     eighty-six genera
                of                        Anthozoa, thirty-five occur
                                                     of
   the fossil state; and that          386 known living species
                                             of                                           of   An
   thozoa, 120 exist          the Red Sea,

                                                 which 110 species were
   observed         by
                  the author. The same Table also shows that                                    of
   the seventeen families               of
                                   known Coral animals, thirteen exist
       the Red Sea, while four are wholly wanting, namely, those
 of in Pennatulina, Hydrina, Tubularina and Alloporina.                 The
  total number        known living species comprised
                         of                                    each family      in
      also given,        as

 inis the Red Sea.
      The 120 species          Anthozoa existing
                                   of                   the Red Sea thus

                                             in

      Of the known      living  Corals there are eight genera peculiar
 to    the Red Sea, namely, Megalactis, Thalassianthus?, Epi

   6. The chalk beds of the South of Europe, around the ba
sin of the Mediterranean, are distinguished from those of the
north and east of Europe by numerous well-preserved chalk
animalcules, and less numerous inorganic laminae; while in
the north and east of Europe these relations are reversed:#.
   7. In the South of Europe the beds of marl which alternate
with the chalk consist of siliceous shells of Infusoria, and flints
are wanting; while in the North of Europe beds of flint al
ternate with the chalk, and marls with Infusoria are wanting.
This exchange of character tends to explain the peculiar re
lation of flint to chalk, indicating that the pulverulent sili
ceous particles of Infusoria have been converted into compact
nodules of flint.
    8. It has been lately remarked that the chalk which con
tains flints is deficient in numerous siliceous Infusoria, when
compared with the Bilin slaty Tripel or polishing slate (Po
lirschiefer) containing semi-opal; but this deficiency now dis
appears, and a rich substitute takes                  its
                                              place, the Infusoria                             in
the North        Europe having been employed
                    of                                 the formation     in

portion of the sand of the Libyan Desert has been proved to
consist of such grains.       It is only in Nubia above Syene that
the desert sand becomes a pure detritus of granite *.
    11. In the various countries of the earth in which occur white
and earthy, as well as coloured and compact rocks, composed
of microscopic calcareous animalcules, the genera and species
of these animalcules present so striking an agreement with
those of the white chalk of Rügen, that they may well be
deemed characteristic of one and the same period of geolo
gical formation. It cannot be asserted for a certainty that
the same forms have been observed any where elset.
    12. In the beds subjacent to and more ancient than the
chalk, namely, in those of the Oolite or Jura limestone for
mation, we have also clear evidence of the existence of other
microscopic Polythalamia. These, however, are such as have
not hitherto been found anywhere in the chalk.
    13. The early assertion that all limestone was the produce
 of animalst, though resting on no sufficient foundation, and
 therefore justly held in slight regard by modern geologists,
yet now deserves every attention, since it clearly appears that
a limestone formation widely extended on the surface of the
earth is composed of microscopic animals, visibly converted
in a gradual manner into inorganic chalk and compact lime
 stone.    If similar phaenomena appear also in the Jura lime
 stone  formation,    and should become still further confirmed,
 these considerations (combined with the long-known existence
of coarser corals and shells in both formations) tend to show

    The Memoir is     accompanied     by four Plates”, presented with
the view of facilitating a comparison between the organic re

those of still living bodies visible to the naked eye.
    Thus the first three Plates exhibit recent small bodies natu

fourth Plate may be readily associated.
    The first three Plates serve also to elucidate the true nature
of the Polythalamia (hitherto mistaken), showing their greater
affinity to the Bryozoa (Flustra) than to                     other animal         all

       Plate IV. contains the invisible animalcules of the chalk
   and chalk marl, displayed in twelve specimens of rock; 1 to 9
   being portions from the chalk, and 10 to 12 from the chalk
   marl, magnified 300 times. In these specimens the calcare
   ous Polythalamia amount to sixteen species, and the siliceous
   Infusoria to twelve species, with siliceous spicula of sponges.

                                            §n.

   chalk; namely, 1. from Puszkary, in               opposite Grod
   no, from the shore of the Memel; 2. from Jütland, in Den

  mass of Hamam Faraún in Sinai, Arabia; chalk marl, No.
   10, from Oran in Africa; No. 11, from Caltasinetta in Sicily;
  No. 12, from Greece.
      In the general table indicated above, under the head of No.
  13 of the contents of the memoir, a list is given of the princi
  pal forms of the invisible organic bodies which constitute
  the rocks from which the twelve above-mentioned specimens
  were taken, as well as the chalk of Brighton, the chalk marl
 of Zante in the Ionian Islands, and the nummulite limestone
 of the Pyramids of Geza in Egypt. From this it results that
  the principal forms in these rocks consist of twenty-five spe
  cies of calcareous-shelled Polythalamia, thirty-nine species of
  siliceous-shelled Infusoria, seven species of soft-shelled Infu
  soria of the flints, and five species of siliceous plants.
      The twenty-five species of calcareous-shelled Polythalamia,
  belonging to eight genera, are the following:—
      Flustrella concentrica; Globigerina bulloides?, G. helicina 2:
  Planulina sicula, P. *turgida; Robulina cretacea; Rosalina
 ºfoveolata, R. globularis?, R. *lacvigata, R. pertusa; Rotalia

  R. stigma; Textularia aciculata?, T. *aspera, T. brevis, T.
 *dilatata, T. *globulosa, T. perforata, T. spinosa, T. *striata;
 Turbinulina italica?        Quinqueloculina? from Benisuef, is
 doubtful.      N.B. Tertularia globulosa, when in fragments, is
 not easily distinguished from Rotalia globulosa; and in like
 manner the fragments of Teatularia perforata may be con
 founded with Rotalia perforata.

cannot avoid recognizing a similarity of relations; and the
thinly laminated marly beds with impressions of fishes,
between Caltasinetta and Castrogiovanni, which Hoffmann
refers with certainty to the chalk formation, correspond to the
similar beds which occur near Oran, but which were said to
be tertiary.        And the parallel is confirmed by the micro

   Both the nummulite limestone of the pyramids of Geza on

belonging to the chalk.      In Egypt it possesses no great ex

                                           Geological Society.                                      399
intermediate between the carboniferous and Silurian systems. Should
such a group exist on the continent, then would the Devonian sy
stem be established, not merely on plausible arguments derived from
its suite of fossils, but also on the more direct evidence of natural
sections.
  With these views the authors endeavoured (1.) to ascertain the
natural descending order of the formations on the right bank of
the Rhine, between the Westphalian coal-field and the chain of the
Taunus. (2). To ascertain the same order in Belgium, and among
the ancient rocks on the left bank of the Rhine, north of the Hunds
ruck.
   In the course of the summer they also made (with similar objects)
several traverses through the Hartz, and one long traverse from the
Thuringerwald to the north flank of the Fichtelgebirge, in the hope
of bringing into relation with their previous observations, the country
which has become so celebrated from the labours of Count Munster.
   The authors follow this order in the descriptive parts of their
paper.    But before commencing their detailed sections, they explain
at some length the method of determining the order of superposition
among rocks, like those of Belgium and the Rhenish provinces,
which are not only much contorted, but often in a reversed position.
This order of superposition can be made out only by sections, which
are of two kinds, vertical and horizontal.      Vertical sections, where
the strata are not inverted, not only indicate the natural group of
strata, but their true order of superposition, both of which may often
be ascertained on a single line of traverse.    But horizontal sections,
showing the intersection of successive groups of strata with the ac
tual surface of the country (and represented by the colours of a
geological map), can only be examined by following the lines of
strike.    The colours of such a section (if derived from strata origin
ally conformable) must show the masses, however contorted, in their
true juxtaposition.       Hence we may define from the horizontal sec
tions of a country a true consecutive geological series; and if the
relative age of any two contiguous terms be known, the relative age
of    allthe other members                   of
                                   the section may         inferred with cer  be

  the descending order is unequivocal.         The passage downwards is
  sometimes effected by flagstones, with bands of shale, containing
  thin calcareous courses. In other places, the shales are more abun
  dant, occasionally becoming much indurated; and in the range
                                                                        to
  wards the north-east (for example, near Meschede) this group be
  comes greatly expanded, and contains many quarries of roofing-slate,
  with a true oblique cleavage. This part of the series is compared
  with the shales under the Eifel limestone, and with the Wissenbach
  slates, which underlie the Devonian limestone series of Dillenburg.
  The great difference in the development of this group produces a
  great difference in the fossils, but on the whole, they are regarded
 as forming a passage between the Devonian and Silurian types.           A
 list of fossils is subjoined, and the authors regard the numerous Go
 niatites as rather connecting the group with the overlying Devonian
 rocks; while the trilobites and orthoceratites, &c., some of
                                                                    which
 cannot perhaps be distinguished from known Silurian fossils, seem
 to link it to the Silurian system.
     Below the preceding comes a group of vast thickness, composed
 of earthy schistose beds, passing on one hand into shale, on the other
 into coarse slate, and alternating indefinitely with bands of psammite,
 sometimes passing into coarse arenaceous flagstone, sometimes into
 thick beds of sandstone. Nearly throughout are occasional obscure
 vegetable impressions, and in the upper part are courses of
                                                                     lime
stone and calcareous bands, with innumerable impressions of fossils.
 In the lower part, the limestone bands seem gradually to disappear,
 and the whole passes into a formation of graywacke and graywacke
slate, in some rare instances producing a good roofing-slate.
                                                                For many
miles south of the undisturbed range of the lower Westphalia lime
stone, the prevailing dip is about north-north-west.
                                                             The country
round Siegen is regarded as a kind of dome of elevation, composed
of the lower part of this series; for still further south the dip is re
versed to the south-south-east; and in a traverse from Siegen to the
Taunus, across the strike (a
                                 distance of about fifty miles), the same
dip is continued, with very few interruptions.         Considering their
high inclination, this fact seems to give an almost incredible
                                                                    thick
ness to the deposits in question.      But the vertical sections do not
give the order of superposition; for at Dillenburg, and on the Lahn,
two great Devonian troughs are brought in among the older strata,
without any general change of dip; and if we accepted the vertical
sections as the sole proofs of superposition, we must place the Devon
ian and a part of the carboniferous series under the chain of the
Taunus. The authors therefore endeavoured to apply the method of
 Professor Dumont, and found their results confirmed by the sections
of the lower Lahn.
    Many other local details are given, and the authors having
                                                                    deter
mined the geometrical position of the great mineral masses, next at
tempt to define their age from their fossils. In the
                                                         arenaceous and
calcareous group under the lower Westphalia limestone, many spe
cies of the genus Pterinea (Goldfuss), Homalonotus, Orthis, &c. &c.,
begin to prevail.       Along with these are forms at present unknown

in England, e.g. Hysterolites of Schlotheim, and two species of Del
thyris, D. macroptera and D. microptera (Goldfuss). The same
groups of fossils are found on the banks of the Rhine; and in a
quarry   near Unkel are many fossils of the genus Orthis, among
which were O. pecten, O. flabellula, O. rugosa. Along with them
was Terebratula Stricklandii, and the group was considered charac
teristic of the lower Silurian rocks of England.
   On a review of the whole evidence, the authors place this vast
succession of strata in the Silurian system, without professing to
separate the several parts into distinct groups, on a parallel with the
several groups of the Silurian system of England.        This is forbid
den by the absence of distinct calcareous bands, and also by the
great vertical range of some of the fossil species, which are found
almost from the highest beds to the lowest of the whole series.
Several lists of fossils are then given, in confirmation of these gene
ral views; and it is thence concluded, that the great sequence of
coarse earthy schists, calcareous bands, arenaceous flagstones, psam
mites, &c., are the representatives of the upper Silurian system, and
that the lowest quartzose, graywacke, flagstone, roofing-slate, &c.,
which in some places have no fossils, and in others have numerous
repetitions of a few species of the genus Orthis, belong to the lower
Silurian, or upper part of the Cambrian Systems.

shales, alternating with sandstone and flagstone, occasionally of a
reddish colour; (3.) Sandstone, flagstone, arenaceous slate, quartz.

fer to various lists of     fossils, and conclude    that,  though    several spe
cies are in common with those of the              overlying   Devonian system,
yet that as a group they are distinct: 1st. Because the carboniferous
species disappear; 2ndly. Because some of the most characteristic
species of the lower limestone (such as the Strygocephalus Burtini,
&c.) are wanting; 3rdly. Because new (and Silurian) types begin
to abound; more especially shales of the genus Pterinea, several
species of Orthis, the Homalonotus Knightii, Calymene Blumenbachii,
&c.     They further remark, that the species of Silurian fossils which
appear in the Eifel lists are mostly derived from the lower shales,
which are regarded as beds of passage.               Along with known Silu

                 several distinct traverses, the authors met with the

                                   in
shales; 2nd. Arenaceous flagstones and shale; the upper part fre
quently exhibiting     reddish tinge, and with portions more
                          a                                         less                        or
calcareous, and the lower part passing into        great formation
                                                               a                                      of
arenaceous flagstone, indurated slate and coarse slate, and occasion
ally   offine quartzite. The series     here and there highly fossili
                                                   is

occasionally presenting obscure impressions of plants, and casts of a
large Homalonotus, of a Silurian species. The sequence, deter
mined more by the symmetrical position of the great mineral masses
than by direct superposition, as seen in vertical sections, gradually
passes into rocks of a more decidedly slaty structure, and almost
without fossils. Passing to the right bank of the Moselle, and in
the same way making traverses through the chain of the Hunds
ruck (which is elevated on the line of strike, i. e. east-north-east),
they again had an ascending series, and thence concluded that the
whole chain was only a portion of the great system under the Eifel
limestone in an altered form.    The Silurian fossils discovered among
the  crystalline quartzites and schists of the chain (e.g. one or two
species of Orthis, a large winged Delthyris, &c.), confirmed this
view.    Hence also the chain of the Taunus, which is the physical
prolongation of the Hundsruck, must be referred to a similar place
in the general series; a conclusion at which the authors also arrived
from an examination of the sections on the right bank of the Rhine,
though obscured by the enormous development of masses of con
temporaneous trap (Schaalstein).
    The authors then give some details respecting the trappean and
volcanic rocks on both banks of the Rhine, and conclude, that the
quartzite and chlorite slates, &c. of the Hundsruck and Taunus are
but altered forms of a great Silurian group under the Eifel lime
stone; and that the causes which at an ancient epoch dislocated,
contorted, and mineralized the strata, have perhaps not yet entirely
ceased, and that the hot springs of Wisbaden and bubbling fountains
of Nassau, may be referred to their last expiring efforts.

 ing Possidonia schist. The analogy presented with the uppermost
 part          of
          the Devonian series     Westphalia seems, therefore, perfect.

 From these facts the authors conclude, that the older rocks of the
 Hartz are chiefly Silurian and Devonian, with a few traces of the
 lower carboniferous.
     If the great contortions and strike of the Rhenish provinces were
 produced contemporaneously with those of the Hartz, then must
 the great derangements of the Hartz have taken place after the de
 posit of the Belgian and Westphalian coal-fields.          But the principal
 dislocations of the Hartz must have taken place before the deposit
 of the    red conglomerates, sandstones, coal-beds and trappean masses,
  which rest on its     eastern flank.    Hence the authors conclude, that
 none of these red conglomerates are of the date of the old red sand
-stone; and that the coal-beds belong to the highest part of the car
 boniferous series, where it passes into the base of the new red sand
 Stone.
     Lastly, The authors describe a hasty traverse, made from the
  Thuringerwald through the forest of Upper Franconia, and thence
 to the north flank of the Fichtelgebirge.        On the northern limits of
 the section (the strike and      many  accidents of position remaining as
  before) were rocks with a true      slaty cleavage, which might (at least
  mineralogically) be compared with the upper slates of the Ardennes;
 and further south, the analogy was confirmed by bands of limestone,
  with stems of Encrinites, but with very few other fossils. Still further
  south occur a few impressions of plants, and the whole system ap
 pears to be at length overlaid by a series of limestones and schists,
  some of which are very rich in fossils. One of these zones of lime
  stone (the lowest according to Count Munster) rests on calcareous
  slates, containing a cardiola of the upper Ludlow rock.          It is in this
  zone that the     Clymenia   is most abundant.      Goniatites,  Orthocera
  tites, &c., are abundant in a higher zone; and the series is overlaid
  by a limestone with many species of true carboniferous productae,
  &c., and identified with the mountain limestone. From these facts
  the authors conclude, that the fossiliferous region near Hoff (south
  of the Fichtelgebirge) belongs to the Devonian system, with the
   exception of the highest beds, which are carboniferous.
      Such are the results arrived at by the authors, which seem to
   be in general accordance with one another, and to bear out the clas
  sification they proposed for the older British formations.

     April 20, 1841.-The Society held their first meeting of this Session.
  After the election of members had been announced, the Chairman
  stated that Walter Hawkins, Esq. had presented the Society with
  a dried specimen of the Gymnotus Electricus.            The Secretary read
  a letter he had received from J. P.       Gassiot,  Esq.,  F.R.S., in which
  was a   description of a voltameter  containing  five pairs of electrodes, so
  arranged as to enable the experimenter to use one or more pairs at
   pleasure. A communication was received from George Mackrell, Esq.,
   detailing experiments wherein the five terminal wires of a voltaic
   battery were ignited at the surface of acid water, forming a part of
   the circuit.   The negative wire was heated to a greater degree than

 the positive. A paper from Thomas Pollock, Esq. was read, de
 scribing the deflections of the galvanometer, dependent on the change
 of colour, &c. produced in certain liquids by the application of heat
 to one arm of a V tube containing them. The author concluded
 that Dr. Black's law of capacity for heat will enable us to explain
 these electrical phaenomena.
    These papers will be printed in the “Proceedings” of the Society,
 the first part of which will appear on the first of July. The Society
 then adjourned to Tuesday, May 18th.

 A    Collection         of Letters illustrative               of the Progress of                      Science in
     England from the Reign of Queen Elizabeth to that of Charles the

 and a few other societies, for the purpose of printing documents con
 nected with the history of the sciences, and forming by these means
 a medium for the circulation of such information on that subject as
 could scarcely be given to the world in any other way. The work
 whose title we have given above is the first offspring of this newly
 established body; and although it is not distinguished by any very
  striking novelty or the produce of any great change in our previous
  knowledge of the history of science at the period to which it refers,
  yet it not only offers very comprehensive views of the real state of
  English science in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but also
  affords us some very curious biographical information respecting our
  men of science during that time. It must above                      remembered,  all      be

mond.      We must not omit to mention, as belonging to this early
period, a very curious letter from Tycho Brahe to Thomas Savelle,
dated 1590, in which he sends his remembrances to Dr. Dee, “quem
in patriam feliciter reversum audivi,” and likewise to Thomas Digges.

   If the hydruret of cumyle be gradually dropped on fused hydra
of potash, hydrogen is evolved, and every drop is converted into te
minate of potash.      The effect is so rapidly produced, that by this
method two pounds of cuminate of potash may be obtained in an hour.

    OEnanthylate of Baryta.—This salt is formed by boiling
carbonate of baryta with an alcoholic solution of oenanthylic

but soluble in water and alcohol.

   Itwill be seen by the preceding numbers that an excess of
carbon is found; but this may be accounted for by the high
temperature required to burn the last particles of carbon, by
which some of the carbonic acid might have been driven off
from the carbonate of baryta in the combustion tube.
   The formula for this salt is one atom oenanthylic acid and
one atom oxide of barium, or C++ His O' + Ba O.
   OEnanthylate of Potash is obtained by neutralizing the car
bonate of that alkali by ocnanthylic acid; it does not crystal
lize, but, on evaporation, assumes the form of a thick trans

     Starting from the composition                          of chlorochromic and chloro

SO, H-Cl), Millon supposes that         the bleaching chlorides have
a similar relation to the    peroxides   of their metals. The per

I  call the final derivative: the quantity C is designated the
final derivee; and it is our present object to show how this
may be obtained in a prime form, that is to say, divested of
irrelevant factors: in this state it must consist of terms, each
containing m + n letters, of which n belong to the coefficients
of V,    and m to those                    of U.
     Of course in
                applying this rule it is to be understood that
every combination of powers in U or V has a single letter
prefixed for    coefficient, and that

   444      Mr. Weaver's      Wiew   of Ehrenberg's     Observations
   ber of species of Polythalamia observed in the Red Sea are
 Jº<U+017F>ly, and in the Mediterranean, on the Libyan and Syrian
   coasts, twenty-seven.      The new species derived from the two
   seas amount to fifty-four, of which twenty-seven species are
  peculiar to the Red Sea, and seventeen are common to both
   seas.    Particularly worthy of notice is the wide distribution
  and massy development of the Peneroplis planatus and Sorites
   Orbiculus, which are rare on the European coast. These forms
  are not only present almost everywhere in the East, but con
  stitute the predominant masses. On the other hand, the Ro
  talia Beccarii, which composes the Italian hills, occurs only
  singly and very rarely in the Red Sea; and I nowhere found
  it on the Libyan and Syrian coasts. The Sorites Orbiculus I
  have also from St. Domingo.
      In reviewing these subjects, even a superficial comparison
  of them with the contents of the chalk and chalk marl, is at
  tended with the striking result, that none of these living forms
  are found among the animalcules of the chalk, not even among
  those which compose the compact limestone of the Egyptian
  and Arabian rocks, and which are still partly washed by the
  sea near Hamam Faraún.
                        Remarks on Polythalamia.
     After a preliminary view of the researches of earlier la
  bourers in this branch of zoological inquiry, Dr. Ehrenberg ob
  serves:—Alively interest respecting the minute Polythalamian
  bodies which enter into the composition of sea-sand was ex
  cited anew by the work of Alcide d'Orbigny in 1826, in which
  are contained a great number of new species, while many of
  those which were previously known are examined with greater
  care, and an improved and easier view is taken of the whole
  subject. By his active exertions he had collected between 600
  and 700 species from the sea-sand of France, Italy, England,
 the Isle of France, Sandwich Islands, the Malouine and Ma
 rian Isles, &c., of which, however, only 425 received names.
 The whole mass of these microscopic animalcules, which he
 again decidedly associates with the Mollusks and Cephalopods,

 become acquainted, and to which I have therefore given the same names,
 namely, Tertularia communis, Calcarina Defrancii, C. Gaudichaudii, Quin
 queloculina sulcata, and Vertebralina striata. His Assilina (Nummulina) ni
 tida I hold to be the Sorites Orbiculus.
    Although I possess and have compared many of the Polythalamia which
have been described by d'Orbigny derived from the same localities, yet I
am in want of a great number of the originals named by him, and as this
author has generally given new names unaccompanied by descriptions, I
have not in Inost cases been able to determine to what form the name
given by him belongs.

ous critical remarks in the Dictionnaire Classique. D'Orbigny
expressly states that the animal of the Polythalamia (his Fora
minifera) resembles the Sepia in the structure of                   body,                   its              al

   446     Mr. Weaver's View of Ehrenberg's       Observations
      I showed, in 1837, that the Polythalamia       could not well
  possess an organization similar to that of the Infusoria, as not
   a single known true species of Infusoria has a calcareous shell;
  and   I had, in 1823, discovered, as    I conceived, a true living
   Polythalamia of earlier authors, resembling in organization
  the very complex Flustra.       The correctness of this view was
  fully established in 1839, after having examined anew, ac
  cording to my improved method, the small Nautilus Orbicu
  lus of Forskål, which d’Orbigny designated in 1826 as Num
  mulina (Assilina) mitida, specimens of which I had collected
  from the sand of the Red Sea in 1823, and which I have
  named Sorites Orbiculus. The result proved that the disc-like
  shell was a Polypary, often composed of more than one hun
  dred single animalcules, the cells of which quite resemble those
  of a Flustra, the animal putting forth and retracting from six to
  eight tentacula. And I even discovered in the interior of the
  single cells well-preserved siliceous Infusoria, the last food
  taken by the animal; and in some of them also small globu
  lar bodies, which, without much constraint, may be considered
  as eggs.    Though I had at an early period observed that the
 disc was    composed                       I
                       of many cells, yet could not perceive an
 opening to them; but the discovery of Infusoria in their in
 terior led me to consider by what means they could have been
 introduced.     Reflection reminded me that I had often seen
  Coral animals which in the expanded state exhibited many
 large bodies with tentacula and a large mouth, yet when con
 tracted left scarcely a trace of the openings through which
 they were protruded from the common Polypary. As such             I
 remembered Pennatula, Lobularia, Halcyonium and similar
 forms, in which I had frequently observed, that in the skin of
 the animal existed calcareous particles, which on the contrac
 tion of the skin so completely closed the opening as to render
 it no longer perceptible. Renewed examination of the closed
 surface of the cells of the Nautilus Orbiculus, Forskål, now
 showed to me that in them also dendritic calcareous particles
 exist, the close approximation of which closes the cell, so that
 the cover of the cell is in fact the dried skin of the animalcule.
 I  now made an experiment in proof, by dissolving the small
 shell in dilute muriatic acid, in order to obtain the animal
 body in a free state; and it succeeded perfectly.       I obtained
as many animalcular bodies as there were cells, connected to
gether by band-like processes, and in the interior of many of
them there were well-preserved siliceous Infusoria.          I then
treated in the same manner the Flustra pilosa and F. membra
nacea of the Baltic, and found in their interior also siliceous
Infusoria.     The same results followed a similar examination

    on the Organic Composition    of Chalk and Chalk Marl. 447
of the shells of Rotalia from the sand of Rimini, of the shells
of Peneroplis planatus, Pavonina Antillarum, and of Orbicu
lina numismalis from the sea-sand of St. Domingo, as well as
of other shells with their animals from the sand of the Red Sea
and the Mediterranean; so that now a view is obtained of the
more general organization of the principal groups of the Po
lythalamia.
    It results clearly from what has been said in respect of these
species, which are so common and widely distributed, and which
have hitherto been designated in systems as small Nautili, that
the straight-jointed shells of Nodosaria (formerly viewed as
Orthocera), as well as the spiral shells of Rotalia, Cristellaria,
&c. (considered as Nautili or Ammonites), and the shells of
 Biloculina resembling vermiform tubes (Serpula), are none of
them internal calcareous parts which were encased by an ani
mal body, similar to the internal bone of Sepia, or the cylin
drical spiral bone of Spirula; but, on the contrary, that they
are external calcareous shells, bearing analogy to those of
 Mollusks, or more correctly to those of Flustra and Cellepora,
which, after separation by an acid, disclose and render visibly
free the internal simple body or the Polypary, exhibiting pre
cisely the same form.       If the shell of Polythalamia be fre
quently perforated with pores, this is no proof that no other
openings exist, or that the animals receive nourishment through
 many tubes, for the same structure is not unfrequently found
in Flustra accompanied with the peculiar opening from which
 the fore-part of the animal body may be protruded; and in
 these exist also fringe-like filaments, which are extensile and
 retractile, and by no means to be compared to the pseudopo
 dia or variable feet of Amoeba, but probably bear analogy to
 the mantle fringes of many Mollusks, applicable to the pur
 poses of creeping and attachment, and for which perhaps they
 were specially designed. Moreover, Flustra possess a distinct
 large animal organization; and the siliceous Infusoria, and
 probable eggs found in Polythalamia, clearly bespeak in them
 also similar relations, the discovery of which, however, had
 hitherto been prevented by the calcareous encasement and the
 minuteness of the objects.
     It has resulted from the examination of the soft small ani
  mal bodies of living Polythalamia, that while many resemble
  Flustra or Eschara assembled in families or polyparies, each
  such family being often composed of hundreds of much mi
  nuter single animalcules, many others are single animals after
  the manner of Mollusks. Hence arise external characters and
  forms which have often a reference to very different relations,
  which it is first necessary to distinguish before we can succeed

450        Mr. Weaver's View of Ehrenberg's Observations
  thalamian form is the Miliola in Dujardin's sense, if there be
  really such self-existent animals, and they be not the young
  of others, or of many-celled forms most nearly related to           Bi
  loculina. And perhaps Gromia oviformis might be so viewed,
  should it not prove to be a Difflugia (an Infusoria).           In this
  series I myself place provisionally, as doubtful, those nume
  rous small globules of the sand of Rimini which have no di
   stinct opening, or sometimes present a very minute one. The
  next simplest form is that of a simple straight row of cells, as
  in the Nodosaria, a jointed continued development of a sim
  ple body. Teatularina, Uvellina and Rotalina (Lenticulina),
  may, as to external form, be viewed as Nodosarina developed
   in another manner, namely, in botryoidal or spiral forms.
      I have here to make a remark that appears important.             In
   the entire vast mass of known        Polythalamia,    a case or vest
  ment prevails which is either cuticular or composed of a cal
  careous substance, while in Infusoria either a cuticular or sili
  ceous substance prevails, so that hitherto no calcareous-shelled
  Infusoria nor siliceous-shelled Polythalamia had presented
  themselves. Yet among the fossil microscopic organisms of
  the chalk marl of Sicily, we find intermingled with the Infu
  soria shells bodies whose forms may be ranked with Poly
  thalamia, namely, with Nodosarina, but the shells of which
  are siliceous, insoluble in acids, and which to the eye have a
  more transparent vitreous aspect than the calcareous shells
  when penetrated by balsam.                 I
                                        have hence been induced to
 place these siliceous-shelled forms, until a further knowledge
 may be acquired of their organization, among the polygastric
  Infusoria near the shelled Amoeba, in a separate family, under
 the name of Arcellina composita, or Polycystina +. Such sili
 ceous-shelled Polycystina, resembling calcareous-shelled Po
 lythalamia, are the genera Lithocampe, Cornutella and Ha
liomma, with several species.
     I  wish here to draw attention to a small character hitherto
unregarded, which is distinctive of true Polythalamia, and
often even of their fragments.          It consists in this, that in the
 tube or channel of connexion between the cells, the mouth of
 the tube which belongs to the earlier smaller cell is overgrown
and surrounded by #. succeeding larger cell.              If the mouth
of the last cell be prolonged in a beak-like form, we find in
all   the earlier smaller cells distinct tube, quite similar     to  the
hard remains       ofthe sipho        in a
                                    the Nautilus; but   so  placed that
the tube always projects forward from the smaller into the
larger cell, and never backward from the larger into the smaller
 *     This view has been already indicated   the work “On the Infusoria
                                                 in

cell. In the Nautilus, this projection of the tube of connexion
is reversed, always proceeding from the larger to the smaller
chamber, so that in the last, the greatest chamber, the body
of the animal thus acquires a smooth foundation, upon which
it can move more freely. In true Nautili also the base of the
cells is concave or undulated in the forward direction, while
in the Polythalamia it appears without exception to be either
quite straight or convex in that direction.          This character
was also observed by Fichtel and Moll.
   The tabular view which I have given of the Bryozoa, found
ed as it is on the new observations which             have made, is         I
drawn   up  with  special  regard  to a definite expression   of fossil
phaenomena, the ancient names of d’Orbigny being mostly re
tained. This very diligent precursor in these studies first laid
down a foundation rich in forms and systematically ordered,
which may serve for                  all
                             future investigations, and has given
names      families which are well adapted
              to                                   his purpose; but   to
these have been
       I             obliged      alter, yet    to

to  separate from each other the forms which constitute his
families, according       they are either simple Polythalamia,

452     Mr. Weaver's View of Ehrenberg's Observations
often resembles an Ammonite or Nautilus, being considered
as the internal bone.         On the other hand, at a later period,
M. Dujardin denied that these animals possessed any organic
structure, stating that they consisted simply of an animated
slime capable of extension, encased by an indurated external
shell, and associating them with the pseudopodian Amoeba
of the Infusoria.       Dr. Ehrenberg now further demonstrates,
by figures and descriptions, their true organic structure, thus
 fully establishing his former positions, both as to simple Po
lythalamia and Polythalamia forming Polyparies.                  He proves
 that they are not internal bones, but external shells encasing
 a soft body, the shell being perforated, as it were, in                parts                  all
 by   numerous    pores,  from which the animal          projects  long  fila
 ments, capable        willat    extension, retraction and bifid divi

                                         APPENDIx.
   Closely connected with the preceding subjects is the valu
able Memoir of M. Alcide d'Orbigny, which has recently ap
peared, entitled, “On the Foraminifers of the White Chalk of
the Paris Basin".” The subjoined extracts may serve to con
vey a view of the general scope of the work, which, placed in
parallel with that of Dr. Ehrenberg, cannot but excite a dou
ble interest in the mind of the reader.
   Previously to entering upon the direct object of the Memoir,
M. d’Orbigny indulges in a few general reflections.
   Let     us,
           says the author, cast        rapid glance upon what has
                                                    a

the Foraminifers.       We have found them distributed through
the oolite series, extending from the lias             the uppermost      to
beds; but        the cretaceous
                 in                system    they  appear    still more

 that which exists.
      We are   the present day acquainted with Foraminifers
                     in
from  every region                   of

    To establish zoologically what we have advanced, let us
pass in review the succession of the genera, and endeavour to
convey an idea of the modifications which have taken place in
the Foraminifers of the cretaceous system, in the ascending
order of the beds.
    At the epoch of the Neocomian formation we have hitherto
found only the genus Teatularia.
    The green sand presents, as we have said, two series of
genera nearly distinct.    That of the mouth of the Charente
contains the genera Dentalina, Cristellaria, Lituola, Alveolina,
Chrysalidina, and Cuneolina; that of Mans, the genera Den
talina, Citharina, Frondicularia, Flabellina, Cristellaria, Bu
limina, and Guttulina. Hence we see, that, with the excep
 tion of two genera common to both localities,       the rest are     all
 different    each of them.
                in
   If  we follow our examination             of
                                      the succession   genera               of          in

      1.   That  the South the same genera

mulina, of which we have not found the analogue in the creta

   2. That in the North the succession is far from taking place
in the same manner; and that the Foraminifers, in much
  reater numbers, present a larger suite in superposition, with
facts not less curious.     The genus Citharina, which consti
tutes the greatest    portion  of the species in the oolite forma
tion, ceases with the green sand of Mans, being found no
further in the cretaceous beds. In the chalk marl of the banks
of the Loire we meet for the first time with the genus Lituola
with the Dentalina; but            all once,at    the white chalk, we
                                                            in
observe    a great number         of
                                species, among which, with          the               all
genera and even some analogous species                           of

Mans, there appear for the first time                       on
                                                 the globe the genera
Nodosaria, Marginulina, Palvulina, Rotalina, Rosalina, Trun
catulina, Uvigerina, Verneuilina, Gaudryina, Globigerina, Py
rulina, Sagrina, Flabellina, and Frondicularia. These genera
contain    a considerable number             of
                                         species; but with the white
chalk the   genus  Flabellina  ceases,   which had continued hitherto
from the green sand, and the genera Verneuilina and Gau

                                       in

that  of  the Paris basin, since       also contains Flabellina, does

not  present   the same    species,   and may perhaps             little         be   a
higher  in   the series, but we have not         yet sufficient data

  Of the fifty-four     species, seven occur also in lower or higher
beds: thus in the       green  sand of Mans are found three spe
cies, Dentalina sulcata, Marginulina compressa, and Cristel
laria rotulata; in the coral chalk of Tours, which is higher
in position than the white chalk, two species, Bulimina obtusa
and Tertularia turris; and in the chalk of Maestricht, being
the highest in position, two species, Dentalina multicostata
and Rotalina Cordieriana.            We also find two species, the
analogues of which occur both fossil in the tertiary tracts of
Austria and Italy, and in the living state in the Adriatic,
namely, Dentalina communis and Rolalina umbilicata.                With
these   exceptions    there still remain   forty-seven  species  peculiar
to the white chalk, showing clearly that it forms a bed distinct
from   all  the rest        of
                         the cretaceous system, belonging           small

   The preceding extracts from the labours of Dr. Ehrenberg
 and M. A. d’Orbigny show that microscopic Polythalamia
  are found in             all
                       calcareous formations from the lias upward;
  but  in England   they   have been lately discovered        still deeper        in

  their discovery       1839  in the mountain limestone

In    1840  they   were also met with           the Kendal     limestone,

tricity, nor at all questions any of the theories respecting     that
subject.”
    42. Owing to this avowed omission to state your opinions
as to the nature   of electricity, as preliminary to the statement
of your “theory,” and      because I was unable to reconcile that
theory with those previously accredited,      I  received the impres
sion that you claimed no aid from any imponderable principle.
It appeared to me that there was no room for the agency of
any such principle, if induction were an action of contiguous
ponderable particles consisting of a species of polarity.           It
seemed to follow that what we call         electricity, could be no
thing more than a polarity in the ponderable particles, directly
 caused by those mechanical, or chemical frictions, movements
 or reactions, by which ponderable bodies are electrified. You
 have correctly inferred that       I had not seen the fourteenth
 series of your researches, containing certain paragraphs (38).
 From them it appears that the polarity, on which so much
stress has been laid, is analogous to that which has long been
 known to arise in a ponderable body, about which the electric
equilibrium has been subverted by the inductive influence of
the electricity accumulated upon another such body.            This is
 clearly explained in paragraph 4 of your letter, by the illus
tration, agreeably to which three bodies, A, B, C, are situ
ated in a line, in the order in which they are named, in prox
imity, but not in contact. “A is electrified positively, and
 then C is uninsulated.”       It is evident that you are correct in
 representing that, under these circumstances, the extremities of
 B will be oppositely excited, so as to have a reaction with any
 similarly excited body, analogous to that which takes place
 between magnets; since the similarly excited extremities of
 two such bodies would repel each other, while those dissimi
 larly excited would be reciprocally attractive.           Hence, no
 doubt, the word polarity is conceived by you to convey an
 idea of the state of the body B.       If I may be allowed to pro
 pose an epithet to convey the idea which I have of the state
 of a body thus electrified, I would designate it as an electro
 polar state, or as a state of electro-polarity.
    43. It does not appear to me, that in the suggestion of the
electro-polarity, which we both conceive to be induced upon
the body B (4), so long as it concerns a mass of ponderable
matter, there is any novelty.       The only part of your doctrine
which is new, is that which suggests an analogous state to be
caused in the particles of the bodies through which the induct
ive power is propagated. . Admitting each of the particles of
 a dielectric, through which the process of ordinary induction
takes place, to be put into the state of the body B, it does not

          Dr. Hare's   Second Letter to  Prof. Faraday.         467
appear to me to justify your definition of electrical induction.
I  think that, consistently with your own exemplification of
that process, you should have alleged ordinary induction to
be productive of an affection of particles, causing in them a
species of polarity.    In the case of the bodies A, B, C (4),
B is evidently passive.     How then can we consider as active,
particles represented to be in an analogous state?          If in B
there is no action, how can there be any action in particles
performing a perfectly similar part? Moreover, how can the
inductive power of an electrical accumulation upon A consist
of the polarity which it induces in B?
   44. Having supposed (8) an electrified ball, A, an inch in
diameter, to be situated within a thin metallic sphere, C, of a
foot in diameter, you suggest, that where one thousand con
centric metallic spheres interpose between A and the inner
surface of C, the electro-polar state of each particle in those
spheres would be analogous to that of B, already mentioned.
Of course, if there be any action of those particles, there must
be an action of B; but this appears to me not only irrecon
cilable with any previously existing theory, but also with your
own exposition of the process by which B is polarized.
   45. Supposing concentric metallic hemispheres to be inter
posed only upon one side of A, you aver that, agreeably to
your experience, more of the inductive influence would be
extended towards that side of the containing shell than before
(14). Admitting this, I cannot concede that the greater          in
fluence of the induction, resulting from the presence of the
metallic particles, is the consequence of any action of theirs,
whether in contiguity or in proximity.     Agreeably to my view,
the action is confined to the electrical accumulation in the
sphere A. Between the electricity accumulated in this sphere,
and that existing in or about the intervening ponderable parti
cles, there may be a reaction; but evidently these particles are
as inactive as are the steps of a ladder in the scaling of a wall.
   46. Suppose a powerful magnet to be so curved as to have
the terminating polar surfaces parallel, and to leave between
them an interval of some inches.        Place between these sur
faces a number of short pieces of soft iron wire. These would,
of course, be magnetized, and would arrange themselves in
rows, the north and south poles becoming contiguous. Would
this be a sufficient reason for saying that the inductive influ
ence of the magnetic poles was an action of the contiguous
wires 2 Would not the phaenomena be the consequence of
an affection of the contiguous pieces of wire, not of their action?
   47. As respects the word charge, I am not aware that I
have been in the habit of attaching any erroneous meaning to

similitude between the processes of conduction and radia
tion (21).
    53. Consistently with the hypothesis that electricity is ma
terial, you have shown that an enormous quantity of it must
exist in metals. To me it seems equally evident that, agree
ably to the idea that heat is material, there must exist in metals
a proportionably great quantity of caloric.     The intense heat
produced when wires are deflagrated by an electrical discharge,
cannot otherwise be consistently accounted for. Agreeably
 to the same idea, every metallic particle in any metallic mass
 must be surrounded by an atmosphere of caloric; since the
 changes of dimensions, consequent to variations of temperature,
 can only be explained by corresponding variations in the
 quantity of caloric imbibed, and in the consequent density of
 the calorific atmospheres existing in the mass which under
   oes these changes”.
    54. Such being the constitution of expansible bodies agree
 ably to the hypothesis in question, it seems to me that the pro
 cess, by which caloric is propagated through them by conduc
 tion, must be extremely different from that by which it is
 transmitted from one part of space to another by radiation.
 In the one case, the calorific particle flies like a bullet pro
jected from a gun, but with an inconceivably greater velocity,
 which is not sensibly retarded by the reflecting or refracting
 influence of intervening transparent media: in the other case,
    *   I    subjoin the language which                        I   have held respecting           the constitution
of expansible solids, during the last twenty years.
   “The expansion of matter, whether solid, liquid, or                                        aeriform,    by an         in
crease of temperature, may be thus explained:—
  “In   proportion as the temperature within any space is raised, there will
be more caloric in the vicinity of the particles of any mass contained in the
space. The more caloric in the vicinity of the particles, the more of it
will combine with them; and in proportion to the quantity of caloric thus
combined, will they be actuated by that reciprocally repellent power, which,
in proportion to                  its
                       intensity, regulates their distance from each other.

 referred to the same class, and to different degrees of the
 same power.”
     61. In reply to this I beg leave to point out, that although,
 in ordinary acceptation, cold refers to relatively low tempe
 rature, yet we           all
                        understand that there might            that perfect         be
 negation       of
                 heat,            or
                           abstraction                     of
                                             caloric, which may           de                       be
 fined absolute cold.            presumeI   that,  having    thus defined
 absolute cold, you would not represent                    identical with
                                                                       it      as
 caloric.     For my own part, this would seem               unreasonable       as
 as   to confound matter with nihility.

                             Introduction.
1.      INthe course of my last paper, it was stated that the
        investigations which it detailed were not as complete
 in some parts as I could wish, and that I hoped to develope
 them more fully in another communication.             After consider
 able  delay,  occasioned   by  alterations in the rooms of the phy
 sical department    of the   college,  I was enabled to resume my
 researches, and since then I have been so fortunate as to dis
 cover a series of new facts belonging to different parts of the
general subject of my contributions. These I have announced
 to the Society at different times, as they were discovered; and
I  now purpose to select from the whole such portions as re
 late particularly to the principal subject of my last paper,
namely, the induction at the beginning and ending of a gal
 vanic current, and to present them as a continuation, and, in
a measure, as the completion, of this part of my researches.
The other results of my labours in this line will be arranged
for publication as soon as my duties will permit me to give
them a more careful examination.

    2. In the course of the experiments am about to describe,
I  have had occasion to repeat and vary those given in my last
paper; and I am happy to be able to state, in reference to the
results, that, except in some minor particulars, which will be
mentioned in the course of this paper, I have found no cause to
desire a change in the accounts before published.             My views,
however, of the connexion of the phaenomena have been con
siderably modified, and I think rendered much more definite
by the additional light which the new facts have afforded.
    3. The principal articles of apparatus used in these experi
ments are nearly the same as those described in my last paper,
namely, several flat coils and a number of long wire helices
 (III. 6, 7, 8.f). I have, however, added to these a constant
battery, on Professor Daniell’s plan, the performance of which
has fully answered my expectations, and confirmed the ac
counts given of this form of the instrument by                  its

length as the cylinders, and about one inch in diameter. The
several elements are connected by a thick copper wire, sol
dered to the copper cylinder of one element, and dipping
into a cup of mercury on the zinc of the next. The copper
and zinc, as usual, are separated by a membrane, on both sides
of which is placed a solution of one part of sulphuric acid in
ten parts of water; and to this is added, on the side next the
copper, as much sulphate of copper as will saturate the solu
tion.      The battery was sometimes used as a single series, with
 all    itselements placed consecutively, and              others      two                            in            or

battery remaining the same.              For this purpose, the battery
consisting of a single element, and the arrangement of the
apparatus as represented in Fig. 3, the coil was diminished in
length from sixty feet to forty-five, then to thirty, and so on.
With the first-mentioned length the shock, at making contact
with the battery, was, of course, very feeble, and could be felt
only in the tongue; with the next shorter length it was more
perceptible, and increased in intensity with each diminution
of the coil, until a length of about fifteen feet appeared to give
a maximum result.
    12. The diminution of the intensity of the shock in the last
experiment, after the length of the coil was diminished below
fifteen feet, was due to the diminution of the number of spires
of the coil, each of which, by acting on the helix, tends
 to increase the intensity of the secondary current, unless the
 combined length of the whole is too great for the intensity of
the battery. That this is the fact is shown by the following
 experiment: the helix was placed on a single spire or turn
 of the coil, and the length of the other part of the copper                                       ri
 band, which did not act on the helix, was continually short
 ened, until the whole of it was excluded from the circuit; in
 this case the intensity of the shock at the beginning was con
 stantly increased. We may therefore state generally, that,
at the beginning of the battery current, the induction of a
 unit of              its
                 length      increasedis                     by

  elements of the compound battery and the coil No. 2, the
  shock, at the beginning of the current, was fully equal to
  that at the ending.        It was, however, found, that             this                                   if,   in

The two ends                of
                    the coil were      placed      the two cups which             in

488                    Prof.     J.   Henry's Contributions
formed the poles of the battery, and permanently retained there
during the experiment; also, at the distance of about six inches
from, say the right hand end of the coil, a loop was made in the
riband, which could be plunged into the cup containing the
left hand end.      With this arrangement, and while only the
two extreme ends of the coil were in connexion with the cups
of mercury, of course the current passed through the entire
 length of the riband of the coil; but by plunging the loop into
 the left hand cup, the whole length of the coil, except the six
 inches before mentioned, was excluded from the battery                                cir
 cuit. And again, when the loop was li<U+017F>ted out of the cup, the
  whole length was included.          In this way the current in the
  coil could be    suddenly     formed and interrupted, while the
  poles of the battery were continually joined by a conductor;
  but no shock with either a single or a compound battery
  could be obtained by this method of operation. .
      19. The feebleness of the shock at the beginning of the
  current, with a single battery and a long coil, is not entirely
  owing to the cause we have stated (17.), namely, the resistance
  to conduction offered by the long conductor, but also de
  pends, in a considerable degree, if not principally, on the ad
  verse influence of the secondary current, induced in the pri
  mary conductor itself, as is shown by the result of the follow
   ing experiment.      Helix No. 1. was placed on a coil consisting
   of only three spires or turns of copper riband; with this, the
   shock, both at making and breaking the circuit with a single
  battery, could be felt in the hands.            A compound coil was
  then formed of the copper ribands of coils No. 3. and 4. rolled
   together so that the several spires of the two alternated with
   each other, and when this was introduced into the circuit so
   as not to act on the helix by                     its
                                            induction, and the battery
   current passed through, for example, coil No.             the shock    3,                at

   induced current       which would neutralize the secondary cur

    making the contact was nearly              powerful    as     the caseas   in

experiments were next instituted to determine the nature of the

arranged in the manner described in my last paper (III. 79.),
for producing currents of the different orders. The result
with this arrangement was similar to that which I have de
scribed in reference to the ending induction, namely, currents
of the third, fourth, and fifth orders were readily obtained.
    21. Also, when an arrangement of apparatus was made                                        si

form of a circle, and placing the helix within this. The shock
was felt in the hands at the moment of closing the circuit, but
the effect at opening the same was scarcely perceptible through
the tongue. An attempt was also made to get indications of
induction by placing the helix within a circle of dilute acid,
connected with a battery instead of a coil, but the effect, if
any, was very feeble.
     29.I  have shown, in the second number of my contribu
tions, that if the body be introduced into a circuit with a bat
tery of one hundred and twenty elements, without a coil, a
 thrilling sensation will be felt during the continuance of the
current, and a shock will be experienced at the moment of
 interrupting the current by breaking the circuit at any point.
 This result is evidently due to the induction of a secondary
 current in the battery itself, and on this principle the remark
 able physiological effects produced by Dr. Ure, on the body
 of a malefactor, may be explained. The body, in these ex
  periments, was made to form a part of the circuit, with a
 compound galvanic apparatus in which a series of interrup
 tions was rapidly made by drawing the end of a conductor
 over the edges of the plates of the battery.       By this opera
 tion a series of induced currents must have been produced in
 the battery itself, the intensity of which was greater than that
 of the primary current.
     30. In this connexion          I
                               may mention that the idea has oc
  curred to me, that the intense shocks given by the electrical
  fish may possibly be from a secondary current, and that the
 great amount of nervous organization found in these ani
 mals may serve the purpose of a long conductor*. It ap
  pears to me, that in the present state of knowledge, this is the
  only way in which we can conceive of such intense electricity
  being produced in organs imperfectly insulated and immersed
  in a conducting medium. But we have seen that an original
  current of feeble intensity can induce, in a long wire, a se
  condary current capable of giving intense shocks, although
  the several strands of the wire are separated from each other
  only by a covering of cotton thread.       Whatever may be the
  worth of this    suggestion,  the  secondary  current affords the
  means of imitating the phaenomena of the shock from the
  electrical eel, as described by Dr. Faraday.       By immersing

 angles to the last, only a slight sensation is felt in each hand,
 but no shock.
     31. Since the publication of my last paper,        I have exhibited
 to  my  class the  experiment     (No.  III. Sect. III.) relative to the
 induction at a distance on a much larger scale. All my coils
 were united so as to form a single length of conductor of
 about four hundred feet, and this was rolled into a ring of
 five and a half feet in diameter, and suspended vertically
against the inside of the large folding doors which separate
 the laboratory from the lecture-room.           On the other side of
 the doors, in the lecture-room, and directly opposite the coil,
 was placed a helix, formed of upwards of a mile of copper
 wire, one-sixteenth of an inch in thickness, and wound into
 a hoop of four feet in diameter. . With this arrangement, and
 a battery of one hundred and forty-seven square feet of zinc
 surface divided into eight elements, shocks were perceptible
 in the tongue, when the two conductors were separated, to
 the distance of nearly seven feet; at the distance of between
 three and four feet, the shocks were quite severe.             The ex
 hibition was rendered more interesting by causing the induc
 tion to take place through a number of persons standing in a
 row between the two conductors.

     32.  The investigations arranged under this          head had their
 origin in the following       circumstances.    After the publication
 of my last paper, I received, through the kindness of Dr.
 Faraday, a copy of the fourteenth series of his researches,
 and in this I was surprised to find a statement which appeared
 in direct opposition to one of the principal facts of my com
 munication.      In paragraph 59, 1 state, in substance, that
when a     plate of metal is interposed between the coil trans
mitting a galvanic current, and the helix placed above it to
 receive the induction, the shock from the secondary current
is almost perfectly neutralized.          Dr. Faraday, in the exten
sion of his new and        ingenious   views of the agency of the in
termediate     particles in  transmitting   induction, was led to make
an experiment on the same point; and apparently, under the
same circumstances, he found that it “makes not the least
difference, whether the intervening space between the two
conductors is occupied by such insulating bodies as air, sul
phur, and shell-lac, or such conducting bodies as copper and
other non-magnetic metals.”

conclusion, however, was not correct, for on making the ex

found this article to produce a more perfect neutralization
than a plate.
   37. Next, the apparatus remaining the same, and the helix
at rest during the experiment, currents were induced in it
by moving the battery attached to the coil up and down in
the acid.    But in this case, as in the others, the effect on the
galvanometer was the same, whether the plate or the coil was
interposed or not.
   38. The experiment was also tried with magneto-electricity.
 For this purpose, about forty feet of copper wire, covered
with silk, were wound around a short cylinder of stiff paper,
and into this was inserted a hollow cylinder of sheet copper,
and into this again, a short rod of soft iron; when the latter
 was rendered magnetic, by suddenly bringing in contact with
its two ends the different poles      two magnets,   of current,                                           of

copper wires      equal length around the middle

with this part of the subject, I will first mention a fact which

 ference to the direction of the induced currents, yet they were
 very different in regard to the intensity of the action. Thus,
 when the arrangement of the apparatus was such that the                in
 duction at making the battery circuit was so feeble as not to
 give the least magnetism to the needle, and so powerful at the
 ending as to magnetize it to saturation, the indication of the
 galvanometer was the same in both cases.
     42. Also, similar results were obtained in comparing the
 shock and the deflection of the galvanometer.              In one expe
 riment, for example, the shock was so feeble at making con
 tact that it could scarcely be perceived in the fingers, but so
 powerful at the breaking of the circuit as to be felt in the
 breast; yet the galvanometer was deflected about thirty-five de
 grees to the right, at the beginning of the current, and only an
 equal number of degrees to the left, at the ending of the same.
     43. In another experiment, the apparatus being the same
 as before, the magnetizing spiral and the galvanometer were
  both at once introduced into the circuit of the helix.                 A
  sewing needle being placed in the spiral, and the contact with
  the battery made, the needle showed no signs of magnetism,
  although the galvanometer was deflected thirty degrees. The
  needle being replaced, and the battery circuit broken, it was
  now found strongly magnetized, while the galvanometer was
  only moved about as much as before in the opposite direction.
     44. Also, effects similar to those described in the last two
  paragraphs were produced when the apparatus was so ar
  ranged as to cause the induction at the beginning of the bat
  tery current to predominate.         In this case the galvanometer
  was still nearly equally affected at making and breaking bat
   tery contact, or any difference which was observed could be
   referred to a variation in the power of the battery during the
   experiment.
      45. Arother fact of importance belonging to the same class
   has been mentioned before (24.), namely, that the actions of
   the currents of the third, fourth, and fifth orders produce a
   very small effect on the galvanometer, compared with that of
   the secondary current; and this is not alone on account of the
   diminishing power of the successive inductions, as will be evi
   dent from the following experiment. By raising the helix from

 the same circumstances, the shocks were neutralized.
     47.      similar effect was observed when the galvanometer
              A
 and the magnetizing spiral were together introduced into
 the circuit. "The interposition                         of

             the  galvanometer       was much diminished.
    50. Another result was obtained                 placing       by
                                                                  the circuit               in

                               was the same as without the water,
                               In addition to these, the body was
 also introduced into the same circuit; the shocks were found
 very severe, the spiral magnetized needles strongly, but the
galvanometer was still less moved than before. The current
of low intensity, which deflects the needle of the galvanome
 ter in these instances, was partially intercepted by the imper
<U+017F>ect conduction of the water and the body.
    51. To exhibit the results of these experiments with still
more precision, an arrangement of apparatus was adopted
similar to that used by Dr. Faraday, and described in the
fourteenth series of his researches, namely, a double galvano
meter was formed of two separate wires of equal length and
thickness, wound together on the same frame; and, also, a
double magnetizing spiral was prepared by winding two equal
wires around the same piece of hollow straw. Coil No. 1,
connected with the battery, was supported perpendicularly on
a table, and coils Nos. 3 and 4 were placed parallel to this,
one on each side, to receive the induction, the ends of these
being so joined with those of the galvanometer and the spiral
that the induced current from the one coil would pass through
the two instruments, in an opposite direction to that of the
current from the other coil. The two outside coils were then
so adjusted, by moving them to and from the middle coil, that
the induced currents perfectly neutralized each other in the two
instruments, and the needle of the galvanometer and that in the
spiral were both unaffected when the circuit of the battery
was made and broken.          With this delicate arrangement the
slightest difference in the action of the two currents would be
rendered perceptible; but when a zinc plate was introduced
so as to screen one of the coils, the needle of the galvanome
ter still remained perfectly stationary, indicating not the least
action of the plate, while the needle in the spiral became
powerfully magnetic.          When, however, a plate of iron was
interposed instead of the one of zinc, the needle of the galva
nometer was also affected.
    52. From the foregoing results it would seem that the se
condary current, produced at the moment of suddenly begin
ning or ending of a galvanic current, by making and breaking
contact with a cup of mercury, consists of two parts, which
possess different properties.      One of these is of low intensity,
can be interrupted by a drop of water, does not magnetize
hardened steel needles, and is not screened by the interposition

The other part is of considerable intensity, is not intercepted
by a drop of water, developes the magnetism of hardened steel,
gives shocks, and is screened or neutralized by a closed coil,
or a plate of any kind of metal.    Also, the induced current
produced by moving a conductor towards or from a battery
current, and that produced by the movement up and down
of a battery in the acid, are of the nature of the first-men
tioned part, while the currents of the third, fourth, and fifth
orders partake almost exclusively of the properties of the se
cond part.
     53.   The principal
                     facts and conclusions of this section were
announced to the  Society  in October 1839, and again pre
sented in the form in which they are here detailed in June
last. Since then, however, I have had leisure to examine the
subject more attentively, and after a careful comparison of
these results with those before given, I have obtained the
more definite views of the phaenomena which are given in the
next section.

 lows:–1. During the time a galvanic current is increasing in
 quantity in a conductor, it induces, or tends to induce, a current
 in an adjoining parallel conductor in an opposite direction to
 itself. 2. During the continuance of the primary current in
 full quantity, no inductive action is exerted. 3. But when
 the same current begins to decline in quantity, and during
 the whole time of          diminishing,
                                 its            induced current  an   pro                         is

to the same depth, but more rapidly than before, then                                                                 the

amount of inductive force expended remains the same; hence,
since the same quantity of force is exerted in a less time, a
greater intensity of action will be produced (57.), and con
sequently a current of more intensity, but of less duration,
will be generated in the secondary conductor. The intensity
of the induced currents will, therefore, evidently be expressed
by the ratio of the ordinate c B to the abscissa A c. Or, in
more general and definite terms, the intensity of the induc
tive action at any moment of time will be represented by the
ratio of the rate of increase of the ordinate to that of the
abscissa for that moment+.
   64. It is evident from the last paragraph, that the greater
º,
or less intensity of the inductive action will be immediately
presented to the eye, by the greater or less obliquity of the
several parts of the curve to the axis. Thus, if the battery be
suddenly plunged into the acid for a short distance, and then
           immersed through the remainder of the depth, the
varying action will be exhibited at once by the form of A B,
the first part of the curve, fig. 17. The steepness of the part
A g will indicate an intense action for a short time A a, while
the part g B denotes a more feeble induction during the time
represented by a c. In the same way, by drawing up the
battery suddenly at first, and afterwards slowly, we may pro
duce an inductive action such as would be represented by the
parts between C and D of the ending of the curve.
   65. Having thus obtained representations of the different
elements of action, we are now prepared to apply these to
the phaenomena.      And, first, however varied may be the                                       in
tensity of the induction expressed by the different parts of
the two ends of the curve, we may in mediately infer that a
galvanometer, placed in the circuit of the secondary conduc
tor, will be equally affected at the beginning and ending of
the primary current; for, since the deflection of this instru
ment is due to the whole amount of a current, whatever may
be    its
       intensity (57.), and since the ordinates       and      are       c   B             C d
equal, which represent the quantity         induction        of
                                                          the two                    in
directions, and, consequently, the amount          the secondary         of
current, therefore the deflection     the  beginning atand ending
of  the battery current  will,      cases,    in   all
                                                equal. This        be                            in

for, however rapidly or slowly we may plunge the battery
into the acid, and however irregular may be the rate at which
it is drawn out, still if the whole effect be produced within the
time of one swing of the needle, the galvanometer is deflected
to an equal degree.
   66. Again, the intensity of one part of the inductive action,
for example that represented by Ag, may be supposed to be
so great as to produce a secondary current capable of pene
trating the body, and of thus producing a shock” while the
other parts of the action, represented by g B and C D, are
so feeble as to affect the galvanometer only.     We would then
have a result the same as one of those given in the last sec
tion (42.), and which was supposed to be produced by two
kinds of induction; for if the shock were referred to as the
 test of the existence of an induced current, one would be
found at the beginning only of the battery current, while, if
the galvanometer were consulted, we would perceive the ef
      .
fects of a current as powerful at the ending as at the begin
Illing.
        The results mentioned in the last paragraph cannot be
obtained by plunging a battery into the
                                                                       .#;

of the current in this    way  is not   sufficiently  rapid    to produce
a shock.    The example was given to illustrate the manner in
which the same effect is supposed to be produced, in the case
of the more sudden formation of a current, by plunging one
end of the conductor into a cup of mercury permanently at
tached to a battery already in the acid, and in full operation.
The current, in this case, rapid as may be                 development,       its
cannot     be supposed      assume    per

gradual development of the current in the short conductor,
with a single battery, and the gradual decline of the same,
are represented by the gentle rise of A B and fall of CD,

indicates the intensity which              the increased shock,
after the number of elements of the battery has been increased.
The accumulation of the electricity, which almost instantly
subsides, is represented by the part B ce, fig. 19; and from
this we see, at once, that although the shock is increased by
using the compound battery, yet the needle of the galvano
meter will be deflected only to the same number of degrees,
since the parts B c and c e give inductive actions in contrary
directions, and both within the time of a single swing of the
needle, and, consequently, will neutralize each other.     The
resulting deflecting force will, therefore, be represented by
ef, which is equal to C k, or to b B, in fig. 18.

    The intensity of the shock at the breaking                                       is represented
as being the same in the two figures, by the similarity of the
rate of descent of the part CD of the curve in each.
    71. We have said (69.) that the quantity of current elec
tricity in a short conductor and a compound battery, after the
first discharge, is nearly the same as with a single battery.
The exact quantity, according to the theory of Ohm, in a
unit of length of the conductor, is given by the formula

tromotive force of one element; r, the resistance to conduc

of a single element (68.), and instead of increasing the                                                             in

needle is first affected by the action of A B, it indicates a cur
rent in the adverse direction to the secondary current.
   80. Although the two inductions in the tertiary conductor
nearly neutralize each other, in reference to the indications of
the galvanometer, yet this is far from being the case with re
gard to the shocks, and the magnetization of steel needles.
These effects may be considered as the results alone of the
action of A B; the induction of B C being too feeble in inten
sity to produce a tertiary current of sufficient power to pene
trate the body, or overcome the coercive power of the hard
ened steel.     Hence, in reference to the shock and magneti
zation of the steel needle, we may entirely neglect the action
of B C, and consider the tertiary excitement as a single cur
rent, produced by the action of A B; and, because this is the
beginning induction (56.), the tertiary current must be in an
opposite direction to the secondary.           For a similar reason, a
current of the third order should produce in effect a single
current of the fourth order, in a direction opposite to that of
the current which produced            and        of it,

    89. These more minute considerations, relative                      the form                       to
of   the curve,    will enable                    us       to
                                          conceive how the time               the                             of
ending            of
              the secondary current,            we have suggested (78.),
                                                                    as
may          be
           prolonged beyond that                                of

the disturbance of the electricity of the conductor on which
this current depends.                    If
                              the development of the primary cur
rent is produced by equal increments in equal times, as would
be the case in plunging the battery (59.) into the acid with a
uniform velocity, then the part A B of the curve fig. 17 would
be a straight line, and the resulting secondary current, after
the first instant, would be one of constant quantity during
nearly the whole time represented by Ac; but if the rate of
the development of the primary current be supposed to vary
in accordance with the views we have given in the last para
graph, then the quantity of the secondary current will begin
to decline before the termination of the induction, or as soon
as the increments of the primary begin to diminish; and hence
the whole time of the subsidence of the secondary will be pro
longed, or the length of b C, fig. 20, will be increased, the
descent of B C be more gradual, and the intensity of the end
ing induction of the secondary current be diminished (see
last part of paragraph 78.).
    90. Besides the considerations we have mentioned (88.),
there are others of a more obvious character, which would also
appear to affect the form of particular parts of the curve. And
first we might perhaps make a slight correction in the drawing
of figs. 17, 18, &c., at the point A, in consideration of the
fact that the very first contact of the end of the conductor with
the surface of the mercury is formed by a point of the metal,
and hence the increment of development should be a little less
rapid at the first moment than after the contact has become
larger; or in other words, the curve should perhaps start a
little less abruptly from the axis at the point A. Also Dr.
Page has stated” that he finds the shock increased by spread
ing a stratum of              oil
                        over the surface       the mercury;    of this                     in
case it   isprobable that the termination        the current       of
                                                                more                       is

exhibited by the galvanic apparatus have alone been discussed.
I  have, however, made a series of experiments on the induc

currents, and I think that the results of these can also be re

require further examination before submitting them to the

I OBSERVE        in the Philosophical Magazine for November
    1840, a letter addressed to you on the Law of Storms,
which contains the following passage:–
   “In an article upon Lieut.-Colonel Reid’s law of storms

remarkable passages upon the subject had previously appeared
in  the memoirs          of
                      the Berlin Professor, but that these are
mere ingenious speculations, for they are           more.  noThe term

apparently, established the theory upon an impregnable basis.

    In order to  explain    the reaction between animal matters and carbon
ate of potash, when fused together at a red heat, which gives rise to this
salt, it is necessary to keep in mind the following properties of the salt:

parts of pearlashes and animal matter, or ten parts of the former
and eight parts of carbonized animal matter. Three or four per
cent. of iron filings are usually added to the mixture.            After each
addition of animal matter the heat is urged until the whole is fused,
and the melted material, which is of a thick consistence, is not re
moved from the pot until the charcoal is seen to be equally diffused
through the whole mass. The mass, after cooling, is placed in an
iron pan filled with water, the clear liquid after a time drawn off,
and water boiled several times on the insoluble residue. The liquids
are evaporated for crystallizing the salt at a temperature not exceed
ing 203°Fahr.       The formation of prussiate takes place after the
solution of the melted mass, by the action of the matters dissolved
upon the insoluble residue; for this melted mass yields nothing but
cyanide of potassium to alcohol, and contains no prussiate.             In ex:
planation of the formation of cyanide of potassium in the melted
 mass, it is stated that metallic potassium readily produces that salt
when fused with calcined blood, disengaging at the same time a
considerable quantity of charcoal; the proportion of nitrogen to
carbon, in cyanogen, being one equivalent of the first to two of the
last, while in blood, hair, and horn, the proportion is 1 to 6.           Now
when these animal matters are fused at a high temperature with
potash, the free charcoal reduces the potash to the state of potas
sium; the latter then acts upon the azotized carbonaceous matter,
 forming cyanogen, with which it unites. A second mode in which
cyanide of potassium is produced, is when ammoniacal gas is con
ducted over a mixture of carbonate of potash and charcoal at a red
heat. This is accounted for by the action of ammonia upon char
coal alone at a red heat; the gas is entirely converted into hydro
cyanic acid and hydrogen (NH, and 2C = H, NC, and 2H).
Now hydrocyanic acid decomposes carbonate of potash at a red
heat, forming cyanide of potassium.          Hence the product of cyanide
of potassium is most considerable when the animal matter is used in
its natural state, and not previously carbonized,          fact     which thea            of
manufacturers       of
                     prussiate          of
                                    potash have long been aware from
experience.      To account for the subsequent conversion                  the                       of

the corrosion of the iron pot in which the fusion is conducted.
Professor Liebig assigns an important place to the sulphur of the
sulphate of potash, usually present to the extent of 12 or 16 per
cent. in pearlashes, in effecting this corrosion.    In the decomposi
tion of the sulphate of potash  by charcoal, bisulphuret  of potassium
                                                   -

The bisulphuret of iron assumes an atom of iron, either from the
sides of the iron vessel or from iron filings which are added; the
double sulphuret thus formed is very fusible, and will consequently
be equally diffused through the melted mass.
   The deficiency of product which frequently occurs in the manu
facture of prussiate of potash is ascribed principally to two causes:
1st, to the want of iron in the fused mass.    The cyanide of potas
sium is then, instead of being converted into ferrocyanide when
thrown into water, decomposed by the free caustic potash when heat
is applied to      its
                 solution.  Uniting with the elements       water,                              of                     its

versity College.
   This paper referred to the decomposition which occurs in the
process for mellon, from the substance considered by Liebig to
be the isolated radical of the sulphocyanides (as obtained by the
action of chlorine or nitric acid on sulphocyanide of potassium);
for which substance, having previously shown it to contain hy.
drogen and oxygen in addition to the elements belonging to the
true sulphocyanogen, the author proposes the term metasulphocyan
ogen.    It became necessary, therefore, to seek for other products of
the decomposition of this substance than those hitherto recognized,
namely, mellon, sulphur, and bisulphuret of carbon; and in decom
posing pure and dry metasulphocyanogen by heat, water, sulphu
retted hydrogen, and hydrosulphocyanic       acid, in addition to the
above, were detected. Admitting the formula for metasulphocyan
ogen, S, Cy H, O, to which he has been led by analyses, the de
composition is explained as follows:—Three equivalents of meta
sulphocyanogen, containing Saº Caº Nis H, O, are resolved into
four of mellon, C, N,6; two of hydrosulphocyanic acid, S, C, N, H., ;
four of sulphuretted hydrogen, S, H, ; eight of bisulphuret of car
bon, Sla Cs; twelve of sulphur, and three of water, H, O,. The sum
of the elements of these compounds will be found to comprise
S, C, Nis H, O, ; or three equivalents of metasulphocyanogen.

   4. The following Note
                           º  Professor Graham, “On the Preparation
of Chlorate of Potash." It is well known that the ordinary pro
cesses for this important salt are attended with some practical diffi
culties.   When a stream of chlorine gas is passed through a strong
solution of carbonate of potash, the absorption of the gas is rapid
and complete, till one-half of the alkaline carbonate is decomposed;
but the remaining portion, which is in the state of bicarbonate, is
not so easily acted upon. To decompose the latter salt completely,
chlorine must be applied in excess, and the decomposition is attended
§.
by the formation of free hypochlorous acid, as has been proved by
      Detmer.    The liquid is also at the end highly bleaching, and
contains much hypochlorite of potash. The boiling necessary to
convert the latter into chlorate of potash and chloride of potassium
occasions, according to M. Morin, a considerable loss of oxygen,
and thus lessens the product of chlorate.     When a strong solution

of caustic potash is substituted in this process for the carbonate, the
absorption of chlorine proceeds without interruption; but the liquid
when saturated bleaches strongly from hypochlorite formed.                A
long-continued boiling is required to destroy this property com
pletely, and as oxygen escapes, the chlorate obtained must be de
ficient in quantity in a corresponding proportion.          The process
which the author recommends, and which is attended with none
of these inconveniences, consists in mixing carbonate of potash inti
mately with an equivalent quantity of dry hydrate of lime, and ex
posing the mixture to chlorine gas.        This mixture, although quite
                                             *
dry, absorbs the gas with prodigious energy, the temperature rises
much above 212°, and water is freely evolved.          When saturated it
may be moderately heated, which destroys a mere trace of hypo
chlorite it contains.   The whole lime is           in the state of car
bonate, and the potash as chlorate and chloride of potassium.          The
solution of the two latter salts is neutral, without any bleaching
property, and free from lime.         The chlorate of potash may be
crystallized from it in the usual way. Carbonate of potash, when
moistened and exposed to chlorine, without the hydrate of lime, ab
sorbs the gas with great avidity, and certainly answers better than
a strong solution of the same salt; but the absorption becomes
slow after the salt is in the state of bicarbonate, and subsequently a
large quantity of the bleaching hypochlorite of potash is produced.
In the new process described above, there is no reason to believe
that the carbonate of potash is decomposed by the dry hydrate of
lime till the chlorine is presented to the mixture; then, while the
lime attracts the carbonic acid, the chlorine acts simultaneously
upon the potash, and the carbonate of potash is thus readily decom
posed. The same principle of calling in a secondary agency to
promote combination may be taken advantage of in many other
cases.    One of these, of some interest, is the promotion of the ab
sorption of sulphuretted hydrogen by hydrate of lime, through the
influence of other salts.     Thus hydrate of lime, dry or slightly
damped, ceases to absorb sulphuretted hydrogen long before it is
saturated with that gas; but if mixed with an equivalent of hydrated
sulphate of soda, the absorption takes place with greatly increased
avidity, and goes on till two equivalents of sulphuretted hydrogen
are taken up for one equivalent of lime.       But here, with the assist
ance of sulphuretted hydrogen, the hydrate of lime decomposes the
sulphate of soda, sulphate of lime being formed, while caustic soda
combines with the sulphuretted hydrogen.
    The author has found that the last mixture may be applied with
advantage, from     its great absorbing power,     in purifying coal gas,
where the highest degree       of
                                purification is desirable, and where the
products, sulphate  of lime and hydrosulphuret    of sulphuret     sodium,

into the last of the dry lime-purifiers.      -

 copy of the second edition of his “Electrotype Manipulation.”
    A letter from Thomas Pine, Esq. was read, containing many inter
 esting facts on the power exercised by the points of living vegetables
 in “drawing off” electricity from the atmosphere. That many im
 portant functions in vegetation result from this, the author concluded
 from the singular circumstance of dew being deposited only on the
 apex of points or leaves.     Apparently smooth leaves are, when ex
amined by a microscope, found studded with these natural attrac
tors; and, which is still more illustrative of the case in question,
plants vegetate with more vigour in an electrified atmosphere than
when the soil is electrified. This communication was merely a gene
ral sketch of conclusions which the author promised to illustrate more
 at large on a future occasion.

    April 26, 1841–Prof. Challis        read a communication on the motion
 of a small sphere submitted to the dynamical action of the vibrations of
an elastic medium. The mathematical reasoning embraced terms                    in
 volving the square of the velocity of the vibrating medium, and the
principal    conclusion arrived at was, that the motion of the sphere
 consists  partly  of a vibratory motion, and partly of a permanent mo
 tion of  translation,  the latter depending on the terms which contain
 the  square  of the velocity.   It was thought that this result may have
 important applications in the physical theories of light and heat.
    The solution of the above problem involves that of another of more
 immediate interest, viz. the determination of the resistance to the
 motion of a ball-pendulum vibrating in the air.                Professor Challis
 obtains the same coefficient of resistance as in several previous solu

coverable loss, which science has experienced, in full advantage not
having been taken of the valuable geological information, which has
been exposed by the railway cuttings in different parts of England
during the last ten years; and he suggests the propriety of each
line of railway being systematically surveyed by a competent ob
server, while the cuttings are in progress.
   Anxious to contribute towards so desirable an end, Mr. Strickland
gladly yielded to a request made to him by Captain Moorsom, the
chief engineer of the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway, to un
dertake a geological survey of the line; and he expresses his obliga
tions to that gentleman and to Captain J. Vetch for the valuable as
sistance they afforded him. The line was originally surveyed by
 Mr. Burr, when only the trial shafts had been sunk, and before the
cuttings were commenced; but Mr. Strickland bears testimony to
the accuracy of the account which Mr. Burr laid before this So
ciety.—(Geol. Proceedings, vol.         593; ii.    p.    Phil. Mag.

mains at only one point in the line of the railway, Mr. Strickland
states that he can offer no other explanation than that previously
proposed by him *, namely, that after the beds of marine gravel had
been deposited and laid dry by the elevation of the land, a large
river or chain of lakes extended down the valley of the Avon, at a
height varying from twenty to fifty feet above its present course;
and that the gravel previously accumulated by marine currents was
remodified by the river, and mixed up with remains of mammalia
which tenanted its banks, or of mollusca which inhabited its waters.
    Local gravel.—This species of detritus occurs abundantly at Chel
tenham, and consists exclusively of detritus from the oolites and lias
of the vicinity. No bones or terrestrial remains have been found init,

X.    DR; AMBROGIO                           FUSINIERI                seems to blame me
           for not having alluded, in my fourth Memoirt, to the
interesting work of M. de la Rive, entitled, “Inquiry into the
Cause of Voltaic Electricity't.”                       I
                                            did not instantly allege
in my   excuse the   having written and sent the said memoir to
the Secretary of the Italian Society of Sciences, some time
previous to my becoming acquainted with the said work, which
had been kindly presented to me only in the November of
1836, by my illustrious colleague, Prof. de la Rive, this cir
cumstance having little interest for the scientific, for whom                                    I
intend to write, and still less for science; but       applied myself      I
instead to  study  the work  itself, as soon as I was able to do so.

he should see that the same facts are reproduced which were
already published by him in 1828, when he wished to found
his theory; and of the many arguments and experiments
brought forward by me, he only speaks of two or three
secondary in importance, and not with the profundity which
one might expect from so distinguished a physicist
    In the first part of my said memoir I treat of the influence
 which voltaic currents exercise in changing the relative electro
motive property of the metals, and of that which is exercised
upon them by the liquid conductors, in which are immersed
the metals themselves; and I established some facts which
ought to serve as the rationale of some experiments produced
 by M. de la Rive as inexplicable except upon his theory.
 But of these we will not speak here. Nor let any one inter
 pret this silence into denial or disapprobation, since the same
 M. de la Rive, in his historical sketch of the principal facts
 discovered in electricity, makes mention of                these, and not           all
 only without starting       doubt        them,   but also with expres

  chemical action shall commence, or if the part of the plate of
  iron immersed in the liquid is exposed for a moment to the
  air, which quickly determines the action, that iron itself be
  comes positive.       And  I   in the first place inquired whence
  might arise the negative electrization in the iron, and conse
  quently positive in the lead, in the first instant that the cop

 place    I demonstrated that the nitric acid increases the electro
 tism both in the iron and the lead, but more in the latter than
 in the former.       I showed, in the third place, that it was an
 error to believe that causing the iron to be exposed to the air
 might be the cause by which it was electrified positively, on
 again putting it into the acid, because the cause of this posi
 tive electrization of the iron was the alteration which the lead
 suffered in the acid in which it was left immersed whilst the
  iron was kept in the air. And I proved, lastly, that to explain
 those experiments by the chemical theory, it is necessary to
 suppose now that the action of the acid renders the iron posi
 tive with respect to the lead, now that it renders it negative;
 now we must suppose that the action of the acid may be less
 forcible in the first instants upon the iron than upon the lead;
 now we must suppose the contrary. (§ XXVII.)
     Another experiment quoted by M. de la Rive was, that two
 plates, the one of gold, the other of the purest platina, being
 fixed to the extremity of the galvanometric wire, and im
|.
 mersed in the pure nitric acid, a very sensible current took
          when a drop of hydrochloric acid was added to the said
   iquid.    And   I demonstrated by ten experiments, first, that
 the nitric    acid,  mixed with very little hydrochloric acid,      in
creases the relative electromotive faculty both in the gold and in
the platina, but more in the latter than in the former; secondly,
that such phaenomena are not derived from electricity imme
diately developed by the chemical action; thirdly, that it is
impossible to explain     byall the phaenomena which are observed
in   these  experiments        the new theory.   (§    XXV.)
     And all these facts stated
              to                       inthe first section of the second
part  of    my before-mentioned memoir, and which contradict
the chemical theory       of   electromotors, what arguments does
M.   de   la  Rive   oppose?      Perhaps Signor Fusinieri believes
that the silence of the learned Genevan          is   sufficient confuta

    XII. I must      not abandon this argument without making
some observations respecting a singular proposition which is
read towards the end of the tenth page of M. de la Rive's
work, expressed in the following terms: “Lors']ue le liquide
dans leguel plongent les deux élémens du couple, estle même,
il n'existe pas un seul cas dans leguel on ait vu le métal le
moins attaqué etre positif par rapport à l'autre.”
   Yet in the actual state of the science it is very easy to find
many cases in which it is not yet known which element of the
pair may be the most acted upon, although it may be un
doubted that the pair itself produces a voltaic current. Which,
for example, of the following substances—silver, gold, platina,
carburet of iron, and peroxide of manganese—is most acted
upon by distilled water?          Yet, whatever pair may be made
with the said metals, there is a current when it is immersed
in the said liquid.             If
                             it be shown that charcoal, well freed
from hydrogen and extinguished for some time, may be more
acted upon by distilled water than the silver, gold and platina,
by which it may have to electrify itself, how does it happen
when positively voltaically united with those metals and                               in
mersed in the same liquid 2                         If

itself, when it is oxidated, may be less acted upon by distilled
water than the noble metals, yet made into a pair with them
it acquires negative electricity.                       If
                                             it be shown that tin may

   A plate of gold with a surface of eight square centimeters,
coupled with one of platina having a surface of one square
decimeter, immersed in the said liquid, produced the deviation
of a degree and a half, which indicated that the gold was
positive in contact with the platina.
    And thus, with any other of the above-mentioned pairs
whatever, a current was obtained, which indicated that one
of the metals was positive and the other negative.

    Ishould believe, moreover, that one only of the above
mentioned facts would suffice to justify the proposition which
may be read at the end of §               XXVII.
                                          of my memoir already
quoted, “that the new theory is not sufficient to explain all
the phaenomena presented by simple electromotors, when the
two plates of which they are formed are immersed in the same
liquid.”
    XIV.     Then when the two   elements of the voltaic pair are
immersed in different   liquids,  the cases are very many which
contradict the new theory, and as elsewhere I have observed,
they may be multiplied almost at the will of the experimenter.
These were considered by M. de la Rive as apparent anoma
lies, and to explain them, I supposed that the two electric
principles tend to reunite themselves immediately in both
liquids, that such reunion is more easy in the liquid which
gives a positive action, and therefore the metal there immersed
is negative.
    Concerning this hypothetical explanation, a<U+017F>ter having
pointed out in § XXX. of my memoir three things to me
incomprehensible in         it,demonstrated, with the assistance
                               I                                                                   of
experiment, that admitting those immediate reunions                   the                     of
electric  principles,  very   many   facts are found       contradictionin
 to the theory. And       Iconcluded        “a thing not easy
                                                it                    ad                 to   be

which       not    any
                     in manner    square    with the new theory.” And
I  terminated that section with some experiments derived from
 two then recent observations          Signor Becquerel, from which
                                           of
 was inferred   clearly  “that      the voltaic pair

538       Prof. Marianini's Eramination of an Experiment
not sufficient to explain the phaenomena of the complex elec
tromotorS.
    The chemical theory being shown insufficient to explain
the phaenomena of the simple electromotors, the insufficiency
as to the explanation of the phaenomena of the complex elec
tromotors was naturally deduced as a corollary from it; and
I  opposed besides the argument of the invariability of the ten
sion, whatever may be the liquid in which the voltaic pairs
are immersed, when neither their number nor their quality
vary.     And to anticipate the reply which would perhaps be
made to that argument, that                            is,
                                        that although the different
fluids   may  not exert    equal  chemical actions upon the voltaic
pairs, yet the difference                    of
                                  the actions exerted upon the two
elements       the pair being equal, the tension also must

the tension will depend upon the greater            less facility which or

              the  electricity  accumulated        one pole will not   at

  But behold us finally at some of my experiments, which the
 learned Genevan undertakes to examine.
     Such experiments are only variations of the last one above
 recorded.       In order to render the transmission of the electric
 fluid  through     the electromotor more difficult, I put between

542         Prof. Marianini's Eramination of an Experiment
 Every one knows that an electromotor of ten pairs has always
 the same tension, whether the plates are large or small, or even
 some small and others large.           And it is known likewise, that
 the quantity of electricity developed varies much with the va
 riation in the dimensions of all the pairs, or even only of some :
 the galvanometers giving the most certain proofs of                                            it.
    But granted even that this might be,                then true that the
                                                                    is  it
 method      bywhich diminished the conductivity
                            I                                   the pile may       of

                    each pair?      M.                  de
                                                Rive seems   la      say, that          to
 those   pairs   between the      copper     and the     zinc,        which                 of              I

 wire, which were immersed             cups containing the liquid con

             as                                                      And this
 interpolation     I did not make     merely   between some        pairs;  but
 in  some experiments those arcs were interpolated between
 every one        of
                  them;          in de so
                              that      came    all          the same con

 dition.     If ever M.           Rive should     say  that those pairs                                     so
 interpolated are not               la

active pairs, and that, therefore, each pair               the interpolated  of
electromotor       developes   less  electricity   than each one           the                        of

the zinc and upon the copper               Now,  ? how        those inactive      do
arcs interrupt the action          the liquid upon the elements
                                         of                                the                        of

                                they alter the quantity            electricity         of

    And yet should
            if         it        pretended that the presence
                                      be                                  that                        of

byof
   a   couple was immersed, might influence the action exerted
     the liquid upon the zinc,           upon the copper
                                                 or
                                                                                        in of

pairs; what influence will the copper wires placed                  the other
successive cups exert?         The experiment shows that the ten
sion   isalways the same, when placing one only                  those inac            of
tive arcs between the pairs            one pile,of    when placing six, as
eight, ten,       any other number whatever between them.
                  or
    And these observations, made relative tension, apply also,      to
with the proper difference,           the decomposing power, which
                                              to
always diminishes, when, the other things being placed simi

adduced by Prof. Faraday in support of Dela Rive's Theory. 548
larly, the conductivity of the pile (whatever may be the me
thod) is diminished.
   But wishing also to concede that those diaphragms or                                                           in
terpolated metallic arcs impart to the pairs the condition that
M. de la Rive desires, how shall we explain the non-altera
tion of the tension, when the electromotor is rendered less
conductive by disposing the pairs, in much larger cups, by
which the liquid strata, through which the electric fluid must
pass, are more extended ? This is the first and principal ex
periment which I oppose to M. de la Rive, regarding his man
ner of explaining the effects of tension and of decomposition,
and of which he does not make mention.
   I said that this was the principal of such experiments, be
cause the insertion of liquid strata of great extent between the
pairs occurring to me as difficult, I have applied to it again
with series of metallic homogeneous arcs, knowing the diffi
culty which the electric current encounters in passing through
alternate liquid and metallic conductors.                 Now, I have re
peated that principal experiment also on a large scale, that                                                      is,
with two electromotors; the one with small troughs,                     which                       in
                             of so
the plates were         disposed, that between the copper                 one                            of
pair and the zinc        the next there was only           stratum      water
                                                                         a                          of
of  the size      one millimeter; and the other with great re
                   of
ceivers,    sothat the stratum           water, which divided one pair
                                                   of

both.
I    have tried also        oblige the current

cently published speak in favour of none of these opinions. We
will here briefly give the conclusions which he has drawn from
his experiments, viz. that the extraction of urea, by the various
methods in which heat is employed, is not at all, as Persoz
supposes, due to the production of this substance under the
influence of heat; that Morin's protochloride of uril is no
thing more than an intimate mixture, or rather a combination
of urea with the chloride of ammonium; that the methods by
which Cap and Henry supposed they had extracted lactate of
urea give merely mixtures in which urea and lactic acid exist
in a free state; that, lastly, urea can be extracted from urine,
by means of alcohol nearly pure, without the employment of
acids or alkalies, of which it might be believed that they de
stroy the natural state of combination of the urea.

      DEAR SIR,             To Richard Taylor, Esq.
At your request we furnish you with a list of the errata contained in our
abstracts.    Most of them are such that every chemist will have been able
to detect and correct them immediately, for instance, Aq O instead of AgO,
where a silver salt is spoken of; and Ag instead of Aq, where nothing about
silver occurs.   We are inclined to believe that most of your readers will
have had the kindness to regard them as typographical errors, and will not
have considered their occurrence a fair occasion to make a display of their
superior knowledge, as a certain Mr.W.A.M. has done, who informs us that
K I should be written without a dot over the K. We shall endeavour to
obviate the occurrence of such errata in future: at the same time it must be
recollected that the great distance prevents us from having proofs trans
mitted.                                      Yours truly,

        38th;  reading of a paper entitled, “On the action of certain
            Inorganic Compounds when introduced directly into the
Blood.”     By James Blake, Esq., M.R.C.S. Communicated by P. M.
Roget,    M.D., Sec. R.S., was resumed and concluded.
    The present paper is a continuation of a memoir read at the Aca
démie des Sciences of Paris, in 1839, and entitled, “Effets de di
verses substances salines, injectees dans le système circulatoire t.
    After some preliminary remarks on the mode in which the ex
periments were conducted, and on the assistance derived from the
harmadynamometer of Poiseuille (or instrument for measuring the
pressure of the blood circulating in the vessels), the author gives a
list of the various saline substances of which he noted the effects
when they were severally injected either into the venous or the
arterial systems, arranged according to the nature of those effects.
He finds, in general, that all the salts having the same base exert
similar actions when introduced directly into the blood.                 He
carefully inquires into the phaenomena apparently arising from the
direct contact of each of the substances above enumerated with the
animal tissues; and more particularly into the effects produced on
the heart, on the muscular and the nervous tissues, and on the pul
monary and systemic capillaries.
    The first series of experiments related are those on the action of
the salts of magnesia: these are found, when introduced in any
quantities into the blood, to arrest altogether the action of the heart;
but a still more remarkable effect which results, is the complete pro
stration of muscular power. The salts of zinc have a similar opera
tion under the same circumstances, but produce the same effects in
smaller quantities.       The action of the salts of copper, of lime, of
 strontia, of baryta, and of lead, are considered successively in the
order in which they are more closely related by their physiological
actions. The author particularly notices the peculiar action which
the salts of the three last-named substances exercise on the muscular
tissues, occasioning contractions in them during many minutes after
death produced by their introduction into the blood. These mus
cular movements were, in some cases, observed forty-five minutes
 after the cessation of the heart's action. Experiments with the salts
of silver and of soda are then detailed ; substances, which exhibit a
 remarkable similarity in their actions on the pulmonary tissue, on
 the heart, and on the systemic capillaries: for while, in the case of
 all the other salts already mentioned, death seems               produced

No ammonia was evolved from either; and the author                       inclined                                                  to
think that the hydrogen yielded                                 by
                                             the zinc compound resulted from

gold and hydrochlorate of ammonia, electrolyzed with platinum elec
trodes, gave a black powder of the specific gravity 10:3; five grains
of which, being heated, gave only 0.05 cubic inch of gas. The
author proceeds to observe, that the similarity in appearance and
mode of formation of these compounds and of the mercurio-ammo
 niacal amalgam, is strong evidence of identity of constitution, and that
 the non-permanence of the latter substance is due to the mobility of
 the mercury; for if we place the compounds in similar circumstances,

also bear immediately upon those           Thénard, Savart, and others,

pendent determination of the magnetic intensity with Hansteen's
apparatus, derived from the data furnished by Captain Belcher's ob
servations, the author shows the extreme improbability that the
differences in the results obtained at Otaheite by Messrs. Erman,
FitzRoy and Belcher, should be occasioned by instrumental or ob
servational error. They are also far greater than can, with any de
gree of probability, be ascribed to periodical or accidental variations
in the magnetic force from its mean value. The only known cause
adequate to their explanation is what may with propriety be termed
Station error; that                   is,

    March 4.—A paper was read, entitled, “Miscellaneous Observa
tions on the Torpedo.”     By John Davy, M.D., F.R.S.
    The  experiments   described in this paper were made on a single
fish, of middle size, recently taken out of the water.       Portions of
the electrical organs, cut transversely in thin slices, exhibited under
the microscope many elliptical particles, apparently blood-cor
puscles, the long diameter of which was about 1-800th, and the
short about 1-1000th of an inch, and a few filaments, apparently
nervous, irregularly scattered; some of them tortuous, and all about
the 2000th of an inch in diameter. The latter bore no resemblance
to muscular fibres. The blood contained some globular particles,
having a diameter of the 4000th of an inch, mixed with the elliptical.
The mucus for lubricating the surface was found to contain globules
apparently homogeneous in substance, but of irregular outline, and
in size varying from the 2000th to the 270th of an inch.
    A paper was also read, entitled, “On a remarkable property of
the Diamond.”        By Sir David Brewster, K.H., D.C.L., F.R.S.L.,
V.P.R.S. Ed.
    On re-examining     the phaenomena of parallel bands of light
and shade exhibited    by reflexion at the plane surface of a diamond,
which the author had noticed some years ago, he concludes that
they result from the reflexions of the edges of veins or laminae, of
which the visible terminations are inclined at different angles, not
exceeding two or three seconds, to the general surface.        He gives
an account of several     analogous  facts observable in other crystals,
more    especially those of carbonate of lime, artificially polished in
surfaces inclined to the natural planes of cleavage.
    March 11.-The following papers were read:
    1. “On a Cycle of Eighteen Years in the Mean Annual Height of
the Barometer in the Climate of London; and on a Constant Varia
tion of the Barometrical Mean, according to the Moon's Declina
tion.” By Luke Howard, Esq., F.R.S.
    For obtaining the general results communicated in the present
paper, the author has followed the same method as that he had
adopted in the two former papers laid before the Society on the con
nexion of the barometrical variation with the lunar phases and apsides.
Tables are given of the barometrical averages on successive solar
years, from 1815 to 1832, so constructed as to exhibit the variation
of the moon's influence according to her declination; and also of
these averages on successive cycles of nine solar years, classed
according to the moon's place in declination, on either side of the
equator. The results deduced from these comparisons are, first,
that the barometrical mean in this climate is depressed by the moon's
declination being to the south of the equator; and, secondly, that
this depression takes place gradually, commencing with the moon's

                                          Royal Society.                                               553
being in full north declination, and proceeding through her remain
ing positions to the time when she   crosses the equator to resume the
northern declination;   at which season, the whole pressure that had
been withdrawn from the atmosphere is suddenly restored. The
author thinks there is evidence of a great tidal wave, or swell in the
atmosphere, caused by the moon's attraction, preceding her in her
approach to, and following her slowly as she recedes from these la
titudes; so that were the atmosphere a calm fluid ocean of air, of
uniform temperature, this tide would be manifested with as great re
gularity as those of the ocean of waters. But the currents uniformly
kept up by the sun's varying influence effectually prevent this from
taking place, and involve the problem in complexity.      He finds that
there is also manifested in the lunar influence a gradation of effect,
which operates through a cycle of eighteen years. The mean press
ure of the atmosphere during the first part of this period increases;
and then, after preserving for a year        maximum amount, againits
decreases through the remaining years          the cycle, but exhibits,
                                                                   of
towards     its
              minimum,   some fluctuations before       again regularly              it
increases”.

    The author brings forward in this paper several recent observa
tions on the formation of ice at the bottom of rivers, the conditions
of which corroborate the views regarding the cause of that phaeno
menon, which he presented in a paper on this subject, published in
the Philosophical Transactions for 1835 (p. 329)*, namely, that it
occurs in consequence of the loss of heat by radiation from the bot
tom of the water, in a manner precisely analogous to the formation
of hoar-frost on the surface of dry land, as first explained by Dr.
Wells. . He then answers some of the objections to that theory pro
pounded in an article, under the title of Ground-GRU, in the Penny
Cyclopaedia, and shows that those objections are founded in error,
and possess no validity.

   In the Companion to the British Almanac for 1839, the author in
serted some results which were obtained with a view of ascertaining
the influence of the moon on the barometer and on the dew-point.
Mr. Luke Howard's researches on this subject (ante, p. 552) having
recalled his attention to that paper, he found that some of the results
he had given appeared to indicate that the moon's position in decli
nation influences the barometer.      In order to render this more ma

    April 1.—The following letter, addressed to the President, was
read:—
                            “4,  Trafalgar Square, London, March 25th, 1841.
    “My Lord,       I have the honour of transmitting to Your Lordship
for  presentation  to the Royal Society, an original portrait of Sir
Isaac Newton   by  Vanderbank,     a Dutch painter of some note in that age.
    “This  picture  has now been many years in my possession, and the
tenure by which I have kept it (as a collateral descendant of so
illustrious a man) was too flattering not to have been a source of
great personal gratification.
    “But I consider such a portrait to belong of right to the scientific
world in general, and more especially to that eminently distinguished
Society of which Newton was once the head, and which is now so
ably presided over by Your Lordship.
    “I  have, therefore, to request Your Lordship will do me the
honour to present this original portrait of Sir Isaac Newton to the
 Royal Society in my humble name.
    “Accident having destroyed some of the papers of my family,              I
am unable of myself to trace the entire history of this portrait, but        I
believe more than one member of the Royal Society is competent to
do so, and it is well known to collectors; and a small mezzotinto
engraving of it was published about forty years ago. It was painted
the year before Newton died, and came into the family of the cele
brated Lord Stanhope, who left it by his will to my grandfather,
the late Dr. Charles Hutton, a distinguished member of the Royal
Society, expressly on the well-authenticated account of that eminent
mathematician having been remotely descended from Sir Isaac New
ton, in the following way, as I find on a family manuscript; viz.
‘that the mother of the well-known James Hutton and the mother
of Dr. Charles Hutton were sisters; and the grandmother of James
Hutton and the mother of Sir Isaac Newton were also sisters.”
    “I  have ever considered this very distant connexion with so great
a man should not be an inducement to lead me into any but casual
mention of the circumstance, that I might avoid the imputation of
a vain boast; nor would it have been brought forward now, except
to explain the cause by which this portrait came into the possession
of an individual who is happy in relinquishing it to grace the Hall
of Meeting of the Royal Society.

 Northumberland, with a few remarks on the Rain-gauge.”     By the
 Rev. W. Walton, F.R.S.
   The author shows that if the mouth of a rain-gauge be placed in
 any plane which is not perfectly horizontal, the results will be liable
 to inaccuracy, whatever may be the direction in which the rain falls.
 He thinks that, on many occasions, the drops of rain diminish in
 their size during their descent on entering warmer regions of the
 atmosphere, so as finally to disappear.

 Communicated by S. H. Christie, Esq., Sec. R.S.
   The Kin, which is the stringed instrument here described, was
 the one played upon by Confucius and the sages of antiquity, and is
 therefore held sacred by men of letters. It is made of the Woo-tung,
 or Dryandria cordifolia.     It is convex above and plane below, and is
 wider at one end than at the other; it has two quadrangular aper
tures in the plane surface, which open into as many hollows within
the body of the instrument; and it is furnished with seven silken
strings of different diameters, which pass over the smaller end, and
are distributed between two immovable pegs below.                A bridge
within a short distance of the wider       extremity  gives  these strings
the necessary elevation and a passage to the under surface, where, by
means of a row of pegs, they are tightened or relaxed at pleasure.
The length of the sounding-board is divided by thirteen studs of
macre, or mother-of-pearl, as a guide for the performer; and they
are placed so that the length of each string is bisected, trisected, &c.,
that    is,
         divided into aliquot parts    far   the eighth subdivision, with
                                                       as         as

the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.
   The birds usually met with by the author in this island were
petrels and penguins; and besides these, he found two species of
gull, a duck, a shag, a tern, a small albatros, and a species of Chionis;
and also a remarkable nocturnal bird allied to the Procellaria.     Brief
notices are  given of the forms and habits of these birds.
   6. “Geological Remarks on Kerguelen's Land.” By R. M*Cor

   The northern extremity of the island is described as being entirely
of volcanic origin. The trap rocks, of which the headlands are com
posed, form a succession of terraces nearly horizontal.       Basalt is the
prevailing rock: it assumes the prismatic form, and passes into
greenstone, and the various modifications of amygdaloid and por
phyry.     The general direction of the mountain-ranges inclines to
the south-west and north-east, and they vary in height from 500 to
2500 feet. Many of the hills are intersected by trap dykes, usually
of basalt. Several conical hills, with crater-shaped summits, are
found, evidently the remains of volcanic vents. Three or four very
singular isolated hills, composed of an igneous slaty sandstone, occur
in Cumberland Bay, presenting very smooth outlines, and consisting
of piles of broken fragments, through which the mass protrudes, in
places, in prismatic columns.      Vast quantities of débris are accu
mulated at the base of the hills, in many places to the height of 200
or 300 feet or more, affording strong evidence of the rapid disinte
gration this land is undergoing, from the sudden atmospheric vicis
situdes to which it is exposed.
   The whole island is deeply indented by bays and inlets, and          its
surface intersected by numerous small lakes and water courses.
These, becoming swollen      by  the heavy rains, which alternate with
frost and snow, rush down the sides       ofthe mountains and along the
ravines in   countless  impetuous   torrents, forming,  in   many places,
beautiful  foaming   cascades,  wearing   away  the  rocks,  and strewing
the  platforms  and   valleys below with vast    fragments   of  rocks and
slopes of  rich alluvium, the result of  their decomposition.
   The most remarkable geological feature      in the island is the occur

rence of fossil wood and coal, and what is still more extraordinary,
these are imbedded in the igneous rocks.      The wood, which is for
the most part highly silicified, is found enclosed in the basalt;
whilst the coal crops out in ravines, in close contact with the over
lying porphyritic and amygdaloidal greenstone.
   A few outline sketches of the rocks and scenery, in various parts
of the island, accompany this paper.
   A paper was also in part read, entitled, “On the proportion of
the prevailing Winds, the mean Temperature, and depth of Rain in
the climate of London, computed through a cycle of eighteen years,
or periods of the Moon's Declination.” By Luke Howard, Esq.,
F.R.S.
  April 29.—The reading of Mr. Howard's paper was resumed and
concluded.
   In this paper the author investigates the periodical variations of
the winds, rain and temperature, corresponding to the conditions of
the moon's declination, in a manner similar to that he has already
followed in the case of the barometrical variations, on a period of
years extending from 1815 to 1832 inclusive. In each case he gives
tables of the average quantities for each week, at the middle of which
the moon is in the equator, or else has either attained its maximum
north or south declination.         He thus finds that a north-east wind is
most   promoted    by  the constant solar influence which causes         when                          it,

tions, which possesses several important advantages.            After de
scribing the nature of the transformations which are subsequently
employed, the author proceeds to develope the process he uses for
obtaining one of the roots of a numerical equation.           Passing over
the difficult question   of determining  the limits of the  roots, he sup
poses the first significant figure (R) of a root to have been ascertained,
and transforms the proposed equation into one whose roots are the
roots of the original, divided by this figure                                                  one root        of this

562               Geological Society:—Mr.       J.  Lambert
(lat. about 37°    17', long. about 15° 40') in a N.N.W. direction for
twelve miles.      Its width is about a mile and a half, and its greatest
height 1400 feet." It is composed of clay-slate, resting upon mica
slate, accompanied by beds of milky quartz, and crossed by numerous
ferruginous veins containing sulphate of barytes and gypsum.            The
strata of the clay-slate are generally horizontal, but are sometimes
inclined from 15° to 20°, and even more, where disturbed by masses
of greenstone.
    The vein of the Barranco Jaroso was the first discovered, and
it is now of considerable richness. Its excavations extend more
than 200 yards in length, with every indication of the lode con
tinuing.      The direction of the vein is north to south, between
one and one and a half hours, or 15° to 22}* east of north; and the
inclination is from 65° to 70° east. The breadth of the vein, where
it was commenced at the surface, was half          a yard, but it had    in
creased to three yards at the depth of forty yards, the point to which
 it had been carried in April 1840. The mineral contents of the
vein consist of parallel divisions of several varieties of galena, as cry
 stallized, radiated with an antimonial aspect, brilliant large-grained,
 fine steel-grained, and black, of oxide and carbonate of lead, and
 argillaceous iron ore; carbonate of iron and carbonate of copper
 also occur; and sulphates of barytes and gypsum are abundant.
     Old workings, supposed to have been conducted by the Romans,
 occur in great numbers, principally at the mouths of the Barrancos
or ravines of Pinalbo del Frances and de la Torre. Quantities of mine
timber, decayed iron tools and lamps of clay, have been found in
 them ; but in no case does it appear that gunpowder was used in
 making the excavations.       Large heaps of slags and scoria are of
frequent occurrence; one of the most important being situated be
 tween the confluence of the Almanzora and the Rambla de Muleya
at the foot of the little hill Cabéza de las Herrerias (Head of the
 Forges).
     This hill, Mr. Lambert says, presents the aspect of a volcanic
crater, and has disturbed the tertiary deposits of the neighbourhood.
 He states, that it is an enormous mass of oxide of iron, with a mul
titude of veins of sulphate of barytes; and that it is absolutely
honey-combed by old excavations in the barytes veins, the contents
of which, he believes, were used as a flux in smelting the argen
 tiferous minerals.     The tertiary beds at this locality consist of clays
 resting upon conglomerates, and are all charged with iron. They
 are stated to contain also “ferruginous and jaspery dendrites,” veins
 of felspar and crystals of barytes.
     A tertiary formation extends from the foot of the Sierra Almagrera
to the Sierras de Filabres, de Alhamilla and Cabrera.           The upper
part consists of an arenaceous conglomerate alternating with marls,
 and beds of quartz and other pebbles of various sizes. The clays con
 tain gypsum and sands very similar to those of the vicinity of Paris;
 and numerous organic remains, belonging principally to the genera
 Ostrea, Pecten, and Dentalium; likewise corals.         The formation is
 disturbed in     many   parts by  protruded masses of   greenstone;   also

                      on the Lead Mines                            of the Sierra               de   Gador.                   563

very singular phaenomena.   Gneiss projects above the tertiary strata
in many places.

    In the ravine of Cartala, protruded masses of trap, containing
veins of asbestos, amphibole, and porcellanite, are stated to have dis
located the strata; an inconsiderable vein of trap is also described
as interposed between two beds of limestone.               The slate clays
near the masses of trap, are said to be frequently of a green colour.
    At the eastern extremity of the chain, the limestone is overlaid
by beds of gypsum, containing masses and strings or small veins of
native sulphur.
    There is no doubt that mines in this mountain chain were worked
by the Romans. The ore is generally found in nests or masses of
inconsiderable size; also in veins and branches of limited extent in
any constant direction, crossing each other, and forming almost
always communications between the nests.             Mr. Lambert is there
fore induced to consider these metallic accumulations as of contem
poraneous origin with the limestone.          At the mine of Arnafe, on
the western edge of the Sierra, the ore occurs between two beds of
limestone, having the same direction east, 20° north, and dipping
 with them 80° to the N.E. It is one foot thick, and is accompanied
 by clay. The same agreement has been found in Santa Rosa, Santa
 Catalina, Cruzados, Trinidad primero, and in all the mines situated
 upon the western declivity, looking towards Berja.
     In the Loma del Sueno, and the interior parts of the Sierra, where
 the beds incline only 20° to 30°, but frequently exhibit great dis
 locations, which change their position entirely, and often form
 crests, fissures, and hollows filled with argillaceous substances, are
 found the greatest masses of ore, lying between the beds, and con
 forming to          all
                    their modifications.    Fluor almost always accom

    In    conclusion,       Mr. Lambert observes, that the improvident me

thod of working the ore in that mountain is fast destroying the
best mines; that new trials have not been attended with anything
like success; and that the hardness of the rock renders sinkings
very expensive, and compels adventurers with limited funds to aban
don their undertakings, unless ore be speedily obtained.
   On the polished and striated surfaces of the rocks which form
the beds of Glaciers in the Alps, by Professor Agassiz.
   This paper was accompanied by a series of plates intended to re
present the effect of glaciers upon the rocks over which they move.
   These effects, consisting of surfaces highly polished, and covered
with fine scratches, either in straight lines or curvilinear, according
to the direction of the movement of the glacier, are constantly found,
not only at the lower extremity, where they are exposed by the
melting of the glaciers, but also, wherever the subjacent rock is
examined, by descending through deep crevices in the ice. Grains
of quartz and other fragments of fallen rocks, which compose the
moraines that accompany the glaciers, have afforded the material
which,   moved by the action of the ice, has produced the polish and
scratches on the sides and bottom of the Alpine valleys through which
the glaciers are continually, but slowly descending. It is impossible
to attribute these effects to causes anterior to the formation of the
glacier, as they are constantly present and parallel to the direction of
 the movement of the ice. They cannot be considered as the effects
 of an avalanche, for they are often at right angles to the direction in
which an avalanche would descend; they are constantly sharp and
fresh beneath existing glaciers, but less distinct on surfaces which
have for some time been left exposed to atmospheric action by the
 melting of the ice. In the valley of the Viesch, the direction of the
 scratches is from north to south, or towards the Rhone; the direction of
 those which accompany the glacier of the Rhone is from east to west;
 that of those beneath the glacier of the Aar is first from west to
 cast, as far as the Hospice of the Grimsel; and then from south to
north, from the Grimsel to the Handeck.             If we would account for
these scratches   by   the action of   water,  we must imagine currents of
enormous depth     filling   these highest  Alpine  valleys, and descending
in opposite directions from the narrow crest that lies between them.
In the upper part of the valley of the Viesch, is a glacier, beneath
which runs a rapid torrent, co-extensive in length with the great
current, to which the above hypothesis would attribute the polish
and scratches on the rocks of the valley.                This small torrent
corrodes the bottom of the valley into sinuous furrows and irregular
holes, and polishes the sides of     itsbed; but the polish
                                                                    of of

aspect from that produced       by  the action   ofthe ice, and   the stones
and sand which    it    carries with   it. The polished surfaces beneath
the ice are often salient and     in   high relief. The sides also        theof
valleys adjacent     to   the actual glaciers are frequently polished and
scratched   at great heights above the ice,       in  amanner identical with
the surface beneath       it,but different from the polish      of
                                                                 the bed           of
the torrent.

566                 Geological Society:—M. Roemer on the
  The amount of polish and scratches varies with the nature of
the rocks.    In the valley of Zermatt and Riffelhorn, rocks of ser
pentine are most exquisitely polished; so also are the granites on
the sides of the glacier of the Aar, where they have not been long
exposed to the action of the air.   Gneiss and limestone do not pre
serve their polish under similar exposure, but retain it while they are
protected by ice or a covering of earth.
   These facts seem to show, that the striated and polished condition
of rocks beneath and on the sides of glaciers, is due to the action of
the ice, and of the sand and fragments of stone forming the Ino
raines which accompany                  it.

    A  letter, dated May 6th, 1840, from M. Roemer,                        Hildes                   of
 heim,    toDr. Fitton,           on
                               the chalk and the subjacent formations                                          to
 the Purbeck stone inclusive           the north
                                              in       Germany.    of
    a. Chalk with flints.-This formation, presenting characters which
 exactly agree with those               of
                                    the chalk         England,    offound only        is                       in
 the island      Rugen.
                of            there consists
                                  It                  white limestone, with fre
                                                             of   a
 quent layers       flints, and includes the same fossils.
    M. Roemer        is of
                        opinion that the Rugen deposit
                             of                                     the age    the   to of                of

 Maestricht beds, though most geologists believe                       younger.      be
    In  the north         Germany there are very thick deposits
                             of                                             sand                     of
stone and sandy marls, which correspond, M. Roemer says,                                                       to
the upper subdivision              of
                                 the chalk formation.         The characteristic
fossils are Callianassa (Pagurus) Faujasii, Belemnites                mucronatus,

 Chalk and subjacent formations in the North of Germany. 567
 small corals, &c.    No Ammonites have been found in it. The lo
 calities where it occurs,  are Gehrden near Hanover, Goslar, Qued
 lenburg, and Halberstadt.
    b. Chalk without flints exists near Piena and Luneberg, with the
 same external characters as in England.        Near Ilseburg, Lemforde,
 Dulmen, and other localities, it is represented by sandy marls and
sandstones.     It contains Belemnites mucronatus, many Scyphia,
some Ammonites, &c.
    c. Chalk marl (Pläner Kalk).-This formation             is extensively
distributed and well exposed in the north of Germany, and exhibits
everywhere the same characters as in England.              It contains no
Belemnites mucronatus, but Ammonites varians, A. Mantelli, A. Gu
toni, Turrilites costatus, T. undulatus, Plicatula inflata, &c.
    d. Upper greensand.—This formation, as a greyish green marl,
with grains of silicate of iron, occurs only near Dresden and near
Wal in Westphalia; also in the neighbourhood of Hildesheim.              It
contains Ammonites falcatus, Terebratula biplicata, Ostrea carinata,
Spatangus subglobosus, &c.
    The chalk marl in general gradually becomes more sandy, and
passes into a sandstone with veins of oxide of iron, but which con
tains no fossils.   The sandstone constantly accompanies the chalk
marl.
    e. Gault.—This deposit has not been detected with certainty in
the north of Germany, but M. Roemer thinks it may be represented
by a marl which occurs between Hanover and Hildesheim, and con
tains Hamites compressus; and by a blue clay near Ottbergen. He has
not been able to find it near Aix-la-Chapelle.
   f.   Lower greensand.—The       mineralogical    characters of this
formation are the same as in     England.    It occurs in Saxony, at the
foot of the Hartz, near Celfeld, near Bilefeld, and near Hattern in
Westphalia, also near Aix-la-Chapelle.          Its fossils are not very
numerous.
   g. Hils conglomerate.—To M. Roemer, geologists are indebted
for first pointing out the existence, as distinct deposits, of the
Hils conglomerate and the Hils clay.
    The Hils conglomerate consists of a yellowish or brownish marl,
containing grains of quartz, schist, and oxide of iron. It forms
very thick beds, and includes in some localities very rich iron ores.
It occurs near Brunswick, at Goslai, and near Essen on the Ruhr
in Westphalia.     Its fossils are very numerous, and partly identical
with those of the lower greensand of England; for example, it
contains Terebratula latissima, T. depressa, T. oblonga, T. sella, Ostrea
carinata, O. macroptera, Pecten quinquecostatus, &c. M. Roemer asks
if it be the equivalent of the Neocomien.
    h. The Hils clay is a bluish pure clay, 100 feet thick.    M. Roemer
considers it to be the Speeton clay of England, as it contains Mya
depressa (Phillips), Glyphaea ornata (Astacus ornata, Phillips), and
Isocardia angulata (Phillips), with a great quantity of other fossils,
which are in part Jurassic species, namely, Ammonites sublawis, A.

568          Geological Society:—Prof. Agassiz on Glaciers,
mutabilis, and A. coronatus.         M. Roemer has noticed the Hils clay
near Hildesheim, near Celfeld, where it contains a considerable
layer of iron; at the foot of the Deister near Hanover, and near
Trenndorf.
    i. Weald clay.—A stiff bluish or brownish clay, seldom contain
ing subordinate beds of limestone and sandstone. The fossils are
almost exclusively the same as those enumerated in Dr. Fitton's
memoir on the beds below the chalk in the south-east of England ;
and are entirely freshwater, with the exception of an Astarte.
    k. Hastings sandstone.—In the north of Germany this formation
is composed of a white, grey or fawn-coloured sandstone, sometimes
alternating in the upper part with greyish clay, and contains from
 seven to ten beds of coal.        Its general thickness amounts to 500 or
 800 feet. The beds of coal vary from one to three feet in thickness,
and are separated by sandstone, which is sometimes only a few feet
 thick. The fossils belong to the genera Paludina, Unio, Endoge
 nites, Abies, Sphenopteris, and Lonchopteris, and M. Roemer has
 found every species mentioned in Dr. Fitton's memoir before al
 luded to.       The sandstone is generally less ferruginous than in
 England.
     l. Purbeck strata.-These beds are described by M. Roemer as
 consisting of shelly limestones alternating with thin layers of sand
 stone, and concretional masses of grit. He has observed two dirt
 beds, but as yet no Cycadeoidea.           The shells which he has found,
 are partly marine, partly freshwater, and belong to the genera
 Paludina, Ostrea, Cyrena, Gervilia, Serpula, &c.
      m. Portland stone.
     The Wealden formation, M. Roemer states, is exhibited near
  Helmsted.        He hopes it will be exposed near Hildesheim.           More
 westward it extends from Hanover by Minden, to Iburg and Rheine
 near Munster in Westphalia; furnishing almost everywhere a very
 good coal. The fossils found in the strata below the lower green
 sand, M. Roemer has accurately figured and described in his works;
 and they proved the identity of the Wealden deposits of England
 and the north of Germany.
      A letter from H. B. Mackeson, Esq. to Dr. Fitton, dated Hythe,
  June 7th, 1840.
      On the 19th of May, Mr. Mackeson discovered some portions of
  a  large  saurian, he believes an Iguanodon, near the bottom of the
  lower   greensand     in the vicinity of Hythe. On the 6th of June,
  he revisited the quarry, and ascertained that the work-people had
  followed the remains for upwards of fifteen feet.        On that occasion,
  Mr. Mackeson        superintended    the disinterment of probably a tibia.
  This   bone,   and others   previously  obtained, with their bulky matrix,
  required a cart and two horses for their removal.           Up to the date
  of the   letter,  no vertebrae, teeth,  phalangeal  or smaller bones of the
  extremities had been found by the workmen.             In the same quarry,
  Mr. Mackeson has obtained a         large Ammonite,    Gervillia aviculoides,
  and other shells characteristic of the lower      greensand.

       and the evidence                   of their having          existed in          Britain.            569
    Nov. 4.—A paper was read on Glaciers, and the evidence of their
having once existed in Scotland, Ireland, and England, by Professor
Agassiz, of Neuchâtel.
    M. Agassiz commences by observing, that the study of glaciers is
not new, as Scheuchzer visited, and even drew, most of the glaciers
of Switzerland; and as, at a later period, Gruner and De Saussure
examined them in great detail, and left few of their phaenomena
uninvestigated.      Hugi also, in his account of the Alps, and Scoresby,
in his   descriptions   of the arctic regions, have communicated much
valuable information respecting glaciers, but without giving rise
to any important geological results. Venetz and De Charpentier
first ascribed to the agency of glaciers, the transport of the erratic
boulders of Switzerland, supposing that the Alps formerly attained
a greater altitude than at present, and that the glaciers extended to
the plains of Switzerland, and even to the Jura.                   This assumed
greater height of the Alps M. Agassiz dissents from, as no geolo
gical phaenomena compel him to admit it; and the arrangement of
the boulders proves that the blocks were not pushed forward by the
glaciers, as conjectured by M. de Charpentier.               Moreover, the phae
nomena of erratic boulders extend over                            all
                                                    the temperate and north
ern regions        Europe, Asia and America, and, consequently, could
                  of
not depend upon                             an  greater altitude         the Alps.          of
                             of so
                                                             as
                          local     event                    a
The consideration          these difficulties induced M. Agassiz             resume              to
 the study      glaciers; and after devoting the suitable portion
                 of                                                              five                  of
                                                                                            at all
 successive summers            the study
                                     to       their details, and
                                                        of                 that has
 been written respecting their structure,              has arrived he      the con
 viction, that the formation         glaciers did not only depend upon the
                                             of
 actual configuration         the globe, but was also connected with the
                                  of
 last great geological changes                         its
                                            surface, and with the extinction
                                                  in
of   the great mammifers which are now found                       the polar ice. in
 He   is also convinced that the glaciers did not advance from the Alps
 into the plains, but that they gradually withdrew towards the moun
 tains from the plains which they once covered.               this belief,   Insays,                  he
 he
 is     supported            by
                         many considerations which escaped previous ob
  servers, depending chiefly                 on
                                     the form and relative position              the                   of
 erratic blocks, and the commonly called diluvial gravel, the former
 being     inSwitzerland always angular, and resting                    the latter,     on
 which consists         of
                       rounded materials.        Considered          this point        in                   of
 view, glaciers assume                an
                                entirely new importance, for they introduce
a   long period       intense cold between the present epoch and that
                      of
  during which the animals existed, whose remains are buried                      the                 in
  usually called diluvial detritus.

                                                                                  as   he              by
  peated investigations               of
                                 Switzerland and the        adjacent   portions                             of
  France and Germany, M. Agassiz became desirous                     investigating     of
a   country      which
                 in      glaciers       longer   no
                                                exist,  but       which traces    in                        of

570        Geological Society:—Prof. Agassiz on              Glaciers,
 glaciers, existed in these portions of the United Kingdom at a period
 immediately preceding the present condition of the globe, founding
 his belief upon the characters of the superficial gravels and erratic
 blocks, and on the polished and striated appearance of the rocks in situ.
     M. Agassiz does not suppose that his views respecting glaciers
 will at once meet with the general concurrence of geologists; and
 he admits that the study of the phaenomena of glaciers in different
 latitudes, as well as at different altitudes, together with the exami
 nation of their different effects where in contact with the sea, will
 introduce many modifications in the consideration of analogous
 phaenomena in countries where glaciers have disappeared; but he is
 prepared to discuss his theory within the limits of observed facts,
 conscious of having searched for truth solely to advance the interests
 of science.
    To avoid useless discussion, he states, that in attributing to the
 action of glaciers a considerable portion of the results hitherto
 ascribed exclusively to that of water, he does not wish to maintain
 that everything hitherto assigned to the agency of water has been
 produced by glaciers; he only wishes that a distinction may be made
 in each locality between the effects of the different agents; and he
 adds, that long-continued practice has taught him to distinguish
 easily, in most cases, the effects produced by ice from those produced
 by water.
    Proceeding to the consideration of facts, he says the distribution
 of blocks and gravel, as well as the polished and striated surfaces of
 rocks in situ, do not indicate the action of a mighty current flowing
 from north-west to south-east, as the blocks and masses of gravel
 everywhere diverge from the central chains of the country, following
 the course of the valleys.     Thus in the valleys of Loch Lomond and
 Loch Long, they range from north to south; in those of Loch Fine
 and Loch Awe from north-west to south-east; of Loch Etine and
 Loch Leven from east to west; and in the valley of the Forth from
 north-west to south-east, radiating from the great mountain masses
 between Ben Nevis and Ben Lomond.             Ben Nevis in the north of
 Scotland, and the Grampians in the south, are considered by the
 author to constitute the great centres of dispersion in that kingdom;
 and the mountains of Northumberland, Westmoreland,                Cumber
 land, and Wales, as well as those of Ayrshire, Antrim, the west of
Ireland, and Wicklow, to be other points from which blocks and
gravel have been dispersed, each district having        itspeculiar debris,
           in  many instances      the parent rock,
                                                                     of of
traceable                      to                       atthe head       the
valleys.    Hence, observes M. Agassiz,            plain the cause       the
                                                of is
                                           it
transport must      be
                     sought for in  the centre      the mountain ranges,
and not from    a point without the district. The Swedish blocks on
the coast  of   England  do  not,he  conceives, contradict this position,
as    he adopts the opinion that they may have been transported              on
floating ice.
     In describing the phaenomena presented by erratic blocks and
gravel, M. Agassiz first insists upon the necessity      of  distinguishing
between stratified    gravel  and mud     containing  fossils, which could

         and the evidence of their having existed in Britain.                                                   571
not    have been accumulated by true glaciers, although the materials
may have often been derived from them; and unstratified masses,
composed of blocks, pebbles, and clay.                These stratified deposits
he considers to be of     posterior    origin  to the glacier epoch. The till
of    Scotland,  or the    great   unstratified accumulation of mud and
gravel, containing blocks of different size heaped together without
order, and containing no organic remains but bones of Mammalia
and insignificant fragments of shells, he is of opinion was also not
produced by true glaciers, although intimately connected with the
phaenomena of ice.        The polished and striated surfaces of the blocks
leave no doubt on M. Agassiz's mind that these masses have been
acted upon by ice in the same manner as the blocks which are ob
served under existing glaciers, and which are more or less re
arranged by water derived from the melting of the glaciers.
     Similar detritus fills the bottom of all the Alpine valleys, as that
of the Rhone from its mouth to its junction with the Lake of Geneva,
and the valley of Chamounix: it is found between the Hospice de
Grimsel and the borders of the lower glacier of the Aar; thence to
the neighbourhood of Goutharen in the valley of Oberhasli, at Im
 Grund, in the plains of Meiringen, and in Interlasken ; also between
Thun and Berne.         At all these localities, M. Agassiz considers, the
blocks were left, when the glaciers extended to them.
     With respect to the valley of the Aar, M. Agassiz says it is easy
to prove that the rounded pebbles of Alpine rocks spread along                                                    its
whole course, were not transported                their present position

       and the evidence    of their having existed in Britain.       573
diverging at the outlets of the valleys, and their being oblique, and
never horizontal on the flanks, which they would be, were they due
to the agency of water, or floating masses of ice. The cause of this
obliquity the author assigns to the upward expansion of the ice, and
the descending motion of the glacier.
    The most remarkable striated rocks in the Alps are near Handeck,
and near the cascade of Pissevache; and the best.examples M.
Agassiz has seen in Scotland, are those of Ballahulish, and in Ireland
those of Virginia.
    If the analogy of the facts which he has observed in Scotland,
Ireland, and the north of England, with those in Switzerland, be
correct, then it must be admitted, M. Agassiz says, that not only
glaciers once existed in the British Islands, but that large sheets
(nappes) of ice covered all the surface.
    The author then details the proofs that glaciers did not descend
from the mountain summits into the plains, but are the remaining
portions of the sheets of ice which at one time covered the flat country.
 It is evident, he says, if the glaciers descended from high mountains,
 and extended forward into the plains, the largest moraines ought to
 be the most distant, and to be formed of the most rounded masses;
 whereas the actual condition of the detrital accumulations is the re
 verse, the distant materials being widely spread, and true moraines
 being found only in valleys connected with great chains of - lofty
mountains.
    It must then be admitted, the author argues, that great sheets of
 ice, resembling those now existing in Greenland, once covered all
 the countries in which unstratified gravel is found; that this gravel
 was in general produced by the trituration of the sheets of ice upon
 the subjacent surface; that moraines, as before stated, are the effects
of the retreat of glaciers; that the angular blocks found on the sur
face of the rounded materials were left in their present position at
the melting of the ice; and that the disappearance of great bodies of
ice produced enormous debacles and considerable currents, by which
masses of ice were set afloat, and conveyed, in diverging directions,
 the blocks with which they were charged.           He believes that the
 Norwegian blocks found on the coast of England have been correctly
assigned by Mr. Lyell to a similar origin.
    Another class of phaenomena connected with glaciers, is the form
ing of lakes by the extension of glaciers from lateral valleys into a
main valley; and M. Agassiz is of opinion, that the parallel roads of
 Glen Roy were formed by a lake which was produced in consequence
 of a lateral glacier projecting across the glen near Bridge Roy, and
 another across the valley of Glen Speane.       Lakes thus formed natu
 rally give rise to stratified deposits and parallel roads, or beds of
 detritus at different levels.
    The connexion of very recent stratified deposits with glacier
 detritus, M. Agassiz observes, is difficult to explain; but he conceives
 that the same causes which can bar up valleys and form lakes, like
those of Brienz, Thun and Zurich, may have formed analogous
barriers at the point of contact with the sea sufficiently extensive to

 574           Geological Society:—The Rev. Prof. Buckland
have produced large salt-marshes to be inhabited by animals, the
remains of which are found in the clays superimposed on the till of
Scotland; and he adds, that the known arctic character of these fos
sils ought to have great weight with those who study the vast subject
of glaciers.
    In conclusion, the author remarks, that the question of glaciers
forms part of many of the great problems of geology; that it accounts
for the disappearance of the large mammifers inclosed in the polar
ice, as well as for the disappearance of the organic beings of the so
called diluvian epoch; that in Switzerland it is associated with the
elevation of the Alps, and the dispersion of the erratic blocks; and
that it is so intimately mixed up with the subject of a general dimi
nution of the terrestrial heat, that a more profound acquaintance
with the facts noticed in this paper will probably modify the opinions
entertained respecting                     it.

   Moraine near Dumfries.—The picturesque ravine of CrickhopeLinn,
about two miles north of Closeburn, and one mile east of Thornhill, in
tersects nearly horizontal strata of new red sandstone, and is traversed
by the Dolland rivulet. On emerging from the upper end of the ra
vine a long terminal moraine is visible, stretching nearly across the
mountain valley, from which the Dolland Burn descends to fall into
Crickhope         Linn; and it resembles, when viewed from          a distance, a
vallum of an ancient      camp,    being   covered with turf. It is formed
principally of an unstratified mass of rolled pebbles, derived from the
slates of the adjacent Lowder Hills, with a few rounded fragments
of granite, the nearest rock of which in situ is that of Loch Doon, in
Galloway, thirty miles to the north-west.                Its height varies from
twenty to thirty feet; its breadth at the base is about one hundred
feet, and        its
                length    four hundred yards.

576        Geological Society:—The Rev. Prof. Buckland
 de Bagne, for example,) descend from the transverse, and extend
 across the longitudinal valleys.     Dr. Buckland mentions the mam
 millated, polished and striated slate rocks, about one mile above the
 falls of the Tumel, on the left portal of the gorge of the valley, as
 the effects of a glacier which descended the gorge: he notices also
 the rounded outline and polish on veins of quartz, which project
 eight or ten inches above the weathered surfaces of masses of mica
 slate near the same locality. Similar mammillated masses of mica
 slate retaining striae and flutings are visible at Bohaly, one and a
 half miles east of Tumel Bridge.
    Evidences of Glaciers on Schiehallion.—The north and north-east
 shoulders of the mountain present rounded, polished, and striated
 surfaces, many of which have been recently exposed by the construc
 tion of new roads. On the left flank of the valley called the Braes
 of Foss, and near the thirteenth milestone, a newly-exposed porphy
 ry dyke, forty feet wide, exhibited a polished surface and striated,
 parallel to the line of descent which a glacier from Schiehallion would
 take; and on the right flank, one hundred yards north of the eleventh
 milestone, another and smaller dyke of porphyry presented similar
 phaenomena.      In the intermediate space the recently uncovered slate
 rocks and quartzite are rounded, polished, grooved, and striated,
 parallel to the direction which a glacier would assume where each
surface is situated.
    Moraines at Taymouth.-Two lofty ridges of gravel, which cross
 the park at right angles to the sides of the valley between the vil
 lage of Kenmore and Taymouth Castle, the hill, on which stands an
 ornamental dairy-house, and the gravel, on which are situated the
 woods overhanging the left bank of the lower end of Loch Tay,
 Dr. Buckland considers to be moraines, or the detritus of moraines;
 also the deeply-scored and fluted boulders of hornblende rock, with
 other debris near Fortingal, at the junction of Glen Moulin with
Glen Lyon.
    Moraines in Glen Cofield.—A remarkable group of moraines occurs
on the high lands which divide the valleys of the Tay and the Bran;
and between the sixteenth and fourteenth milestones thirty or forty
round-topped moraines, from thirty to sixty feet high, are crowded
together like sepulchral tumuli. These mounds, composed of un
stratified gravel and boulders, Dr. Buckland says cannot be referred
to the action of water, as they are placed precisely where a current
descending from the adjacent high lands would have acted with the
greatest velocity; and they exactly resemble some of the moraines
in the valley of the Rhone, between Martigny and Löek. The vil
lage of Amulrie is considered by the author to stand on a group of
low moraines; and the road for two or three miles from it, towards
Glen Almond, to traverse small moraines or surfaces of mica slate,
rounded by glaciers.       A few conical moraines appear also on the
high lands between Glen Almond and Crieff.
    Proofs of Glaciers in and near Strath Earn.—This part of the val
ley of the Earn is flanked irregularly with ridges and terraces of
gravel, the detritus of moraines; and on its north side, in the woods

       on the Evidences     of Glaciers in Scotland and England.         577
    adjacent to Lawers House, near Comrie, hard slaty rocks of the Devo
    nian or old red sandstone system have been rounded and striated. At
    the west end of Comrie, near the bridge, blue slate rocks have been
   also rounded and guttered.
       Evidence of Glaciers near Comrie.—In this district Dr. Buckland
    tested the value of the glacial theory by marking in anticipation on
    a map the localities where there ought to be evidences of glaciers
   having existed, if the theory were founded on correct principles.
   The results coincided with the anticipations.         On a hill above the
   gorge, called the Devil's Caldron, near Fentallich,         are rounded
   surfaces of greenstone, partially covered by moraines; and at Kena
   gart, also immediately above the Devil's Caldron, is a small cluster
   of moraines, easily separable into lateral and terminal. Two miles
   up the valley a medial moraine forms a ridge on the level ground, in
   front of the confluence of Glen Lednoch and Glen Garron. The farm
   house of Invergeldy is stated to stand on the detritus of a moraine,
   and the glen descending to it from Ben-na-cho-ny to be partially
  obstructed with moraines. The surface of the granite at Invergeldy,
  which supplied the stone for Lord Melville's monument at Crieff, is
  rounded and mammillated, but too much weathered to present a
  polish or striae.    On a hill of trap, however, half a mile south of the
  farm of Lurg, there is a distinct polish, striated in the direction
  which a glacier descending the subjacent valley would assume. In
  Glen Turret, on the shoulder of the mountain immediately above the
  south-west extremity of Loch Turret, a very deep ravine intersects
  a vast lateral moraine, which Dr. Buckland shows must have been
  lodged there whilst the Loch was a mass of ice, and the valley above
  it filled with a glacier more than five hundred feet above the present
 level of the lake.      At the falls of the Turret, at the lower extremity
  of the gorge, is an extensive lodgement of moraines; and at the
 upper end, on the left bank of the Turret, near a gate which crosses
 the road, the slate-rocks are polished and furrowed; and at both
 these localities Dr. Buckland had anticipated that glacial action
 ought to be found.
      Evidence of Glaciers near Loch Earn.—On the north bank of the
 Loch rounded and furrowed surfaces and portions of lateral mo
 raines are exposed by the roadside; and at Loch Earn Head is a
 group of conical moraines at the junction of Glen Ogle with Loch
 Earn, and at the very point where, had they been brought by a rapid
 current, they would have been propelled into the Loch. It is never
 theless the exact position where the terminal moraine of a glacier
 would be deposited.
      Moraines near Callender.—Moraines        are stated to cover more or
less the     valley of the Teith from Loch Katherine to Callender, and
the    lofty terraces flanking the valley from Callender to Doune are
considered to be the detritus of moraines, modified by the great
floods which accompanied the melting of the ice.          One of them, near
Callender, has been mapped as the vallum of a Roman camp. The
little lakes on the right bank of the Teith, four miles east of Cal
lender, Dr. Buckland considers due to moraines obstructing the

drainage of the country; and the greater part of the first table-land
on the right bank of the Teith, between Callender and Doune,                                                       in
cluding the portion on which stands Mr. Smith's farm, to be com
posed of re-arranged glacial detritus.
   Proofs of Glacial Action at Stirling and Edinburgh.—Having thus
shown that glaciers once existed in the glens and mountainous dis
tricts of Scotland, Dr. Buckland proceeds to point out the evidence
of glacial action at points but little raised above the level of the sea,
and distant from any lofty group of mountains.                   In 1824 he had
noticed that the trap-rock then recently exposed on the summit of the
hill [at Stirling], between the castle and the church, was polished and
striated, but at his last visit in 1840 these evidences had become obli
terated by weathering. The grooves and scratches described by Sir
James Hall on the Costorphine hills near Edinburgh, and on the sur
face of Calton Hill, Prof. Agassiz is of opinion cannot be explained by
the action of water; but they resemble, he says, the effects produced
by the under-surface of modern glaciers. In his recent examination,
in company with Mr. McLaren, of the Castle Rock at Edinburgh,
Dr. Buckland found further proofs of the correctness of the glacial
theory, by discovering at points where he anticipated they would
occur, namely, on the north-west angle of the rock, distinct striae
upon a vertical polished surface; and at               base           its
                                                                nearly horizontal   a

masses could have come in contact with the roof of a low vault. On
the contrary, it is easy, he says, to explain the phaenomena of the
polish by the long-continued action of fragments of ice forced into
the cave laterally from the bottom of a glacier descending the valley,
on the margin of which the vault is placed; and the irregular group
ing of the parallel striae to the unequal motion of different fragments
of ice, charged with particles of stone firmly fixed in them, like the
teeth of a file. The cave is not three hundred feet above the level
of the sea, and the proving of glacial action at this point justifies,
the author states, the belief that glaciers may also at that period
have covered Calton              Hill and the Castle Hills of Edinburgh and
Stirling.
  A paper “On the Geological Evidence of the former existence of
Glaciers in Forfarshire,” by Charles Lyell, jun., Esq., F.R.S.,
F.G.S., was commenced.
    Dec. 2.—Mr. Lyell's memoir “On the Geological Evidence of
the former existence of Glaciers in Forfarshire,” commenced on the
 18th of November, was concluded.
    Three classes of phaenomena connected with the transported
superficial detritus of Forfarshire, Mr. Lyell had referred, for several
years, to the action of drifting ice ; namely, 1st, the occurrence of
erratics or vast boulders on the tops and sides of hills at various
heights, as well as in the bottoms of the valleys, and far from the
parent rocks; 2ndly, the want of stratification in the larger portion
of the boulder formation or till; and 3rdly, the curvatures and con
tortions of many of the incoherent strata of gravel or of clay resting
upon the unstratified till*.     When, however, he attempted to apply
the theory of drifting ice over a submerged country to facts with
which he had been long acquainted in Forfarshire, he found great
difficulty in accounting for the constant subterposition of the till
with boulders to the stratified deposits of loam and gravel; for the
till ascending to higher levels than the gravel, and often forming
mounds which nearly block up the drainage of certain glens and
straths; for its constituting, with a capping of stratified matter,
narrow ridges, which frequently surround lake-swamps and peat
mosses; and for the total absence of organic remains in the till.
   Since, however, Professor Agassiz's extension to Scotland of the
glacial theory, and         its
                           attendant phaenomena, Mr. Lyell has re-ex
amined     aconsiderable   portion      Forfarshire, and having become
                                                 of
convinced that    glaciers existed for     long time   a    the Grampians,in
and extended into the low      country,  many      his  previousofdifficulties

580          Geological Society:—Mr.                  Lyell   on the
bec, was far more intensely cold at one period than it is now”, yet,
that his thoughts had been diverted from the consideration of a long
continued covering of snow on the Scottish mountains, by the know
ledge that the climate of Great Britain during the several tertiary
epochs was warmer than it is at present.         He is of opinion that,
during a period immediately antecedent to the existing, several os
cillations of temperature may have occurred in the northern hemi
sphere.
    Forfarshire, Mr. Lyell divides geologically into three principal
districts: 1st, the Grampians, composed of granite, gneiss, mica
slate, and clay-slate, flanked by a lower range of vertical beds of
old red sandstone, associated with trap; 2ndly, the great syncli
mal trough of Strathmore, occupied by the middle and newer mem
 bers of the old red sandstone; and 3rdly, the anticlinal chain of
 the Sidlaw Hills, consisting of the inferior or grey beds of the old
 red sandstone, usually accompanied by trap.         He further states,
 that it represents, on a small scale, both geologically and physically,
 the portion of Switzerland where erratic blocks are most abundant,
 the Grampians with their crystalline rocks being comparable to the
 Alps, the secondary chain of the Sidlaw Hills to the Jura, and
 Strathmore to the great valley of Switzerland; and that the resem
 blance is increased by the occurrence in Strathmore and on the
 Sidlaw Hills of angular and rounded blocks of Grampian rocks.
    The superficial detritus of Forfarshire, Mr. Lyell divides into
 three deposits: 1st, the thin unstratified covering on the Grampians,
 derived from the disintegration of the subjacent strata, with a slight
 intermixture of pebbles traceable to rocks at a higher level, not far
 distant; 2ndly, the unstratified materials enclosing boulders which
 occur at the base of the hills on both sides of every glen, and not
  due to taluses formed by landslips, but constituting terraces of
 transported debris, with a nearly flat top, and sometimes with two
 steep sides, one towards the river, and the other of less height to
 wards the mountain; and 3rdly, the stratified gravels, sands and
 clays which overlie the unstratified detritus.      Mr. Lyell confines
his observations principally to the second and third divisions.
   The terraces or lateral mounds very generally increase in width
and depth as they descend from the higher to the lower glens, attain
ing in the latter sometimes a thickness of 100 feet, and occa
sionally so great a breadth as to leave only sufficient room for the
river to pass. The inferior part is always unstratified, consisting of
mud and sand, in which large angular and rounded fragments of
rocks are imbedded. These boulders are more and more rounded
as their distance increases from the hills whence they could have
been detached; but they are more frequently flat-sided than pebbles
which have been rounded by water; and they become more diversi
fied in character by the junction of every tributary glen.      In the
upper part the mounds often consist of 40 to 80 feet of the same
materials as the lower, but regularly stratified.     Mr. Lyell then

           Jormer existence of Glaciers in Forfarshire.                             581
proceeds to illustrate his subject by describing in detail the phae
nomena presented by the valley of the South Esk and those of its
tributaries.
  The South Esk springs from             a shallow lake nearly 3000 feet
above the level of       the sea, and twenty miles from Strathmore. For
six miles the river flows through a district composed partly of gneiss,
traversed by veins of granite or eurite, and partly of granite.     The
fragments derived from this high region may be traced downwards
continuously for twelve miles to Cortachie; and as a proof that the
detritus forming the lateral mounds has followed the same down
ward course, Mr. Lyell states that it preserves throughout, as well
in the main as in the lateral glens, an uniformly grey colour; while
the detritus of the lower zone of mica-slate is invariably tinged red,
this colour being also imparted to the debris of the still lower por
tions of the glens, notwithstanding the intermixture of pale brown
materials obtained from the clay-slate of that district.         Another
proof of the detritus not having been drifted upwards, is the absence
in the higher portions of the glens of the blocks of pure white quartz
which abound in the region of mica-schist, and have been derived from
the numerous veins and beds of quartz belonging to that formation.
The chief exception to this arrangement is a boulder of conglomerate
in the bed of the Proson, evidently derived from hills two miles to
the south, but which are considerably above the level of the glen. A
few other similar exceptions have been noticed, but the distances to
which the stragglers have been traced are inconsiderable.      The phae
nomena exhibited      by  the lateral mounds,  Mr.   Lyell states, agree
well with the hypothesis of their being the lateral moraines of gla
ciers; and he adds, that he had never been able to reconcile these
phaenomena, particularly the want of stratification, with the theory
of the accumulations of the detritus during submergence, and the re
moval by denudation of the central portions of a deposit which had
by that means filled the glens. The distribution of an enormous
mass of boulders on the southern side of Loch Brandy, and clearly
derived from the precipices which overhang the Loch on the three
other sides, is advanced as another proof in favour of the glacial
theory.    It is impossible to conjecture, Mr. Lyell says, how these
blocks could have been transported half a mile over a deep lake; but
let it be imagined that the Loch was once occupied by a glacier, and
the difficulty is removed.     Loch Whorral, about a mile to the east
                                                 on its

sides by  precipices    gneiss, and presents

               Jormer existence of Glaciers in Forfarshire.                                                        583
district, Mr. Lyell conceives, mightbewell accounted for by supposing
the union of three or four large glaciers; but he considers it difficult
to explain the accumulation of the overlying stratified materials, the
top of which must be 600 feet above the level of the sea, and facing
the Strath. In following out the narrow ridge which intervenes
between the Proson and the Carity, during last October, in company
with Dr. Buckland, the latter drew the author's attention to a spot
half a mile south-west of the House of Pearsie, where the surface of
a porphyry rock was polished, furrowed, and scratched.        The quar
rymen of Forfarshire also state as a general fact, that rocks of suffi
cient hardness, when first laid bare, are smooth, polished and scored;
and Mr. Blackadder has found on the Sidlaw Hills large boulders of
sandstone grooved and polished.         Another general fact mentioned
by Mr. Lyell            is,
                   that the unstratified boulder-clay becomes more and
more   impervious      the lower part

appears to offer a happy solution of the problem of the marl-loch
gravels, the longitudinal banks being regarded as lateral and medial
moraines, and the transverse ridges as terminal.      The chief objec
tions are the stratification of the upper part of the banks, and the
necessity of assuming a glacier thirty-four miles in length, with a
fall of only 300 or 400 feet of country.                    -
   It has always appeared to Mr. Lyell and Mr. Blackadder remark
able, that the marl-loch gravels at Forfar are nearly 100 feet above
the tract of till which separates them from the valley of South Esk,
in Strathmore.     In the present configuration of the country, water
could not deposit the Forfar gravels without extending to the South
Esk, the detritus of which is distinct, and separated by a low district
of till without gravel. The only explanations of these phaenomena
Mr. Lyell considers to         be either that the till is the moraine of a
glacier, or that there has been a local change of relative levels of
lands, by which the gravel of Forfar was uplifted, or the till to the
northward depressed.
    Another line of stratified detritus ranges at a higher level from
the Loch of Lundie, along the Dichty Water, to the sea at Moray
Firth, a distance of thirteen miles; and it is stated that many others
might be enumerated.            It is only on the coast to the east and west
of  Dundee,     at  heights  varying    from twenty to forty feet, that strati.
fied  clay  and    gravel  have been found by Mr. Lyell to contain marine
shells,    all belonging         known existing species, except
                                to                                       Nucula.                a

it finally reached the sea.        During the second condition, when the

            Glaciers in Scotland and England, Part           II.      587
motion of the ice would be very small, there would be, Mr. Lyell
states, vast accumulations of snow filling the plains and valleys to a
great height, and leaving bare only the higher peaks and precipices
of the mountains. From .these points, he conceives the erratic
blocks were detached and conveyed almost imperceptibly along the
surface of the frozen snow to great distances. Lastly, at the break
ing up and gradual retreat of the glaciers during the third period, he
is of opinion, the boulders were deposited in the various situations
in which they are now found, and that moraines, or lateral and trans
verse mounds, were successively deposited, and lakes formed, by which
stratified materials were accumulated in certain positions.
    The second part of Dr. Buckland's Memoir on the Evidence of
 Glaciers in Scotland and the North of England, was then read.
    The first part of the Memoir concluded with an account of glacial
phaenomena in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh (see ante, p. 569);
and the line of country more particularly described in this portion
extends southward from Edinburgh by Berwick, Newcastle, the Che
viots, the lake districts of Cumberland and Westmoreland, Kendal
and Lancaster, to Shap Fell.        A large portion of the low lands be
tween Edinburgh and Haddington is composed of till or unstratified
glacier-mud containing pebbles.         In the valley of the North Tyne,
 about one mile east of Haddington, is a longitudinal moraine mid
 way between, and parallel to, the river and the high road; and
Dr. Buckland directs attention to the trap-rocks which commence a
little further eastward, and are intersected by the Tyne for four or
five miles above Linton, as likely to present scored and striated sur
faces, where the valley is most contracted.           Four miles west of
 Dunbar another     long  and   lofty ridge of gravel stretches along the
right bank of the river; and for three miles to the south-east of Dun
bar extends a series of terraces or modified lateral moraines.      In the
 high valleys at the east extremity of the Lammermuir hills, between
 Cockburn's Path and Ayton, moraines dispersed in terraces are also
 visible at various heights on both sides of the river; and on the left
 margin of the estuary of the Tweed, three miles north of Berwick,
 round tumuli and oblong mounds of gravel are lodged on the slope
 of a hill 300 or 400 feet above the level of the sea.
    Moraines in Northumberland.—On          many parts of the coast of
 Northumberland,      especially near Newcastle, deposits of till rest
upon the carboniferous rocks.          At the village of North Charlton,
between Belford and       Alnwick,     Mr. C. Trevelyan pointed out to
 Dr. Buckland in 1821, a tortuous ridge of gravel which was sup
 posed to be an inexplicable work of art; but which he became con
 vinced, after an examination in 1838 of the upper glacier of Grin
 delwald and that of Rosenlaui, is a lateral moraine.        Dr. Buckland
 was prevented from     examining    the gorges  through  which the Burns
 descend from the eastern extremity of the Cheviots, but he directs
 attention to them as points where striae and other proofs of glacial
 action may be found.        Immediately below the vomitories of the
 eastern valleys of the Cheviots, enormous moraines are stated to
 cover a tract four miles from north to south, and two from west to

east; and the high road to wind among cultivated mounds of them
from near Woller, through North and South Middleton, and by
West and East Lillburn to Rosedean and Wooperton. On the left
bank of the College Burn", immediately above the bridge at                               Kirk
newton, Dr. Buckland discovered last autumn a moraine thirty feet
high, stratified near the top to the depth of a few feet, but com
posed chiefly of unstratified gravel, inclosing fragmentary portions
of a bed of laminated sand about three feet thick.     Some of these
fragments were in a vertical position, others were inclined, and the
laminae of which they were composed, were, for the greater part,
variously contorted.   He is of opinion that these detached portions
were severed from their original position, moved forward, and con
torted by the pressure of a glacier, which descended the deep trough
of the College Burn from the northern summit of the Cheviots.
    Evidence of Glaciers in the mountains of Cumberland and West
moreland.— Proofs of glacial action, Dr. Buckland says, are as abun
dant throughout the lake districts and in the districts in front of the
great vomitories through which the waters of the lakes are discharged,
as in Scotland and Northumberland.            Thus, in the vicinity of Pen
 rith, near the junction of the Eden with the Eamont and the Lowther,
 are extensive moraines loaded with enormous blocks of porphyry and
slate, brought down, Dr. Buckland observes, by glaciers, which
descended from the high valleys on the east flanks of Helvellyn, and
 in the mountains around Patterdale, into the lake of Ulleswater
 (considered to be then occupied by ice), and from the valleys by
 which the tributaries of the Lowther descend from the east flank of
 Martindale, from Haweswater and Mardale.             A remarkable group
 of these moraines is by the road side near Eden Hall four miles east
 of Penrith; and the detritus of moraines is stated to occupy the
 greater part of the valley of the Eamont, from Ulleswater to                             its
junction with the Eden. On the southern frontier              these moun   of
tains in Westmoreland and Lancashire similar moraines occur on an
extensive scale. Thus, immediately below the gorge through which
the Kent descends from the mountains             Kentmere and Long Sled

upper ends of Windermere and Coniston lakes; and they contain a
large admixture of clay, in consequence of the slaty nature of many
of the mountains. A capping of till and gravel, thirty to forty feet
thick, overlies the great vein of haematite near Ulverston.      The nu
merous boulders upon the Isle of Walney also indicate the progress
of the moraines from Windermere and Coniston to the north-west
extremity of Morecombe Bay.
   Dr. Buckland was prevented from personally examining, during his
late tour, the south-west and west frontiers of the Cumberland
mountains, but he conceives that many of the conical hillocks laid
down on Fryer's large map of Cumberland, in the valley of the
Duddon, at the south base of Harter Fell, are moraines; that some
of the hillocks in the same map on the right of the Esk, at the east
and west extremities of Muncaster Fell, are also moraines formed by
a glacier which descended the west side of Sca Fell; and that many
of the hillocks near the village of Wastdale were formed by moraines
descending westward.        Dr. Buckland is likewise convinced that
moraines exist near Church in the Valley; also between Crummoch
Water and Lorton, in the valley of the Cocker; and near Isle, in
the valley by which the Derwent descends from Bassenthwaite lake
towards Cockermouth, though there are no indications of them on
Fryer's map.
   Near the centre of the lake district are extensive medial mo
raines on the shoulder of the hill called the Braw Top, and formed
by glaciers at the junction of the valley of the Greta with that of
Derwent Water.
   Dr. Buckland had no opportunity of seeking for polished and stri
ated surfaces in the high mountain valleys of the lake district; but
he found them on a recently exposed surface of greywacke in Dr.
Arnold's garden at Fox Howe near Ambleside; likewise near the
slate quarry at Rydal; and on newly bared rocks by the side of the
road ascending from Grassmere to the Pass of Wythburn; he is also
of opinion that many of the round and mammillated rocks at the
bottom of the valley, leading from Helvellyn by the above localities
to Windermere, owe their form to glacial action.
   The remarkable assemblage of boulders of Criffle granite at Shalk
beck, between Carlisle and Cockermouth, Dr. Buckland conceives
may have been transported across the Solway Frith on floating
masses of ice, in the same manner as the Scandinavian blocks are
supposed to have been conveyed across the Baltic to the plains of
Northern Germany.
   Dispersion of Shap Fell Granite by Ice.—The difficulties which
had long attended every attempt to explain the phaenomena of the
distribution of the Shap Fell boulders, Dr. Buckland considers, are
entirely removed by the application of the glacial theory.        One of
the principal of these difficulties has been to account for their disper
sion by the action of water; northwards along the valley, descend
ing from Shap Fell to Shap and Penrith; southwards in the direc
tion of Kendal and Morecombe Bay; and eastward, over the high
table-land of Stainmoor Forest, into the valley of the Tees, as far

which have been put             practice for effecting the regulation.
                                         in                                                                      In

                     it       horizontal cross-arm,
                                         a                  the extremities       to                             of
which are attached springs nearly transverse                  direction      the        in              to

             Regulator         of the Clock-work of Equatoreals.                                        591
cross-arm, carrying at the ends small weights. When the regulator
is made to revolve with a certain velocity, the centrifugal force of
the balls bends the springs till the balls just touch the inner surface
of a drum which surrounds the regulator: the smallest additional
velocity causes the balls to press against the drum and create a
friction which immediately reduces the velocity; and the drum is
made slightly conical, so that by raising or depressing it the velocity
may be altered at pleasure. This construction not only partakes
 of the defects common to all the others, but is liable besides to this
 peculiar objection, that the determinate rate will depend most es
 sentially on the strength of the springs, and will therefore depend
 on temperature and other varying causes.           The other constructions
 (which were practically introduced by Mr. Sheepshanks) depend
 upon the same principle as that of the governor of the steam-en
 gine.    Two balls suspended from the upper part of a vertical axis,
 by rods of a certain length, are made to expand by the rotatory ve
 locity of the axis; and this expansion, when it reaches a certain
 extent, is made to press a lever against some revolving part, and
 thereby to create a friction which immediately checks the velocity.
 In some cases the balls are suspended by rods from the extremities
 of a horizontal arm carried by the vertical axis. This construction,
 adopted in the south equatoreal of the Royal Observatory, may be
 considered analogous to Fraunhofer's, substituting for the springs
 the gravity of the balls;—a change which can hardly fail to be ad
 vantageous.
     Now, the uniformity of rotatory motion of the spindle, in these
 various constructions, depends entirely on this assumption; that                                          if,
 upon the whole, the retarding forces are equal                the accelerating
 forces, the revolving balls will move                       in

594     Royal Astronomical Society:—Mr. Maclear on the
made, which the confined locality admitted of, to secure the canvass
against the effects of the wind. The instrument was erected and
adjusted on the 29th of January, and the observations commenced
the same evening.        They were carried on until the 19th of Fe
bruary, but under very disadvantageous circumstances, principally
from the violence of the north-east wind acting on the unsettled
canvass, and the showers of sand carried into the tent from the
street. This series of observations proved to be unsatisfactory, and
was not used for the determination of the amplitude.
    As one of the objects for which the present observations were
undertaken was to determine the influence of Table Mountain on
the direction of the plumb-line, the sector was next transferred to
a station close up towards the precipitous front of the mountain, on
its north side, and about 1000 feet above the level of the sea.
 Previous, however, to the commencement of the observations at
 this station, Mr. Maclear removed the bisecting wires, which had
been found too thick for several of the stars employed, and substi
tuted cobweb. The observations began on the 24th of February,
and were continued till the 13th of March, when the sector was
dismounted and carried, as before, by coolies to the office of the
Engineer Department in Cape Town.
    The next step in the proceedings was to transport the sector to
 Klyp Fonteyn, the northern extremity of the arc. The party ar
 rived at the station on the 24th of March, and immediately prepared
 to erect the sector on the corn-floor described in the former Notice
 as Jacobus Cotsee's foundation, which is situated at, and rather
 within, the south extremity of the ruin supposed by Captain Everest
 to be the granary of Lacaille.         Before the instrument was set up,
the several   pieces  forming    the bearing  and upper adjustments of the
 tube were    separated,  and   carefully  cleared from sand and dust. A
 tent having been raised, and fixed to iron pins driven into the floor,
 the tube was placed on           its
                                   bearings, and the two barometers sus
pended from the sector tripod.          At the distance       twenty-one feet
                                                             of
 exactly, and due east   of    the sector axis,     anail was driven into the
floor, on   which the axis    of  the repeating circle was placed.
    The observations for zenith distances began                   on
                                                                 the 28th              of

   A cursory comparison of the observations having shown that
those made at the southern station did not deserve the confidence
required in a work of this kind, where the length of a few feet is a
quantity of importance, and experience having proved that good ob
servations could not be obtained under a tent in Mrs. De Witt's yard,
it was resolved to look out for some solid building close to the sta
tion, where the sector could have fair play. Mr. Maclear fixed upon
the Raggebay Guardhouse, and the necessary permission having been
obtained, a hole was made in the roof, the floor taken up and sunk
to the requisite depth, and the sector erected on the 7th of May,
one week after the return of the party from Klyp Fonteyn.
   From the state of the weather, no observations could be obtained
until the 12th, and frequent interruptigns afterwards occurred from
the same cause; so that six weeks were expended on a a work
which,in favourable weather, might have been accomplished in two.
   The sector was dismounted on the 30th of June, and carried
back to the Observatory, where it was again set up in the sector
room on the 2nd of July.      On examination, it was found to be as
perfect as when first received, without the slightest mark of injury.
   The author next proceeds to give the reduction of the observa
tions. The barometers employed at Klyp Fonteyn were made by
Mr. Thomas Jones, and from a comparison of their results with the
Journal kept at the Royal Observatory, it appears that the station
at Klyp Fonteyn is 485 feet above the mean level of the sea”. The
station in the Guardhouse is close to the sea beach; the feet of
the sector tripod could not be more than two or three feet above
high-water mark. The chronometer employed at both stations
was by Arnold, and beats half-seconds.        Its performance at Klyp
Fonteyn was good; at the Guardhouse, the reverse. At the former
place,        its
            rate was actually obtained                         by

596         Royal Astronomical Society:—Mr. Main on the
of observations of the star in question at one station, and in one
position of the sector, into the least number for the same star at the
other station, the resulting mean amplitude from the stars north of
the zenith is 1° 13' 1", 173, and from the stars south of the zenith,
 10 13<U+017F>   14''.961.
     By assigning to the amplitude found from each star a weight
equal to the quotient of the square of the number of observations
of the star by twice the sum of the squares of the errors at both
stations, the group to the north of the zenith gives 1° 13'14". 173,
and the group to the south 1° 13'14".953.              The results of the
two methods of computation may be regarded as identical; and the
 stars north of the zenith give the amplitude less by 0"-78 than the
 stars south of the zenith.       .
     It is not easy to assign the cause of this discrepancy.              Mr.
Maclear inclines to ascribe it to the probable expansion of the tube
at Klyp Fonteyn from the high temperature.             While the observa
tions were made the thermometer was sometimes as high as 93°,
while at the Guardhouse the range was between 57° and 63°.
Lacaille (Mém de l'Acad. 1752) states that his southern group of
stars gave the amplitude greater by 0"-8 than the northern.             This
near coincidence with Mr. Maclear's result is remarkable.
     If the expansion of the tube be the cause of the discrepancy, the
mean between the north and south groups is as correct as if no ex
pansion took place. This mean is 1° 13'14":56, with a probable
 error not exceeding 0"-03.
     The axis of the sector on the corn-floor at Klyp Fonteyn was
 216 feet (reduced to the meridian) south of the centre of the founda
 tion discovered on the 6th of April, and supposed to be Lacaille's
 sector station.     The axis of the sector in the Guardhouse was 45
feet on the meridian north of Lacaille's sector station in Mrs. De
Witt's yard. Now 261 feet = 2":56; which added to 1* 13'14":56
gives 1° 13' 17" 12 for the amplitude of Lacaille's arc.          Lacaille's
value is 1° 13' 17":33*.
     The author remarks, in conclusion, “that although this work
does not clear up the anomaly of Lacaille's arc, it redounds to the
credit of that justly distinguished astronomer, that, with his means,
and in his day, his result from 15 stars is almost identical with
that from 1133 observations on 40 stars, made with a powerful and
celebrated instrument.       Our field of inquiry is now limited to the
terrestrial    measure,  which every friend to science must wish to see
undertaken without      delay,  as a portion of a greater arc to extend so
far as to neutralise local    attractions,   and leave no doubt upon the
true curvature of this    portion   of the southern hemisphere.”

    Of these memoirs, it is sufficient to say that Mr. Henderson's
parallax of a Centauri is discussed at some length; and the result
 is, that there seems       strong probability
                                  a                      sensible parallax of   a                                        in

    Lastly,     indiscussing Bessel's parallax             Cygni, the author  of     61

   An Account of some Experiments made with an Invariable Pen
dulum, at the Cape of Good Hope.        By T. Maclear, Esq.
   When Mr. Maclear was appointed Astronomer at the Cape of
Good Hope, he was desirous of repeating the experiments there
with an invariable pendulum; but it was some time before he had
sufficient leisure to prosecute this measure. The pendulum had
been previously swung in London by Mr. Baily, and also after its
return to this country.    The method of proceeding in such cases is
so similar, and has been so often described, that it is unnecessary
to enter further on that part of the subject. The result of these
experiments shows, that, on the assumption that the pendulum
made 86400 vibrations in London, in a mean solar day, at the tem
perature of 62° in vacuo, and at the mean level of the sea, it made
only 86332.92 vibrations, under the same circumstances, at the
Cape of Good Hope; which is almost identical with the experi
ments of Mr. Fellows, and differing very little from the experiments
of Captain Foster and Freycinet.       A new pendulum, consisting of
a thick brass  bar,  without any  bob,  and furnished with four knife
edges, is about to be forwarded to Mr. Maclear, which he proposes
to swing at the principal stations of the triangulation that is now
 carrying on in that colony.
   An Account of some Experiments made with three Invariable
Pendulums, by Lieut. Murphy, R.E., during the late Expedition
down the Euphrates.       By Mr. Baily.
   When Colonel     Chesney  undertook the expedition down the Eu
phrates, three invariable pendulums were placed under his care, for
the purpose of their being swung at positions more inland than had
been hitherto practised.    Two of these pendulums (iron and copper)
belonged to this Society, and the other (brass) to the Admiralty;
and they are the same that were taken out by the late lamented
Captain Foster.     They had been previously swung in this country,
before the expedition just mentioned, by Mr. Baily, and also subse
quent thereto.    Only two places presented favourable opportunities
for swinging these pendulums during the expedition: the first, at
Port William, near Bir, on the Euphrates; and the other, at Bussora.
The experiments were made by Lieutenant Murphy, and were con
ducted with his usual caution and ability: the details are recorded
in printed skeleton forms, with which he was furnished previous to
his departure; but none of the computations were made till after
Lieutenant Murphy's decease.        The reductions have since been
made by Mr. Baily, on the same data as those already mentioned in
the seventeenth volume of the Memoirs of this Society. On the as
sumption that each of these pendulums made 86400 vibrations in a
mean solar day in London, at the temperature of 62° in vacuo, and
at the mean level of the sea, it is found that they respectively made

      Invariable Pendulums at the Cape and on the Euphrates. 603

        The Neapolitan  Government   having  directed Mr. Simms    con                                         to
     struct   new standard scale, on

     was made for this Society, the object    the present communication
                                                                   of of

  made with the centre yards of each scale.          It appears that 215
  comparisons were made on nine several days by three different per
  sons; and the mean of the whole showed that the centre yard of
 the Neapolitan scale was longer than the standard yard of the So
 ciety's scale, by 002680 of an inch : the greatest differences from
 the mean being + 000520 and —-000365 of an inch.               This new
  scale is marked No. 6; it being the sixth scale of this construction
 that has been made.
     On the Difference of Longitude between the Observatories of
  Madras and the Cape of Good Hope, deduced from Moon-culmina
 ting stars. By T. Maclear, Esq.
     The observations extend from February 19, 1834, to October 10,
 1837, both inclusive, and contain all the corresponding observations
 within that period, except two which appear to be erroneous; and
 amount to seventy in number.        Of these, only three were of the
 second limb.     The result of the whole shows that the difference of
 longitude is 4" 7" 1*56, with a probable error of + 0°53.

 ON THE LIMIT TO THE ACTION OF CERTAIN CHEMICAL REAGENTS.
  M     •
          P. HARTING having examined the action of certain chemi
          cal reagents, has given the following statement as the result.
     1. The sensibility of starch as a reagent for iodine.
    Iodide of potassium slightly acidulated with nitro-muriatic acid,
 tested by a diluted solution of starch, gave the following results.
     1. Containing 1-500dth iodine gave a black precipitate, the upper
 surface was brownish yellow.
    2. Containing 1-1000dth iodine gave nearly the same colour.
    3. Containing 1-2000dth iodine gave the precipitate the same
 colour, but the solution slightly coloured.
    4. Containing 1-3000dth iodine, precipitate bluish black, the so
lution nearly clear.
    5 and 6. Containing 1-4000dth to 1-5000dth iodine, precipitate
bluish black, the solution quite clear.
    7 to 11. Containing 1-10,000dth to 1-40,000dth iodine, very dark
blue.
    12 and 13. Containing 1-50,000dth to 1-60,000dth iodine,  -     blue
with a shade of violet.
    14 and 15. Containing 1-80,000dth to 1-100,000dth iodine, the
upper stratum violet blue, the under stratum violet.
    16. Containing 1-120,000dth iodine, the upper stratum violet,
the under stratum rose-colour.
    17. Containing 1-150,000dth iodine, the whole precipitate rose
colour, with a shade of violet.
    18 and 19. Containing 1-200,000dth        to 1-250,000dth    iodine,
rose-colour, the upper surface only with a slight shade of violet.
    20 to 22. Containing 1-300,000dth to 1-400,000dth iodine, the
whole precipitate of a rose-colour.

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.           605
    23 to 25. Containing 1-450,000dth to 1-550,000dth iodine, the
upper stratum of the precipitate was slightly rose-colour, the under
stratum was white.
    The action took place immediately on the addition of the starch
as far as No. 19.      The following numbers required some period to
elapse first: it  required some hours in the solution of 1-500,000dth
to 1-550,000dth before any effect was produced.
    2. The sensibility of reagents on acids.
    For sulphuric acid, specific gravity 1-829, containing 75-83 per
cent. real acid.
    Syrup of violets did not detect less than 1.250th sulphuric acid
of the above specific gravity, or 1-310th real acid.
    Paper stained by Brazil wood was acted upon by 1-10,000dth,
or 1-12,500dth real acid.

by 1-50,000dth, or 1-62,500th real acid.
    Paper stained by litmus was immediately reddened by 1-20,000dth,
or 1-25,000dth real acid, and after some hours was slightly reddened
by 1-50,000dth, or 1-62,500dth real acid.
    Carbonate of potash occasioned a slight effervescence with 1
250th, or 1-310th real acid.
    For phosphoric acid. — Brazil wood paper and paper stained
with red cabbage detected 1-10,000dth of anhydrous phosphoric
acid.
    Litmus paper was immediately reddened by 1-10,000dth, and
after some hours by 1-30,000dth phosphoric acid.
    Peculiar reagents for various acids.
    For free sulphuric acid.—A concentrated solution of chloride of
calcium occasioned a precipitate, after some hours, in a solution
containing 1-310th of real sulphuric acid.
    A solution of acetate of lead gave a precipitate with 1-50,000dth
 real acid.
    A solution of chloride of barium gave a precipitate with
 1-75,000dth.
    For combined sulphuric acid.—Acetate of lead produced a pre
 cipitate in a solution of sulphate of soda containing 1-36,000dth
 acid.
    Chloride of barium in a solution of the same salt containing
  1-45,000dth acid.
    For nitric acid.—By means of hydrochloric and gold leaf 1-240th
 of nitric acid, spec. grav. 1-32 was detected : the gold leaf was dis
 solved in 24 hours.
     For phosphoric acid.—Acetate of lead produced an immediate
 precipitate with 1-10,000dth anhydrous acid, and with 1-20,000dth,
 after remaining for half an hour.
     Lime water produced exactly the same effect.
     Chloride of barium did not occasion a precipitate in less than
  1-10,000dth.

 606               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
   For arsenious acid.—Lime water in excess produced a precipitate
in a solution containing 1-4000dth of this acid.
   Ammoniacal solution of oxide of copper detected 1-8000dth.

 1-30,000dth; with a more diluted solution the colour of this                                       preci
pitate was not sufficiently apparent.
   3. The sensibility of reagents for metals and their orides.

   Litmus paper reddened by acetic acid was distinctly rendered blue
by 1-80,000dth.
   Hydrate of potash contains 16 per cent. of water, therefore the
quantity   of real potash detected by the above reagents was
1-3600dth, 1-9000dth, 1-24,000dth, and 1-95,000dth.
    For potash.-An alcoholic solution of chloride of platinum occa
 sioned a precipitate in a solution of nitrate of potash containing
 1-205th of this base; a solution containing 1-200dth was not pre
 cipitated by      it.
    A  very concentrated solution          tartaric acid produced
                                                     of                    precipi        a

                         to                                      added. These    be

                                 ANILIN.
   The following are the additional particulars relative to anilin, re
ferred to in our last, p. 281.
   Anilin is a base which with acids readily yields fine crystallized
salts. When exposed to atmospheric air, it soon becomes yellow and
eventually brown, and the same resinous body is formed which is
separated from it by distillation.       It must therefore be preserved
                                                                    quickly

out of the contact of air, and to prevent     itsaction should
distilled.   Anilin may contain   a little water, from which          freedis
 by distillation, taking care, when     athird       has been distilled,

acid produces in solutions of anilin a precipitate which is sometimes
of a deep green colour, and at others of a blackish blue : this acid
appears to be a good reagent for anilin, since it is readily produced
even in weak solutions; when the precipitate is obtained from con
centrated solutions it leaves a considerable quantity of oxide of
chromium when calcined. Oxymanganate of potash and the salts of
anilin suffer mutual decomposition, brown oxide of manganese being
