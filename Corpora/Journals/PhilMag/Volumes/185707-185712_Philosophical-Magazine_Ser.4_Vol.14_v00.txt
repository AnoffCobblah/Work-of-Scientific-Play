 Theory    of the modifications experienced by jets of Liquid issuing
    from circular orifices when exposed to the influence of vibratory
    motions.
 §  1.  TN    the preceding series f, we deduced from the properties
        J-    of our liquid figures the theoretical explanation of the
 constitution of jets of liquid issuing from circular orifices, and
 protected from every disturbing influence ; we have now to study,
 again from a theoretical point of view, the curious phenomena
 which present themselves when vibratory movements are com
 municated to the liquid.           Setting out, according to our an
 nouncement, from an idea of Savart's, we shall show how the
effects of these vibratory motions combine with those of the
forces of figure {forces figuratr ices) which determine the trans
formation into detached masses, after which all the phenomena
in question will explain themselves in a natural manner.
    After having endeavoured to prove, by means of an ingenious
hypothesis, that the agitation occasioned in the mass of liquid in
the vessel by the efflux itself is capable of exciting vibrations in
this mass directed normally to the plane of the orifice, Savart
has shown that the result of such vibrations would be the

2                    M.   J.   Plateau   on   Jets of Liquid under   the
alternate expansion          and contraction of the diameter of the
jet; because the portion of the latter which issued during
the continuance of a vibration directed from within outwards,
would suffer a compression which would augment its thickness,
whilst the portion which issued during the continuance of a vi
bration directed from without inwards would, on the contrary,
 suffer a traction which would attenuate it.            According to our
 former researches, however, the formation of these expansions
 and contractions is due, not to vibratory motions, but to the
 instability of the equilibrium of the figure ; nevertheless, when
 vibrations are communicated from without to the liquid in the
 vessel, and consequently really exist in this liquid, when, for
 instance, a sonorous instrument in a state of vibration is put in
 communication with the sides of the vessel, then the vibrations
 in question must necessarily tend to exert upon the vein an
 action of the kind conceived by Savart ; and if these vibrations
 have a suitable period, there will necessarily be a concurrence
 between their actions and those of the forces of figure.
     Before examining the subject more closely, we must refer to a
 point in our theory concerning jets not submitted to the above
 influence.
     § 2. In the second series, §§ 72, 74 and 82, we have seen that
if,   when      jet of liquid issues vertically downwards, we imagine
                 a
 the motion of translation to be perfectly uniform, the laws of the
 transformation of cylinders apply exactly to the jet and from           ;
 them may be deduced the laws of Savart governing the length
 of the continuous portion, and the tone produced               the shockby
 of the discontinuous portion against               stretched membrane.
                                                        a
 But this uniformity in the motion of translation cannot be real
  ized  ;   itcan only be approached by augmenting the charge*,
  and throughout the length of the continuous part the translatory
 motion      isalways more or less accelerated      whence
                                                        ;     results, that
                                                                     it
  in the   absence   of  the  forces of figure the  jet would necessarily
  become more and more attenuated at greater distances from the
  orifice.     Hence the liquid figure being no longer exactly cylin
  drical, the laws of the transformation of cylinders cannot, with
  out some modifications, be applicable; and we were of opinion                    f,
  that, since the volume of the divisions of cylinderJ      a      less the   is
 less the diameter of the latter, the divisions of jet ought during

    X It will be remembered that the term divisions was given to those por
tions of liquid cylinder each of which became converted into
            a                                                       detached  a
sphere  ; and that during the transformation, the limits of all divisions are
the circular sections at the most contracted parts of the jet.

                     influence   of Vibratory Motions.                             8
withstanding its apparent legitimacy, this was but a hypothesis,
and we were wrong in presenting it as the expression of a fact.
For, in the first place, we were thus led to a conclusion difficult
to admit, that is to say*, that the liquid descends more rapidly
than the divisions, and that, moving thus in a kind of canal
whose dimensions are alternately broader and narrower, its velo
city suffers a series of periodic variations : again, if the divisions
lost volume in the course of the continuous part, it would follow
that the volume of each detached mass would be less than that of
a primitive division ; and as at all distances from the orifice the
same quantity of liquid necessarily passes during the same time,
the number of masses which would strike a stretched membrane
during a second would be greater than the number of divisions
generated in the same time at the contracted section, — a result
evidently irreconcileable with our theory of the influence of vi
brations upon the jet.
  But there is another hypothesis,           equally     probable        a   priori,
which does not involve the difficulties just alluded to, and which
moreover    is, as we shall see, supported      by
                                                experiment.       Instead
of regarding each division, as independent of its adjoining ones,
and thus as diminishing freely and gradually in volume on account
of the attenuation of the jet, so that the volumes of all those
which at given moment are situated on the continuous part of
            a
the jet diminish from the highest to the lowest,           itjust as per
                                                                is
missible to assume that these divisions are dependent one upon
the other, and that, in virtue of this dependence, they all have
the same volume, but that in consequence of the attenuation of
the jet this uniform volume        intermediate between those which
                                   is
would correspond, individually, to the two extreme divisions. This
intermediate volume will consequently be less the more the jet
tends to become attenuated, in other words, the more feeble the
charge.      All complication thus disappears the divisions descend
                                                 :
with the same velocity as the liquid without altering their initial
 volume ;   the liquid does not pass from division to division, and

their length, so that they are longer or shorter according as the
charge is more or less strong.
   § 2a. Since the new hypothesis just presented is simpler, and
since it accords theory with experiment, we shall in future adopt
it, so that the 76th paragraph of the second series will require
rectifying accordingly.
   This hypothesis too, like the former one, leads us to the recog
nition of two kinds of influences acting oppositely upon the law
which governs the length of the continuous part of the jet when
the charge        made to vary

plicity     attainable.
               is
   In the first place, we must remember that              the translatory
                                                                       if
movement were uniform, the proportionality to the square root
of the charge would always be satisfied, even down to very feeble
charges*. But             the divisions descend with the accelerated
                                if
velocity   of  the  liquid, and     we assume that no change results
                                          if
therefrom in the duration of their transformation, they will de
scribe     agreater space during this transformation, so that the
continuous part will be longer than             the acceleration did not
                                                         if
exist ;  and    the  excess, compared    with  the  length of the conti
nuous part in the case of uniform motion, will be considerable
under        feeble charge, whilst
               a                          will be inconsiderable under
                                                  it
very  strong     ones,  for the latter render  the translatory motion in
the continuous part sensibly uniform.             On passing, therefore,
from the first to the second of these charges, the ratio of the
lengths of the continuous parts which respectively correspond to
them will be nearer unity than              the acceleration were zero,
                                                    if
that     to say, nearer unity than the ratio of the square roots of
          is
 the charges.
    But the divisions cannot descend with accelerated velocity
 without becoming simultaneously elongated                        f,
                                                    and hence arise
 two  causes  of diminution in  the period  of transformation.  We
 know, in   fact   that the more the length of the divisions of
                         J,                                                       a
 cylinder surpasses the limit of stability, the greater the rapidity
 of transformation, and, on the other hand, that the elongation
 which the jet thus experiences must diminish the thickness of
its contractions more than that of its expansions; for on the
former the effect of elongation      assisted, whilst on the latter
                                                 is
it   isopposed by the forces of figure.      This second influence,
that     to say, the diminution of the period of transformation —
          is
which diminution       greater the more the velocity of translation
                                    is

tends to render the law more rapid than the proportionality to

the square root of the charge, and consequently its tendency is
opposed to that of the first influence.
    Lastly, there is a third influence opposed to the preceding
one, and hence of the same kind as the first.    As we have already
remarked on concluding the second paragraph, the nascent divi
sions must be shorter the more feeble the charge ; but according
to what has been above remarked, this shortening, by diminish
ing the excess in the length of each division beyond the limit
of stability, ought to tend to augment the period of trans
formation.
    Consequently the 78th paragraph of the second series relative
to the neutralization of the two opposite kinds of influences, and
hence to the manifestation       of Savart's laws from moderate
charges upwards, still holds true; it must be borne in mind,
merely, that the influences to which it refers are not precisely
those indicated in the 77th paragraph of the same series, but, as
may be seen, are somewhat simpler.
    The second part of the 82nd paragraph (2nd series), however,
in which we sought to establish a priori the conditions under
which Savart's laws respecting the tones produced by jets are
realized, cannot now be maintained ; for the considerations there
presented are founded upon the first hypothesis.          Reasoning
according to the new hypothesis, we will remark, that as the
charge increases, the jet issuing from a given orifice approximates
more and more to what it would be were there no acceleration,
and consequently the length of the nascent divisions converges
towards what it would be in such a case ; whence by virtue of
the first part of the same paragraph 82, the laws of Savart will
necessarily be satisfied from smaller, sufficiently strong charges
upwards.      This constitutes all that the new hypothesis can fur
nish respecting the conditions in question ; it does not permit
us to determine the smallest charge under which the same com
mence to be fulfilled, for it provides us with no accurate data for
calculating the length of the nascent divisions.
    Lastly, it will also be necessary to rectify the commencement
of paragraph 83 (second series), which establishes, by the first
hypothesis, the approximate uniformity in the velocity with which
 the contractions are carried over the space corresponding to a
nascent division.      According to the new hypothesis, the trans-
 latory motion of these contractions coincides with that of the
 liquid itself, and consequently we may calculate with exactitude
— for the charge and orifice employed by Savart — by how much
 the velocity has augmented at a distance from the contracted
 section equal to six times the diameter of the latter, i. e. at a
 distance evidently greater than the length of a nascent division :
 the augmentation      thus obtained scarcely exceeds a hundredth.

6             M.  J. Plateau  on  Jets of Liquid under  the
The new hypothesis,       as well as the old one, therefore establishes
the close approximation to uniformity in the motion of the con
tractions through the small space in question, and consequently
the remaining part of the paragraph may be accepted as correct.
     § 3. These rectifications being made, we proceed to the subject
in hand by recalling briefly the modifications which, according to
the researches of Savart, every jet receives under the influence
of vibrations. The first fourteen of the following numbers refer
to jets descending vertically : —
     No. 1. The continuous part becomes shortened.
     No. 2. The thickness of the limpid portion appears augmented.
     No. 3. Each of the masses which detach themselves at the
lower extremity of the contiriuous part becomes flattened first
in a vertical direction, that is to say, its horizontal diameter
becomes greater than that of the sphere it tends to constitute.
     No. 4. These flattened masses, being abandoned to themselves,
 tend to assume the spherical form, about which they only oscil
 late, however, in consequence of inertia ; thus they become
 alternately flattened and elongated in a vertical direction, so that
 their horizontal diameter, which was at first greater than that of
 a sphere of the same volume, becomes afterwards less, then
 greater again, and so on.
     These periodic variations in the horizontal diameter of the
 masses taking place simultaneously with their translatory motion,
 the impression left upon the eye by the rapid passage of any one
 of these masses would be that of a figure presenting a regularly
 disposed series of maxima and minima of thickness; the first
 corresponding to the places passed by the mass in its phases of
 greatest horizontal development, and the second to those by
 which it has passed during its phases of greatest horizontal con
 traction. Now as the successive masses pass (either exactly or
 nearly so) the same places in the same phases of their oscilla
 tions of form, the impressions which they would individually
  produce become superposed more or less completely, and the
  agitated part of the jet presents in a permanent manner the dif
  ferences in thickness in question ; in other words, this agitated
  part appears composed of a regular series of ventral segments
  whose nodes occupy fixed positions.
      When the above superposition is imperfect, each ventral seg
  ment has the appearance of an assemblage of waves, each of
  which constitutes a kind of cone having for axis that of the jet
  itself.  About the half of the first ventral segment is formed by
  the passage of the expansions of the bottom of the continuous
  part, so that the latter terminates near the middle of this ventral
  segment.
     No. 5. The length and diameter of the ventral         segments are

                    influence    of Vibratory Motions.                             '
greater the stronger the charge, and the greater the diameter of
the orifice.  The diameter of the nodes varies in the same manner.
   No. 6. All these phenomena manifest themselves even under
ordinary circumstances, when no vibrations are intentionally
excited in the liquid of the vessel.    The reason of this       that,       is,
on the one hand, the shock of the discontinuous part of the jet
against the liquid into which    falls gives rise to vibrations which
                                    it
are transmitted to the vessel     means of the air and the sup
                                     by
ports;   and, on the other hand, the vessel also receives through
its supports the small vibrations due to external noises which are
propagated     bythe ground.     It   only when,
                                          is                  by
                                                     suitable pre
cautions, the vessel   isprotected from these two influences, that
the jet assumes its natural aspect.
   No.    7.All the phenomena enumerated in the first five of the
above numbers, however, become much more developed and
regular when   a  note, in unison with that which would be pro
duced     by

                                               by
ment in the neighbourhood of the apparatus.      The continuous
part then becomes considerably shortened; the diameter of the
limpid portion increases still more the ventral segments become
                                           ;
enlarged, gathering themselves more together, so that the nodes
which separate them become more elongated; lastly, the dia
meter of these nodes appears diminished.
   No. 8. Other tones, not in unison, as before, though likewise
produced by an instrument in the neighbourhood of the vessel,
act upon the jet in an analogous manner, but with much less
energy.
    Lastly, there are tones which produce no effect.
    No. 9. In the particular case where the note of the instrument
is almost in unison, the continuous part of the jet                is
                                                           alternately
lengthened and shortened, and the beats which coincide with
these variations in length can be recognized            by
                                                    the ear.
    No. 10. When the discontinuous part of the jet            received  is
upon a   body which can only render        determinate note,

happens that the vibrations of this body modify the note peculiar
to the jet.     This does not appear possible, however, unless the
difference in pitch between the latter note and that of the body
which receives the shock does not exceed minor third.
                                                    a
   When the note of the jet       thus modified
                                   is                   by

                                                    a
tion of the body impinged upon, often suffices to cause the jet
to return to its own note, and this return            always effected
                                                        is

  When the difference between the two notes     very small, they

fluence of vibrations are still greater, and acquire a perfect regu
larity when the sonorous instrument (No. 7), instead of being
held at a certain distance from the apparatus, is put in contact
with the sides of the vessel, and when its note is very intense
and exactly in unison with that of the jet.     The continuous part
is then so much shortened, that the upper extremity of the first
ventral segment almost touches the orifice; and, on the other
hand, the superposition of the ventral segments formed by the
individual masses (No. 4) is so exact, that no appearance of
waves is any longer distinguishable.
   No. 12. This extreme regularity permits us to distinguish
clearly the apparent figure produced by the passage of the sphe
rules interposed between the masses. This figure, which occupies
the axis of the jet below the extremity of the continuous part,
also possesses ventral segments and nodes, but both are shorter
than those due to the passage of the masses.
   No. 13. By means of an instrument placed thus in contact
with the sides of the vessel, almost all notes are capable of pro
ducing effects analogous to those of a note in unison with that
of the jet; but these effects are less considerable the greater the
divergence between the note of the instrument and the unison
in question.
   No. 14. Moreover, under these conditions, even when the
note natural to the jet is not in unison with that of the instru
ment, it may be brought into unison even if the difference between
the number of vibrations were large enough to constitute an in
terval of a fifth above, or more than an octave below the note of
the jet.
   No. 15. If the jet, instead of descending vertically, issues
horizontally, then under ordinary circumstances, — that is to say,
when it is not exposed to the influence of a sonorous instrument,
but is allowed to strike the liquid in the vessel which receives            it,
— its discontinuous part presents ventral segments and nodes
like those observed, under the same circumstances, in jets de
scending vertically (No. 6), and the vibrations of an instrument
also modify      in the same manner.
                 is it
   If the jet made to ascend obliquely, the same phenomena
are still observable as long as the angle formed with the horizon
does not exceed from 20° to 25°.
   No. 16. Beyond this limit, however, and up to 45° or 50°,
the discontinuous part assumes other aspects. When the jet                  is
not under the influence of      sonorous instrument, this disconti
                                     a
nuous part appears scattered into       kind of sheaf in one and the
                                                a
 same vertical plane.    Under the influence of vibrations of de        a
terminate period,       may happen that this sheaf resolves itself

into two distinct jets, each possessing regularly formed ventral
segments and nodes ; sometimes, indeed, with a different deter
minate note the sheaf becomes replaced by three jets ; lastly,
there is always one note which reduces the whole to a single jet,
presenting a perfectly regular system of ventral segments and
nodes, and this is the note which also produces the greatest
shortening of the continuous part.
     No. 17. With one and the same charge and orifice, the num
ber of vibrations corresponding to the note which produces the
greatest effect upon the length of the continuous part, and upon
the dimensions of the ventral segments of the jet, is less the
greater the angle between a descending vertical line through the
orifice and the direction in which the jet issues.      The difference
between the numbers of these vibrations in the two cases where
the jet falls vertically and where it issues horizontally is incon
 siderable, but the same becomes very great when the latter case
is compared with that where the jet ascends vertically.
     § 4. In proceeding to the explication of these curious pheno
 mena, we shall devote all paragraphs between this and the 24th
 to the consideration of jets descending vertically.
     Experiment has shown us*, that, in the transformation of a
 cylinder of liquid, the length of a contraction is exactly, or at
 least very nearly, equal to that of an expansion ; and, as we then
 asserted, we shall demonstrate in the sequel that this equality is
 rigorous at the commencement of the phenomenon.                Now this
 result is evidently applicable to the nascent contractions and ex
 pansions of a jet, whence it follows that the respective durations
 of the passages of one of these contractions and of one of these
 expansions at the contracted section are equal.          On the other
 hand, a division of a cylinder or of a jet being comprised between
 the middles of two successive contractions, and being thus com
 posed of an expansion and two semi-contractions,          the duration
 of the passage of a division of the jet at the contracted section is
  necessarily equivalent to the sum of those of the passages of an
  expansion and a contraction ; and inasmuch as these two latter
  are equal, we arrive at this first conclusion : the duration of the
 passage either of a contraction or of an expansion at the con
  tracted section is equal to half the time of passage of a division.
     But we knowt that the number of vibrations per second corre
  sponding to the note produced by the shock of the discontinuous
  part of the jet against a stretched membrane, is equal to double
  the number of isolated masses which impinge upon this membrane
  in the same interval of time ; and, in virtue of our new hypo
  thesis (§ 2), this latter number coincides with that of the divi
  sions which pass the contracted section during the same time;

hence the duration of each of the vibrations in question, like that
of the passage of a contraction or an expansion, is equal to half
the time of passage of a division, and we may thus deduce the
following fundamental conclusion : —
    The duration   of each of the vibrations corresponding to the note
produced by a jet is equal to that    of the passage of a contraction
or an expansion at    the contracted section.
    § 5. Let  us  now   suppose, that, by means of the expedients in
dicated by Savart, the jet is first protected from the influence of
vibrations proceeding from the fall of the liquid into the receiving
vessel and from external noises, and then — the jet being thus
abandoned to the sole action of the forces of figure — that a note
exactly in unison with that which would be produced by the
shock of the discontinuous part against a stretched membrane,
is transmitted to the vessel whence the jet issues, and thus to the
liquid it -contains.     The liquid is in a state of vibration as it
flows from the interior of the vessel towards the orifice ; conse
quently, if these vibrations have a vertical direction, each portion
of the jet which passes the contracted section during the execu
tion of a descending vibration will be animated with the velocity
 \/2gh, together with that of this vibration, and hence such a
portion will contain more liquid than that which would have
passed during the same time in the absence of these vibrations.
The excess of velocity will, in fact, tend to communicate itself to
the part of the jet situated below that which we are now consi
dering ; but, disregarding for a moment the action of the forces
of figure, we must at least admit that this inferior part will, by
its inertia, offer a certain resistance ; and that, as a consequence,
the excess of liquid brought by the excess of velocity will tend to
spread itself out horizontally, or, in other words, to produce a
lateral expansion of the portion of the jet to which it belongs.
   This granted, if the figure (almost cylindrical) which the jet
would assume by the sole effects of the translatory motion of the
liquid and of the circular form of the orifice were a figure of
stable equilibrium, the portion which, under the action of the
descending vibration, expands laterally as it passes the contracted
section, would at the same time strive to regain its former shape.
It follows from this, under the hypothesis in question, that as
the expansion developed itself, it would also propagate itself to
the underlying strata, and would constitute upon the surface of
the jet an elevated wave of a certain length, which would descend
with a velocity equal to the sum of that of its propagation and
that of the liquid.     Again, the portion of the jet which would
immediately afterwards pass the contracted section in an ascend
ing phase of vibration, and which on that account would tra
verse the same with the velocity        V2gh diminished by that of

                  influence   of Vibratory Motions.               11
the vibration, would, for contrary reasons, give rise to a depressed
wave on the surface of the jet, of the same length as the elevated
one, and the former would follow the latter with the same velo
city. Afterwards would come a new elevated wave followed by
a new depressed one, and so on as long as the communication of
vibrations continued.
     But, in consequence of the instability of the cylindrical figure,
and of the tendency of the jet to become transformed into de
tached masses, quite different results take place.    Let us imagine
that the lower extremity of one of the expansions which would
be formed under the sole action of the forces of figure, due to
instability, passes the contracted section precisely at the moment
 when a descending vibration, commences in the liquid.           Then
 inasmuch as the forces of figure push continuously an excess of
 liquid into this portion of the jet, which expands the latter with
 out its having any tendency to return to its former shape, it is
 evident that the quantity of liquid brought at the same time by
 the additional velocity, due to the descending vibration, may
 spread itself out laterally and contribute to the formation of the
 expansion without having to surmount a contrary tendency.
 Besides, since the duration of the vibration is equal to the time
 employed by the portion of the jet, — converted into a nascent ex
 pansion by the forces of figure alone, — in passing the contracted
  section, the upper extremity of this portion will pass the con
  tracted section precisely at the expiration of the vibration, so
  that the immediate action of the latter will have been exercised
  upon the whole portion in question and upon this portion only.
  Lastly, since the expansion produced by the combined actions
  above alluded to has no tendency to efface itself, neither will it
  be propagated to the subjacent strata, and hence it will not give
  rise to a wave.  Thus the portion of the jet under consideration
  will, from the beginning, be more expanded than it would have
  betn in the absence of vibrations ; but it will have the same
  length, and will descend with the same velocity as in the latter
case.
   The descending vibration will be followed by an ascending
one; and as the latter diminishes the velocity of passage at the
contracted section, there will result, as we have already intimated,
a diminution of volume in the portion of the jet under its influ
ence, so that the same will tend to become thinner ; but as the
forces of figure tend to make a contraction of this portion, the
attenuating action of the vibration will again be unopposed, and
consequently no wave will be formed.        We see, therefore, that,
like the expansion which preceded        the contraction thus formed
                                       it,
 by the double action of the forces of figure and of the vibration
will be more developed, though        itwill have the same length,
                                                                         s

12           M.   J. Plateau on Jets    of Liquid under   the
 and will descend with the same velocity, as if the jet were aban
 doned to the sole action of these forces of figure.
    The same thing will take place with all the other expansions
 and contractions.      In virtue of the equality between the time
 employed by    each   of  these portions in passing the contracted
 section and the duration of each vibration, all the expansions
will coincide with the descending, and all the contractions with
the ascending vibrations ; the one as well as the other, therefore,
will preserve their length and their velocity of translation ; but
they will all leave the contracted section in a more developed
condition, in other words, in a more advanced phase of trans
formation than if no vibrations had been produced.
    § 6. But the action of these vibrations does not cease here.
In fact, the velocities of the descending and ascending vibrations,
which, as we have already intimated, change their direction in
the expansions and contractions in order to produce a greater
transversal development in the former, and a greater attenuation
in the latter, cannot destroy themselves in each of these portions
the moment they have passed the contracted section ; these velo
cities, therefore, thus changed into transversal velocities, will
continue, like acquired velocities, to augment those which result
from the forces of figure.
    § 7. In order that the transmitted vibrations may with all
their intensity exert upon the nascent divisions of the jet the
action described in the two preceding paragraphs, it is necessary
that they have a vertical direction at the orifice, as we have above
imagined.    Without doubt it would be difficult to show, a priori,
that in propagating themselves to the orifice, the vibrations there
actually assume this direction ; but Savart, who occupied himself
so much with the communication of vibrations, implicitly admits
the fact.   Indeed, on the one hand he supposes that these vibra
tions merely reinforce those which, according to him, are generated
by the efflux itself, and which are necessarily vertical ; and, -on
the other hand, he nowhere says that, in order to obtain a maxi
mum action, it is necessary to give the sonorous instrument any
particular position.      A.t all events, in case of difficulty it would
suffice to remark, that whatever may be the actual direction ac
cording to which the liquid molecules execute their vibrations in
passing the orifice, we may always — except in the exceptional
case where this direction is exactly horizontal — conceive each
vibration divided into two others, of which the one, being hori
zontal, will have no influence on the transformation of the divi
sions of the jet, whilst the other, being vertical, will exert its
whole action.
   We have assumed, too, that each descending vibration com
mences at the moment when the lower extremity of each expan

                  influence  of Vibratory Motions.                13
sion passes the contracted section ; but if this coincidence does
not exist when the vibrations first exercise their influence, a
struggle will take place between the actions of the forces of figure
and those of the vibrations; and it is manifest that from that
moment the transformation of the jet, which, being a pheno
menon of instability, may be displaced by slight causes, will
cause all the expansions and contractions to advance or recede,
so as soon to establish the above coincidence, and thus to permit
the concurrence and full liberty of the two systems of actions.
   § 8. These principles being admitted, we proceed to show
how, one by one, all the modifications suffered by a jet under
the influence of vibrations follow as consequences.
   We must, in the first place, remember that when the jet is
abandoned to the sole action of the forces of figure, the velocity
with which its transformation is effected remains very small up
to a considerable distance from the contracted section, so that
the corresponding portion of the jet has a calm and limpid
aspect ; in the second place, that at a greater distance the ex
pansions assuming a more rapid and perceptible development,
the jet appears to widen up to the point where the masses detach
themselves ; and lastly, that beyond this point the diameter of
the jet, which coincides with that of these masses themselves, is
 sensibly uniform*.
   Such a jet being conceived, let the note we have heretofore
been considering be produced in its proximity.         Inasmuch as
under the influence of this tone each division leaves the con
tracted section in a more advanced phase of transformation (§ 5),
and as the transformation also departs from this phase with a
greater velocity than it would have had under the sole action of
the forces of figure (§ 6), it necessarily follows that the trans
formation in question will become completed in less time ; con
sequently each division will attain the condition of a detached
mass at a less distance from the orifice, and thus the continuous
part will become shortened.
   And since the expansions are more developed from their origin,
we see, in the second place, that the apparent thickness of the
limpid portion of the jet — which thickness, in each point of the
length of this limpid portion, is evidently that acquired by the
expansions when passing the same — will appear augmented.
   Thirdly, the excess of transversal velocity received by the
transformation from the vibrations, and which continues as ac
quired velocity, must necessarily cause the horizontal diameter of
the successive masses to exceed that of the spheres which these
 masses tend to constitute, so that the said masses will be flat
tened in a vertical    direction.   But, manifestly, this horizontal
                          * Second Series,
                                           § 70.

14              M.   J. Plateau  on Jets of Liquid under     the
extension and this vertical flattening must render the capillary
pressure at the contour of the masses greater than that at points
near the axis, whence there will arise an increasing resistance
which will ultimately destroy the transversal velocity.
     The differences of pressure will then act freely, and the mass
will return towards its spherical figure of equilibrium ; but the
phsenomenon taking place with an accelerated velocity, this latter
figure will not be a permanent one ; on the contrary, the mass
will become contracted in a horizontal, and elongated in a ver
tical direction, until the increasing resistance which results from
the new inequalities between the pressures shall have destroyed
the velocity acquired ; afterwards the mass, being solicited by
the differences of pressure which produced this resistance, will
again return towards the spherical figure, and again go past it
in order to become extended a second time horizontally and flat
tened vertically, after which it will recommence the same series
of modifications, and will continue its oscillations of form as long
as it continues to descend.
     Thus, in the case of unison with the note which the shock of
 the discontinuous part would produce, the phaenomena recorded in
 the first four numbers of paragraph 3 are very simply explained.
     Since, however, the continuous part of the jet reaches almost
 to the middle of the first ventral segment, and consequently
 almost to the point of the agitated part corresponding to the
 first of its maxima of thickness, we must admit that each mass
 attains its first phase of greatest horizontal development a little
 hefore it becomes completely detached, and at the moment, no
 doubt, when it is connected with the mass which follows it only
 by a mere thread.
     As to the appearance of systems of waves presented by the
 ventral segments when the phenomena are not altogether regular,
 it is evidently, as recognized by Savart, the result of the inexact
  superposition of many ventral segments produced individually by
  the successive masses : these ventral segments are seen simulta
  neously, and appear as it were through one another, in conse
  quence of the persistence of their impressions upon the retina.
      § 9. It is evident that the interval of time between two phases
  of greatest horizontal contraction, or, in other words, the time
  employed by each mass in executing a complete oscillation of
  form, is independent of the velocity of translation ; consequently
  the space described by a mass during the time in question in
   creases with the velocity of translation ; but this space is evi
   dently the distance between the central points of two nodes or
   the length of a ventral segment* ; this length, therefore, ought
   to increase with the charge.
      * It is thus that Savart appears to regard ventral segments whenever he

                     influence  of Vibratory Motions.                     15
    The volume of the nascent divisions also increases with the
charge (§ 2), and as each division furnishes a detached mass,
the volume of these masses must likewise increase with the
charge; now the greater the volumes of these masses, the
greater must be their horizontal diameters when the same attain
their maxima and minima ; but these greatest and least diame
ters are respectively the diameters of the ventral segments and
nodes ; hence the diameters of both ventral segments and nodes
ought also to increase with the charge.           The limit, however, to
which this augmentation tends is not a wide one ; for the great
est volume which the isolated masses can acquire is evidently that
which they would possess if the translatory motion of the liquid
were uniform, that is to say, the volume of the spheres into
 which an indefinite cylinder, formed of the same liquid and having
 a diameter equal to that of the contracted section, would resolve
 itself*.
     Again,  if the charge does not vary, but a greater orifice is
 employed, the volume of the divisions of the jet, and hence that
 of the detached masses, will also be more considerable ; now the
 greater the masses the less rapid should be the oscillations of
 form, and consequently the greater the space through which
 they descend during one of these oscillations ; thus the length
 of the ventral segments ought to increase with the diameter of
 the orifice.     As to the respective diameters of the ventral seg
 ments and the nodes, it is evident, from what has been already
 advanced, that they will increase at the same time.
     From the present paragraph it will be seen, therefore, that
 the experimental results in No. 5 of paragraph 3 are once more
 the necessary consequences of theory ; in the case, of course, of
 vibrations having the same period as those of the note natural to
 the jet.    Let us proceed to the Nos. 6 and 7 of paragraph 3.
     §  10.  When    the jet is not exposed to the influence of a sono
 rous   instrument,    but is received in a vessel placed simply upon
 the ground, the principal cause of the vibrations transmitted by
 the air and the supports of the vessel from which the jet escapes,
 is the shock of the detached masses against the liquid into which
  they fall ; it will easily be understood, therefore, that the ma
 jority of such vibrations will have a period equal to that which
  would result from the shock of the masses in question against a
  stretched membrane, and consequently that their action upon
  the jet is explained by what has already been advanced in the
 preceding paragraphs.         The intensity of the vibrations thus pro-
  occupies himself with their length, and in the paragraph which follows we
  have adopted his expressions ; in reality, however, it is manifest that the
  space in question consists of an expansion and two semi-contractions.

 16                   M.    J.   Plateau on Jets     of Liquid under          the
duced, however, not being great, the modifications of the jet can
not acquire all that development of which they are susceptible ;
besides, as the vibrations under consideration are not very regular,
and are accompanied by other smaller and still more irregular
ones proceeding from external noises, the phaenomena must be
affected by such irregularities ; in fact, it was under these cir
cumstances that Savart described the appearance of the waves
within the ventral segments.
   With respect to jets issuing under these circumstances from
two different orifices, and under different charges, Savart mea
sured, approximatively, the lengths and the diameters of the ven
tral segments as well as the diameters of the nodes.     It may be
of use to reproduce here the results of these measurements, in
which the centimetre is assumed as unit.

    We may here remark, that as the length of a ventral segment
 coincides with the space described by a mass during one of its
 oscillations of form, and as the period of such an oscillation is
 constant for one and the same jet, the ventral segments of the
 latter ought to increase in length from the first downwards on
 account of the acceleration in the descent.      It is somewhat sin
gular, therefore, that Savart, who in another part of his memoir
mentions this augmentation in reference to a particular experi
ment, has nevertheless in the above Table given the lengths in
question as if they were absolute ; it is to be presumed that they
refer to the first ventral segment of each jet.      In fact, the expe
riment in which Savart observed       the augmentation of the lengths
of the ventral segments must have rendered the effect more than
ordinarily apparent, since the first ventral segment was generated
very near the orifice.
    § 11. If, whilst the jet is falling freely into the Vessel placed
to receive       it,
                   note in unison with its own
                       a                             produced on an  is
instrument in its neighbourhood, as "'we' have hitherto sup
posed, then under the action of these more intense and perfectly
regular vibrations the modifications of the jet will necessarily be

                    influence   of Vibratory Motions.                      17
more developed ; that is to say, the limpid portion will appear
still a little thicker, the continuous part will become still shorter,
the ventral segments wider, and the nodes narrower.        Moreover,
the superposition of the ventral segments formed by each of the
masses will be more exact, and thus they will overreach one an
other less toward their extremities, so that the ventral segments
which result from their superposition will be more gathered
together, and the nodes which separate the same will appear to
be elongated.      Now such       is,
                                 in reality, as may be seen in No.         7

 in fact, Savart speaks of the great regularity of the ventral seg
 ments which manifest themselves when such              jet

 ment for giving the unison.

unison with that of the jet, then as the vibrations no longer suc
ceed each other at the same intervals as the passages of the ex
pansions and contractions due to the forces of figure, there can
no longer be an incessant concurrence between the two kinds of
actions, and   it will at once be perceived that very complicated
effects must result from these alternations of accord and opposi
tion. Nevertheless we will attempt to unravel to some extent
the phenomena then presented                by
                                        the jet.
    To simplify our task as much as possible, we will assume all
foreign actions to have been previously annulled.           During the
succession of phenomena, let us mentally seize the moment when
the central point of contraction due to the forces of figure passes
                         a
the contracted section precisely at the same time that an ascend
ing vibration      half completed
                   is               this vibration will then evidently
                                        ;
concur with the forces of figure to increase the contraction.           If
the note of the instrument, however, has          a higher pitch than
that of the jet, in other words,      the duration of
                                        if                   vibration
                                                              a            is
less than that of the passage of the contraction,        greater or less
                                                          a
portion of the bottom of the latter must have been in conflict
with the end of the preceding descending vibration, and an equi-
valent part of the top of the contraction will also be in conflict
with the commencement of the succeeding descending vibration,
because these descending vibrations tend to expand the portions
of the jet upon which they act. If, on the contrary, the note
produced      bythe instrument has     lower pitch than that of the
                                            a
jet,it   is evident   that   concurrence
                             a              will exist throughout the
whole of the contraction, but that the commencement of the
 vibration must have been in conflict with, the upper part of the
    Phil. Mag. S. 4. Vol. 14. No. 90. July 1857.                       C

18            M. J. Plateau  on Jets of Liquid under  the
preceding expansion, and that the end of this same vibration
will be in conflict with the lower part of the following expansion.
    It is easy to see that after a certain number of vibrations a
similar effect will be reproduced, in other words, that the middle
of an ascending vibration will again coincide with the middle of
the passage of a contraction, and that this coincidence will occur
periodically and at equal intervals.    For example, if the duration
of a vibration were five-sixths of that of the passage of a con
traction or an expansion, then six double vibrations — each of
which is composed of an ascending and a descending vibration —
would be accomplished in the same time as the passage of five
contractions and five expansions ; and if we commence counting
from one of the above coincidences, another coincidence will
occur at the end of this interval of time ; in our example, coin
cidences will occur at intervals equal to the duration of six double
vibrations. Let us next attempt to discover what takes place
during each of these intervals, or, in other words, between any
such coincidence and the next following one.
    For this purpose let us examine what occurs at the termination
of the first half of one of these intervals.   In the above example
we shall evidently have again arrived at the middle of an ascend
ing vibration ; but if we consider that the interval commences
with the passage of the beginning of a division (§ 4), and exactly
embraces the passage of five whole divisions, we shall recognize
that the middle of a division, that is to say, the middle of an
expansion, is just passing the contracted section at the termina
tion of the first half of the interval under consideration ; this
vibration, therefore, will be altogether opposed by the forces of
figure ; the conflict which is now at its maximum will evidently
have been on the increase up to this moment, that is to say, it
will have been occupying greater portions of the successive vibra
tions, in order afterwards to diminish by the same degrees.
   These principles being granted, let us notice the consequences.
   Each of the contractions corresponding to a coincidence will
leave the contracted section in a more advanced phase of trans
formation, and thus each will become ruptured at a less distance
from the orifice than if no vibrations had been produced ; but
the following contraction, being already under less favourable
conditions, will not be so soon ruptured; and the subsequent
ruptures, up to that of the contraction for which the conflict
between the two actions has been greatest, will, in a similar
manner, be effected at increasing distances from the orifice;
after this the phsenomena will retrograde, that is to say, the
places of successive rupture will remount until a contraction
corresponding to a coincidence again returns, when everything
will recommence in the same order.           It appears, then, that

                    influence of Vibratory Motions.               19
 in such   a jet the continuous part has different lengths which
 succeed each other periodically ; the shortest of these lengths,
 however, ought to be considered as that of the veritable conti
 nuous part of the jet, because in it the continuity is never inter
 rupted, and it must necessarily be shorter than it would be if the
 same jet were not submitted to the influence of a sonorous in
 strument.
    At  the same time, however, the shortening of the continuous
 part ought to be less than in the case of unison. In fact, if the
 note of the instrument has a higher pitch than that of the jet,
 the most complete coincidence between the two actions can, as
 above remarked, only establish itself about the middle parts of the
 contractions where it exists, and at the extreme portions there is
 conflict.   If the note of the instrument has a lower pitch, the
 concurrence, it is true, extends throughout the whole contrac
 tion, but then conflict exists in the adjacent portions of the two
 expansions, between which the contraction is situated ; and as
 these portions admit with less facility the liquid chased thither
 by the contraction, the latter cannot freely obey the two actions
 which simultaneously tend to attenuate it.
    In the second place, the shortening, according to the above,
ought to be less the more the note of the instrument deviates
from being in unison with that of the jet; for the higher its
 pitch above the latter, the less the portion of the contraction
which corresponds to the above-described coincidence ; and the
lower its pitch below the note of the jet, the further the conflict
extends upon the adjacent expansions.
    Lastly, since upon the contractions corresponding to coinci
dences, and up to a certain distance above and below each of the
same, the action of the vibrations favours more or less that of
the forces of figure, the other modifications determined by unison
ought also to be manifested by the jet in an analogous, though
in a less decided manner ; thus the limpid portion will again
appear a little thickened, and the agitated part will have ventral
segments and nodes ; these modifications, however, will be again
less developed the greater the interval between the note of the
instrument and that natural to the jet.
    The complication of the subject permits us, therefore, merely
to enunciate, as results, the following four conclusions : — When
a note of a higher or lower pitch than that natural to the jet is
produced at a certain distance from the apparatus, — 1st, the
continuous part ought to assume different lengths periodically ;
2nd, the shortest of these lengths, which is that of the veritable
continuous part, ought to be shorter than the unchanging con
tinuous part was before the action of the instrument, but longer
than it would be in the case of unison ; 3rd, the jet ought to

20            M.  J. Plateau on Jets of Liquid   under the
present, in a manner analogous to, though less decided than the
case of unison, a small increase in the thickness of the limpid
portion, and a system of ventral segments and nodes in the
agitated portion ; 4th, the development of all these phenomena
ought to be less perfect the more the note of the instrument
deviates from unison, so that notes having too high or too low a
pitch ought to appear inactive.
    We have assumed that all foreign actions were previously
 neutralized; but since these actions tend to produce similar
effects (§ 10), it is evident that if they are left unneutralized
they can scarcely do more than add to the intensity of the phse-
nomena.
    We may here intimate, that notes not in unison with that of
the jet at the same time give rise to other effects, which, in general,
though not very apparent in jets descending vertically, manifest
themselves, as will be seen, when the efflux takes place under
certain obliquities.    These effects depend upon the conflict be
tween    the vibrations and the forces of figure, and consequently
vanish in the case of unison ; instead of diminishing, therefore,
like the effects just studied, the ones now alluded to increase
with the divergence from unison.
    § 13. The first of the four conclusions above enunciated is
precisely verified, in a particular case, by the fact recorded in
No. 9 of paragraph 3. In fact, when the note of the instrument
is very near that of unison, the period of vibration differs very
little from that of the passage of a contraction or an expansion ;
and consequently, when a coincidence takes place, it will be
nearly complete, that is to say, the conflict will extend only over
extremely small portions of the contraction or of the two adja
cent expansions ; for such a contraction, therefore, almost the
same things will take place as in the case of perfect unison ;
hence at the moment when this contraction is ruptured, the
 continuous part of the jet will have nearly the same length as in
the case of unison ; afterwards its length will increase until that
corresponding to the greatest conflict is attained; but, in conse
quence of the near approach to equality between the respective
periods of a vibration and of the passage of a contraction or ex
pansion, a considerable time will elapse before this maximum
occurs, so that the gradual elongation of the continuous part will
take place slowly enough to become perceptible ; lastly, the same
things will occur with the subsequent shortening of the conti
nuous part, and so forth. As to the beats, it is clear that they
result from the mutual reaction of the note of the instrument
and that of the jet; for although Savart does not expressly say
so, we may conclude from the manner in which he adduces the fact
in question, that the jet ought to fall upon a stretched membrane.

                   influence  of Vibratory Motions.                  21
   Except in the particular case of a very small interval between
the note of the instrument and that of the jet, Savart says nothing
of the periodic changes of the continuous part ; neither should
he have done so, as we shall presently see.        For intervals which
do not fulfil the above   condition,   these changes are too rapid for
the succession to be distinguished, so that all the lengths, as well
as all the systems of ventral segments respectively corresponding
to these lengths, ought to appear simultaneously ; hence, under
these circumstances, each of the ventral segments of the jet
ought to appear formed of individual ventral segments not ex
actly superposed, and consequently (§ 8) to present the aspect
of an assemblage of waves. But this aspect was not new to
Savart, for he had observed it (§ 10) in the ventral segments of
jets not submitted to the influence of a sonorous instrument.
    § 14. The three remaining conclusions in paragraph 12 appear
to be confirmed by No. 8 of paragraph 3.              Nevertheless, the
manner in which Savart mentions the facts might throw some
doubt upon the perfect exactitude of this accord.         The following
passages of Savart' s memoir are the only ones which refer to the
facts in question: —
   "  The octave and fifth below the note produced by the shock
of the discontinuous part against a body employed for strength
ening the tone, as well as its minor third, augmented fourth,
 and the octave above, produce upon the jet modifications analo
gous to those just described*, but always with much less energy;
and there are notes which have no influence whatever upon the
dimensions of the jet and the aspect it presents."
    Subsequently, when speaking of a jet received at a small di
stance from the orifice upon a thick solid body, he says, —
    " Just as when the jet is entire, we find that the octaves above
and below, as well as the fifth and minor third above the note in
 question f, also influence the state of the jet, though to a less
degree."
    Lastly, with reference to the modifications experienced by a jet
under the influence of a note in unison with that due to the
shock of the discontinuous part against a stretched membrane,
but protected from every other foreign influence, he remarks
that—
    " Analogous   results are obtained when divers notes are pro
duced upon a stringed instrument in the neighbourhood of the
reservoir, but one of these notes always exercises a greater influ
 ence upon the jet than any of the others."
    Do these passages imply, that, besides the unison, only the
 octave and fifth below, the minor third, the augmented fourth and
              * That is to say, to those produced by unison,
              t That natural to the jet.

22         Mr. W. S. Jevons      on the  Cirrous form of  Cloud.
the octave above, modify the state of the jet ? This is not probable;
for if so, Savart, instead of saying " and there are notes which have
no influence whatever, &c," would have said, and all other notes
except the preceding ones are without influence, &c.         Ought these
passages to be interpreted as admitting that the notes there sig
nalized are, after the unison, the most active ; and that of the re
maining notes of the scale, some are simply less efficacious, whilst
the rest exert no action whatever ? But in this case can we be
lieve that Savart would have expressed himself thus ? We may
further remark, that the augmented fourth indicated in the first
passage is omitted in the second.
     These vague expressions show that Savart studied but little
the influence of notes differing from unison ; at least, under the
present circumstances, it appears to us that neither a partial dis
agreement nor an absolute agreement between our theoretical
conclusions and experimental facts can be deduced.               Happily,
Savart afterwards sought to augment the energy of the action of
the vibrations of the instrument; and the effects, as he then
describes them, ought, as we shall soon see, to be regarded as
altogether confirmatory of our conclusions.

                    II. On the Cirrous form of Cloud.
By W.      S.  Jevons, Assayer, Sydney Branch of the Royal Mint*.
                 is a name denoting those light fibrous tufts, branches,
 CIRRUS  or scrolls    of cloud often seen at great elevations in the
atmosphere ;       and  the general adjective-term cirrous may be con
veniently applied to any appearance in clouds of this fibrous or
feathery character.
     The term was originally proposed by the meteorologist Howard;
 and in defining the cirrus as " Parallel, flexuous, or diverging
 fibres, extensible by increase in any or in all directions," he left
 little to be desired either as to accuracy or conciseness of de
 scription.
     Though so happy in his descriptions and remarks on the ap
 pearance of the cirrus, he merely attempts to explain its form
 ation by comparing it with the well-known experiment of the
 electrified lock of hair.      In this latter phenomenon, the hairs or
 other fibres employed, being all charged with the same kind
  of electricity, become mutually repellent and spread out to the
 greatest possible distances from each other.           The cloud-fibres,
 on the contrary, are generally seen to run parallel to each other,
 often, indeed, to great distances and throughout the most various
              * Communicated
                                by Thomas Graham, Esq.,  F.R.S.

           Mr. W. S. Jevons   on the     Cirrous form of Cloud.                23
flexures, in a manner altogether forbidding the idea of any re
pulsive force between them.      Howard also supposes the cirrous
fibres to act as conductors between masses of dry and moist air
of opposite electric conditions ; but though fibres, once formed,
might be capable of discharging the electricities with greater
ease than the surrounding clear air, it does not appear to me
how the watery particles, which he has moreover to suppose pre
cipitated by some other means, come to be gathered up in this
particular form, — a sort of action with which                I
                                                      know of no
parallel (a regular polar arrangement being  of course  a very im
 probable supposition).
   I  have not been able to find that any more satisfactory theory
 has been yet proposed ; and, indeed, it would seem that, since
 the establishment of Howard's arrangement and nomenclature
 of clouds, but little attention has been paid to their study at all,
 particularly as regards the cirrus cloud.
    A simple and natural explanation of these cirrous fibres                 is,
                                                                              I
•believe, to regard them as minute streamlets of air forcing their
 way through  a   stratum of air of different temperature and mois
ture. We have only to suppose two neighbouring masses of air,
completely or very nearly saturated with aqueous vapour and of
 different temperatures, to filter into each other in minute stream
lets
   ;    and the watery particles which must most certainly be pre
cipitated, according to the well-known theory of Dr. Hutton,
 will be arranged so as to present exactly the forms of these
 streamlets, and in fact produce    a cirrous cloud.
    The extremely lofty position in the atmosphere at which these
clouds nearly always occur, renders       itimpossible for us as yet to
ascertain even the conditions of the air surrounding them          and   ;
the untangible nature of    a   cloud, when reached, would render
direct experiments upon the mode of its formation entirely out
of the question.      In the case of cirrous clouds especially, we
can only observe with exactness their external character and
other apparent conditions, and then employ         sort of circumstan
                                                    a
tial evidence to demonstrate their nature.
    This have attempted to do
       I                            byproducing miniature represen
tations of clouds, under conditions in which the cause of forma
tion could be certainly known.
   The extreme mobility and invisible nature of gases would
render any experiments upon them, on        small scale, extremely
                                                a
difficult and unsatisfactory; but for our present purposes we
may,   I  believe, substitute liquids, for instance water, which
being so much more sluggish and dense, will be so much the
slower and more observable in their motions, and will not require
the same care to prevent        accidental     disturbances       by   tempera
ture, &c.

24       Mr. W.    S. Jevous on t/te Cirrous form    of Cloud.
   Now   a thread-like or stream-like appearance is nearly always
to be seen, more or less, when two liquids of different densities
are being mixed together, as in making ordinary chemical solu
tions, mixing alcohol and water, &c. ; and if a drop of ink be
added to a glass of clear water, it will be observed to sink down
wards into it in tape-like streams, and eventually to spread about
in threads of a more or less cirrous character.
   This same appearance may be shown more or less distinctly in
a multitude of different ways, but the following experiment has
been devised and selected as presenting the most complete and
striking representation of a cirrous cloud ; and it was the acci
dental observation of appearances nearly the same as those pro
duced in this experiment which led me to form the present theory.
   Exp. 1. To about 800 grms. of pure water add 2 or 3 drops
of hydrochloric acid, and 1 grm. measure of a strong solution of
white sugar (spec. grav. of solution 1-15). Warm this to rather
above 100° F., and pour the greater portion into an ordinary glass
beaker about 5 inches in diameter and 9 or 10 in height (fig. 1).
                Fisr. 1.
                                                   Fig.  2.
                                                       L.
                                            a. Discs of flannel or
                                               other stuffing.
This beaker should be surrounded by a second larger one to pre
vent disturbance of temperature ; and a tube-funnel, allowing
only a very slow stream to pass, must be placed in it reaching to
the bottom, and with a termination like fig. 2 ; or with such
similar contrivance as shall prevent all violent currents, and allow
us to introduce further quantities of liquid without the least dis
turbance of the strata above.
   The remainder of the hot solution of sugar must be added by
this funnel j and before this is quite run out, a little pure cold
water is to be added so as to cleanse the apparatus.               Then,
again,  without  allowing  the stream-to  break,   a  second    different
stratum must be added, previously prepared, and consisting of
800 grms. of distilled water at the ordinary temperature of the

          Mr. W. S. Jevons     on the   Cirrous form of Cloud.       25
air, with -2 (T%) of a gramme of crystallized nitrate of silver dis
solved in it. The more gradually this stratum is inserted beneath
the other, especially at the first, the more distinct will be the
result of the experiment.    The nicest management, indeed, and
the most careful and patient manipulation are necessary in order
to prevent any accidental and irregular mixture from taking
place, which would confuse the shape of the cloud ; but even in
his case sufficient cirrous action will subsequently go on, to
answer the purposes of our experiment.
    A white precipitate of chloride of silver, of the usual cloud
like appearance, will immediately begin to form, and from the
first will present an entirely cirrous character.    Small streams
in the form of threads or curiously shaped bands will be seen
passing from one stratum into another, and often curving about
 in the most complicated and beautiful manner.        After a time
the middle of the glass will be filled by a dense and confused
but still fibrous mass of cloud, which will probably soon extend
 itself to the bottom ; but there will now also be seen with the
 greatest distinctness, numbers of these small parallel threads
 ascending and reaching nearly to the surface of the top stratum,
 of considerable length, and ending in evanescent points.
    The slightest circular motion or disturbance communicated to
 the strata will cause these fibres to assume all sorts of curved
 and flexuous forms, which, however, in general still maintain
 their parallelism. And it is upon the exact resemblance which
 this miniature cloud bears to the common appearances of the
 cirrus, that the probability of the truth of this theory must be
allowed principally to rest.
    It is evident that the cloud of chloride of silver is produced
by the gradual mixing of the upmost and lowest strata contain
ing respectively hydrochloric acid and nitrate of silver, thus
representing closely the precipitation of watery particles by the
mixture of portions of moist air of different temperatures.      It
remains then only to consider the manner and cause of mixture.
   The addition of one-eight per cent, of sugar solution was found
to raise the specific gravity of water by about 4-10,000dths (that
 is,
   from 1-0000 to 1-0004 at 60° F.) but when heated to about
                                           ;
100°, its density     not more than about "994 or -995, so that at
                  it is
this temperature      will lie in separate stratum above pure water
                                  a
at 60°.
   The parts of these strata, however, which are immediately in
contact, soon communicate their heat and tend to assume mean     a
temperature  ;  and  it  evident that whenever this
                          is                           the case, the
                                                         is
portions of liquid containing sugar must always  be slightly denser
than those that are pure,i and must consequently sink below and
displace the latter.

26          Mr. W. S. Jevons   on the  Cirrous form of Cloud.
    We shall thus have portions of the upper stratum continually
 sinking into the lower, and corresponding portions of the lower
rising through the upper ; and this movement, as the experiment
demonstrates, takes place by an interfillration of minute, thread
like streams.
     [It is evident that the difference of temperature of the strata
in this experiment is not a material point, being simply a means
employed to enable us to lay one stratum upon another of a
 slightly greater density when of the same temperature, so that
we may afterwards observe the mixing process and change of
place in the most gradual manner possible.]
    Exp. 2. Let the first experiment be now repeated in exactly
the same manner, with the exception of adding the sugar to the
lowest stratum instead of to the highest, as before.
    The appearances will now be totally different : but little cloud
at all will be seen to form, even after a considerable length of
time ; and whatever may happen to be caused by accidental dis
turbance will lie in a uniform or streaked flat sheet at the surface
where it is produced, until it finally subsides to the bottom by
its own density.
    These two experiments exhibit a most striking contrast; and
the only difference of conditions being in the inversion of the
light and dense fluids, we are at once led to the conclusion, that
different portions of liquids may, from the effects of very slight
differences of specific gravity alone, be caused to mix and pass
into each other in the form of minute streamlets, which, if ren
dered visible, as by the formation of a precipitate along their
sides, present exact resemblances in form to the fibres of cirrous
cloud.
    Now    as gases are subject to the same laws   of equilibrium and
pressure as liquids, excepting only as far as       they are modified
by the property of elasticity, it is probable      that strata of the
atmosphere, which, being at perfect freedom to assume the den
sity due to the superincumbent pressure, will be further unaffected
by their compressibility, must act otherwise; just like strata of
very rare liquids, for instance, will, under the same circumstances,
lie in quiet horizontal strata, or will displace each other violently
or gradually, as the case may be. On this account it appears to
me certain, that masses of air, in gradually displacing each other
and mixing by reason of slight differences of density, will exhibit
the same phenomena as we have seen to take place in liquids.
    It may perhaps be objected, that liquid cohesion has some
hand in producing the thread-jike appearance produced in the
first experiment, and that my argument fails, since cohesion is
non-existent in gaseous bodies.         Now though liquid cohesion
might tend to keep the particles of each stratum together, and

            Mr. W. S. Jevons    on the  Cirrous form     of Cloud.     27
apart from those of another stratum for which they have less
cohesion, and though we may conceive the two moving strata
thus segregated into distinct threads,         I  do not think that this
is at all the cause of the phaenomenon.             It is rather the much
greater facility with which any       two  fluid bodies can move among
each other when distinct channels are preserved, than when each
particle of one is opposed to a particle of the other moving in
the opposite direction, — just as in a street or a large crowd of
people, the passage of all is much impeded unless those moving
in opposite directions proceed along different sides or along di
 stinct channels.      It is probably a simple mechanical effect of the
 motions of small bodies of each fluid, produced immediately that
 the perfect equilibrium of the horizontal strata is in any way
 disturbed.
      And again,   I do not know that it is proved that cohesion is
 entirely    non-existent   in gases ; by definition, a gas is matter in
 which the repulsive forces entirely overcome the cohesive or attractive
forces between the particles ; but supposing the gas so restrained
  by superincumbent pressure that no further expansion can take
 place, it is not impossible, as far as    I  see, that some difference of
  attractive or repulsive forces between particles of the same and
  particles of different gases, or the same gas in different conditions,
  may come into play, which, if not to be called cohesion, will at
  least produce the same apparent effects as that force.           The un
  doubted attraction which many solids exercise on gases, as seen,
  for instance, in the cohesion of air to the glass tube of the baro
  meter, and the absorption and condensation of gases by charcoal,
  platinum black, &c, show that gases do not possess repulsive
  forces only.
      Another distinct property or force existing equally in liquids
  and gases is the diffusive, which would certainly tend to cause
   mixture of two different strata; but this is evidently not the
   least concerned in this phenomenon, since diffusion acts quite
   independently of, or contrary to gravity, and would therefore
   produce nearly as much effect in the second experiment, where
   no cirrous appearance (or rather only flat cirrus or cirrostratus)
    at all was seen, as in the first experiment.
       I think it is pretty evident, then, that when two horizontal
    and tranquil strata of gases are in contact, the upper one being
    very slightly the denser, they will tend to change places, or to
    mix, by filtering into each other in distinct portions, which in-
    moving will assume the form of small channels or threads.            If
    this do not take place, the strata could only remain the denser
    supported upon the lighter, until the half-chemical process of
    diffusion would cause their complete mixture; but no one can
    suppose the strata so equally poised that the difference of specific
    gravity would not cause mechanical movement.

 28         Mr. W. S. Jevons   on the Cirrous form of Cloud.
     We must carefully distinguish this gradual filtration from the
 violent motions of large masses of fluid, also produced by differ
 ences of density and pressure, but which are on so much larger
 a scale as to produce entirely different appearances.         If the
 whole upper stratum in our first experiment were suddenly to
 become of greater density than the rest of the liquid beneath, it
 would undoubtedly sink down through the latter in large rapid
 streams ; but instead of this it is only small quantities of liquid
 at the junction of the strata, mere pins' heads in size, which,
 from the equalization of temperature, become successively of suf
 ficient density to sink, and they then do move with all the violence
 of which they are capable.
     It is the violent upward motion of currents of moist air which
 produces the cumulus, the rarefaction and reduction of tempera
 ture, however, occasioning the precipitation of watery particles ;
 but just as cumuli rise in detached rounded masses separated by
 portions of clear air, which must have more or less of a descend
 ing motion, so very small portions of air will filter upwards iu
 distinct fine threads, with intervening threads moving in the
opposite direction.
    But we are not wanting in some analogous and easily observed
appearances in the air itself, as in the long wavy threads or bands
of smoke rising from the wick of a candle, or the light-streaks
so distinctly seen moving across a sunbeam entering a room of
which the air is smoky or thick. The chemist, too, cannot help
remembering the thread-like clouds which always appear when
hydrochloric acid and ammonia are exposed within the reach of
each other's vapour.      By carefully employing these chemicals, a
true and distinct cirrous cloud might no doubt be produced ;
but gases are so easily disturbed and move so rapidly, as soon to
cause complete mixture and confusion in any experiment on a
small scale.
    On this theory, then, cirrous fibres are considered to be thread
like streamlets of moist air, forcing their way by the effect of
gravity alone through masses of air likewise moist, but of differ
ent temperature and density ; watery particles being of course
precipitated, according to Dr. Hutton's theory, and becoming
visible over the surfaces of the streamlets.
    It will now be well to mention a few points in which the ana
logy between the miniature experiment and the real atmospheric
cirrous cloud evidently fails.                     - n .i-T>h
    1st. The white precipitate of chloride of silver used to repre
sent the watery particles of a cloud is not resoluble in fresh quan
tities of the fluid ; but any portions of watery cloud-matter sub
siding into or otherwise coming into contact with undersaturated
air will immediately re-evaporate and vanish, so that appearances
will be considerably modified.

           Mr. W. S. Jevons   on the  Cirrous form of Cloud.      29
    2nd. The precipitate of chloride of silver has a tendency to
subside, its gravity being much superior to that of water ; but
during the precipitation of aqueous vapour into cloud-matter a
great amount of latent heat is given out, which, by expanding
the air, diminishes its density, and gives it a tendency to rise
above surrounding portions instead of subsiding, on account of
the weight of the watery particles.         Hence it is that cirrous
fibres will be observed ascending much more frequently than
descending; and that the ends of fibres have a general tendency
to curve upwards, as we may observe in nature.
    3rd. Atmospheric strata being usually in horizontal motion in
different directions, cloud-fibres produced by the interfiltration
of portions of these cannot have a perpendicular direction, but
will generally lie in a nearly horizontal position, except perhaps
towards the extremities.      They will also more generally partake
of the motion of the upper than the under current.
    It is easily conceivable, on this theory, that by different com
binations of currents and other circumstances, the most variable
 appearances and shapes will be assumed by the cirrous fibres,
 even such a variety as we observe in their beautiful natural
 forms.
    To render this paper complete and convincing, it would be
 necessary, in addition to showing that such cirrous filtration
 may take place among gases, to prove by facts that the condi
 tions of our theory, viz. a moist and dense stratum of air lying
 upon another portion of air, however small in quantity, also
 saturated with aqueous vapour, but specifically lighter, may or
 does actually occur in the atmosphere.        But our present know
 ledge of the motions of the currents of the atmosphere, and more
 especially of the distribution of aqueous vapour throughout them,
 is so imperfect as to render this extremely difficult.       I must
 leave this task to more competent persons, content if they shall
 first of all pronounce that the essential point of the theory, a
filtration action, is a reasonable explanation of the form and ap
 pearances of the cirrus.
     I think, however,   I  may mention several instances in which
  such circumstances may very probably occur, and where this
  theory   seems   to me to   afford a very probable explanation of
  remarkable    phamomena,   or  else to lead directly to such an ex
  planation, i
     Thunder-clouds in Sydney are nearly always preceded by a
  sort of lofty spreading crest of cirrus or cirrostratus, moving
  rapidly in a direction contrary to the wind at the surface of the
  earth.    Beneath this there at last appear large masses of cumu-
  lous storm-cloud, either in huge towering columns, or in irregular
  torn portions exhibiting great agitation, from which the rain and

30           Mr. W. S. Jevons     on the  Cirrous form of Cloud.
lightning proceed, the whole moving in the same direction as the
cirrus above. Squalls or a decided change of wind and weather'
after the storm show that the latter arises from the conflict of
two currents, the lower one always moist and sultry.                  At the
point   of   conflict,  this lower  current,  as I  suppose,   is turned up
wards, and then probably swept backwards by the other current
which is replacing it. The upward motion produces a vast pre
cipitation of vapour in the cumulous form, leading to rain and
electrical excitation ; while at a higher level, the air proceeding
from the summits of these cumuli still preserves sufficient warmth
and moistness to cause it to filter upwards into the other por
tions of the colder upper current.              Would not an advancing
cirrous crest be exactly the form of cloud produced on this
theory    ?

   To proceed       a little further in this explanation     of the produc
tion of    a  thunder-storm, to which our cirrous theory has partly
led us, may not the electrical excitation of the thunder-cloud be
easily accounted for by supposing it to collect, like a conductor,
the whole electrical charge of the lower moist and electrified
current as successive portions of this reach the point of conflict
and rise upwards ? Electricity probably exists in the air pre
cisely as on the surface of the excited glass plate of an electrical
machine.        There are large quantities of the electrical fluid or
force distributed among individual particles; but these are so
far separated by masses of non-conducting air, that no large
quantity can be discharged at any one moment. When the
whole mass of air, however, passes upward and through the
cloud, the watery particles which are precipitated assume all the
electricity of the particles of air, just as the metallic points of
the conductor collect the whole electrical charge of the surface

 of the glass cylinder passing before it ; and being a good con
 ducting body, the cloud soon discharges itself to the earth in a
 succession of immense sparks or flashes, which will be kept up
 as long as a current of moist, warm and excited air continues to
 arrive at the storm-point, or this latter itself travels over new
 and excited regions of air.   The continual supply of electricity,
 often amazingly great, at which some authors have much won
 dered (see Miller's 'Elements,' vol. i. p. 313), would at all events
 be easy to understand ; and this explanation can be extended to
the phsenomenon of lightning in any cumulous cloud, since the
 cirrous crest or the stratous masses which also usually form, are
in no way essential to the collection of electricity.
    The section of a thunder-cloud, on the preceding page (fig. 3),
is only intended to represent a certain class of storms occurring in
 Sydney, since other storms of different character occur even here,
but it seems to agree exactly with the descriptions of storm-
clouds in other localities (see Arago's 'Essay on Thunder and
Lightning,' Chap. II. ; or Howard's Climate of London,' Intro
                                         '
duction, p. xlviii).   Arago proves that lightning may issue from
a single small cloud ; but in this case I presume it will always
be a cumulous cloud, both from the descriptions of the clouds
in the cases cited, and from the remark of Beccaria, which he
quotes, viz. that
                   " thunder and lightning never issue from smoky
clouds; that is to say, from those strata of clouds which are
characterized by their apparent uniformity of composition and
regularity of form," meaning,     I suppose, stratous, cirrostratous
or cirrous clouds.
    It will perhaps have been observed in our experiment No. 1,
that the streams descending from the upper stratum into the
lower often end in little knobs, or drops, or scrolls of a peculiar
and interesting shape. I do not understand why the descending
streams should differ in shape from the ascending ones, which
generally, but not always, end in evanescent points, though it
might arise from the tendency of chloride of silver to subside, as
mentioned before ; but it is remarkable that similar appearances
are often to be seen on the under surface of dense cirrostratous
clouds, especially at the front or the tail of a thunder-cloud (as
shown in figure at E). Sometimes these dropping portions of
cloud, or droplets, seem to come in contact with dry air, when
their well-defined form is destroyed, and a fibrous or fur-like
appearance only remains.      They appear to be truly portions of
subsiding cloud.
    To return to our theory, Howard says (' Climate of London,'
Introduction, xliii), " Steady high winds are also preceded and
attended by streaks (of cirrus) running quite across the sky in
the direction in which they blow."         This would be the precise

effect produced    by a rapid upper current into which, at some
point  or  points, moist  streamlets of warm air were filtering up
wards from another      current.   Watery particles would be preci
pitated, and then rapidly swept away in long, flat, and nearly
horizontal streaks.
   An indirect electrical origin for the cirrus is not incompatible
with this theory, and we may thus perhaps have a cue to the
supposed connexion of cirrus and cirrostratus with auroral dis
plays.    It is not inconceivable that electrical or magnetical cur
rents passing among moist and varying currents of air in the
higher parts of the atmosphere, might occasion some rise of tem
perature in particular portions.     If this amount only to y^th of
a degree Fahrenheit, or say only yg^th or 3-^th of a degree,
this would be quite sufficient to originate a very gradual and
slow filtering action in these tranquil regions, and produce those
very rare but exceedingly lofty scrolls of cirrus which are said to
last sometimes for days together unchanged.
   To follow out these speculations into their full results would
require volumes ; the object of the present paper is fulfilled in
merely suggesting a filtering action as the explanation of many
important phenomena of the atmosphere.
   I  will add   a few remarks concerning the other well-known
forms of clouds.
   In our second experiment, the meteorologist cannot avoid
recognizing a striking resemblance between the sheet-like white
precipitate, only produced when the strata are disturbed and
mixed by internal causes, and the cloud known as stratus, which
has a flat or lenticular shape, and invariably a nearly horizontal
position. Cirrostratus is often, indeed, the more proper name
for the cloud artificially produced in our experiment, since acci
dental cirrous mixture of the strata nearly always takes place
from imperfect manipulation; but the fibres thus produced
always quickly settle into the horizontal position, and form a
streaked sheet which exactly represents the cirrostratus.
   The stratus, it is already well known, is produced by the mix
ture of portions of air saturated with moisture but differing in
temperature ; and we may now pronounce more precisely from
the conditions of our experiment, that it is formed when strata,
moving in contact with each other, are caused to mix at their
common surface by friction or other similar mechanical causes.
This is shown, too, by the form which it often assumes of parallel
transverse bars or waves; for just as a breeze ripples the surface
of water over which it blows, or as the latter again occasions
ripple-marks on the sandy bottom over which it moves, one cur
rent in the atmosphere may produce a ripple in flowing over

               Mr. W. S. Jevons   on the   Cirrous form of Cloud.       33
another   and as the two portions of air would mix more at one
           ;
part, of each undulation than any other, long waves of cloud
would be the result. Ripple would, I think, be a convenient
term for this appearance in descriptions of clouds.
    The only other fundamental form of cloud besides the cirrus
and the stratus is the cumulus, the nature of which is too well
known to need any remarks here.           The fundamental cloud-
actions of the atmosphere may then be laid down as follows : —
    1st. Cumulus, produced by the elevation and rarefaction of
large masses of air.
    2nd. Stratus, produced by the mechanical mixture of different
portions of moist air at their common surface.
    3rd. Cirrus, produced by the interfiltration of different por
tions of moist air.
    Howard felt and marked the fundamental differences of these
by giving them these distinct and admirably chosen names.
They were not laid down as fundamental in obedience to any
theory or deduced system of classification whatever, but because
their appearance and conditions of occurrence in the atmosphere
are so entirely distinct as at once to point to essential differences
of nature, whatever these may be. Howard, indeed, had very
little conception of how these clouds were formed ; and carried
away, perhaps, by the success of his first attempt at classification,
he completed his nomenclature by applying to a number of other
subordinate species of cloud, systematic terms obtained by the
combination of these three principles, viz. cumulostratus, cirro-
cumulus, cirrostratus, and cuuiulo-cirrostratus or nimbus.
    Now these compound terms will not be at all philosophical or
advantageous unless the species of cloud they represent are actu
ally formed by the amalgamation of the cloud-actions denoted by
the component parts of the term.      In adopting a theory of these
actions, we should therefore have to re-examine and perhaps
remodel these terms with a view to render them true and con
sistent.
   Now it seems to me that the cirrous and stratous actions are
those only which can be truly amalgamated, and take place in
the same portion of air ; and that if the other actions do ever
unite, the result will not be the clouds universally denoted by
the terms \ised.     Cirrostratus      is,
                                        indeed,    true intermediate

kind. "Ntff'&hly in the second experiment       did  we produce     di

 (and vice versd), which will produce cirrostratus, and explain the
fact that this compound form of cloud is more common than
either the simple cirrus or stratus alone.
    If it be said that the compound term denotes two kinds of
actions going on at different parts of the same cloud, and not
necessarily in the same portion of air, that, for instance, cumulo-
stratus (sometimes called,    I think, the anvil-shaped cloud) is a
cumulus extending at top into a stratous projection,         I answer
that the term becomes too indefinite, since a cumulus and stratus
may be combined together in several other ways, so that anvil-
shaped cloud is a more exact and desirable description.
    But if even cumulostratus and nimbus should be retained on
account of their well-established use, the term cirrocumulus is
still outlying as entirely unmeaning and improper.            Howard
himself thus describes this modification : — " The cirrocumulus is
formed from a cirrus, or from a number of small separate cirri,
by the fibres collapsing, as it were, and passing into small
roundish masses, in which the texture of the cirrus is no longer
discernible,   although they still retain somewhat of the same
relative arrangement."      The cirrocumulus is produced from the
cirrus when the filtering action is from some cause or other
stopped ; watery particles once precipitated do not always eva
porate again immediately the action stops, since they may be
surrounded by air perfectly saturated with moisture; but the
forms of the streamlets or cirrous fibres are soon broken up, and
the cloud-matter aggregates into small rounded bodies.          There
is nothing in the formation of this sort of cloud which in the
least resembles a cumulous action, and it occurs indeed in a
totally different region of the atmosphere from true cumulus ;
the term cirrocumulus is therefore improper, as well as but im
perfectly descriptive of the mere appearance of the cloud.           I
should propose in its place the short term cirroidus, or cirroid
cloud, which sufficiently expresses its undoubted cirrous origin,
and half- cirrous appearance.
    Howard's nomenclature by no means exhausts the variety of
common species of cloud ; as there is cirroid cloud derived from
ft former cirrus, so there may be masses of cloud-matter remain
ing from former cumuli and strati, equally important and fre
quently occurring in the atmosphere, though not so distinctive
in appearance.      For those species   I  would propose the corre
sponding    terms  cumuloid and   stratoid cloud ; or if substantives
be necessary, cumuloidus and stratoidus.
    Every meteorologist must have felt the insufficiency of Howard's
terms alone ; and until an additional and numerous set of terms
be devised to denote definite atmospheric phsenomena, it will
always be impossible, as at present, to record the state of the sky

description.  Considering that clouds are the only indications
of those lofty and otherwise invisible currents and other atmo
spheric changes, producing ultimately those results which we
take so much trouble to record on the surface of the earth, it
is impossible to understand why their study has been so much
neglected.

 x = y = tan 90°= a.       Hence the great circle AB may be said
 to correspond with what in plane coordinate geometry is desig
 nated the line at infinity.         It is also evident that this circle
 divides the whole spherical surface into two hemispheres, in
 each of which there is a distinct origin.              We shall, however, at
 present  confine   our attention       to  the  consideration     of one hemi

 dinates of any point on the surface of a sphere whose spherical
 coordinates are x, y.     Now if the aves of spherical coordinates
 are inclined at an angle o>, it is evident that the tri-coordinate
 planes are such that the axes of X and Z are inclined at an angle
 w, and are each perpendicular to the axis of Y.                      Hence the
 equation of   the   sphere, whose centre            is  at  the origin of tri-

    5. Whenever, therefore, it is required to find the spherical
equation of the curve formed by the intersection of any given
surface with the sphere, it is sufficient to substitute for X, Y,
and Z in the equation of the surface their values as given above,
aud the resulting equation in x and y will be the spherical equa
tion of the curve.
    Hence " a spherical equation of the nth degree represents a
curve formed by the intersection of the sphere with a cone of the
rath degree whose vertex is at the centre of the sphere."
    Similarly, it may be seen that if n be an even number, a
                                                                 "
spherical equation of the nth degree represents the curve formed
by the intersection of the sphere with a central surface of the nth
degree."
   As  a particular case of the above theorems, we learn that
                                                                "a

    6. We shall now apply the principle contained in arts. 3 and
 4 to deducing the spherical equation of the great circle, and to
 the establishment of certain formulae which will be found useful
 in investigating the properties of spherical curves.                In what fol
 lows,  the  axes of spherical coordinates              are supposed to be rect
 angular, and the radius of the sphere equal to unity.
    A great circle is formed by the intersection of a sphere with a
plane passing through its centre.                     Its equation is therefore
found from
                        LX + MY + NZ=0...1,
by substituting fpr     X, Y,    Z, their values as given in (B), to be
                            L« + Ny + M=0,
where    L, M and N are the cosines of the angles between the
 normal to the plane whose equation is (1), and the axes of X,
Y, Z respectively. Hence, if P be the pole of the great circle,
and CA, CO and CB be the axes of rectilinear coordinates, we
have
             L = cos  PB,      M = cos PO,              N=   cos PA.
But
             cos PO = cos PM        .  cos    OM

             tan PN = tan MO            . cos   NO   ;

IV.    Account of Experiments on the Perception of Colour.            By
    J.  C. Maxwell, B.A., Professor of Natural Philosophy,
    Marischal College, Aberdeen.
     To  the  Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
        Gentlemen,
             experiments which   I intend to describe were undertaken
THEin order         to render more perfect the quantitative proof of
the theory of three primary colours.         According to that theory,
 every sensation of colour in a perfect human eye is distinguished
 by three, and only three, elementary qualities, so that in mathe
matical language the quality of a colour may be expressed as a
function of three independent variables.            There is very little
 evidence at present for deciding the precise tints of the true
 primaries.      I have ascertained that a certain red is the sensation
 wanting in colour-blind eyes, but the mathematical theory relates
 to the number, not to the nature of the primaries.          If, with Sir
 David Brewster, we assume red, blue, and yellow to be the primary
 colours, this amounts to saying that every conceivable tint may
 be produced by adding together so much red, so much yellow,
 and so much blue.       This is perhaps the best method of forming a
 provisional notion of the theory.      It is evident that if any colour
 could be found which could not be accurately defined as so
 much of each of the three primaries, the theory would fall to
 the ground.       Besides this, the truth of the theory requires that
 every mathematical consequence of assuming every colour to be
 the result of mixture of three primaries should also be true.
     I have made experiments on upwards of 100 different artifi
 cial colours, consisting of the pigments used in the arts, and their
 mechanical mixtures.        These experiments were made primarily
 to trace the effects of mechanical mixture on various coloured
 powders ; but they also afford evidence of the truth of the
 theory, that all these various colours can be referred to three
 primaries. The following experiments relate to the combina
 tions of six well-defined colours only, and      I  shall describe them
 the more minutely, as       I hope to induce those who have good
 eyes to subject them to the same trial of skill in distinguishing
 tints.
     The method of performing the experiments is described in
the Transactions of the Boyal Society of Edinburgh, vol. xxi.
part 2. The colour-top or teetotum which I used may be had
of Mr. J. M. Bryson, Edinburgh, or it may be easily extempo
rized.     Any rotatory apparatus which will keep a disc revolving
steadily and rapidly in a good light, without noise or disturb
ance, and can be easily stopped and shifted, will do as well as
the contrivance of the spinning-top.

       Account   of Experiments   on the Perception of Colour.    41
    The essential part of the experiment consists in placing several
discs of coloured paper of the same size, and slit along a radius,
over one another, so that a portion of each is seen, the rest being
covered by the other discs. By sliding the discs over each other
the proportion of each colour may be varied, and by means of
divisions on a circle on which the discs lie, the proportion of each
colour may be read off.       My circle was divided into 100 parts.
    On the top of this set of discs is placed a smaller set of con
centric discs, so that when the whole is in motion round the
centre, the colour resulting from the mixture of colours of the
small discs is seen in the middle of that arising from the laVger
discs.    It is the object of the experimenter to shift the colours
till the outer and inner tints appear exactly the same, and then
to read off the proportions.
    It is easy to deduce from the theory of three primary colours
what must be the number of discs exposed at one time, and how
much of each colour must appear.
    Every colour placed on either circle consists of a certain pro
portion of each of the primaries, and in order that the outer and
inner circles may have precisely the same resultant colour in
every respect, there must be the same amount of each of the
primary colours in the outer and inner circles.        Thus we have
as many conditions to fulfil as there are primary colours ; and
besides these we have two more, because the whole number of
divisions in either the outer or the inner circle is 100, so that if
there are three primary colours there will be five conditions to
fulfil, and this will require five discs to be disposable, and these
must be arranged so that three are matched against two, or four
against one.
    If we take six different colours, we may leave out any one of
the six, and so form six different combinations of five colours.
It is plain that these six combinations must be equivalent to
two equations only, if the theory of three primaries be true.
    The method which       I have found most convenient for regis
tering   the  result of an  experiment, after an identity of tint has
been obtained in the inner and outer circles, is the following : —
    Write down the names or symbols of the coloured discs each
at the top of a column, and underneath write the number of
degrees of that colour observed, calling it + when the colour is
in the outer circle, and — when it is in the inner circle ; then
equate the whole to zero.          In this way the account of each
colour is kept in a separate column, and the equations obtained
are easily combined and reduced, without danger of confound
ing the colours of which the quantities have been measured.
The following experiments were made between the 3rd and 1 1th
of September, 1856, about noon of each day, in a room fronting

42           Prof. Maxwell's Account of Experiments on
the north, without curtains or any bright-coloured object near
the window.    The same combination was never made twice in
one day, and no thought was bestowed upon the experiments ex
cept at the time of observation.    Of course the graduation was
never consulted, nor former experiments referred to, till each
combination of colours had been fixed by the eye alone ; and no
reduction was attempted till all the experiments were concluded.
   The coloured discs were cut from paper painted of the follow
ing colours : — Vermilion, Ultramarine, Emerald-green, Snow-
white, Ivory-black, and Pale Chrome-yellow.         They are de
noted by the letters V, U, G,     W, B,  Y respectively.   These
colours were chosen, because each is well distinguished from the
 rest, so that a small change of its intensity in any combination
 can be observed.      Two discs of each colour were prepared, so
 that in each combination the colours might occasionally be
transposed from the outer circle to the inner.
    The first equation was formed by leaving out vermilion. The
remaining colours are Ultramarine-blue, Emerald-green, White,
Black, and Yellow.       We might suppose, that by mixing the
blue and yellow in proper proportions, we should get a green of
the same hue as the emerald-green, but not so intense, so that
in order to match it we should have to mix the green with white
to dilute  it,and with black to make    itdarker.    But  it  not in
                                                               is
this way that we have to arrange the colours, for our blue and
yellow produce    a  pinkish tint, and never a    green, so that we
must add green to the combination of blue and yellow, to pro
duce a   neutral tint, identical with
                                    a   mixture of white and black.
    Blue, green, and yellow must therefore be combined on the
large discs, and stand on one side of the equation, and black and
white, on the small discs, must stand on the other side. In
order to facilitate calculations, the colours are always put down
in the same order but those belonging to the small discs are
                      ;
marked negative.       Thus, instead of writing
                  54U + 14G + 32 Y  = 32W + 68B,
we write                   14G-32W-68B           32Y=0.
                 + 54U +                     +
  The sum of all the positive terms of such an equation  100,   is
being the whole number of divisions in the circle. The sum of
the negative terms    also 100.
                      is
   The second equation consists of all the colours except blue       ;
and in this way we obtain six different combinations of five
colours.

                                                  the unassisted
judgment of my eye, on six different occasions, so that there are
thirty-six independent observations of equations between five
polours.

   Table  I. gives the actual observations, with their dates.
   Table II. gives the result of summing together each group
of six equations.
   Each equation in Table II. has the sums of its positive and
negative coefficients each equal to 600.
    Having obtained a number of observations of each combina
tion of colours, we have next to test the consistency of these
results, since theoretically two equations are sufficient to deter
mine all the relations among six colours.        We must therefore,
in the first place, determine the comparative accuracy of the
different sets of observations.     Table III. gives the averages of
the errors of each of the six groups of observations.      It appears
that the combination IV. is the least accurately observed, and
that VI. is the best.
   Table IV. gives the averages of the errors in the observation
of each colour in the whole series of experiments.        This Table
was computed in order to detect any tendency to colour-blind
ness in my own eyes, which might be less accurate in discrimi
nating red and green, than in detecting variations of other co
lours. It appears, however, that my observations of red and
green were more accurate than those of blue or yellow.         White
is the most easily observed, from the brilliancy of the colour,
and black is liable to the greatest mistakes.    I would recommend
this method of examining a series of experiments as a means of
detecting partial colour-blindness, by the different accuracy in
observing different colours.      The next operation is to combine
all the equations according to their values.      Each was first mul
tiplied by a coefficient proportional to its accuracy, and to the
coefficient of white in that equation.     The result of adding all
the equations so found is given in equation (W).
    Equation (Y) is the result of similar operations with reference
to the yellow on each equation.
    We have now two equations from which to deduce six new
equations, by eliminating each of the six colours in succession.
We must first combine the equations, so as to get rid of one of
the colours, and then we must divide by the sum of the positive
or negative coefficients, so as to reduce the equations to the
form of the observed equations. The results of these operations
are given in Tabic V., along with the means of each group of six
observations.     It will  be seen that the differences  between the
results of calculation from two equations and the six independent
observed equations are very small.       The errors in red and green
are here again somewhat less than in blue and yellow, so that
there is certainly no tendency to mistake red and green more
than other colours.       The average difference between the ob
served   mean   value  of a colour and the calculated value is '77
of a degree, The average error of an observation in any group

41           Prof. Maxwell's Account of Experiments                            on
from the mean of that group was '92.           No observation was
attempted   to  be registered nearer  than  one  degree of the top,
or T£jy of a circle ; so that this set of observations agrees with
the theory of three primary colours quite as far as the observa
tions can warrant us in our calculations ; and       think that theI
human eye has seldom been subjected to so severe a test of its
power of distinguishing colours.      My eyes are by no means so
                                                   I
accurate in this respect as many eyes have examined, but a little
practice produces great improvement even in inaccurate observers.
     I
     have laid down, according to Newton's method, the relative
positions of the five positive colours with which I worked. It
will be seen that W lies within the triangle VUG, and Y out
side that triangle.
   The first combination, equation                 I.,
                                          consisted of blue, yellow
and green, taken in such proportions that their centre of gravity
falls at W.

from white ; and we find that the observations of this equation are
affected with the greatest errors. Hence the importance of reducing
the resultant tint to as nearly a neutral colour as possible.
   It is hardly necessary for me to observe, that the whole of the
numerical results which      I have given apply only to the coloured
papers which      I used, and to them only when illuminated by
daylight from the north at mid-day in September, latitude 55 .
In the evening, or in winter, or by candlelight, the results
are very different.     I  believe, however, that the results would
differ far less if observed by different persons, than if observed
under different lights ; for the apparatus of vision is wonder
fully similar in different eyes, and even in colour-blind eyes the
system of perception is not different, but defective.

V. Notes on Mineralogy. — No. VI. On the Siliceo-Felspathic
     Rocks of the South of Ireland.                     By the Rev. Samuel
     Haughton, M.A., Fellow of Trinity College, and Professor of
     Geology in the University of Dublin.
          is well known that siliceo-felspathie           trap rocks of a pecu
 IT         liar kind are found in the mining district of the Ovoca,
Co. Wicklow, and in the mining district of Bonmahon, in the
south of the county of Waterford; and the recent investigations
of the Geological Survey in the west of Kerry and Cork have
brought to light the existence of great quantities of similar rocks
in the neighbourhood of Killarney, and in the mountains to the
westward . stretching to the south of Kenmare Bay ; and it is
not at all improbable but that these remarkable felspathic rocks
may in this district be associated with the copper lodes, which
have proved so productive in the Berehaven or Allihies Mine.
These rocks have a general resemblance to each other in all these
districts, and when once seen and recognized cannot be easily
                            Communicated     by the Author.

48            The Rev. S. Haughton's Notes          on   Mineralogy,
mistaken for any other description of rock ; they are of a pale
bluish, or greenish-grey colour, weathering white to the depth
of several inches, slightly translucent on the edges, of conchoidal
fracture, and sharp metallic ring under the hammer.
   The Cornish miners who are acquainted with the mining
districts of Wicklow and Waterford, consider these rocks as the
equivalents of their own Elvans, to which they bear no external
resemblance, though it cannot be denied that they appear to
exert an equally favourable influence on the productiveness of
the metallic lodes with which they are associated.; and the re
sults of my analyses prove that they have an intimate relation
to the granitic rocks in their chemical and mineralogical com
position. The resemblance in composition to some varieties of
granite    is,
             indeed, so striking, that   requires but slight effort
                                              it               a
of the imagination to conceive them as granites cooled under
peculiar circumstances which prevented the development of the
usual crystalline structure.
    In some cases, however, these siliceo-felspathic rocks appear
to be deposited in stratified beds, conformable to the slates and
felspathic ash-beds with which they are found associated.      This
is particularly the case in the Ovoca district, where the mass of
felspathic rock      found to lie between dark soft slates of the
                     is
Silurian age, and has never been observed to penetrate these
slates in dykes.
I     shall now proceed to the discussion of the analyses of these
rocks from the Wicklow, Waterford, and Killarney districts re
spectively.
 1. Siliceo-felspathic     Rocks   of   the Vale   of   Ovoca, Co. Wicklow.
     The cupriferous      and pyritous lodes of this district have         a
N.E. and S.W. bearing, and an underlay to the S.E.                       They
appear to be nearly conformable to the planes of bedding of the
slate in which they occur; and they are overlaid to the S.E.               by
a thick mass of siliceo-felspathic   rock, which rises into the re
markable hill called the Bell Rock, on the west side of the Ovoca.
The lodes are all dislocated        byleft-handed heave coinciding
                                         a
apparently with the direction of the Ovoca Valley, and the fel
spathic rock partakes of this movement of the lodes.            has It      a
stratified character throughout, and in places, as near the Tigroney
Mine,    it  assumes completely the character of an ashey-slate,
weathering perfectly white.
 I     obtained specimens of the Bell Rock from Mr. Edward
Barnes, Resident Director of the Wicklow Copper-Mine Com
pany, which were procured          by
                                  blasting two or three feet into the
rock, so as to obtain portion quite free from the action of the
                          a
weather.         The specimens are of     a   pale greenish colour, exceed

 ingly hard, striking fire freely under the hammer, but when
 subjected to long-continued action of the reducing flame of the
 blowpipe, melting slightly on tbe edges, particularly in the
 neighbourhood of the minute specks of silicate of iron which
 appear here and there through the body of the rock.
    The following analysis will serve to give an exact idea of the
 composition of this rock, which is more siliceous than the fel-
 stones of Waterford and Killarney : —

                                    99-70
    It is evident from this analysis, that the atoms of protoxides
and peroxides are about equal in quantity, and that the rock may
be represented by a mixture of felspar and quartz.
                                Q + F = 1-808,
                                     F=0199.
    From these equations, we find that its mineralogical compo
sition is as follows : —

    2.  Siliceo-felspathic   Rocks   of Knockmahon,          Co. Waterford.
    The felspathic rocks of Knockmahon are intimately associated
with the copper lodes which have rendered that locality famous,
and occur abundantly on the shore below the village of Bon-
mabon in prismatic masses of a columnar structure, which have
received the name of the Bishop's Library.                  These rocks occur
also, and are well shown,       in  a cutting     for   a tramroad    connecting
Tankardstown with Knockmahon                 Mine.       In  this  latter  locality
they occur stratified conformably with the brown
                                                                     fossiliferous
Silurian slates which are found at the Tankardstown Mine. The
following analysis is of a specimen taken from the stratified
                                                                       —

   This rock, like that at Ballymurtagh, Co. Wicklow, is a com
pound of quartz and felspar ; if it be regarded as a sedimentary
rock, it must be considered as a trappean ash, composed of fel
spar and fine quartzose mud, with a slight admixture of carbonate
of lime.   Its mineralogical composition is as follows : —

      3. Siliceo-felspathic   Traps of Benaunmore, Co. Kerry.
    The hornstones or siliceo-felspathic rocks of Benaunmore
occur in splendid columns, many of which, as described by
Mr. Foot, of the Geological Survey, are 200 feet in length.
The rock is more translucent than the felspathic traps of Wick
low or Waterford already described, and presents more of the
character of a truly igneous product.          Its analysis gave the fol
lowing results : —

    This rock, like the others already discussed, is a compound of
 quartz and felspar ; and it is easy to calculate the proportions of
 the two minerals as follows : —
                                                    Per cent.

      From the fact, that the felspathic trap of Benaunmore occurs
  in columnar masses, it may be inferred to be probably of igneous
  origin ; it is massive, fine-grained, with rounded specks of quartz
  (globuliferous), and small occasional facets of felspar ; brittle, of
  conchoidal fracture, somewhat lamellar, and translucent on the
  edges ; with a ringing clink and striking fire freely when struck
  with the hammer.
     I  have lately had an opportunity, in conjunction with Dr.
 Wilde of Dublin, of examining a very large number of stone
 implements found in various parts of Ireland ; and           I find that
 the different varieties of siliceo-felspathic       rocks were carefully
 sought out by the makers of these implements.               Among the
 most common varieties so used, are the pure pale-green felstone,
 and a mottled porphyritic variety of the same kind of rock,
 streaked with pink felspar and dark-coloured metallic hornblende.
     In the collection of stone implements preserved in the Col
 lection of the Royal Irish Academy, there are also a number of
 stone implements from Jamaica,- formed of the same kind of
felstone, which would appear to have been particularly well suited
 to the purposes to which such implements are supposed to have
 been applied.
    The felstones and siliceo-felspathic rocks of Ireland are only
 locally abundant, and as the weapons made from this kind of
rock are found in all parts of Ireland, it is conjectured by anti
quarians that an extensive trade in, and manufacture of, these
felstone celts and weapons must have existed in former times in
Ireland.      This trade, if such existed, must have been confined
to Ireland itself, as there is scarcely a single stone implement in
the Collection of the Irish Academy which cannot be readily
identified as made of an Irish rock ; and in many instances the
locality from which it was obtained can be assigned with tolerable
accuracy.

water mutually replace each other, so that with increase of the
potash there is decrease of the water, and vice versd.        Sehwar
zenberg's analyses led to the formula KO, 3Co8 O5 + 3HO.
This relation of cobalt to oxygen was so unusual that the co-
baltate of potash became the subject of separate investigation
by Pebal* and Mayer f, who have, however, arrived at results
which confirm in the main Sehwarzenberg's statements.
    Pebal's experiments were made chiefly with a view of deter
mining the relation of cobalt to oxygen in the acid, and he ac
complished this by the application of Bunsen's method of volu
metric analysis.       Pebal's analyses, which agreed well with each
other, gave numbers corresponding to the formula Co6 O10, KO,
 or 2(Co805), KO.         The relation of the cobalt to the oxygen
is therefore the same as that found by Schwarzenberg ; but
 Pebal does not consider that water is contained as an essential
constituent in the substance.
     Mayer's object was not solely to determine the relation of cobalt
 to oxygen, but also to examine whether cobaltic acid might not
 be a mixture of two oxides of cobalt, the more so as Fremy had
 stated that an oxide of cobalt, Co O2, was formed under certain
 circumstances.       Mayer also investigated with great complete
 ness the various methods of forming cobaltate of potash.           His
 experiments confirm essentially Sehwarzenberg's           statements,
 and his analyses agree with the formula 3(Co305) KO, 3HO.
 But he does not consider that it can be called cobaltate of pot
  ash ; it is rather a peroxide, which has the property of com
 bining with bases ; on treating it with water, the greater part
  of the potash is removed, although the relation of cobalt to
  oxygen remains constant ; many instances of this class of com
  pounds are known, which suffer a progressive decomposition
  with water.      Mayer considers that the water is an essential con
  stituent, and he explains the difference in this respect from
  Pebal's views as arising partly from the ready decomposibility of
  the potash compound with water, and partly from the production
 of different compounds, according as circumstances are modified.
               J
     Wohler describes a new mode of forming suboxide of silver.
 When yellow arsenite of silver is digested at a moderate tempe
 rature with caustic soda, it rapidly becomes black. When this mix
 ture is made to boil, allowed to settle, and the clear liquid poured
 off, it is found to contain arseniate of soda. The black precipitate
 is again boiled with fresh soda, then well washed out with water
 and dried.       It then forms a heavy black powder, with a shade
 of grey, and under the burnisher has a metallic appearance.          It
 consists of suboxide of silver containing a little metallic silver.

    The reducing action exercised by arsenious acid on silver and
copper in the presence of alkalies, extends also to some nitro
compounds *. When nitrobenzole is digested with solution of ar
senious acid in excess of strong caustic soda, it is converted into
aniline, which can be distilled off and obtained pure.         Wohler
intends trying this reducing action on other nitro-compounds.
    St.-Clair Deville and Caronf have investigated the preparation
and properties of magnesium.          A mixture is made of chlorides of
magnesium and sodium with fluoride of calcium, to this mixture
sodium in pieces is added, and the whole mixed well together.
This mixture is then introduced into a red-hot earthen crucible,
which is closed down.        The action commences immediately, and
when it is over, the lid is removed, and the mass stirred well
with an iron rod until the mixture is quite uniform.         It is then
allowed to cool, and when about to solidify is poured out on an
iron plate ; this mass, when cold, is broken up and the globules
of magnesium picked out. The rest of the mass can be remelted,
and more magnesium obtained.                   J
                                       Wohler recommends that the
mixture be allowed to become cold in the crucible, which is then
broken and the globules separated from the adhering scoria by
solution in water.       They may be obtained much brighter by
immersing them in a solution of sal-ammoniac, or of carbonate
of soda, but must not be allowed to remain too long, as they dis
solve with evolution of hydrogen.          They are then washed and
carefully  dried  at a gentle  heat.   Wohler  succeeded in preparing
magnesium by the reduction of the double salt of chloride of
magnesium and sodium, obtained by mixing the solutions of the
two chlorides in equivalent proportions, evaporating them to
dryness, and fusing the mass.
   To purify crude magnesium, it is heated in a tube of dense
gas coke to an almost white heat, and a slow stream of hydrogen
passed through ; on cooling, the metal is taken out, and melted
under a mixture of chloride of magnesium, chloride of sodium,
and fluoride of calcium.        By increasing the proportion of the
fluoride, the mixture is rendered less fusible than magnesium,
so that the latter can be poured off at the moment at which the
former solidifies.
    Magnesium is volatile like zinc, and at almost the same tem
perature as that metal. When pure it volatilizes without leaving
any residue, and the sublimed metal is white and coated with a
small quantity of magnesia.          Magnesium has about the same
melting-point as zinc,; heated somewhat higher it ignites and

 ceived.     Its specific gravity is 1'75; it can be filed, and takes
 an excellent polish ; it resists the action of the air tolerably well,
 though not so well as zinc.       When distilled in a rapid current
 of hydrogen, some metallic dust is carried away, which remains
 suspended in the hydrogen ; and if this be set fire to, it burns
 with one of the most beautiful flames which can be conceived.
     Deville and Caron are still engaged in an investigation of the
 physical properties of magnesium, and experiments are in pro
 gress on the reduction of the alkaline earths by means of carbon.
     In a note on ozonometry,     M. Bineau* seemed to attribute to
 nitric acid the property    of liberating iodine from iodide of po
tassium in the cold, and in the presence of water.          Bechampt
 adduces a variety of facts which show that this is not the case,
 if the nitric acid be pure.
    If to a given volume of dilute solution of iodide of potassium,
which has been mixed with starch-paste, a drop of nitric acid
such as is usually found in laboratories be added, the mixture
becomes immediately blue ; if to another volume of the iodide
solution there be added even a great excess of the same nitric
acid diluted, but which has had carbonic acid passed though it
in the dark to expel nitrous acid, the mixture does not become
blue ; the same is the case on adding to the iodide solution pure
nitrate of potash and sulphuric acid.          But this becomes blue
also if the nitrate of potash has been melted, or has been in
contact with organic substances, or if traces of nitrite of potash
be added.       Ozonometric paper, therefore, does not become blue
under the influence of pure dilute nitric acid ; the coloration
must be attributed to the nitrous acid always contained in con
centrated nitric acid which has been prepared some time.
Millon showed long ago that pure nitric acid, free from nitrous
acid, did not liberate iodine from iodides, or sulphur from sul
phides ; but it has not been stated what is the action of nitrous
acid on iodides.      Bechamp examined this point, and found that
the action of nitrous acid gave rise to the formation of nitric
oxide, and was a convenient method of preparing this gas.          He
mixed an equivalent of nitrite of potash, and an equivalent of
iodide of potassium dissolved in water, in an appropriate appa
ratus, and having expelled all the air by means of carbonic acid,
added a few drops of sulphuric acid ; a rapid evolution of gas
ensued, which reddened in the air, and was completely absorbed
by protosulphate of iron. This was binoxide of nitrogen, which
could only have arisen from the action of nitrous acid on the

The aqueous solution, which contains the methionic acid, was

it would thus contain 2(S2 O4) in copulated combination with
the radical C2 H2, which can replace two equivalents of hydro
gen.    The formation of methionic acid might be explained as
arising from the oxidation of a part of the carbon.       In fact,
Strecker observed the occurrence of carbonic acid as well as an
abundant evolution of sulphuric acid.
   Some time after the preceding investigation was completed,
Strecker recognized methionic in disulphonietholic acid, the acid
obtained by Buckton and Hofmann from the action of sulphuric
acid on acetonitrile.  And by preparing some of the acid accord
ing to the methods described by these chemists, he was able to
establish its identity with methionic acid, not only by ocular
demonstration, but by analysis.
     Beinhold  Hoffmann * has examined the monochloracetic
acid, the existence of which, although pointed out by Dumas,
and afterwards by Leblanc, has never been satisfactorily esta
blished. It is obtained by bringing chlorine into contact with
monohydrated acetic acid ; its formation begins probably even in
the dark, but takes place best in sunlight, if the chlorine be not
in too great excess.   It is always accompanied by the formation
of a small quantity of a higher chlorinated acetic acid, and it is
probable that the formation of monochloracetic acid is the first
step, and that from this the higher chlorinated acid is formed.
   Monochloracetic acid, C4 H8 CI O2, is a well-characterized
acid, and forms crystalline salts.   It when pure, crystalline
                                                        is,                   a

    Chloral, C4 HC13, O2, is generally considered to be a substitu
tion product of aldehyde, C4 H4, O2, in which three equivalents of
hydrogen are replaced by three of chlorine. Wurtz* wished to
ascertain if chloral were really formed by the direct action of
chlorine upon aldehyde, and exposed anhydrous aldehyde in ex
cess to the action of chlorine.           The only substitution product
he obtained was chloride of acetyle, C4 H3 CIO2, while at the
same time a quantity of aldehyde was changed into metaldehyde,
 C8 H8 O4, the modification into which it passes on being long
kept, and some of this had been changed to a substance,
 C8 H7 CIO4, by the action of chlorine.
    He further tried whether chloride of acetyle gives chloral by
the continued action of chlorine, and with this view placed chloride
of acetyle, C4 Hs O2 CI, in large globes filled with chlorine, and
exposed them to the action of sunlight.           A liquid was obtained,
which gave on fractional distillation a substance boiling between
100° and 105° C, which was monochlorinated chloride of acetyle,
C4 H2 CI2 O2.         It is a colourless liquid, having an extremely
irritating odour.        The action of water on this substance gives
rise to the formation of monochloracetic acid ; thus

    The reactions of ammonia and of alcohol upon monochlorinated
chloride of acetyle, have been examined by Willm.                 On mixing
alcohol with this substance a very violent action ensues, and the
vessel in which it takes place requires to be cooled down.                 On
washing the product          with  water, and  rectification,   a  colourless
liquid of etherial odour, and boiling at 1430,5, is obtained. This
is monochloracetate         of sethyle, and its formation is thus ex
pressed   : —

 of ammonia on monocbloracetic aether, and also by the action of
 dry ammonia on monochlorinated chloride of acetyle.
     Limpricht has recently * given a preliminary notice of a reac
 tion which supplies a link in a remarkable series of transforma
tions, and shows that it is possible to convert certain acids into
the corresponding alcohols.
    By heating leucine, C12 H13 NO4, in a retort over free flame, it
melts at about 170°, and between 184° and 200° an oily liquid
of an empyreumatic odour distils over, which solidifies on cooling
into a mass of soft foliaceous crystals. These are soluble in water,
and treated with hydrochloric acid liberate carbonic acid.                 The
hydrochloric     acid   solution    was   evaporated   to dryness,   extracted
with absolute alcohol, the alcoholic solution shaken with caustic
potash, on which an oily liquid separated out, which on rectifi
cation over solid potash proved to be amylamine.                  The prepa
ration of leucine from horn is not difficult, and in this way up
wards of an ounce of pure amylamine was obtained.                     The de
composition may be thus expressed : —
                 Ci2Hi3N04          _   C10H13N       + 2C02
                    Leucine.            Amylamine.    Carbonic acid.
    In  the same way alanine, C6 H7 NO4, the homologue of leucine,
was found to give ethylamine, and there is little doubt that gly-
cocoll, C4 Hs NO4, would give methylamine.
    This opens out a way of transforming certain acids into their
alcohols, for Piria has shown that by distilling the salts of cer
tain acids with formiates, aldehydes are obtained; these aldehydes
give, as Strecker has found, when treated with hydrocyanic and
hydrochloric acids, compounds such as leu?ine and alanine,
which are homologous with glycocoll. Limpricht has now
shown that ethylamine and amylamine can be prepared from
alanine and leucine, and it has long been known that these
bases give, when treated with nitrous acid, the nitrous aethers of
alcohol and fusel oil, from which of course these latter substances
may be formed.         The various steps in the reaction in the case
of alcohol will make this transformation clearer : —

        "On Practical Methods for rapid Signalling by the Electric
Telegraph."     By Prof. W. Thomson, F.R.S.
   I am at present engaged in working out various practical applica
tions of the formulae communicated some time ago in a short article
on the "Theory of the Electric Telegraph" (Proceedings, May 17,
 1855), and I hope to be able very soon to lay the results in full
before the Royal Society.     In the mean time, as the project of an
Atlantic Telegraph is at this moment exciting much interest,      shall     I
explain shortly a telegraphic system to which, in the course of this
investigation, I have been led, as likely to give nearly the same
rapidity of utterance by a submarine one-wire cable of ordinary
lateral dimensions between Ireland and Newfoundland, as is attained
on short air or submarine lines by telegraphic systems in actual use.
   Every system of working the electric telegraph must comprehend
(1) a plan of operating at one extremity, (2) a plan of observing at
the other, and (3) a code of letter-signals. These three parts of the
system which I propose will be explained in order,
                                                    — I. for long sub
marine lines, and II. for air or short submarine lines.
         I.   Proposed telegraphic system        for   long submarine lines.
  1.     Plan of operating. — This          consists in applying a regulated gal
vanic battery to give, during a limited               time, a definite variation of
electric potential determined by theory, so as to fulfil the condition
of producing an electric effect at the other extremity, which, after
first becoming sensible, rises very rapidly to a maximum, then sinks
as rapidly till it becomes again, and continues, insensible.
    The principle followed is that pointed out by Fourier, by which
we see, that, when the wire is left with both ends uninsulated after
any electrical operations whatever have been performed upon        the      it,
distribution   of  electric potential through    will very quickly be
                                                         it

reduced to a harmonic law, with an amplitude falling in equal pro
portions during equal intervals of time. Unless the electric opera
tions fulfil a certain condition, this ulterior distribution is according
to the simple harmonic law (that       is,    proportional to the sine of the
                                             is
 distance from either extremity, the whole length being reckoned as
   80°) . The condition which propose to fulfil
1                                  I                             is,
                                                            that the coefficient
 of the simple harmonic term in the expression for the electrical
 potential shall vanish. Then, according to Fourier, the distribution
will very much more quickly wear into one following                 double har
                                                                       a
 monic law (that is, the sine of the distance from one extremity, the
 whole length being reckoned as 360°).            In this state of electrifica
 tion the two halves of the wire on each side of its middle point,
 being symmetrically and oppositely electrified, will discharge into
 one another, as well as into the earth at their remote extremities                      ;
 each will be like   a   single wire of half-length, with the simple har
 monic distribution  ;    and the wire will, on the whole, be discharged
as fast as a   wire of half the length, or four times as fast as        wire of
                                                                           a
the whole length, after an ordinary electrification.             There      conis
 siderable latitude as to the mode of operating so as to fulfil this con
 dition, but the theoretical investigation        readily available for finding
                                                  is
 the best way of fulfilling   it  in practice. The result, as       have tested
                                                                       I
by actual calculation of the electric pulse at the remote end,             mostis
 satisfactory.    The calculations, and curves exhibiting the electric
pulse in a    variety of cases, will,
                                    I     trust, very soon be laid before the
 Royal Society.
    The time and law of operations being once fixed upon, mecha            a
nical contrivance of the simplest kind will give the means of direct
ing  a  regulated galvanic battery to perform           with exactness, and to
                                                            it
any    stated   degree   (positive   or  negative)   of  strength.    Complete
plans of all details I     have ready to describe when wanted, and shall
very soon be able to state exactly the battery power required for                        a
cable of stated dimensions.
    2. Plan of observation for receiving a message. — The instrument
whichI      proposeis   Helmholtz's galvanometer, with or without modi
fication.     The time of vibration of the suspended magnet, and the
efficiency of the copper damper, will be so arranged, that during the
electric pulse the suspended magnet will turn from its position of
equilibrium into   a   position of maximum deflection, and will fall back
to rest in its position of equilibrium.           The possibility of fulfilling
these conditions   is  obvious from the form of the curve           have found
                                                                       I
to represent the electric pulse. The observer will watch through                         a
telescope the image of    a   scale reflected from the polished side of the
magnet, or from    a    small mirror carried by the magnet, and he will
note the letter or number which each maximum deflection brings into
the middle of his field of view.
    3. Code of letter-signals. — The most obvious way of completing
a  telegraphic system on the plans which have been described,                 to    is
have the twenty-six letters of the alphabet written on the scale of
which the image in the suspended mirror              observed, and to arrange
                                                       is
thirteen positive and thirteen negative strengths of electric operation,

Prof. Thomson          on  Rapid Signalling by         the  Electric Telegraph.        61
which will give deflections, positive or negative, bringing one or other
of these letters on the reflected scale into the centre of the field of
view. But it would be bad economy to give the simple signals to
rare letters, and to require double or triple signals for double and
triple combinations of frequent occurrence.                    Besides, by the plans
which I have formed, it will, I believe, be easy to make much more
than thirteen different positive and thirteen different negative
strengths of electric operation, giving unmistakeably different degrees
of deflection; and if so, thenmany of the mostfrequent doubleand triple
combinations, as well as all the twenty-six letters of the alphabet
singly, might be made by simple signals. But it is also possible
(although I believe highly improbable), that in practice only three
or four, or some number less than thirteen, of unmistakeably different
deflections could be produced in the galvanometer at one end by
electric operations performed on the other extremity.                         If so, the
whole twenty-six letters could not each have a simple signal, and
double signals would have to be chosen for the less frequent letters.
Experience must show what number of perfectly distinct simple
signals can be made, and I have scarcely a doubt but that it will be
much more than twenty-six.                 Then it will be easy to invent a letter
code which will use these signals with the best economy for the
language in which the message is to be delivered. Towards this
object  I  have commenced             collecting statistics showing the relative
frequency with which tbe different simple letters, and various com
 binations of simple letters, occur in the English language, and I must
 soon have information enough to guide in choosing the best code for
a given number of simple signals.
    The investigation leading to a measurement of the electro-mag
netic unit of electricity in terms of the electro-static unit, published
since the commencement                of the present year by Kohlrausch and
Weber, has given all           that   is required to deduce from Weber's own
previous experiments          the   measurement       of the electric conductivity of
 copper wire      in  terms    of  the   proper     kind   of unit for the telegraph
problem.       The     data  required     for  estimating the rapidity of action in
 a submarine        wire   of  stated    dimensions      would be completed by a
 determination       of  the  specific    inductive    capacity of gutta percha, or
better  still,  a  direct  experiment      on  the  electro-static   capacity of a yard
 or two cut    from     the  cable   itself.    I  have   estimated     the retardations
of various     electric    pulses,   and    the   practicable    rate    of transmitting
messages by        cables   2400    miles   long,   and   of  certain    ordinary lateral
dimensions, on the assumption that the specific inductive capacity of
gutta-percha, measured as Faraday did that of sulphur, shell-lac, &c,
is 2, from which it probably does not differ much.                      These estimates
 have been published          elsewhere      (Athenaeum,      Oct.   1556),   and I shall
 not repeat    them     until  I  can  along   with   them   give  a  table  of  estimates
 lor  cables    of   various     dimensions,      with   the   uncertainty      as  to the
 physical property        of  gutta-percha       either  done    away    with  by   experi
 ment, or taken strictly into account.

     II.  Plan for rapid self-recording signals  by air wires and short
                             submarine cables.
     The consideration of the preceding plans has led me to think of a
  system of working air lines, and short submarine lines, by which
  great rapidity of utterance, considerably greater I believe than any
  hitherto practised, may be attained.     I have no doubt but that on
  this system five or six distinct letters per second, or sixty words per
  minute, may be readily delivered through air lines and submarine
  lines up to 100 miles, or perhaps even considerably more, of length,
  and recorded by a self-acting apparatus, which I shall describe in a
  communication I hope to make to the Royal Society before its next
 meeting.

 graph." (Second communication.) By Prof. W. Thomson, F.R.S.
       I. Further  remarks on proposed method    for great  distances.
     Since my former communication on this subject I have worked out
 the determination of operations performed at one extremity of a sub
 marine wire, so adjusted, that when the other extremity is kept con
 stantly uninsulated, the subsidence of the electricity in the wire
 shall follow the triple harmonic law (that is to say, the electrical
 potential shall ultimately vary along the wire in proportion to the
 sine of the distance from either end, one-third of the length of the wire
 being taken as 180°). The condensation of the electrical pulse at the
 receiving extremity, due to such operations, is of course considerably
 greater than that which is obtained from operations leading only to
 the double harmonic as described in my last communication ; but
 experience will be necessary to test whether or not the precision of
 adjustment in the operations required to obtain the advantages which
 the theory indicates, can be attained in practice when so high a
 degree of condensation is aimed at.     The theory shows exactly what
 amount and duration of residual charge in the wire would result
 from stated deviations from perfect accuracy in the adjustments of
 the operations j but it cannot be known for certain, without actual
 trial, within what limit such deviations can be kept in practice.
 From Weber's experiments on the electric conductivity of copper,
and from measurements         which I have made on specimens of the
cable now in process of manufacture for the Atlantic telegraph,          I
think it highly probable that, with an alphabet of twenty letters, one
letter could be delivered every two seconds between Newfoundland
and Ireland (which would give, without any condensed code, six
words per minute) on the general plan which I explained in my last
communication ; and that no higher battery power than from 150 to
200 small cells of DanielPs (perhaps even considerably less) would
be required.     Whether or not this system may ultimately be found
preferable to the very simple and undoubtedly practicable method of
telegraphing invented by Mr. Wildman Whitehouse, can scarcely be
decided until one or both methods shall have been tested on a cable

of the dimensions of the Atlantic cable, either actually    submerged   or
placed in perfectly similar inductive circumstances.
   II. Method for telegraphing through submarine or subterranean
                 lines  of not more than 500 miles length.
    The plan which     I have  proposed to describe for rapid signalling
through     shorter  wires, has  one characteristic in common with the
plan   I have   already suggested for the Atlantic telegraph ; namely,
that of using different strengths of current for different signals.
    But in lines of less than 500 miles, condensed pulses, such as have
been described,     may be made to follow one another more rapidly
than to admit of being read off by an observer watching the image of
a scale in a suspended mirror ; and a new plan of receiving and
recording the indications becomes necessary.
    Of various plans which I have considered, the following seems
most likely to prove convenient in practice.
    Several small steel magnets (perhaps each about half an inch
long) are suspended horizontally by fine threads or wires at different
positions in the neighbourhood of a coil of which one end is con
nected with the line wire and the other with the earth.          Each of
these magnets is held in a position deflected from the magnetic
meridian by two stops on which its ends press; and two other small
stops of platinum wire are arranged to prevent it from turning
through more than a very small angle when actuated by any de
flecting force making it leave the first position.       When a current
passing through the coil produces this effect on any one of these
magnets, it immediately strikes the last-mentioned stops, and so
completes a circuit through a local battery and makes a mark on pre
pared electro-chemical paper.       For each suspended magnet there is
a separate style, but of course one battery is sufficient for the whole
printing process. One set of the different suspended magnets are so
 adjusted, that a current in one direction of any strength falling short
 of a certain limit makes only one of them move ; that a current in
 the same direction, of strength exceeding this limit but falling short
 of another limit, moves another also of the suspended magnets ; and
 so on for a succession of different limits of strength of current in one
 direction.    The remaining set of suspended magnets are adjusted to
 move with different strengths of current in the other direction
 through the coil.       Without experience it is impossible to say how
 many gradations of strength could be conveniently arranged to be
 thus distinguished mimistakeably.       I have no doubt, however, that
 very moderate applications of electric resources would give at least
 three different strengths of current in each direction, which could
 with ease and certainty be distinguished from one another by the test
 which the Suspended magnets afford. Thus, a signal of six varieties
 — one letter of an alphabet of six — could be recorded by almost in
 stantaneous movements of six suspended magnets, making one, two
 or three marks by one set of three styles, or one, two or three marks
 by another set of three styles, placed all six beside one another,
 pressing on a slip of electro-chemical paper drawn by clockwork, as
 hi the Morse instrument,

64                             Royal Society:   —
     In subterranean or submarine lines of      less than 100 miles length,
it would                   of simple battery applications, followed by
           be easy, by means
connexions with the earth, or by means of simple electro-magnetic
impulses at one end of the wire, to give ten or twelve of such signals
per second without any confusion of utterance at the other end. The
confusion of utterance which would be experienced in working thus
  through longer lines would be easily done away with, in any length
  up to 500 miles, by following up each battery application with a
  reverse application for a shorter time, or by following up each electro
  magnetic impulse by a weaker reverse impulse, so as approximately
 to fulfil the condition (described in my former communication), of re
 ducing the subsidence of the electrification in the wire to the double
 harmonic form.       It would, I believe, be readily practicable to send
 distinctly five or six such signals per second (each a distinct letter of
 an alphabet of six) through a wire of 500 miles length in a submarine
 cable of ordinary dimensions.       To perform the electrical operations
 required for sending a message on this system, mechanism might be
 had recourse to, and, by the use of perforated slips, as in Bain's and
 other systems, it would be easy to work from twelve to twenty of the
 six-fold varied signals per second through lines of less than 1 00 miles
length. Operating by the hand        is,however,   Ibelieve, generally pre
ferred for ordinary telegraphing and no such speed as the last-men
                                    ;
 tioned could be attained even by         skilful operator working with
                                           a
 both hands.      Six distinct letters or signs of an alphabet of thirty,
 could, however,   I believe, be delivered per second by the two hands
working on     a  key-board with twelve keys (perhaps like those of       a
 pianoforte), provided the keys are so arranged as to fulfil the follow
 ing conditions —
               :
     (1) That by simply striking once any one of        afirst set of six of
 the keys, an electric operation of one or other of the six varieties shall
 be made twice, the second time commencing at               definite interval
                                                            a
 (perhaps -^th of second) later than the first.
                    a
    (2) That by striking one or other of the remaining six keys at
 the same time, or very nearly at the same time, as one of the first
 set, the second operation of the double electric signal will be that
 corresponding to the key of the second set which            struck, instead
                                                            is
 of being mere repetition of the operation corresponding to the key
           a
of the first set.
    It would certainly be easy to make key-board to fulfil these
                                               a
 conditions with the aid of some clockwork power. Then by arranging
the thirty-six permutations and doubles of the six simple signals t»
represent an alphabet of thirty-six letters and signs, an experienced
operator would have to direct his mind to only six different letters
per second, while executing them by six double operations with his
fingers. That  it   would be possible to work      by
                                                   hand at this rate there
can be no doubt, when we consider the marvels of rapid execution so
commonly attained by practice on the pianoforte and     ;        appears not
                                                                 it
improbable that in regular telegraphic work, practised operators of
ordinary skill could perform from four to six letters with ease per
second, or from forty to sixty words per minute, on lines of not more
than 100 miles length. The six signals per second, which, according

      Prof. Donkin on                 the   Equation of Laplace's Functions.                    65
to the preceding estimate, could be distinctly conveyed by a sub
merged wire of 500 miles in length, could of course be easily per
formed by the hand, with the aid of a key-board and clockwork
power adapted to make the double operations for giving rapid sub
sidence of electricity in the wire when any one key is touched, and
to let the different strengths of current, in one direction or the other,
be produced by the different keys.     Thus without a condensed code,
thirty words per minute could be telegraphed through subterranean
or submarine lines of 500 miles ; and from thirty to fifty or sixty
words per minute through such lines, of lengths of from 500 miles to
 100 miles.
   The rate of from fifty to sixty words per minute could be attained
through almost any length of air line, were it not for the defects of
insulation to which such lines are exposed.       If the imperfection of
the insulation remained constant, or only varied slowly from day to
day with the humidity of the atmosphere, the method I have indi
cated might probably, with suitable adjustments, be made successful ;
and   Ithink it possible that it may be found to answer for air lines of
hundreds of miles' length.      But in a short air line, the strengths of
the currents received, at one extremity, from graduated operations
performed at the other, might suddenly, in the middle of a message,
become so much changed as to throw all the indications into con
fusion, in consequence of a shower of rain, or a trickling of water
along a spider's web.

    It appears probable, therefore, that the generalization of the result
obtained for the limited value of n is legitimate ; but the author does
not profess to demonstrate this conclusion, believing that the principle
of the " permanence of equivalent forms

    " A Memoir     on Curves     of the Third Order."        By Arthur Cayley,
Esq., F.R.S.
    A curve of the third order, or cubic curve, is the locus represented
by an equation such as U=(*^a;, y, 2)3=0 ; and it appears by my
 " Third Memoir on Quantics," that it is
                                                  proper to consider, in con
nexion with the curve of the third order, U=0, and its Hessian
 HU=0 (which         is also    a curve of the third order), two curves
of the third class,        viz. the curves represented by the equations
PU=0 and QU=0. These equations,                   I  say, represent curves of
the third class ; in fact, PU and QU are contravariants of U, and
therefore, when the variables x, y, z of U are considered as point
coordinates, the variables $, »j, £ of PU, QU must be considered as
line coordinates, and the curves will be curves of the third class.             I
propose (in analogy with the form of the word Hessian) to call the
 two curves in question the Pippian and Quippian respectively.                  A
 geometrical definition of the Pippian was readily found ; the curve
 is in fact Steiner's curve R0 mentioned in the memoir
                                                                   " Allgemeine

in the particular case of a basis-curve of the third order ; and I also
found that the Pippian might be considered as occurring implicitly
in my " Memoire sur les Courbes du Troisieme Ordre," Liouville,
t. ix. p. 285, and " Nouvelles Remarques sur les Courbes du
Troisieme Ordre," Liouv. t. x. p. 102.      As regards the Quippian,                              I
have not succeeded in obtaining a satisfactory geometrical definition ;
but the search after it led to a variety of theorems, relating chiefly
to the first-mentioned curve, and the results of the investigation are
contained in the present memoir.       Some of these results are due to
 Mr. Salmon, with whom                  I
                              was in correspondence on the subject.
 The character of the results makes it difficult to develope them in a
 systematic order ; but the results are given in such connexion one
                            I
 with another, as have been able to present them in. Considering
 the object of the memoir to be the establishment of a distinct geo
 metrical theory of the Pippian, the leading results will be found
 summed up in the nine definitions or modes of generation of the
 Pippian, given in the concluding number.        In the course of the
 memoir  I  give some further developments relating to the theory in
 the memoirs in Liouville above referred to, showing its relation to
 the Pippian, and the analogy with theorems of Hesse in relation to
the Hessian.

    In a communication made to the Royal Society in the last Session,
"On the Lunar-diurnal Magnetic Variation at Toronto," the author
had stated that he could discover no trace of the lunar influence of
the decennial inequality which constitutes so marked a feature in the
solar magnetic variations.     He has since read, in a memoir commu
nicated to the Imperial Academy of Sciences at Vienna, entitled "On
the influence of the Moon on the horizontal component of the Mag
netic Force," that M. Kreil is of opinion that the observations of
different years at Milan and Prague, when combined, would rather
favour the contrary inference, viz. that the decennial inequality exists
in the lunar as well as in the solar variations.   The author was led
therefore to re-examine this question by the aid of the observations
of the Declination at the Hobarton Observatory, which he considers
to be remarkably well suited for the purpose, as they comprise eight
years of consecutive hourly observation with unchanged instruments
and a uniform system of observation, and number, exclusive of
Sundays, Christmas-days, and Good Fridays, and occasional but very
rare omissions, no less than 51,998 observations.
    These observations have been examined by the processes already
described in the author's communication of last Session, and the
results form the subject of the present paper, showing, in the author's
belief, decided and systematic evidence of the existence of the diurnal
inequality, having its minimum epoch in 1843-1844, and its maximum
epoch five years later, in the mean diurnal variation due to the dis
turbances and in the more regular and ordinary solar-diurnal varia
tion, and the absence of any trace of a similar inequality in the
 lunar-diurnal variation.

    " On the Function of the Thyroid Body." By Patrick Martyn,
 Esq., M.D. Lond., Surgeon R.N.
    After referring to the form, situation, connexions and internal

structure of the thyroid body, its large supply of blood and its capa
bility of sudden alterations of bulk ; the author briefly adverts to the
 unsatisfactory explanations which have been offered as to its function,
 and then proceeds to state his own views, as follows : —
     " The upper part of the trachea, the larynx, and the passage of the
 fauces and mouth constitute the organ of voice ; the two former are
 the essential or voicing part as mechanicians call              it,   that which pro
 duces the tone.        The larynx and trachea taking     —        a     share in other
 functions and being associated by juxtaposition and attachment with
 contiguous organs — are always pervious and open for respiration                     ;
 lengthen and shorten, fall and rise with the oesophagus in deglutition,
 and bend and turn with the universal motions of the head and neck.
     " To admit of this great mobility and flexibility, certain structure
                                                                 a
 is  necessary.    The larynx         is   triangular box enclosing the apparatus
                                           a
  of the chordae vocales        ;its   two   cartilaginous sides or alae, diverging
 from the    front,    are  not    fixed    but  free at the back, being completed
 by soft parts the trachea
                 :                       composed of
                                         is            a     succession of incomplete
  cartilaginous hoops      or rings lying apart,        the  back and intervals being
¦
  made up    and   the  tube   completed by         soft membrane.
     " Now the structure of wind instrument, such as that of the
                                         a
 human voice         is,
                       requires the very opposite properties.                 It must be
  rigid, tense  and   inflexible.       The   qualities   of the  tone  will   be in exact
  proportion    to  these   properties.         How    thenis      the  soft,   slack and
  flexible vocal tube rendered thus rigid, tense and inflexible, and fit to
  produce pure tone         The muscles of the larynx, the thyro-hyoid and

                                                                                  :
  lying  on, or bring parallel       to, but   diverging    from   the vocal tube, they
  cannot effect the object referred to. It appears to me that the
  thyroid body       isprovided for this purpose. The act of uttering                  a
  tone or of speaking stops the return of the blood from that organ,
  distends and renders          tense, and from the nature of its attachment
                                it
  round the top of the trachea and on the free sides of the ales of the
  larynx, renders them fixed, firm, and tense also. This effect                is    aided
  by the aforesaid muscles, the thyroid body being interposed and
  giving them more advantageous                 mechanical action. This tension
  may be in any degree, and on energetic speaking or singing, the in
  creased size of the part and the fulness of the collateral veins may
  be seen.     This    isthe reason of its large supply and free distribution
  of blood. An instance of the want of this tension in an instrument
  may be seen in the bagpipe, where the porte-vent                is     attached to the
  chanter or voicing part by             flexible joint or
                                         a                  by   leather, and the tone
 is  in consequence squeaking and uncertain.
      " Besides thus giving rigidity, firmness and tension to the organ
  of voice, the thyroid body also acts in another capacity— as loader.        a
  In most musical instruments, loaders are used to render the vibra
  tions slower and longer, and the tone in consequence fuller, louder
   and deeper.     They compensate for want          of    size and space, and give to
 a  small instrument, or to small vibrating or voicing part of an instru

smothered.
   "The compass of the voice                 in great part produced by the
                                                         is
raising and lowering of the larynx, the shortening and lengthening
of the vocal tube. The thyroid body partakes of this motion, at
the same time firmly fixing and rendering tense the parts in each
position.      By its change of shape, bulk and density — flattening and

part in producing the wonderful qualities of modulation and expres-
sion peculiar to the human voice.            In animated conversation, decla
mation and singing, this may be seen.
   " Its function then appears to be threefold — rendering the slack,
mobile and flexible vocal organ or tube rigid, tense and inflexible,
and fit to produce pure tone                             by
                                            its bulk and density acting as

loader and strengthened making the tone more sonorous, full and
deep, and thus compensating for want of length and size in the
organ and finally, by its varying shape, bulk, density and pressure,
       ;
furnishing an important aid in producing the inimitable qualities of
modulation and expression enjoyed by the human voice.

larynx and trachea, and its being supplied by the same nerves— its

being proportionally larger in women and children than in men,

     " On the species of Mastodon and Elephant occurring in the
 Fossil state in England. — Part II. Elephants."            By H. Falconer,
M.D., F.R.S., F.G.S.
     In the introductory portion of Part I. of this Memoir, the author
 alluded to the ambiguity that has existed relative to the mammalian
 faunae of the Miocene and Pliocene periods in consequence of pa
 laeontologists confounding several distinct forms of Mastodon, of
 different geological ages, under one name (M. angustidens) ; and on
 this occasion Dr. Falconer stated, that, in the application of the name
 Elephas primigenius (Mammoth) to a multitude of elephantine re
 mains from various superficial and deep deposits, over a vast extent of
 territory, and of different ages, a similar, if not a greater, amount of
  error and confusion had arisen.       In fact, at least half the habitable
  globe has been assigned to the Mammoth as his pasture-ground, if
  we were to accept the determinations of all those who have written
  on the remains of Elephas primigenius.          The duration, too, of this
  nominal species in time is equally remarkable, so considered ; since,
  as it has been quoted from the lower and the upper pliocene beds,
  as well as from the post-pliocene glacial gravels, it ought to have
  existed before the European area received its present geographical
  form, and indeed before the Alps, Apennines, and Pyrenees reached
  their present elevation.        After noticing the difficulty met with
  by the geologist in the classification of the newer Tertiaries, on
  account of this ubiquitous presence of the Mammoth, the author
  proceeded to show that several species, belonging to two distinct
  subgenera, have been generally confounded under the name of Ele
  phas primigenius ; and that each had its limited range in geogra
  phical area and geological time.           The present condition of the
  nomenclature of the subject, and the history of the established
   species of European fossil Elephants, namely Loxodon meridionalis,
   Loxodon priscus, Euelephas antiquus, and Euelephas primigenius,
  preceded an explanation of the principles on which the species are
   determined, and a description of the dental characters by which the
  Elephants are divisible into subgenera, — a succinct account of which
   was given in the former part of the Memoir (vol. xiii. p. 462). The
   " intermediate molars " in Elephants have never less than six divi
   sions of the crown, and sometimes as many as eighteen.              These
   molars do not all have an equal number of ridges : some Elephants
   have an augmentation of only one ridge to the crown of the penul
   timate of these molars ; these are '* hypisomerous," namely Stegodon

      On the British Species of Fossil Mastodon and Elephant.        73
and Loxodon ; others, in which the number of the ridges progressively
increases, are "anisomerous," and form a third natural group, namely
the Euelephas or Elephas proper. The Stegodon has four species,
fossil in India ; and approaches the Mastodon in the form of the
molars.    The Loxodon includes the existing African Elephant and
three fossil species, and is characterized by its distinct rhomboidal
discs of wear on the grinders. Euelephas has thin-plated molars ;
but in some species there are intermediate stages, as regards the
angular mesial expansion of the plates, between it and Loxodon.
   Dr. Falconer next proceeded to review some well-ascertained
mammalian faunae localized in certain parts of Europe, where the
conditions of deposit are most simple, and to apply the results to the
more complex instances, where the remains of more than one di
stinct fauna are intermingled, or so closely deposited as to be too
readily confused by collectors.      With this view, the author in
stanced the Subapennine or pliocene deposits of the Astesan, and
elsewhere in Piedmont and Lombardy, where Trilophodon Borsoni,
Tetralophodon arvernensis, Loxodon meridionalis, Lox. priscus, and
Euelephas antiquus, with Rhinoceros leptorhinus, Hippopotamus major,
&c, are found associated together. In the Subapennine beds of the
Val d'Arno, in Tuscany, Tetralophodon arvernensis and Loxodon
meridionalis occur with the same Hippopotamus and Rhinoceros.
Near Chartres, in France, Loxodon meridionalis accompanies H.
major and Rhinoceros leptorhinus. The above-mentioned are neces
sarily the leading mammalian forms of the older Pliocene period.
North of the Alps pliocene deposits similar to those of Italy occur in
some parts of Switzerland, but they are soon overlaid towards the
north by a distinct mass of erratic drift of a different age and with
different mammalian remains. In the fluviatile "Loess" or Lehm
                                                              "       "
of the valley of the Rhine, and in the Glacial Drift of the plains of
Northern Germany, these post-pliocene deposits contain remains
of the true Mammoth, with the tichorhine Rhinoceros, the Musk-
buffalo, &c, which thus constitute the leading types of the post-
pliocene mammalian fauna.
   On the eastern coast of England, the Crag-deposits (the Red and
Norwich Crags) yield the pliocene Tetralophodon arvernensis, Lox
odon meridionalis, and Euelephas antiquus ; and the so-called Elephant-
beds at Cromer, Mundesley, and Hasborough furnish Lox. meri
dionalis and Euel. antiquus, with Rhin. leptorhinus and Hip. major.
These characteristically pliocene fossils, however, are occasionally
intermingled with the remains of the post-pliocene Euelephas primi-
genius, the latter fossils having been derived from the overlying and
later drift-beds, which have thus proved a fertile source of the
confusion and ambiguity already referred to. To some extent,
similar conditions exist at Bracklesham Bay and Pagham Harbour,
where molars of E. primigenius are found in the upper gravels,
whilst remains of E. antiquus abound in the older mud-deposit,
lately described in the Society's Journal by Mr. Godwin-Austen.
    Dr. Falconer then considered the fluviatile deposits of the Valley
of the Thames, in relation to their Elephantine remains ; especially

74                         Geological Society.
at Grays Thurrock and Brentford.       At the former place the author
recognizes the true pliocene assemblage of Loxodon prisons, Euele-
phas antiquus, Hippopotamus major, and Rhinoceros leptorhinus ; but
the group of mammals found at Brentford, according to the published
determinations, indicate the close proximity of both the pliocene
and post-pliocene faunae at different levels of the same section. The
 Grays Thurrock deposits, and the lower beds at Brentford were
inferred to be of an earlier age than any part of the Boulder-Clay
or Sill.
    The grouping of the E. primigenius, Rhinoceros tichorhinus, Bu-
balus moschatus, &c, in the newer gravels of England and elsewhere
was next dwelt upon, as affording an additional clue to the tracing
 of the several characteristic mammalian faunas over the European
area.
    To the possible objection of there being   too many large Probos
cideans    grouped in one fauna, the author replied that the bones of
animals of three distinct species actually occur together in one
stratum in Italy, and that six species are found in deposits of one
age in the Sivalik hills.
    Dr. Falconer concludes that the same mammalian fauna existed
throughout the period during which both the Crag and the fluviatile
beds of the Thames Valley were being deposited ; and that a chro
nological division of the newer Tertiaries into older Pliocene, newer
Pliocene or Pleistocene, and Post-pliocene is untenable ; too much
stress having been laid by authors upon the shell-evidence on this
point.    At the same time, it is not meant to be implied that all the
species of the fauna ranged everywhere throughout the area : some
in all probability were peculiar to the south, and others to the
north.
    The presence of the Hippopotamus in the pliocene deposits was
pointed out as being of great importance in indicating the character
of the pliocene land, which, extending between England and the
Continent, must have afforded a great system of rivers and lakes,
and probably had a comparatively warm temperature, as late as the
deposition of the Grays beds, where also (as is well known) occur
some southern freshwater shells, now extinct in England.
    After some remarks on the negative evidence afforded by this
mammalian fauna with regard to the supposed refrigeration of
the land during the Pliocene period, Dr. Falconer reviewed the
opinions of some English geologists on the physical conditions and
fauna; of this region during the newer Tertiary epoch, especially
the views of Mr. S. Wood, Mr. Prestwich, and Mr. Trimmer ; and
concluded with a few remarks on the occurrence of E. antiquus in
the Cefn and Kirkdale Caves, and of E. primigenius in Kent's Hole,
and on the non-existence of E. primigenius south of the Alps, and
its restriction in the United States of America to the Northern and
Central States.     In the Southern States and in Mexico a distinct
fossil species, Euelephas Columbi, hitherto undescribed, occurs along
with remains of Mastodon, Mylodon, Megatherium, Horse, &c.

NOTE ON THE QUESTION — IS THERE ANY ADVANTAGE, IN CHE
     MICAL DECOMPOSITIONS, IN INTRODUCING AN INDUCTION
     APPARATUS OF ONE WIRE IN THE CIRCUIT OF A VOLTAIC PILE ?
     BY C. DESPRETZ.
        a battery with one or two liquids in which the amalgamated zinc
IN      is scarcely, if at all, attacked by dilute sulphuric acid, when the
current is not established, the loss of weight of the zinc corresponds
with the oxygen of the water decomposed in the voltameter.               This
result shows that the pile is the most perfect of machines, when its
force is measured by the decomposition of water ; for in this case the
effective work is equal to the motive work within a hundredth, or
sometimes a two-hundredth part.             The pile is supposed to be com
pletely isolated, and the amalgamated zinc not sensibly attacked by
the dilute sulphuric acid.
     An experiment of M. De la Rive has shown that a pile which de
composes water very weakly, acquires the power of decomposing it
in a very marked manner, if an induction apparatus be introduced
into the circuit.        M. De la Rive has given the name of voltaic con
denser to the induction apparatus of one wire which he employed.
     It has lately been asserted, that by an arrangement analogous to
that of M. De la Rive, there is an actual economy in the consump
tion of zinc.        Such an opinion can only be founded upon exact
experiments.         If the quantity of zinc consumed were less than that
corresponding       with   the oxygen of the water decomposed, the union
of a pile and an induction apparatus would form a more than perfect
machine.        Its useful effect would exceed the motive work, which would
be    a  singular result.     To settle this question, the only course is to
 weigh     the amalgamated zinc before and after the experiment, and to
 compare     the  loss of the metal with the weight of oxygen and hydro
 gen    of the  water   decomposed in the voltameter.
     To make the necessary comparison, eight Bunsen's elements were
 arranged in two sets of four elements. This arrangement is equivalent
 to two elements in tension, of four times the dimension.           In the cir
 cuit was placed a small induction apparatus with a single wire.
 When half a litre of gas (oxygen and hydrogen) was evolved in the
 voltameter, the loss of the zinc was 1'578 grm., on the average of five
 nearly concordant experiments.           The average duration was an hour
 and two minutes.
      T578 grm. of zinc corresponds with a quantity of water represented
 by a volume equal to 08131 litre of dry oxygen and hydrogen at
 32°F. and a pressure of 076 metre.           The experiment only furnished
 0"500 litre of moist oxygen and hydrogen gas at a temperature of
  60o-75 F., and a pressure of 0*7435 metre.            In a dry state, at 32°
  F. and the pressure of 0-76 metre, the 0'500 litre is reduced to
 0-4531 litre.       Thus the induction apparatus causes a loss of 0"36
  litre, or four-ninths of the internal work, or four- fifths of the actual
  work obtained ; in other words, nearly half the zinc is not repre
  sented by the water decomposed           in the voltameter. If time were

 the only object, and the zinc and acids used in the pile were regarded
 as negligeable matters, there would be an advantage in the use of
 the induction apparatus. The same pile, but without the induction
 apparatus, only produced half a litre of moist gas in about double
 the time.
    The great loss of zinc here ascertained must not be attributed to
 the reversal of the current.     The direction of the current remains
 the same.    If each wire of the voltameter be covered with a gra
 duated tube, the volume of one of the gases is double that of the
 other ; the former is hydrogen, the latter oxygen.        In passing the
 current through a solution of sulphate of copper, one electrode is
 covered with a coat of red copper, the other retains the colour of
 platinum.    It is to the diversion of a part of the current by the
 conductor of the hammer that the greater part of the loss must be
 attributed.
    At the commencement of the experiment the current divides into
 two very unequal parts, — one passes by the conductor of the hammer,
 and the other traverses the voltameter.      This is very weak in com
 parison with the former ; so much so that it is almost incapable of
 decomposing water. Nearly all the current passes by the conductor
 of the hammer, the resistance of the two plates of copper, of a few
 centimetres in length, of which this is composed, being extremely
 small compared with that of the voltameter.          If the hammer be
 removed, the entire current passes into the voltameter, but the cur
 rent which then traverses the pile has less intensity than when the
 conductor of the hammer is closed. — Comptes Rendus, May 18, 1857,

  ON THE SLOW ACTIONS PRODUCED UNDER              THE COMBINED IN
      FLUENCE OF HEAT AND PRESSURE.            BY M. BECQUEREL.
    M. Becquerel has long been occupied with the slow actions pro
duced at the surface or in the superficial strata of the globe at the
ordinary temperature and pressure of the atmosphere. These actions
have a chemical, electrical or mechanical origin, but the chemical
cause is that which acts with the greatest efficacy.       The following
examples will give an idea of the influence of each of these three
causes.
   When a plate of iron is exposed to moist air, it soon becomes
oxidized here and there, in points where there is heterogeneity, or
where foreign bodies exist. These points constitute so many voltaic
couples, which assist the original chemical action.       In the electro
chemical reaction which takes place, water is decomposed; the
hydrogen which comes in contact with the oxide combines with the
nitrogen of the air or that of adherent organic matter, forming am
monia or carbonate of ammonia, which is usually found in rust.
The effect is still more manifest when a fragment of charcoal, or of
any other body which is a good conductor, but less oxidizable than
iron, is applied to the iron plate. Copper, lead, and silver, in contact
with certain solutions, produce analogous effects.
   Rocks with a felspar base, or which contain alkali, when crushed
and when their fragments are carried away by water and rolled in

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous      Articles.             77
the torrents,    become    decomposed    by the mutual     friction  of their
particles.    M. Becquerel has proved this decomposition twenty
years ago, by crushing basalt, felspar, &c. in an agate mortar in
presence of water ; the damp paste which is formed soon furnishes
an alkaline reaction.      The decomposition of the bodies pulverized
is sometimes facilitated by mixing them with other bodies of which
the elements are capable of acting by double decomposition upon
those of the former.
    Thus on triturating together in equal atomic proportions nitrate
of lead and iodide of potassium, iodide of lead and nitrate of potash
are obtained in a few moments.         In operating with sulphate of soda
and carbonate of lime, a double decomposition is also produced.
    In a recent communication to the Academy, M. Daubree has
brought forward some new evidence in support of the preceding
observations.      He operates as follows : — Into a cask, to which he
gives a rapid rotatory movement, he puts water with fragments of
felspar and quartz ; at the expiration of a certain time a mud pro
duced by the trituration of the particles is deposited, and the water
becomes alkaline.       The felspar is consequently decomposed, at least
partially.
    In these investigations, M. Becquerel had hitherto operated only at
the ordinary pressure and temperature of the atmosphere ; in the pre
sent case he has experimented at temperatures and pressures more or
less elevated, with the view of obtaining an idea of what must have
taken place in the sedimentary rocks when they were covered by
 ejected rocks, such as granite, porphyries, basalt, &c. In the present
memoir the combined influence of heat and pressure in chemical and
 electro-chemical actions are alone referred to. The effects resulting
from mechanical actions will be treated of in a particular memoir.
    The author operates as follows : — He takes a tube of 5-6 millims.
 in diameter and 2 decimetres in length, closed at one extremity ;
 into this he puts the solid substance, and pours over it the solution
 which is to react. On the top of this some sulphuret of carbon or
 aether is poured ; the tube is sealed up and placed in a stove heated
 to 212° — 302° F. Another tube is sometimes introduced into the
 principal one, containing another volatile liquid, the elementsof
 which are to react upon the solid body or the solution ; lastly, when
 electro-chemical effects are in question, the apparatus destined to
 produce these is placed in the tube.         By means of these different
 modes of experimentation, M. Becquerel has obtained the following
 products : —
     1 . Arragonite in right rectangular prisms with two bevels at each
 apex, and the angles of which are measurable by the goniometer.
     2. Protoxide of copper in pretty octahedral crystals.
     3. Sulphurets of copper in prisms, having the aspect of the native
 sulphurets.
     4. Sulphurets of silver arid lead in lamellae, having a metallic aspect.
     5. Green carbonate of copper (malachite) and blue carbonate of
 copper in small nodules.
     6. Metallic iodides, bromides and cyanides, insoluble and crystal
 lized, &c.

  78                  Intelligence and Miscellaneous      Articles.
      From the researches of M. Becquerel it appears, that under the
  combined influence of heat and pressure, slow actions acquire new
  activity and produce interesting effects in a physico-chemical and
  geological point of view. — Comptes Rendus, May 11, 1857, p. 938.
       NOTE ON THE OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF MAGNETIC BODIES.
                                   BY M. VERDET.
      In a note read some time ago before the Academy of Sciences*,
  the author made known some experiments showing that under the
  influence of magnetism the salts of iron exert an action upon polarized
  light opposite to that of water, glass, sulphuret of carbon and some
  other transparent substances.            On studying the compounds of the
  other magnetic metals, he has found that a certain number of them
  act upon light in the same way as the compounds of iron.
      He gave the name of magnetic rotatory power to the property of
  rotating the plane of polarization temporarily developed by magnetism
  in transparent substances.           The magnetic rotatory power of most
  transparent     substances    he called  direct, and that of the salts of iron,
  inverse.     He now proposes to substitute for these terms the expres
  sions positive and negative, which indicate the direction of the rota
  tion.     Water, sulphuret of carbon, glass and the other transparent
  substances of which the rotatory power is positive, rotate the planes
  of polarization in the direction in which positive electricity traverses
  the conducting wire of the electro-magnet ; the salts of iron rotate
  it in the direction of movement of negative electricity.
      The magnetic metals of which the author has investigated the
  transparent compounds, are iron , nickel, cobalt, manganese, chromium,
  titanium, and cerium.          All these metals are attracted by electro
  magnets,     and   form    compounds endowed with the same property.
  There    are  other   metals,  such as platinum and its analogues, which
  appear    to be  magnetic,    but  all the compounds of which are diamag-
  netic ; the magnetic character of these metals is therefore not
  absolutely certain f.
     Iron. — Protosalts of iron are endowed with a negative magnetic
  rotatory power, evidenced by the weakness of the action which the
  aqueous solutions of these salts exert upon polarized light.               This
  action is always weaker than would be that of the water contained
  in the solution, but in the same direction, and the author has not
  met with any protosalt of iron possessing a negative power sufficient
  to destroy entirely the positive power of the water.           To make quite
  sure of this phsenomenon, the author prepared solutions of sulphate
  of iron of different degrees of concentration, and found that the
  rotations produced agreed exactly with the hypothesis, that these
  solutions are mixtures of two bodies endowed with opposite rotatory
  powers J.

     + The experiments relating to these variously concentrated         solutions
 presented a remarkable peculiarity.        Considering them as formed of water

                  Intelligence and Miscellaneous         Articles.               79
    The negative magnetic rotatory power of the salts of peroxide of
iron is much greater than that of the protosalts. An aqueous solution
of perchloride of iron containing 40 per cent, of salt, exerts a negative
action upon polarized light six or seven times greater than the
action of water, and nearly equal to that of Faraday's heavy glass.
.dStherial and alcoholic solutions give the same results. But wood-
spirit appears to he the most suitable solvent ; it can take up a
considerable quantity of iron-salt, remaining much more transparent
than water, aether or alcohol with a similar quantity of salt. By
dissolving 55 parts of perchloride of iron in 45 parts of wood-spirit,
a liquid is obtained, which, from its transparency, is adapted for exact
observations, and the action of which upon polarized light is nearly
double that of heavy glass, but in the opposite direction.                     The
author made use of this liquid to see whether the magnetic rotatory
power of the salts of iron varied according to the same laws as that
of ordinary transparent substances.               He compared the rotation
produced by       1 centitn.  of the  solution,  with   the opposite rotation of
the same      thickness   of sulphuret   of carbon,   and  caused the amount of
 the  rotation   to vary, by altering    the  intensity   of  the electro-magnet,
 the size and form of the armatures, or their distance from the trans
 parent substance. The proportion of the two rotations was always
 the same, so that the negative rotation produced by the salts of iron
 varies in accordance with the same laws as the positive rotation
 caused by transparent substances in general.               »
    From     the  experiments    of  Pliicker   and  Faraday, it is known that
 the ferrocyanide of potassium is diamagnetic, and the ferridcyanide
 slightly magnetic.        The author found that the rotatory power of
 the ferrocyanide is positive and pretty considerable ; that of the
 ferridcyanide negative and very great.             15 parts of ferridcyanide,
 dissolved in 85 parts of water, furnish a liquid the rotatory power of
 which is twice as great as that of water.
    Nickel. — All the salts of nickel have a positive rotatory power, so
 that their solutions exert a greater action upon polarized light than
 that of the water which they contain.            This positive rotatory power
 is well marked, and comparable to that of the salts of zinc and tin.
    Cobalt. —The magnetic rotatory power of the salts of cobalt is
 positive, but weaker than that of the salts of nickel.                It is rather
 difficult to be shown, as no salt of cobalt can be dissolved in con
 siderable quantity in water without diminishing the transparency
 of the liquid.
    Manganese. — The protosalts of manganese                  possess a positive
 and anhydrous sulphate, the phenomena observed could be represented
 numerically, by attributing to the water and the anhydrous sulphate con
 trary actions proportionate to the density which these two bodies possess in
 the solution.      On the other hand, this was impossible, supposing the
 solutions to contain water and crystallized sulphate of iron with 7 atoms
 of water. Hence it appears probable that the dissolved salt is not the
 crystallized, but the anhydrous sulphate; and the same kind of experiment
 may perhaps be applied to the solution of some analogous chemical
 questions.

  rotatory power, comparable to that of the salts of cobalt ; the salts
  of the sesquioxide possess too much colouring power to be adapted
  for these experiments.          Nothing, however, is easier than to prove
  the magnetism of the three preceding metals and their salts.
     Chromium. — The protosalts of chromium are difficult to prepare;
  those of the sesquioxide have so much colouring power that they
  cannot be dissolved in very small quantity in water without destroying
  all its transparency ; but chromic acid and some chromates are very
 convenient for experiments.            Neutral chromate of potash has a
  weak negative rotatory power, which, however, it is impossible to
  mistake ; the rotatory power of the bichromate is also negative, and
  greater than that of the neutral salt ; chromic acid has a negative
  rotatory power comparable to that of the protosalts of iron. Chromic
  acid and bichromate of potash are magnetic, whilst the neutral
  chromate is diamagnetic.           On comparing this circumstance with
  the observations relative to the ferrocyanide of potassium, we shall
 be led to conclude that the positive rotatory power of the latter is
 not due to its being diamagnetic, but to the physical properties of
 the iron being as completely masked as its chemical properties in
 this compound*.
     Titanium. — Bichloride of titanium, which is liquid at ordinary
 temperatures, has a negative magnetic rotatory power, a little superior
 in absolute value to the magnetic rotatory power of water. The
 author could not ascertain with certainty whether it is magnetic or
 diamagnetic ; pure titanium is magnetic.                Titanium is generally
 regarded    as allied  to  tin, and the bichloride   in particular as analogous
 to bichloride of tin.        It is remarkable, that, under the influence of
 magnetism these two bodies exert contrary actions upon polarized
light.
     Cerium. — A concentrated solution of sulphate of cerium and a so
 lution of chloride of cerium, appeared to possess a magnetic rotatory
 power a little less than that of water.          It is therefore probable that
 the rotatory power of the salts of cerium is negative. The mag
 netism of these salts is as evident as that of the salts of chromium or
 manganese.
     Thus, by   the properties which they communicate to their trans
 parent   compounds,       the magnetic metals are divided into two series,
¦— one containing iron, chromium, titanium, and probably cerium,
 the other including nickel, cobalt and manganese.                It is worthy of
remark, that the most strongly magnetic metals, iron and nickel, are
the types of these two series, and that the less magnetic metals, as
it were, establish the transitions. — Comptes Rendus, June 8, 1857,
p. 1209.
    * In studying the optical properties of the strongly-coloured solutions
furnished by the persalts of iron, the salts of nickel, cobalt and chromium,
and the chromates, it is essential to take into account the influence of the
coloration upon the position of the tint of passage.           Serious errors will
be committed     if the necessary correction be neglected.

Society for 1836, ventured to call attention to certain pheno
mena of the proof-plane commonly employed to determine the
electrical distribution in different points of a charged conductor.
This question has recently again engaged my attention ;            I have
been hence led to further investigate the general nature and
operation of statical electrical force.        In the course of my several
inquiries certain facts have presented themselves, calculated,
as it appears to me, to materially affect our views of elec
trical action.       In order, however, to make these inquiries, as
submitted in this present communication, clear and intelligible,
it is desirable for me to briefly treat the question, as it were,
ab initio in all its general elementary detail, so as to complete
that continuous chain of reasoning requisite to the 'full develop
 ment of every sound philosophical inquiry,— a privilege which
 will, I  trust, be freely granted me.

    2.  I omit for the present all especial account of the several
processes and electrical instruments of research employed in these
inquiries ; they are for the most part such as       I have described in
former papers    in  the Royal Society's  Transactions,  viz. the Hydro
static Electrometer, the Scale-beam Electrometer, Unit-jar, Bifilar
or Torsion Balance, Quantity-jar, &c*         I will merely observe, that
I  have, since my first announcement of these instruments, greatly
improved them, and carried processes of quantitative measurement
to a remarkable degree of precision, so that given and measured
 quantities of electricity may be deposited with perfect certainty
 on insulated conducting surfaces, the intensity or reactive force
 accurately deduced under a great variety of circumstances, of
form, extent of surface, variation of distance, or any other ele
 ment essential to the inquiry.      I have further given most especial
 attention to the perfection of the several insulations upon which
the accuracy of important deductions mainly depends. Wherever
 it is admissible, the conducting bodies are insulated by suspen
 sion filaments of strong silk-gut, carefully varnished with a solu
 tion of shell-lac or naphtha, and sustained by varnished glass
 supports, so that an extremely small surface is exposed in such
 kind of insulation.      The glass rods and other solid insulators
 employed were also carefully varnished, and as slender as the
 nature of the experiment would admit, and were made perfectly
 dry when employed, by the dry heat of a curved iron heated to
redness.      By these means, and with attention to the air of the
 room, I have been enabled to retain the quantity-jar and needle
 of the balance in a charged state for two and sometimes three
 days together, and that, too, without much deterioration of
 charge.     Suspended insulated conductors of some considerable
 extent have been observed to perfectly retain the quantity of
electricity communicated to them, and far exceeding the time
requisite for the experiment under examination ; so that all cal
 culation of loss of charge by atmospheric influence, and which
 is commonly a very precarious matter, became altogether eli
 minated in the inquiry.
    3. Preliminary views. — If an insulated neutral conductor, N,
 Plate I. fig. 1, be immediately opposed to an insulated charged
conductor P, then, as is well known, a peculiar and very extra
ordinary species of action ensues, — an action apparently of a
 sympathetic kind, and which at first seems to be an action ex
erted between the two bodies at a distance.           The result of this
action, whatever it be, is to change the actually existing electrical
condition of the two bodies ; e. g. the neutral body N, without
any direct communication of electricity, exhibits a state of elec
trical excitation and becomes attractive of surrounding matter,
         * Transactions of the
                               Royal Society for 1834, 1836, 1839.

whilst the existing attractive force of the charged body P on
 surrounding matter is sensibly diminished. The electrical state
 thus induced in the neutral body N, is a peculiar state: its
 near face n, immediately presented to the charged body P,
assumes a condition of electrical force directly opposed to that of
 P, whilst its remote face, p, exhibits the same kind of force. On
 the other hand, the near face of the charged body P immediately
 opposed to N, although its electrical state is still the same, ex
 hibits a very considerable increase of charge ; and this is attended
 by such a diminution of charge in its remote face r, that this
face r will, under some circumstances, not only approach neu
 trality, but it may actually pass that limit.        The subsequent or
 actually existing    states of these  two bodies,  therefore,  instead of
being as represented in fig. 1, may be better conceived by the dia
 graming. 2. This peculiar electrical disturbance, both in charged
or neutral bodies, has been designated not unaptly by the term
electrical induction. Conceiving that both these disturbances were
present in every case of electrical attractive force, and that it was
from these disturbances the subsequentforce of attraction resulted,
 I was led, so long since as the year 1839, to consider the action of
 the charged on the neutral body, fig. 1, as a primary or direct
 inductive force, and the action of the now changed neutral body,
 fig. 2, upon the charged body, as a sort of secondary or reflected
inductive force*, two terms which have since been fully recog
 nized and employed by many cultivators of this branch of science.
    4. Both the single- and double-fluid hypotheses of electricity
 have been employed in explanation of this induced electrical dis
turbance in bodies, and not altogether without success.                The
theory    of two  electrical fluids  supposes   a disunion   of  the  com
bined electrical elements, and a greater or less accumulation of
them in opposite parts of the given conductors.           The single-fluid
theory supposes an actual displacement of electricity in each of
 the opposed bodies, and a disturbed or new distribution of it.
Although it is far from probable that either of these hypotheses
is a true explanation, yet either may be employed in the way of
elucidation, and to facilitate our comprehension of the kind of
action we have to deal with.        I adopt here the latter hypothesis,
as being of a simple character, well calculated to represent the
phenomena.
    5. Assuming, then, the presence of a peculiar agency every
where existing in the matter of our globe, and termed electricity,
and supposing it to be of such a nature as to tend always to an
equilibrium of distribution, then when a charged body, P, fig. 1,
which we will assume to be charged positively, is directly opposed
to a neutral body N, the tendency of the superabundant                elec-

tricity of P being to an equilibrium of distribution, a portion of
the electricity proper to N, and which is adjacent to the charged
body P, begins, as it were, to recede toward its remote parts,
so as to provide for the reception of as much of the charge accu
mulated on P, as the near extremity of P is prepared to throw off
upon it ; a state of things already illustrated in fig. 2, in which
there is an increased accumulation, g, in charged body, P, and
a displacement, n, in neutral body, N.       Supposing no impedi
ment to motion,    the bodies     P   and   N   are apparently     attracted ;
they move toward each other up to contact, the charge becomes
shared between them, and N is said to have taken up electricity
from P.    I   must again repeat, that I do not employ this hypo
thesis further than as a means of elucidation and perspicuity ;
other modes of explanation may be equally admissible ; but what
ever hypothesis we resort to, we have virtually the same elements
to deal with : it is the form only of representation to the mind
which we change.
   6. This being understood, it is very important to observe, that
a charged body P, fig. 1, cannot possibly throw off any of its
charge upon a second neutral body N, unless the neutral body N
can assume this new and preparatory induced state represented
in fig. 2 : if from any disturbing cause that is not possible, then
no attractive force ensues, and no electricity is communicated.
Hence it is we find a much greater force of attraction between a
charged and a neutral body susceptible of free inductive change,
than between a charged and neutral body less open to such
change.     If the neutral body be connected with the earth, then
the attractive force    is,
                          under the existing conditions, the greatest
possible, since the electricity of the neutral body N, fig.         has2,
then unlimited room to recede, and the induced change in the
face n nearest the charged body as complete as           can be.
                                                          it       The
few following experiments are instructive and important.
   Exp.   1.  Let an extremely thin circular disc of gilded wood, n,

                            an insulating thread from one arm of            a
delicate balance   B, and duly counterpoised         by
                                                     weights placed in
the opposite scale-pan.       Place an insulated and similar gilded
disc p  immediately under n, and proceed to communicate to                  p   a
given electrical charge      little or no attractive force will ensue,
                              :
even although the distance between the two discs be very consi
derably diminished  ;   indeed, under any circumstances the force
will be small; there       in fact, little or no capacity in the op
                         is,
posed faces    p n of the discs for inductive change (5).        If the
disc n be a   thin lamina of varnished talc little susceptible of in
duction, the force      by
                         this test    is
                                      inappreciable.

 suspended disc n, so as to allow the electricity of the near face of
n to recede, and a determination of the charge toward the face p
of the charged disc p to ensue, then considerable attractive force
 follows ;   instead of suspending n

change of which            it   is

    These facts have an important application to the phsenomena
 of statical electricity, and cannot be too forcibly insisted on                                :
they may be easily and substantially verified experimentally.
    7. It is  apparent from the experiments of Cavendish, Saussure,
Volta, Coulomb, and other celebrated philosophers, that                hol         if      a
low metal globe be insulated and charged (as                termed)   with
                                                                      it   is
electricity, all the charge will be found on its exterior surface                              ;
so that   a   small carrier-ball perfectly insulated on            slender      a
 support, takes up no charge after being introduced into the
interior of the globe and placed in contact with its inner sur
face.    There      no doubt that the charge
                     is                             determined toward
                                                              is
the exterior surface of the globe.           A great variety of experi
 mental evidence leads to this conclusion.        Still the failure of an
 insulated carrier-ball to take up electricity from the interior sur
face of the globe              is,
                         taken abstractedly,                 by
                                                  no means conclusive
 of the fact         quite possible for the whole interior of the globe
                   it it
              :        is
 to bristle, as     were, with electricity, and yet the carrier-ball fail
 to become charged in the slightest degree.         This fact      of such       is
 great elementary importance, that          feel myself justified in call
                                                    I

have greatly extended and perfected.
   Exp. 5. Let       fig.  be   hollow globe of glass of about

and exposing an opening about an inch in diameter.            Let
this globe be filled with dry mercury up to the neck       and be                 a,

86    Sir W. Snow Harris's Researches in Statical Electricity.
placed in an outer glass vessel A D, also filled with mercury ; we
have then all the conditions requisite for imparting a charge to
the interior of the glass.    For thiS purpose let a light insulated
charging rod, c b, surmounted by an electrometer of repulsion, m,
be introduced within the globe, and the mercury in the exterior
vessel be connected with the ground by a metallic communica
 tion, a t. Let this system be charged in the usual way : when
 charged to any degree of intensity, as shown by the electrometer,
 remove the communication with the earth a t, and also the
 charging rod c b, by means of its insulating support k ; run off
the mercury first from the outer vessel A D, and then from the
 interior of the globe by means of a glass siphon, and place the
now empty globe on an insulator, as represented, fig. 6. We
may be now assured, on the faith of Franklin's celebrated expe
riment of the electrical jar with moveable coatings, that all the
interior surface of the globe is covered with electricity.     Intro
 duce now a small insulated carrier-ball b into this charged globe
 so as to touch the interior electrified glass, and again withdraw
it. The carrier-ball comes away quite neutral, as in the case of
the hollow metal globe, notwithstanding that it has been actually
brought into contact with a dense stratum of electricity, the pre
sence of which may be made evident by simply attaching the
carrier-ball to the lower point b of the insulated charging rod b c,
fig. 5, and introducing it as before.      The electrometer m will,
if delicately hung, be immediately affected; or otherwise the
charge may be shown by the medium of an ordinary gold
leaf.
    8. That the failure of the carrier-ball to take up electricity is
in no degree dependent on the circumstance of what may be con
sidered in the light of electrical accumulation on an insulating
surface as distinguishable from the case of the hollow metal
sphere, may be clearly shown by charging a plane glass surface
having moveable coatings and treating the plane charged glass
in a similar way.     In this case electricity is freely taken up by
the carrier-ball from the charged side : it is hence evident that
the globular form of the surface is the immediate cause of the
failure of the carrier-ball to take up electricity from the glass.
The carrier-ball, in fact, cannot take on that induced electrical
state (3) requisite to its reception of free electricity ; the forces
operating on it being in contrary directions, its natural electricity
cannot recede from any point of its surface, hence all induced
change in the distribution of its own proper electricity, n p, fig. 2,
is impossible.
    This experiment with charged glass may be effectively ma
naged by employing water instead of mercury ; or we may en
velope the outer surface of the globe in tinfoil and electrify the

      Sir W. Snow Harris's Researches in Statical Electricity.      87
 glass internally by means of a point connected with the electrical
 machine and projecting within the globe.
     9. That induction would go on within the globe were it free
 to do so, may be exemplified by one or two striking illustrations.
     Exp. 6. Let a charged hollow globe of metal or glass, fig. 7,
 be placed on an insulating support as before, fig. 6 ; introduce
 within it the small insulated carrier-ball b, and whilst within the
 globe touch the carrier-ball with a light insulated wire, c b, pro
jecting freely into the air ; remove this wire and then withdraw
 the carrier-ball ; the carrier-ball will be found charged with elec
 tricity opposite to that of the globe ; if the globe be plus, the
 carrier-ball will be minus, as might be expected.       In this state
 introduce the carrier-ball again within the globe, and so as to
 touch the interior surface ; it comes away now quite neutral,
 that is to say, it has taken up positive electricity from the inte
 rior surface, either by immediate contact with the electrical par
 ticles in the case of a charged globe of glass, or through the
 medium of the metal surface in the case of a charged metal
 globe.
     The same result ensues if we touch the carrier-ball with the
 free wire when in contact with the interior surface, provided both
 be raised together off the surface previously to withdrawal of the
 wire, otherwise the carrier-ball immediately takes up positive
 electricity and comes away neutral.         The insulated free wire,
 however, comes away positively charged with the electricity which
 had retired from the carrier-ball.
     If  both the touching wire c b, fig. 7, and carrier-ball b, be
raised together and removed without the globe, then the whole
evinces positive electricity ; for the carrier-ball, whilst in contact
with the interior of the sphere, having first become negative,
immediately takes up positive electricity from the charged sphere
and becomes neutral, and probably remains so whilst in contact
with the sphere ; whilst the exterior ball c of the touching wire
evinces positive electricity, being necessarily charged with the
electricity superinduced upon it by the first induction (3), fig. 2.
 On raising the whole system out of the sphere, however, this
superinduced electricity expands over the whole; for the ori
ginal conditions are restored, whilst the new electricity taken up
remains; hence the carrier-ball will now evince positive elec
tricity.    And this is really what happens when an insulated wire
and ball are introduced within the globe of sufficient length to
project into the air.
    10. Although the two cases of charged globes to which have  I
thus called attention may at first appear different, the one being
a case of a hollow globe of metal, the other of glass, yet a very
little reflection will show that both cases are virtually the same

thing ; the difference is a difference of degree, not of kind ; they
are, in fact, both reducible to the elements of the electrical or
Leyden jar.        Indeed, every case of what is commonly called a
charged conductor, resolves itself into the form of a coated elec
tric, and is the result of a peculiar disposition and combination
of electrics and conductors ; it           in fact, the accumulation of
                                             is,

bounded by, and in direct contact with, conducting matter,
either near or distant.          Thus, in the case of what has been
termed     a charged   hollow   metallic  globe, in which all the charge
is   conceived to be impelled, as        were,

                          a
 surface of the metal, we find on an attentive examination the
 following arrangement of conductors and electrics, fig.                  and           8,
 into which every case of electrical charge may be finally resolved.
 We have, first, metallic surface

                                                                               is a

 continuation other air, A, not so immediately electrified, and sus

                                                       :                in its      is
  turn bounded by other conducting matter, N. When, therefore,
  we impart free electricity to the hollow sphere            we do nothingP,
  more than cause an electrical accumulation to ensue upon the
  stratum a, according to the well-established            principles of the
  Leyden experiment.        We do not, in fact, charge the sphere at
  all, any more than we charge the coating of an electrical jar                                :
  indeed    it   doubtful
                 is            in any case we could charge

  than that of the inner coating of          given dialectric bounded by
                                                 a
   distant conducting matter, and which we may consider as the
   opposed coating     ;the metal of the globe        merely the conductor

   to the charge.     The inductive action upon which the charge de
   pends, may be shown to extend to great distances.               Cavendish
   traced  it from the centre to the walls of        room 16 feet in dia
                                                            a

       If we examine the experiment of the charged glass globe (7),
   fig.   5,we find the elementary conditions precisely the same.
    Here we have (fig.       an interior coating of mercury

result of the operation is to cause an electrical accumulation on
the interior surface of the glass.   The great difference in the
two cases simply consists in the more or less perfect application
of the coatings to the dialectric medium upon which the charge
depends.     If we could suppose our hollow metal globe sur
rounded by a second external globe of metal, the two globes
being near each other, but not anywhere touching, then we
should have the two cases identical, as seen in the very ingenious
apparatus employed by Faraday (Experimental Researches, 11 95).
If, further, we imagine that, subsequently to the charging of
this system, both the globes were removed, as in the case of the
mercury coatings, Exp. 5, and the intermediate air to remain, as
it were, fixed and immoveable, then would be developed upon
the boundaries of this stratum all the phaenomena of the hollow
glass globe above described ; the charge would remain with the
air. If, in the case of the charged glass globe, we allowed the
interior metallic coating to remain under the form of thin me
tallic leaf attached to the glass, then the final experimental con
ditions would be identical. As it       is,
                                          we operate upon the charge
in the case of the hollow metal sphere, through the medium of
the coating in the case of the glass globe, we come into contact
            ;
more immediately with the charge itself.
    11. The theoretical view, therefore, of the celebrated experi
ment of what has been termed         a  charged hollow sphere, and
which appears the best adapted to explain the phsenomena,          that
                                                                  is
 of charged electrics generally.     The free electricity first commu
nicated to the inner coating, viz. the metallic sphere, operates by
induction upon the nearest matter susceptible of electrical change
 (3), and thereby developes or calls into operation the opposite
electricity. The opposite forces thus brought into life tend to
 combine and exhibit attractive force, and consequently come as

 charge simple insulated conductors generally.        The amount of

 by  them under given electrometer indication, can never be so
                 a
 great as in the case of systematically coated electrics of compa
 ratively small thickness. The case of simple conductors      is  much
 the same thing as the case of extremely thick glass, or the limit
 ing of the free action of one of the coatings of an electrical jar    ;
 in either case the quantity of electricity which can be accumu

  nished.     The experiment with an electrified hollow globe there
  fore appears to have been expressed in very inexact terms, and
  the phenomenon of the exclusive appearance of the charge upon
 the exterior surface somewhat misapprehended.
      12. It follows from these demonstrable conditions of elec
  trical charge, that a stratum of what may be termed electrical
  particles must always necessarily exist upon the surfaces of a
  charged conductor, as is clearly demonstrable by experiment; and
 the electrical agency, whatever it be, penetrates to a greater or less
  degree the substance of the air itself, or other dialectric medium
 in contact with the conducting surface, as is well shown in Fara
  day's most comprehensive researches (1245).        This is really the
 acceptation of the term electrical atmosphere ; a term correctly
 applied by the celebrated Volta, who most thoroughly compre
 hended the practical nature of electrical force, notwithstanding
 that his power of rigorous thought has been questioned, and his
 theoretical views of electricity rather severely remarked on by an
 eminent writer not altogether unbiassed by theoretical opinion,
 and evidently not a little impatient of dissent*.     That Volta was
 most perfectly correct in attributing the phsenomena of charged
 electrical conductors to the presence of electrical atmospheres
 surrounding them, taken in the sense in which          I
                                                        have just ex
 plained the term, is absolutely demonstrable by the most conclu
 sive experiments : we remove the metal, and there remains the
 charged stratum; in other words, the atmosphere of electrical par
 ticles, as it may be termed, entirely without and independent of it.
     13. The electrical stratum thus found to exist on electrified con
 ductors appears firmly held to the surface by attractive force, and
 is inseparable from it by movement of the body. Franklin whirled
 a charged ball attached to a silk cord many times round in the air
 and with great velocity, still the ball retained its chargef-      An
electrified conductor, therefore, when transferred from one place
 to another, may be supposed to carry the electrical stratum along
 with   it,just as the metallic coating of charged glass would do.
It true that the term electrical atmosphere has been occasion
   is
ally used in      vague and unsatisfactory sense, and has hence been
                   a
justly discountenanced     by  many eminent physicists and mathe
maticians.      When taken, however, in the sense in which      I  have
applied        as expressive of
              it                 a  demonstrable fact, the question
assumes quite another form.       Volta, therefore, in referring the
phsenomena of electrical attraction and repulsion, and the opera
tion of electrified bodies generally on each other, to the imme
diate action of the electrical particles themselves held firmly on

from rigorous thought, or evince in any degree a vague and im
perfect apprehension of the probable nature of electrical force.
When we remove the coatings of a charged electric (7), Exp. 5,
something is evidently left behind — some agency or source of
power. What is that something ? In what does it consist ? It is
evidently external to the metallic surface with which the dialectric
 surface was previously in contact, although inseparable from it
 so long as the two remain combined ; and it is really from this
 something, which we express by the term electrical stratum or
 atmosphere, that the phsenomena we observe arise, and not from
 an hypothetically charged conductor*.
      14. On attentively reviewing these facts, it will be quite ap
 parent, that in any endeavour to take away or abstract electricity
 from a charged surface through the medium of a conducting sub
 stance applied to    it,
                        it   isabsolutely essential to maintain in this
 substance  a   sufficient power of inductive change.    This we cannot

  thata   small and very completely insulated disc of metal of indefi
  nitely small thickness may under some circumstances come away
  from contact with an electrified surface very nearly neutral.
  These are important facts as affecting the practical operation of
  what is    termed the proof-plane, and which consists of an ex
  tremely thin and small insulated disc of metal applied to the
  Burface ofa    charged conductor, often with view of determining

   disposed in different points of the surface.     The received theo

   removal we may be supposed to have actually abstracted an ele

   of this view, or to be assured that     a small insulated disc, how-

   15. Exp. 9. Having satisfactorily investigated this fact,      I pro
ceeded to observe the rate of increase of force at the centre as
the altitude of the intervening cylinder above the surface was
increased, and to find the altitude of the point at which it would
become equal to the force at the extremity, viz. 32 to 33 degrees.
                  I
With this view employed a series of small cylinders of gilded
wood, varying from *1 to "75 of an inch in altitude, and about
•4 of an inch in diameter ; also other similar cylinders varying
from 1 to 6 inches in altitude, so as to obtain, by superposition
or otherwise, any given height above the surface required. The
following are some of the resulting forces as compared with the
altitude, in which it is apparent that the force up to a certain
limit increases with the square root of the altitude, or is nearly
in that proportion, after which it ceases to increase, and is for
further altitudes nearly the same.

   On employing a cylinder from 5 to 6 inches high, the force
from the plane with a given charge was observed to be every
where the same.
   16. It appears, therefore, from these results, that the effect of
the intervening cylinder is to raise up the point of contact, and
place the tangent or proof- plane p, so far without the influence of
the electrical stratum upon the surface as to admit of a free in
ductive change ; the cause, therefore, of a tangent disc of small
thickness becoming more highly charged from the extremities
of an electrified surface than from the centre, may mainly depend
upon its position in respect of the electrical stratum (12) when
placed in these two relative points.           I have on a former oc
casion called attention to this circumstance.          If, for example,
we place a small disc of little thickness in the centre of a charged

  94    Sir W. Snow Harris's Researches in Statical Electricity.
  surface, as at c, fig. 10, it would suffer more obstruction to in
  ductive change from surrounding electrical particles than when
 placed at the extremity q, where it woidd be less involved, as
 it were, in counteracting forces.       If placed directly at and out
 side the extremity q, then one of its faces would be still more
 exposed and free ; it would therefore take up more electricity in
 these points than at the centre c, in which it was less free ;
 a result perfectly in accordance with the phenomena of electric
 force already exemplified (6), Exps. 1, 2, &c.          By giving the
 touching disc, therefore, a free action of induction, either by
 such means as resorted to in Exp. 9, just described, or by attach
 ing to its remote surface a light gilded reed and ball of about 6
 inches in length, as represented in fig. 11, we obtain an equal
 reactive force when transferred to the balance, from all points of
 the surface to which we apply it.        I have little doubt but that,
 employed in this way, the method of finding the relative quan
 tity of electricity on charged surfaces employed by Coulomb is
 very exact.     I  found, for example, that in charging a rectangular
 plate  P, fig. 10,  with one, two, three, &c. measured quantities of
 electricity, the reactive forces from an elevated cylinder a b, or
from a tangent plate prepared as in fig. 11, were exactly in the
same ratio, at whatever point of the surface it was applied.
It is clear that in the preceding Exp. 9 the several altitudes
admit of being considered as proof-planes of increasing thick
ness : were we to trust the indications of such planes, we might
be led into very unsound deductions as to the distribution of
 electricity upon the charged plate.      Suppose the thickness of the
plane had been about the -1 of an inch, the reactive force at the
centre, as compared with the force at the extremity, would
have given quantities in the proportion of 7 : 33, being nearly as
 1:5.     If  we take the thickness *25, then the proportion would
have come out in the ratio of 1 1 : 33, or as 1:3; if "5, it
would have been as 15 : 33, or as 1 : 2 nearly ; so that, as before
observed (13), Exp. 7, it would be difficult to say at what limit
we may arrest our measure in respect of a decrease of the thick
ness of the proof-plane, although by no means difficult to find
the limit for its free inductive susceptibility in the opposite di
rection, as just shown.       There are many important phaenomena
of electrical charge involved in these considerations, and to which
the proof-plane, as usually employed, would certainly ill apply.
If, for example, we impart the same quantity of electricity to a
square, a circular plate, and a rectangular plane of equal area
greatly extended as to length, then, as shown by Volta, the in
tensity of charge is greatly diminished in the case of the long
plane, and we could dispose upon it a much greater quantity of
electricity under the same degree of the electrometer.           Yet a

   Sir W. Snow Harris's Researches in Statical Electricity.      95
proof-plane applied to these surfaces in the usual way might
actually evince a greater reactive force when applied to the rect
angle, although the surface and quantity of electricity were actu
ally the same as in the square or circular plate ; the electrical
stratum on the rectangle being less condensed, as it were, upon
any given point of its surface.      Now a touching body, prepared
as in fig. 11, so as to be susceptible of a free induction, will,
when transferred to the balance, at once show the difference of
intensity in the two surfaces, and although not in this case
affording a correct measure of the relative quantity of electricity,
may under another form of the experiment be made available for
that purpose.
    17. It is to be here considered how far the presence of a cy
lindrical conductor ap, fig. 10, elevated above the charged plane,
is calculated to disturb the original distribution, and change its
quantitative condition upon different points of the surface. That
a portion of the electrical accumulation becomes transferred to
the cylinder is certain ; but the quantity is not in proportion to
its extent of surface, or such as to interfere in any appreciable
degree with the original distribution, which will be found to
remain precisely the same whether the cylinder ap, fig. 10, be
present or not.      The cylinder, in fact, may be considered to
become charged in great degree by a new distribution of its own
 electricity, and to become affected in pretty much the same way
 as the carrier-ball and wire introduced into the hollow sphere
 (9), Exp. 6, fig. 7, that is to say, a portion of the electricity of
 the cylinder itself, in the face next the charged surface, first
 becomes displaced by induction (3), fig. 2, and retires towards
 its remote or distant face/), fig. 10.    This preparatory change
 complete, the near or lower face of the cylinder then receives or
 shares in the total charge in proportion to the amount of this
 induction ; so that a new quantity of electricity proper to the
 cylinder itself is thus called into action and becomes sensible at
 its remote portions, and the quantity of charge taken by the
 cylinder is limited in extent to the element of the surface it
 actually covers. Now the influence of this upon the general and
 original state of the distribution is quite inappreciable, as may
 be easily shown by taking the reactive force at any given point
 with and without the presence of the cylinder, when the force
 will be found precisely the same.
    The method, then, of determining the reactive force generally
 of the charged plate P, or of any point of it, through the medium
 of an intervening elevated conductor of given form and dimen
                                          a
 sions, appears to be the best and most accurate process which can
 be possibly employed, inasmuch as the electrical development at
 its distant face p, fig. 10, will always be in the direct proportion

96     Sir W. Snow Harris's Researches in Statical Electricity.
 of the electrical force of the element of the surface which it actu
 ally covers.
    18. These facts being duly considered, it appears by no means
 improbable that the distribution of an electrical charge through
 the medium of metallic surfaces, considered as conductors merely
 to the charge (10), may, upon the whole, be uniform, or nearly
 so, and that the deduction upon the evidence of the proof-plane,
that it is far otherwise, is at all events questionable.       According
to the action of the proof-plane, the electrical charge accumulated
upon a long rectangular plane R, fig. 12, would be represented
by a curved line, such as a R b, a large portion of the charge
being accumulated at the extremities.         It         is,
                                                      however, just pos
 sible, on the other hand, from the phsenomena observed, (14),
 (15), that the charge may be at least thicker at the centre, and
 admit of being represented               by
                                       another kind of curve, such as
 dee*. If, however, we take the evidence of simple and direct ex
                                                         a
 periment, we should be led to conclude that the stratum of elec
trical charge upon the surface of electrified conducting bodies
was uniformly distributed throughout.           The following are few      a
striking and new experiments which greatly favour this conclu
sion, or are at least in accordance with it.
    Exp. 10. R, fig. 13,    is   rectangular plate of copper, about
                                 a                                             4
feet in length and    3  inches in width, carefully insulated in the
way already described (2).        The suspended or moveable disc n,

sustaining the wheelwork, &c,           set on
                                           is      travelling carriage or
                                                     a
rail so as to admit of the whole being easily moved backward
or forward, and the suspended disc n of the electrometer easily
transferred immediately over any required point.               Let      be R
now charged with any given measured quantity of electricity,
so as to bring the index     t       by
                                    the attraction of the disc n to a
given   point,  say  10   degrees; the disc n being at          given di
                                                                   a
stance above the plane, say an inch.         Let  the  attracted disc be
now gradually moved along over the surface of the plane from
one extremity to the other   ;  not any appreciable change will ensue
in the position of the index     ; the force on the disc will be every
where the same,   —  a result perfectly consistent with the hypothesis
of uniform distribution.      Any simple apparatus may be employed
for this experiment, such as        common balance so poised as to

4 feet in length and 1 inch in diameter, and E a delicate electro
meter of the form just adverted to.         The cylinder being charged
with a given measured quantity of electricity, the arm of the
electrometer inclines toward it a given number of degrees.         Let
this instrument, affected by a given inclination, be now carefully
 moved along against a guide-rail upon a base B : no change
whatever will ensue in the degree of inclination of the arm. The
charged cylinder exerts upon it the same force throughout.
    Exp. 11. The cylinder e, fig. 14, being suspended as above de
scribed,  I endeavoured by means of an electroscope of repulsion,
m q, to discover whether any change would ensue in the divergence
of the balls in changing their position along the charged surface.
This electroscope was constructed and applied in the following
way : — A slender varnished rod of glass, c m, fig. 15, attached to
a small hook m,, is cemented into a light cross arm a b of gilded
wood, about an inch long, being equal to the diameter of the
cylinder c, fig. 14 ; b c and a d are two light reeds terminating
in balls of pith hung at each extremity of the crosspiece ab.
The jointed hinges are made of very fine platinum wire turned
into rings, and hang one within the other after the method of
Cavallo.    This construction gives to the reeds and balls an ex
cessive freedom of motion, and is incomparably the best method
of suspension for such electroscopes         I have as yet met with.
This electroscope is hung by means of the hooked ring m, upon
a small line of silk a b, fig. 14, stretched between the wooden balls
terminating the glass arms supporting the insulated cylinder c.
When the cylinder is electrified, the balls necessarily diverge and
stand out freely from it on each side, as shown in the figure.
Let this electroscope thus divergent be now gently and carefully
moved along upon the line a b by means of a long slender rod
of glass applied against the ring m : no appreciable change is
observed in the divergence of the reeds ; it is everywhere the
same.    If the divergent reeds be placed beyond either of the
extremities of the cylinder, then they are apparently thrown
outwards as well as sideways, as would necessarily be the case,
but up to the extremity of the cylinder on either side          I have
never yet been enabled to detect any change such as represented
in fig. 12 ; and that, whether by the movement of the electro
scope, or by testing the divergence from different points unde*
the same charge.
   19. An interesting question here arises as to how far the di
vergence of the balls is really the result of repulsive force, pro
perly so called.     Whether, as maintained by Lord Stanhope
and many other eminent electricians, the reeds and balls are
attracted, as it were, into the air rather than absolutely repulsed,
much in the same way that we observe an excited silk ribbon

attracted toward the wall of a room ; the reeds evidently seek to
diverge beyond the limit of the dense electrical stratum on the
surface of the cylinder; and hence in charging the cylinder with
one, two, three, &c. measured quantities of electricity, by which
the thickness of the stratum may be supposed to be continually
 increased, we observe the distance of divergence become also in
 creased.    Beyond the extremity of the cylinder the balls would
 be attracted into the air with increased force in two directions,
 viz. from the extremity and from the side of the cylinder ; hence
 they would appear as if repulsed sideways and outwards.
     These experimental facts, as it appears to me, are quite con
 sistent with a uniform thickness of stratum or distribution of
 electricity upon the surface of a charged conductor.
     20. The distance to which the attractive force of a charged
 surface extends will be directly as the quantity of electricity
 accumulated, as may be thus experimentally demonstrated.
     Exp. 12. Let the disc n, fig. 13, of the electrometer E be
 placed at a given distance above any point p of the rectangular
 plate R, suppose #5 of an inch.       Charge the plate R with a given
 quantity of electricity, and observe the force at the given distance,
 •5 of an inch ; let it be, for example, 16 degrees of the index at
 this distance.     Let the distance be now increased; let           it, for
 example, be     made   twice as great, or equal       1  inch; then    the
 index will only show     4  degrees of force     the force will, in fact,
                                                  :
 be as the squares of the distances inversely.          Under these cir
 cumstances, double the charge of the plate            R
                                                       ;   the force indi
 cated will   be  again  16   degrees, that      to say,
                                                  is        will be as the
                                                           it
 square of the charge.       Hence the distance to which an equal
 attractive force has extended from an area on the surface of the
 plate equal to that of the disc n,     isas the quantity of electricity
 accumulated,    that   is,
                          as  the charge directly.
     Ewp. 13. Place the electrometer         E,
                                              fig. 14, at given distance
                                                           a
 opposite any point of the cylinder      c   ;charge the cylinder with
a   given measure of electricity, and note the degree of inclination
 of the arm of the instrument.          Let the distance of the ball
 of the electrometer from the cylinder be now made twice as
 great, and the charge on the cylinder doubled         ;   the inclination
 of the arm will remain the same.
 I     endeavoured to find in this way the limits of distance at
which the force was just sensible to very delicate electroscopes,
and found them to be as the quantity of charge in the cylinder.
Thus   a   given quantity being accumulated, the electroscope              E
(the sensibility of which could be. very greatly increased by
changing the position of small piece of reed moveable on the
                              a
lower arm, and     by  which  it    poised) was placed at such
                                   is                              a  mea
sured distance from the cylinder as admitted only of an extremely

    Sir W. Snow Harris's Researches in Statical Electricity.                  99
small movement, just as much as would indicate force.                      This
distance being now made twice as great, the arm was observed
to be similarly affected when the quantity of charge was doubled.
These results accurately correspond with the law of striking
distance in Lane's discharging electrometer, as                 I  have before
shown in my paper in the Royal Society's Transactions for 1834,
p. 227.        Since double, treble, &c. quantities of electricity exert
attractive forces as the squares of these respective quantities,
whilst, on the other hand, the forces decrease inversely as the
squares of the distances between the striking points, we have
 necessarily the same striking force at all distances if we make
the quantity of charge increase with the distance.                     Hence a
charge     which    could  strike  over  a distance   of  '5 of an  inch would,
on being doubled, strike over twice that distance, or 1 inch;
that is to say, the force at that distance would be the same as
seen in the experiments 11, 12, 13, &c. just described*.
    21. In the case of a conducting surface terminating in an
acute angle or point, we may still have an equal distribution of
the charge, the only difference being a more free action of the
charge upon the angular portion.               Thus in fig. 16, let P be
an    insulated      conductor   charged    with   electricity, and suppose
it to be transformed into a pointed conductor, Vp, by removing
the triangular portions a c ; then, as is evident, all the electrical
 stratum which formerly occupied those portions a c would become
 removed, and there would be less pressure or impediment, as it
 were, to the free inductive action of external matter on a given
point p than there would be if the point were enveloped in elec
trical particles. The force, therefore, upon the principles already
explained (15), would extend to a greater distance, and the
striking distance of a point so circumstanced in respect of the
electrical stratum greatly extended.            The charge therefore would
run off more freely, or be more freely received by a pointed
conductor than by          a point enveloped in surrounding electrical
particles.
    22. The result of experiment 9, and the deductions (15) and
(16), enable us to operate upon metallic conductors in commu
nication with the fixed disc of the electrical balance, or hydro
static or other electrometers, without any care for the position
   * M. De la Rive, in his late comprehensive work on electricity, appears
to consider this law of striking distance, as compared with the law of inten
sity, somewhat extraordinary.       He says, " Ce qu'il y a d'assez remarquable,
c'est que    la distance a laquelle une decharge entre deux balles chargees
d'electricites contraires peut avoir lieu, est simplement proportionelle aux
quantite"s d'electricite, tandis que les forces attractives sont proportionelles
aux carres de ces forces." (Vol. i. p. 66.)     It will be seen, however, that
the above considerations fully explain the fact, and show it to be a neces
sary result of the laws of electrical force.

 ON considered         to be bibasic, and polymeric with cyanic acid.
 But this view did not sufficiently well account for some of its
                                                                 '
 properties ; and Gerhardt, in the first edition of his Organic
 Chemistry,' held, that from the explosive properties of the
fulminates their nitrogen was contained, not as cyanogen, but
 partially as NO4, and he gave to fulminic acid the formula
 C4 N (NO4) H2.        The constitution of this acid has lately been
 the subject of separate investigation at the hands of Schischkoff*
and Kekule *, who have arrived at results which are very similar,
and include Gerhardt's supposition.
     From the highly explosive nature of the fulminates, and from
the fact that cyanogen compounds are constantly formed in their
various decompositions, Kekule held that one half of their nitrogen
was in the form of NO4, and the other half as cyanogen.                  It
follows from this, that the other half must be present in another
form, and would constitute with the remaining constituents a
compound belonging to the methyle group. The formula of ful
minating mercury would then be C2 (NO4) (C2 N) Hg2, and
would exhibit in its composition the greatest analogy with a
large class of compounds ; for instance, C2 H, CI, CI, CI, chloro
form; C2 (NO4) CI, CI, CI, chloropicrine; C2 H H H C2 N, ace-
tonitrile    (cyanide of methyle).         Fulminating mercury would
stand nearest to chloropicrine and acetonitrile.         Like the former,
it would be a nitro-compound, and like the latter, a cyanogen
compound.         It might be a nitroacetonitrile, whose two hy
drogen atoms are replaced by mercmy, and hypothetical fulminic
acid would be a nitroacetonitrile, C2 HH (NO4) C2 N.

       In  accordance with this interpretation, it was to be expected
    that  fulminating mercury, when treated with chlorine, would
    yield chloride of cyanogen and chloropicrine ; and experiment
    showed this to be the case.      Kekule obtained as products of this
    reaction gaseous chloride of cyanogen, and an oil which had all
    the properties of chloropicrine, but was probably contaminated
    with chloride of carbon.      In this reaction no carbonic acid was
    formed, and the equation would thus be, —

    By distilling fulminating mercury with hypochlorite of lime,
    pure chloropicrine is obtained.         By treating fulminating mer
    cury with sulphuretted hydrogen, Kekule obtained sulphocyanide
    of ammonium and carbonic acid, the occurrence of which in this
    reaction had "hitherto been unnoticed.             The reaction did not,
    however, give concordant results on analysis.             The previous ex
    planations given of this reaction are not quite correct : it is
    rather to be assumed that the free fulminic acid decomposes with
    sulphuretted hydrogen at the moment of its formation into sul

       Schischkoff derives fulminic acid from the type biuret, to which
   he gives the rational formula 2 (C2 O2 N H ) N H3. If the hydrogen
    of the ammonia be replaced by the bibasic radical C4 H2 (NO4),
    we get the formula of fulminic acid, 2(C202NH) .N(C4H2N04).
    In an analogous mannerfulminuric* acid isderivable from the type
    urea. (C2 O2 NH) NH3, in which the hydrogen of the ammonia is
    replaced by the same tribasic radical, C4 H2(N04).              If  this view
    were correct, we ought to get from these compounds evidence
    of the presence of NO4, and of the group NC4 H2(N04), which
   would be mononitroacetonitrile. Schischkoff made the experiment
    on fulminuric acid, which gave chloropicrine on treatment with
   hypochlorite of lime, as Kekule had found was the case with ful
   minating mercury under the same treatment.                Schischkoff found
    also that fulminuric acid, when treated with nitrosulphuric acid,
   gave a new body, which is trinitroacetonitrile, NC4(N04)3. This is
   a compound     similar to camphor, possessing a penetrating unplea
   sant smell, which melts at 41°-5 and explodes at 220° C.                    Its
   formation may be thus expressed :        —

102         M. Dexter on   the Equivalent Weight     of Antimony.
By the action of water and of alkalies, this substance furnishes         a
body NC4 (NO4)2 (NH4), which is acetonitrile, NC4 H3, in which
two equivalents of hydrogen are replaced by 2 (NO4), and one of
hydrogen by NH4. By boiling this body with potash, and sub
sequently treating the salt thus obtained with oxide of silver, a
beautiful salt is obtained, to which the author gives the formula
           NH3 As    i
                       ^*'  ^is   remar'iable  salt would thus belong
                            C4 H3~l
to the type acetic acid,       „    fO4.
    A new determination of the equivalent weight of antimony
has been made by Dexter*, who has obtained numbers which
 differ slightly from those obtained by Schneider and by Rosef.
 His determination deserves, however, great consideration,          for it
was made with all possible care and precision by the method ori
ginally used by Berzelius. The starting-point was the prepara
tion of pure metallic antimony ; and for the purpose of obtain
ing this, advantage was taken of the insolubility of metantimo-
niate of soda.      Crystallized tartarized antimony was fused in a
 Hessian crucible with nitre and potash, and the fused mass poured
out, allowed to cool, dissolved and filtered, and a solution of pure
chloride of sodium added to it. The metantimoniate of soda pre
cipitated was well washed out, and then converted into hydrated
antimonic acid by treatment with nitric acid.             The hydrated
antimonic acid, well washed out and dried, was placed in a
porcelain crucible lined with pure charcoal and strongly ignited.
The reduced metal was not quite pure j it contained traces of
sodium, for it was impossible to extract all soda from the metan
timoniate by nitric acid.        The metal was therefore finely pow
dered, mixed with some of the same antimonic acid, and again
strongly ignited. The metal collected at the bottom in a regulus,
covered with a slag of melted oxide of antimony.            It was quite
pure, as was shown by special experiments.           Its specific gravity
was 6-705 at a temperature of 3°-75.             Scheerer for the same
temperature found the specific gravity of antimony to be 6708.
    For the purpose of the determination, the metal was converted
into antimonic acid by treatment with pure nitric acid, the
antimonic acid ignited and weighed as antimonious acid, SbO4.
The number obtained as the mean of eleven very concordant ex
periments was 1529-4, or 122-3 on the hydrogen scale.                This
method of determination, although simple, has the
                                                           disadvantage
that a small error of observation has great influence on the result,
and to avoid this source of
                                inaccuracy Dexter made a great many
experiments with another method.           This consisted in determi-

   Wohler*' describes an improved method of preparing the
crystallized silicon discovered by himf. It consists in fusing
aluminium with five times its weight of soluble glass, and ten
times its weight of cryolite.      The soluble glass he uses is that
made by Kuhlmann of Lille.            This is powdered and mixed
with the powdered cryolite ; a Hessian crucible is half-filled with
the mixture, and the piece of aluminium laid on             and thenit,
filled up with the rest of the mixture. The crucible             then     is
heated, and the mixture kept melted for about half an hour. On
cooling, black reguli are obtained, quite saturated with silicon,
and- the surface     generally covered with 3- and 6-sided plates
                       is
of silicon. ~
     It  remarkable that these reguli cannot be remelted at the
          is
temperature at which they are formed.         They can be heated to
redness in any open crucible without melting and without being
oxidized.     If red-hot globule be thrown into cold water, half
                   a
the volume of aluminium flows out, and the silicon remains in
the form of the globule as       crystalline mass filled with hollow
                                  a
spaces.     In preparing silicon,       better therefore to treat the
                                          it   is

some aluminium        obtained in this way, which can be used for
                       is
a  fresh preparation of silicon.
    The same chemist has, in conjunction with Bufff, been en
 gaged on some investigations of the relations of aluminium to
the galvanic current.      In the course of these they have dis
covered     gas containing silicon which

 104          M. Baudrimont     on a new Sulphide    of Carbon.
 Wohler and Buff have not yet been able to establish its quanti
 tative composition, for it is always mixed with variable quantities
 of free hydrogen. It appears to contain an equal volume of
 hydrogen. This gas, siliciuretted hydrogen, is also obtained
 when aluminium containing silicon is dissolved in hydrochloric
 acid ; but in this case it is mixed with so much free hydrogen
 that it is not spontaneously inflammable in the air.
    On heating silicon to a dull red heat in a current of dry hydro
 chloric acid gas, the latter is decomposed, yielding hydrogen and
 a new chloride of silicon.     This is a mobile fuming liquid, more
 volatile than ordinary chloride of silicon, and is decomposed by
 water into hydrochloric acid and into a white substance, which
 is a new oxide of silicon. The latter is slightly soluble in water,
 very soluble in alkalies, hydrogen being evolved, and silicic acid
 being formed.     It is a hydrate which does not lose its water at
 300° C, but heated to redness in the air, it takes fire and
 burns with a very white light, evolving hydrogen which inflames.
    The attempts made to determine the composition of the new
 oxide and the new chloride have not given satisfactory results.
 Most of the numbers agree with the formulae Si2 O5 and Si2 CI5 ;
 but these appear improbable, and it is not certain that pure sub
 stances have been obtained.        The corresponding bromine and
 iodine compounds have been obtained by the same methods.
 The bromide is a fuming liquid, very volatile ; the iodide is a
 dark red solid, very fusible and volatile, which decomposes in
 moist air into hydriodic acid and the white oxide.
    Baudrimont*    has discovered a new sulphide of carbon, which
 stands  in the  same   relation to carbonic oxide, CO, that bisul
phide of carbon, CS2, does to carbonic acid, CO2.           It may be
formed by a variety of reactions, but the best method consists
in passing the vapour of bisulphide of carbon over spongy pla
tinum, or over pumice heated to redness.         In this case CS2 de
composes into sulphur, and into a gaseous body which is the new
subsulphide. This reaction shows its formation in the most pre
cise manner.
    It is also obtained in the process of making bisulphide of
carben, — by the action of hydrogen on bisulphide of carbon at "a
red heat; by calcining sulphide of antimony with excess of
charcoal ; by the action of oxide of carbon on sulphuretted hy
drogen at a high temperature, CO + HS = HO + CS; and by the
action of sulphurous acid, or of chloride of sulphur on defiant
gas at a red heat ; it is also produced in the destructive distilla
tion of sulphocyanogen.
   The first method yields it pretty pure, in the others it is mixed

     M. Becker   on the  Artificial Production of Margaric Acid.         105
  with sulphuretted hydrogen and oxide of carbon.              It is purified
   by  being  rapidly passed    through  solution    of  acetate of lead, of
   subchloride   of copper  dissolved  in  II CI,  and  after being dried it
   is preserved over mercury.
      It is gaseous, colourless, with an odour resembling ordinary
   sulphide of carbon, but strongly setherial, and not at all dis
   agreeable.    It burns with a blue flame, producing carbonic acid,
   sulphurous acid, and a little sulphur.         It is rather heavier than
   carbonic acid. Water dissolves its bulk of the gas, but decom
   poses it into sulphuretted hydrogen and carbonic oxide.             With
   alkalies it is rapidly decomposed.      With lime-water it gives sul
   phide of calcium, and its own volume of carbonic oxide,
                          CaO + CS = CaS + CO.
  At   a  red heat it is slowly decomposed (1) by spongy platinum ;
   (2) by the vapour of water into HS and. CO ; (3) by hydrogen
  into HS, and a carburetted hydrogen; (4) by copper into gra-
  pbitoidal carbon, and sulphide of copper.            Exposed to the sun
  light with chlorine, a reaction takes place which gives rise to the
  formation of new bodies.
      Exploded with oxygen in the eudiometer, it furnishes equal
  volumes of carbonic acid and sulphurous acid, from which, and
  from its decomposition with alkalies and with copper, its for
  mula CS has been deduced.
      It has been known that the cyanides of the alcohol radicals,
  when treated with potash, give off ammonia, and there is formed
• a member      of the fatty acid series containing two equivalents
  more carbon than the alcohol radical from which it was derived.
  Thus cyanide of sethyle, C4H5C2N, gives propionic acid, C6'H604j
  cyanide of amyle, C10HuCaN, gives caproic acid, C12H1204.
  Becker* has made an interesting application of this reaction,
  and succeeded in producing margaric acid, C34 H34 O4, by treat
  ing cyanide of cetyle, C32 H31 C2 N_, with potash.
      Cetylic alcohol was first prepared from spermaceti by known
 methods, and converted into iodide of cetyle by treatment with
 iodine and phosphorus. The conversion of iodide into cyanide
  of cetyle was effected by boiling the iodide of cetyle with an
 alcoholic solution of cyanide of potassium for several days, and
 the cyanide was converted into margaric acid by boiling it for
  some time with caustic potash. The acid thus obtained, and its
 baryta-salt, gave numbers corresponding to margaric acid ; it had
 also the appearance of that acid, but its melting-point was 52°
 to 53° C, or 12 degrees lower than the melting-point assigned
 to margaric acid.

  106                  M. Schuler     on  Linoleic Acid.
     Becker has also prepared some of the double aethers, and
  compound sethers of cetylic alcohol.            They are easily obtained
  by  the  same  methods    by which     the  corresponding compounds of
  the lower homologues of cetylic alcohol are procured.
     Heinz* has investigated        the composition of the solid part of
  olive-oil.   He found that olive-oil contained palmatine as well as
  oleine, and very probably stearine and arachine.            But the diffi
  culties attendant on the separation, in the pure form, of the
  higher acids were too great to allow this point to be stated with
  certainty.
     According to some older experiments by Sacc, linseed-oil was
 held to be the glycerine compound of two acids, of which one
 was liquid and oily, and the other solid and crystalline.             The
 composition of the drying oils has been lately studied by Schuler f,
 who communicates the results of his experiments on linseed-oil.
 The mode of investigation and separation of the constituents was
 that usually employed in this kind of investigation. He finds in
 it a new fatty acid, which he names linoleic acid. When pure it
 is a pale yellowish liquid oil, which strongly refracts light.
 Treated with nitrous acid it becomes red, and after a time viscid;
 but there is formed no elaidic acid, as is the case with oleic acid
 under these circumstances.          The analyses of the salts of this
 acid did not give accordant results ; it seems to have a tendency
 to form acid salts.     Numerous analyses of the pure acid gave,
 however, numbers corresponding to the formula
                      C82 H28  04= C32     H97 O3,   HO.
 The number of equivalents of carbon exceeds that of hydrogen
by four, while in ordinary oleic acid, C86 H34 O4, the excess is
two.      From its composition and relation to nitrous acid it opens
 a new series of fatty acids.
     Schuler thinks that the solid acid in linseed-oil is palmitic,
and not margaric acid, as Sacc had held.             Linoleic and palmitic
acids have the same number of carbon and oxygen atoms, but
differ in the number of their hydrogen atoms,

    Mayer has made a very extensive and complete series of ana
lyses of the ashes of various seeds.            Hitherto the quantitative

contained in plants had not been investigated; and yet it is
indubitable that certain mineral constituents of a plant have

greater importance for certain organic substances than others ;
and it is impossible, for instance, to establish any relation be
tween the mere total quantity of ash and the quantity of albumi
nous substances in a plant.       Now albuminous substances never
occur in a vegetable structure unaccompanied by phosphoric
acid ; it must be admitted, therefore, that the existence of the
former is dependent on the presence of the latter, and the ques
tion arises what is the relation between them.          In vegetable
structures, which principally contain albumen, the relation be
tween phosphoric acid, nitrogen and bases, is different to that
existing in structures which principally contain vegetable caseine
or gluten, and hence albumen requires a quantity of phosphoric
acid and bases different to that which is necessary for caseine and
gluten : experiment must decide under what limits these va
riations may take place.
     The seeds which Mayer investigated were rye, wheat, barley,
 oats; and besides these he analysed several leguminous seeds, and
 several sorts of flour, groats and bran.      These substances were
from the most various parts of Germany, and grown on the most
 varied soils.     Mayer describes at some length the analytical
 methods used, and states that some of the older analyses of these
 substances are not trustworthy on account of the imperfect me
 thods by which they were made.
     The general results he arrived at from his experiments and
 from known facts may be summed up as follows : —
     1. The seeds of the cereals contain a nearly constant quantity
 of water, and differences of climate exert no influence in this
 respect.
     2. The proportions of phosphoric acid and nitrogen vary, but
 these variations are within very narrow limits.
     3. The proportion of ash in the seeds of the cereals varies also
 within very narrow limits.
     4. The finer the flour is ground, the less is the quantity of
  nitrogen contained in it.
     5. Bran is rich in phosphates and in nitrogen.       Its ash con
  sists principally of phosphates, and does not contain much silica.
     6. Leguminous seeds are richer in nitrogen and phosphoric
  acid than cereal seeds.     The latter contain pyrophosphates ; the
  former, tribasic phosphates.
      7. A remarkable     relation exists between albuminous sub
  stances and phosphoric acid. An increase in the quantity of the
  former is accompanied by a proportionate increase in the quan
  tity of the latter, and phosphoric acid is a necessary condition of
  the existence of albuminous substances.
      8. This relation varies, however, for each kind of albumen —
  for vegetable albumen, legumine, and for gluten. Leguminous

108            Prof. Clausius    on the   Nature of  the  Motion
seeds,   which consist chiefly of legumine and soluble albumen,
contain for the same quantity of phosphoric acid one and a half
to twice as much nitrogen as the seeds of cereals, which consist
principally of gluten.
     9. The relation of phosphoric acid to nitrogen is modified
when one of these albuminous substances is replaced by another
in seeds of the same kind and variety, as has been shown by
Millon.
     10. The ash of most kinds of corn contains large quantities
of magnesia, which is partially present as ammonio-phosphate of
magnesia.       And hence the proportion of nitrogen in a seed does
not exactly give the quantity of albumen.
        XI.  On the Nature      of the Motion which      we  call Heat.
                             By R. Clausius*.
 1.   T3EFORE writing my             first memoir on heat, which was
      -L* published in 1850,         and in which heat is assumed to be
a motion,    I  had already formed for myself a distinct conception
of the nature of this motion, and had even employed the same
in several investigations and calculations.             In my former me
moirs I intentionally avoided mentioning this conception, because
I   wished to separate the conclusions which are deducible from
certain general principles from those which presuppose a parti
cular kind of motion, and because           I  hoped to be able at some
future time to devote a separate memoir to my notion of this
motion and to the special conclusions which flow therefrom.
The execution of this project, however, has been retarded longer
than I at first expected, inasmuch as the difficulties of the sub
ject, as well as other occupations, have hitherto prevented me
from giving to its development that degree of completeness which
I   deemed necessary for publication.
     A memoir has lately been published by Kronig, under the
title Grundziige einer Theorie der Gase^, in which                I have re
cognized    some     of  my   own    views.     Seeing   that   Kronig has
arrived at these views just as independently as I have, and has
published them before me, all claim to priority on my part is of
course out of the question ; nevertheless, the subject having once
been mooted in this memoir,             I feel myself induced to publish
those parts of my own views which            I have not yet found in it.
For the present, I shall confine myself to a brief indication of a
    * From Poggendorff's Annalen, vol. c.
    t This was first printed separately by A. W. Hayn in Berlin, and after
wards appeared in Poggendorff's     Annalen, vol. xcix. p. 315.

                                 which we call Heat.                            109
     few principal points, and reserve a more complete analysis for
     another time*.
          2. Kronig assumes that the molecules of gas do not oscillate
     about definite positions of equilibrium, but that they move with
     constant velocity in right lines until they strike against other
     molecules, or against some surface which is to them impermeable.
    A. share this view completely, and         I  also believe that the expan-
  v sive force of the gas arises from this motion.                   On the other
                I
     hand, am of opinion that this is not the only motion^presenT.
          In the TTrst placed the hypothesis of a rotatory as well as a
     progressive motion of the molecules at once suggests itself; for
      at every impact of two bodies, unless the same happens to be
      central and rectilineal, a rotatory as well as a translatory motion
      ensues.
 ¦jfc-    I  am also of opinion that vibrations take place within the
      several masses in a state of progressive motion.            Such vibrations
      are conceivable in several ways.         Even if we limit ourselves to
      the consideration of the atomic masses solely, and regard these
      as absolutely rigid, it is still possible that a molecule, which con
       sists of several atoms, may not also constitute an absolutely rigid
      mass, but that within it the several atoms are to a certain extent
      moveable, and thus capable of oscillating with respect to each
      other.
          I  may also remark, that by thus ascribing a movement to the
//¦    atomic masses themselves, we do not exclude the hypothesis that
       each atomic mass may be provided with a quantity of finer mat
       ter, which, without separating from the atom, may still be move
       able in its vicinity.
          By means of a mathematical investigation given at the end of
       the present memoir, it may be proved that the vis viva of the
       translatory motion alone is too small to represent the whole heat
       present in the gas ; so that without entering into the probability
       of the same, we are thus compelled to assume one or more mo
       tions of another kind.       According to this calculation, the excess
       of the whole vis viva over that of the translatory motion alone is
 /particularly important in gases of a complicated chemical consti
       tution, in which each molecule consists of a great number of atoms.
          *  I must not omit to mention here, that some time ago Mr. William
       Siemens of London, when on a visit in Berlin, informed me that Joule
       had also expressed similar ideas in the Memoirs of the Literary and Philo
       sophical Society of Manchester.    My views being consequently no longer
       completely new, this was an additional reason why      I should hasten their
       publication less than I otherwise probably should have done.       Hitherto I
       have not been able to procure the memoir of Joule in question, and there
       fore I  am ignorant how far he has pursued the subject, and whether his
       views coincide with mine in all points.   It is to be regretted that Joule did
       not publish his memoir in a more widely circulated periodical.
                                                                                      -

 110           Prof. Clausius   on the   Nature of   the   Motion
       3. In one and the same gas the translatory motion of the
   whole molecules will always have a constant relation to the
   several motions which, in addition to the above, the constituents
   of the molecules likewise possess. For brevity           I will call the
   latter the motions of the constituents.
       Conceive a number of molecules whose constituents are in
   active motion, but which have no translatory motion.            It is evi-
. dent the latter will commence as soon as two molecules in con
   tact strike against each other in consequence of the motion of
   their constituents.    The translatory motion thus originated will
   of course occasion a corresponding loss of vis viva in the motion
   of the constituents.    On the other hand, if the constituents of a
   number of molecules in a state of translatory motion were mo
   tionless, they could not long remain so, in consequence of the
   collisions between the molecules themselves, and between them
   and fixed sides or walls.     It is only when all possible motions
   have reached a certain relation towards one another, which rela
   tion will depend upon the constitution of the molecules, that
   they will cease mutually to increase or diminish each other.
      When two molecules whose constituents are in motion come
   into collision they will not rebound, like two elastic balls, accord
   ing to the ordinary laws of elasticity ; for their velocities and direc
   tions after collision will depend, not only upon the motion which
   the whole molecules had before impact, but also upon the motion
  of those constituents which are nearest each other at the moment
   of collision. After the equalization of the several motions, how
  ever, when the translatory motion        is, on the whole, neither in
  creased nor diminished by the motions of the constituents, we
  may, in our investigation of the total action of         agreat number
  of molecules, neglect the irregularities occurring at the several
  collisions, and assume that, in reference to the translatory mo
  tion, the molecules follow the common laws of elasticity.
      4. The explanation of the expansive force of gases and its
  dependence upon volume and temperature, as given              by Kronig,
  suffers no essential modification through the introduction of
  other motions.      The pressure of the gas against       a fixed surface
is    caused by  the molecules in great number continually striking
  against and rebounding from the same.           The force which must
  thence arise      in the first place,
                  is,                    by equal velocity of motion in
 versely proportional to the volume of the given quantity of gas          ;
 and secondly,      byequal volume proportional to the vis viva of the
 translatory motion the other motions do not here immediately
                         :
 come into consideration.
      On the other hand, from Gay-Lussac's law we know that,
 under constant volume, the pressure of          a perfect gas increases
 in the same ratio as the temperature calculated from —273° C,

                            which we call Heat.                               Ill
which we call the absolute temperature.                 Hence, according to
the above, it follows that the absolute temperature is propor
tional to the vis viva of the translatory motion of the molecules.
But as, according to a former remark, the several motions in
one and the same gas bear a constant relation to each other, it is
evident that the vis viva of the translatory motion forms an ali
quot part of the total vis viva, so that the absolute temperature
is also proportional to the whole vis viva in the gas.
     These considerations, together with others connected there
with to be given hereafter, induced me, in my memoir " On the
Moving Force of Heat," to express the opinion that the specific
heat of gases was constant; which opinion was in opposition to
the experiments then known*.                  The quantity of heat which
must" be imparted to a gas, under constant volume, in order to
raise its temperature is to be considered as the increase of the
vis viva in the gas, inasmuch as in this case no work is done
whereby heat could be consumed.                The specific heat under con
stant volume, therefore, is in a perfect gas the magnitude which
 Rankine calls the true specific heat.           Now the assertion that the
true specific heat of a gas is constant, is simply equivalent to the
 assertion that the total vis viva in the gas has a constant ratio to
 the vis viva   of the translatory motion which serves us as a mea
 sure of the temperature. With respect to the specific heat under
 constant pressure,     I  have proved in the memoir before cited, and
 by means of a hypothesis proceeding from the same considera
 tions, that it differs only by a constant magnitude from the true
 specific heat.
     5. The foregoing is true for permanent gases only, and even
 for these only approximatively.            In general, the small deviations
 which present themselves can be easily accounted for.
     In order that Mariotte's and Gay-Lussac's laws, as well as
 others in connexion with the same, may be strictly fulfilled, the
 gas must satisfy the following conditions with respect to its mo
 lecular condition : —
     (1) The space actually filled by the molecules of the gas must
 be infinitesimal in comparison to the whole space occupied by
 the gas itself.
     (2) The duration of an impact, that is to say, the time required
 to produce the actually occurring change in the motion of a mo
 lecule when it strikes another molecule or a fixed surface, must
 be infinitesimal in comparison to the interval of time between
 two successive collisions.
     (3) The influence of the molecular forces must be infinitesimal.
 Two conditions are herein involved.                In the first place, it is
 requisite that the      force  with   which    all  the molecules at their
   *                                                                      1, 102,

   112          Prof. Clausius   on the Nature of   the  Motion
   mean distances attract each other, vanish when compared with
   the expansive force due to the motion.        But the molecules are
   not always at their mean distances asunder ; on the contrary,
   during their motion a molecule is often brought into close proxi
   mity to another, or to a fixed surface consisting of active mole
   cules, and in such moments the molecular forces will of course
   commence their activity.      The second condition requires, there
  fore, that those parts of the path described by a molecule under
  the influence of the molecular forces, when the latter are capable
  of altering appreciably the direction or velocity of the molecule's
  motion, should vanish when compared with those parts of its
  path with respect to which the influence of these forces may be
  regarded as zero.
      If these conditions are not fulfilled, deviations in several ways
  from the simple laws of gases necessarily arise ; and these devia
  tions become more important the less the molecular condition of
  the gas fulfils the conditions in question.
      On becoming acquainted with the celebrated investigations of
  Regnault on the deviations of gases from Mariotte's and Gay-
  Lussac's laws,    I  attempted, by means of the principles above
 intimated, to deduce some conclusions with respect to the mole
 cular condition of several gases from the nature of the deviations
 which Regnault detected in the same. A description of this
 method, however, would be too prolix ; and even the results, in
 consequence of the many difficulties encountered in actual calcu
 lation, are too uncertain to merit being here adduced.
      Whenever, therefore, in the sequel a gas is spoken of, we shall,
 as before, conceive it to be one which perfectly fulfils the above
 conditions, and which Regnault calls an ideal gas, inasmuch as
 all known gases present but an approximation to this condition.
      6. After these considerations on the gaseous condition, the
 question at once arises in what manner the solid and liquid con
 ditions differ from the gaseous.       Although a definition of these
 states of aggregation, in order to be satisfactory in all its details,
 would require a more complete knowledge than we at present
 possess of the condition of the individual molecules, yet it ap
pears to me that several fundamental          distinctions may be ad
vanced with tolerable probability.
     A motion of the molecules takes place in all three states of
aggregation.
     In the solid state, the motion is such that the molecules move
about certain positions of equilibrium without ever forsaking the
same, unless acted upon by foreign forces.              In solid bodies,
therefore, the motion may be characterized as a vibrating one,
which may, however, be of a very complicated kind.            In the first
place,   the  constituents  of a  molecule  may  vibrate  among    them

                           which we call Heat.                      113
selves ;  and secondly, the molecule may vibrate as a whole :
again, the latter vibrations may consist in oscillations to and fro
of the centre 6f gravity, as well as in rotatory oscillations around
this centre of gravity. In cases where external forces act on the
body, as in concussions, the molecules may also be permanently
displaced.
   In the liquid state the molecules have no longer any definite
position of equilibrium.       They can turn completely around their
centres of gravity ; and the latter, too, may be moved completely
out of its place.     The separating action of the motion is not,
however, sufficiently strong, in comparison to the mutual attrac
tion between the molecules, to be able to separate the latter en
tirely. Although a molecule no longer adheres to definite neigh
bouring molecules, still it does not spontaneously forsake the
latter, but only under the united actions of forces proceeding
from other molecules, with respect to which it then occupies the
same position as it formerly did with respect to its neighbouring
molecules.     In liquids, therefore, an oscillatory, a rotatory, and
a translatory motion of the molecules takes place, but in such a
manner that these molecules are not thereby separated from each
other, but, even in the absence of external forces, remain within
a certain volume.
    Lastly, in the gaseous state the motion of the molecules entirely
transports them beyond the spheres of their mutual attraction,
causing them to recede in right lines according to the ordinary
laws' of motion.      If two such molecules come into collision du
ring their motion, they will in general fly asunder again with
the same vehemence with which they moved towards each other ;
and this will the more readily occur, since a molecule will be
attracted with much less force by another single molecule than
by all the molecules which in the liquid or solid state surround it.
    7. The phenomenon of evaporation appearing peculiarly in
teresting to me,    I  have attempted to account for the same in the
following manner.
   It has been stated above, that in liquids a molecule, during
its motion, either remains within the sphere of attraction of its
neighbouring molecules, or only leaves the same in order to take
up a corresponding position with respect to other neighbouring
molecules.     This applies only to the mean value of the motions,
however; and as the latter are quite irregular, we must assume
that the velocities of the several molecules deviate within wide
limits on both sides of this mean value.
   Taking next the surface of a liquid into consideration,    I assume
that, amongst the varied motions to and fro, it happens that
under the influence of a favourable cooperation of the transla
tory, oscillatory, and rotatory motions, a molecule separates itself

114          Prof. Clausius  on the Nature of   the  Motion
with such violence from its neighbouring molecules that it has
already receded from the sphere of their action before losing all
its velocity under the influence of their attracting forces, and
thus that it continues its flight into the space above the liquid.
    Conceive this space to be enclosed, and at the commencement
empty ; it will gradually become more and more filled with these
expelled molecules, which will now deport themselves in the space
exactly as a gas, and consequently in their motion strike against
the enclosing surfaces.     The liquid itself, however, will form one
 of these surfaces ; and when a molecule strikes against the same,
it will not in general be driven back, but rather retained, and, as
it were, absorbed in consequence of the renewed attraction of the
other molecules into whose vicinity it has been driven.        A state
 of equilibrium will ensue when the number of molecules in the
 superincumbent     space is such, that on the average as many
molecules strike against, and are retained by the surface of the
liquid in a given time, as there are molecules expelled from it in
the same time.      The resulting state of equilibrium, therefore, is
not a state of rest or a cessation of evaporation, but a state in
which evaporation and condensation continually take place and
 compensate each other in consequence of their equal intensity.
    The density of the vapour necessary for this compensation,
 depends upon the number of molecules expelled from the surface
of the liquid in the unit of time ; and this number is again evi
dently dependent upon the activity of the motion within the
liquid, that is to say, upon its temperature.       I have not yet suc
ceeded in deducing from these considerations the law according to
 which the pressure of vapour must increase with the temperature.
    The preceding remarks on the deportment of the surface of
 the liquid towards the superincumbent vapour, apply in a similar
 manner to the other surfaces which enclose the space filled with
 vapour.    The vapour is in the first place condensed on these
 surfaces, and the liquid thus produced then suffers evaporation,
so that here also a state must be attained in which condensation
and evaporation become equal.        The requisite quantity of con
densed vapour on these surfaces depends upon the density of the
vapour in the enclosed space, upon the temperature of the vapour
and of the enclosing surfaces, and upon the force with which the
molecules of vapour are attracted towards these surfaces.            In
this respect a maximum will occur when the enclosing surfaces
are completely moistened with the condensed liquid; and as
soon as this takes place, these surfaces deport themselves exactly
like a single surface of the same liquid.
    8. The reason why the presence of another gas above the liquid
cannot impede the evaporation of the same may now be immedi
ately explained.

                           which we call Heat.                  115
   The pressure of the gas on the liquid arises solely from the
fact, that here and there single molecules of gas strike against
the surface of the liquid.  In other respects, however, inasmuch
as the molecules of gas themselves actually fill but a very small
part of the superincumbent space, the latter must be considered
as empty, and as offering a free passage to the molecules of the
liquid.   In general these molecules will only come into collision
with those of the gas at comparatively great distances from the
surface, and the former will then deport themselves towards the
latter   as   would the molecules of any other admixed gas. We
must conclude, therefore, that the liquid also expels its molecules
into the space filled with gas ; and that in this case also the
quantity of vapour thus mixed with the gas continues to increase
until, on the whole, as many molecules of vapour strike against
and are absorbed by the surface of the liquid as the latter itself
expels ; and the number of molecules of vapour to the unit of
volume requisite hereto, is the same whether the space does or
does not contain additional molecules of gas.
    The pressure of the gas, however, exercises a different influ
ence on the interior of the liquid.    Here also, or at places where
the mass of liquid is bounded by a side of the vessel, it may
happen that the molecules separate from each other with such
force that for a moment the continuity of the mass is broken.
 The small vacuum thus produced, however, is surrounded on all
 sides by masses which do not admit of the passage of the moved
 molecules ; and hence this vacuum will only then become mag
 nified into a bubble of vapour, and be able to continue as such,
when the number of molecules expelled from its enclosing liquid
 walls is sufficient to produce an internal vapour-pressure capable
 of holding in equilibrium the pressure which acts externally and
 tends to compress the bubble again.      Hence the expansive force
 of the enclosed vapour must be greater, the greater the pressure
 to which the liquid is exposed, and thus is explained the relation
which exists between the pressure and the temperature of the
boiling-point.
   The relations will be more complicated when the gas above
the liquid is itself condensable, and forms a liquid which mixes
with the given one, for then of course the tendency of the two
kinds of matter to mix enters as a new force.        I shall not here
enter into these phenomena.
   As in liquids, so also in solids the possibility of an evaporation
may be comprehended ; nevertheless it does not follow from this
that, on the contrary, an evaporation must take place on the sur
face of all bodies.    It    in fact, readily conceivable that the
                            is,
mutual cohesion of the molecules of       abody may be so great,
that, so long as the temperature does not exceed certain limit,

 116           Prof. Clausius  on the Nature of  the Motion
 even the most      favourable combination of the several molecular
 motions is not able to overcome this cohesion.
     9. The explanation of the generation and consumption of heat
 accompanying changes of the state of aggregation and of the
 volume of a body, follows immediately, according to the above
 principles, from the consideration of the positive and negative
 work done by the active forces.
     In the first place, let us consider the interior work.
     When the molecules of a body change their relative positions,
 the change may be either in the same direction as that according
 to which the forces resident in the molecules tend to move the
 latter, or in a direction opposite to this.    In the first case, a cer
 tain velocity is imparted by the forces to the molecules during
 their passage from one position to the other, and the vis viva of
 this velocity is immediately transformed into heat ; in the second
 case, and disregarding for the present the action of extraordinary
 foreign forces, it is in virtue of heat that the molecules move in
 directions opposed to the interior forces, and the retardation which
 these molecules thereby suffer through the action of the opposing
 forces appears as a diminution of the motion of heat.
     In the passage from the solid to the liquid state the molecules
 do not, indeed, recede beyond the spheres of their mutual action ;
 but, according to the above hypothesis, they pass from a definite
 and, with respect to the molecular forces, suitable position, to
other irregular positions, in doing which the forces which tend to
retain the molecules in the former position have to be overcome.
    In evaporation, the complete separation which takes place
between the several molecules and the remaining mass evidently
 again necessitates the overcoming of opposing forces.
    With respect to gaseous bodies, it is evident from what has
been above remarked concerning the requisites of a perfect
gaseous state, that as soon as a gas has once attained this state,
molecular attractions have no longer to be overcome during its
further expansion, so that during the changes of volume of an
ideal gas no interior work has to be performed.
    10. Besides the interior, we have in the next place to consider
the exterior work, and the corresponding change in the quantity
of heat.
    In  the first place, with respect to the changes in the heat of a
permanent gas subjected to pressure or expanding by overcoming
a counter-pressure,     Kronig has already remarked at the conclu
sion of his memoir, that when one of the sides against which the
molecules of gas strike is itself in motion, these molecules will
not rebound with velocities equal to those they possessed when
moving towards the side.        If the side approaches the molecules,
the velocity of the molecules on leaving the same is in general

                           which we call Heat.                      117
greater than before, if it recedes less.      By means of special ma
thematical considerations, it may without difficulty be proved
that the increase or decrease of the vis viva thereby produced
must exactly correspond to the external work done by the expan
sive force of the gas ; nevertheless it is not even necessary to give
a special proof of this theorem, since the same is an immediate
consequence of the general law of equivalence between vis viva
and work.
    If the side moves so slowly that the pressure of the gas against
the moving side is just as great as against a stationary one, then,
in determining the work, the velocity of the side no longer enters
into consideration, but merely the whole path described by the
same.      On the contrary, if the velocity of the side is so great
that in the vicinity of the same a sensible compression or rare
faction of the gas thereby ensues, then the pressure actually ex
ercised by the gas during the motion must always be brought
into calculation.
    When an overflow takes place between two vessels filled with
gases of different densities, or between a full and an empty ves
 sel, on the whole no work will be performed, and therefore no
change in the total quantity of heat can occur.          It is not here
asserted that no change in the quantity of heat takes place in
either of the two vessels considered separately, for a mass of gas
whose molecules move principally in a definite direction deports
itself towards adjoining gaseous masses in the same manner as a
moved side ; and when the moved gaseous mass strikes against
 stationary walls, just as much motion of heat makes its appear
 ance as vis viva is lost by the common translatory motion of the
whole mass.
    Just as in the changes of volume of gaseous bodies, so also in
 other cases the external work must be taken into consideration ;
 as, for instance, the work which during the evaporation is em
 ployed to overcome external resistance, and thus to make room for
 the vapour as it is generated.       In solid and liquid bodies which
 only   suffer small  changes  of volume,  the external work is also for
 the most part only small ; nevertheless here also cases occur in
 which its influence becomes considerable.
     11. Lastly, I must mention a phsenomenon the explanation
 of which appears to me to be of great importance, viz. when two
gases combine with each other, or when a gas combines with another
 body, and the combination is also gaseous, the volume of the com
pound gas      bears a simple ratio to the volumes of the single consti
 tuents, at least when the latter are gaseous.
     Kronig has already proved that the pressure exerted by a gas
 on the unit of its enclosing surface must be proportional to the
 number of molecules contained in the unit of volume, and to the

118            Prof. Clausius  on the Nature of the Motion
vis viva of the several molecules arising from their translatory
motion, the only one which Kronig considers.
    If  we apply this to simple gases, and assume that, when pres
sure and temperature are the same, equal volumes contain the
same number of atoms — a hypothesis which for other reasons is
very probable, — it follows that, in reference to their translatory
motion, the atoms of different gases must have the same vis viva.
    We will next examine in what manner this theorem remains
true when applied to the molecules of compound gases.
    12. In the first place, let us compare compound gases amongst
themselves, e. g. two gases to form which the constituents have
combined in ratios of volume respectively equal to 1 : 1 and 1 : 2.
Nitric acid and nitrous acid may serve as examples.
    With respect to these two gases, we know that quantities con
taining the same amount of oxygen occupy the same volume.
 Hence here, too, equal volumes contain the same number of mo
lecules, although in the one gas each molecule consists of two,
 and in the other of three atoms ; and we must further conclude,
that even these differently constituted molecules have the same
 vis viva with respect to their translatory motion.
     In most other compound gases we are led to the same conclu
 sion ; and in cases which do not submit themselves to this rule,
 it does not appear to me impossible that the discrepancy may be
 accounted for in one or both of two ways : either the gas was not
 sufficiently removed from its points of condensation when its vo
 lume was determined, or the chemical formula hitherto employed
 does not properly represent the manner in which the atoms are
 combined to form molecules.
     On comparing compound and simple gases, however, an un-
 mistakeable      deviation from the foregoing rule shows itself,
 inasmuch as the space corresponding to an atom of the simple
 gas does not correspond to a molecule of the compound one.
 When two simple gases combine in equal volumes, it is well
 known that no change of volume takes place, whilst according
 to the above rule the volume ought to be diminished in the ratio
 of 2 : 1 . Again, when a volume of one gas combines with two or
 three volumes of another, the combination is found to occupy
 two volumes, whereas according to rule it ought only to occupy
 one volume, and so on.
     13. On seeking to explain these curious anomalies, and espe
  cially to find a common law governing the relations of volume
 in gases,   I  was led to adopt the following view as being most
 plausible.     I  beg to offer the same to the scientific public as a
 hypothesis which is at least worthy of further examination.
     I  assume that the force which determines chemical combi
 nation, and which probably consists in a kind of polarity of the

                          which we call Heat.                        119
 atoms, is already active in simple substances, and that in these
likewise two or more atoms are combined to form one molecule.
    For instance, let equal volumes of oxygen and nitrogen be
given.     A mixture of these gases contains a- certain number of
molecules, which consist either of two atoms of oxygen or of two
atoms of nitrogen.      Conceive the mixture to pass into a chemical
compound, and the latter then contains just as many molecules,
which are merely constituted in a different manner, inasmuch as
each consists of an atom of oxygen and an atom of nitrogen.
Hence there is no reason why a change of volume should take
place.    If, on the other hand, one volume of oxygen and two of
nitrogen are given, then in the mixture each molecule consists
of two, and in the compound of three atoms.              The chemical
combination, therefore, has caused the number of molecules to
diminish in the ratio of 3 : 2, and consequently the volume ought
to diminish in the same ratio.
   It is well known that some simple substances do not, in the
gaseous form, occupy the volume which their atomic weights
and the volumes of their combinations would lead us to antici
pate, but another, and in most cases a smaller volume, which
bears to the former a simple ratio.       A special investigation of
these substances would here be out of place, more especially as
two of them, sulphur and phosphorus, deport themselves in other-
respects in so remarkable a manner, in consequence of the variety
of conditions they are capable of assuming, that we may reason
ably expect further discoveries from chemistry with respect to
these bodies; and then, perhaps, besides other irregularities,
those of the volumes of their vapours will be explained.         Never
theless  I  may here recall one circumstance which in some cases
may possibly facilitate this explanation.      I refer to the fact, that
the above hypothesis, according to which the molecules of simple
substances each consist of two atoms, may not be the only pos
sible one.
   On comparing with each other all cases of simple and com
pound gases, we must not expect to find immediately a perfect
agreement throughout.       I am of opinion, however, that, under
the present uncertainty with respect to the inner constitution of
several bodies, and particularly of those which possess a compli
cated chemical composition,     too great weight ought not to be
laid upon individual anomalies; and       I  deem it probable, that,
by means of the above hypothesis respecting the molecules of
simple substances, all relations of volume in gases may be referred
back to the theorem, that the several molecules of all gases possess
equal vis viva in reference to their translatory motion.
   14. Proceeding to treat the subject       mathematically,    we  will

 120          Prof. Clausius  on the Nature of  the Motion
first deduce the expression which shows in what manner the
pressure of the gas on the sides of the vessel depends upon the
 motion of its molecules.
    As the shape of the vessel is indifferent, we will select that
 which is most convenient for our purpose.       We will assume the
 vessel to be very flat, and that two of its sides consist of parallel
 planes so close to one another that their distance asunder is infi
 nitesimal when compared with the other dimensions of the ves
 sel.   Hence we need not consider the cases where the molecules
 strike against one of the narrow strips of sides, and we may
 assume that each moves in a right line until it either strikes
 against another molecule or against one of the large parallel sides.
 In fact, to take the small sides into consideration would change
 nothing in the final result, and would only make the develop
ment more prolix.
    Let us consider one only of the two large sides ; during the
 unit of time it is struck a certain number of times by molecules
 moving in all possible directions compatible with an approach
 towards the surface.    We must first determine the number of
 such shocks, and how many correspond        on the average to each
 direction.
    15. Hereafter we shall always assume the gas to be an ideal
 one ; in other words, we shall disregard the irregularities pro
ceeding from an imperfect gaseous state, so that in determining
the pressure we may, with Kronig, introduce certain simplifica
tions in place of considering the motion exactly as it takes place.
    The whole number of shocks received by the side remains un
changed when we assume that the molecules do not disturb each
other in their motion, but that each pursues its rectilineal path
until it arrives at the side.
    Further, although it is not actually necessary that a molecule
should obey the ordinary laws of elasticity with respect to elastic
spheres and a perfectly plane side, in other words, that when
striking the side, the angle and velocity of incidence should equal
those of reflexion, yet, according to the laws of probability, we
may assume that there are as many molecules whose angles of
reflexion fall within a certain interval, e.g. between 60° and 61°,
as there are molecules whose angles of incidence have the same
limits, and that, on the whole, the velocities of the molecules are
not changed by the side.      No difference will be produced in the
final result, therefore,  if we  assume that for each molecule the
angle and velocity of reflexion are equal to those of incidence.
According to this, each molecule would move to and fro between
the large parallel sides, in the same directions as those chosen
by a ray of light between two plane mirrors, until at length it
would come in contact with one of the small sides ; from this

                            which we call Heat.                              121
it would be reflected, and then commence         a similar series of
journeys   to and  fro, and so forth.
    Lastly, there is no doubt that actually the greatest possible
variety exists amongst the velocities of the several molecules.   In
 our considerations, however, we may ascribe a certain mean velo
 city to all molecules.   It will be evident from the following for
 mula?, that, in order to maintain an equal pressure, this mean
 velocity must be so chosen that with it the total vis viva of all
 the molecules may be the same as that corresponding to their
actual velocities.
   16. According to these assumptions, it is evident, that, during
the unit of time, each molecule will strike the side under consi
deration just as often as during that time it can, by following its
peculiar direction, travel from the side in question to the other
and back again.     Let h be the distance between the large parallel
sides, and S the acute angle between the normal and the direc
tion of motion   :   then              is the length of the path
                                                            r    from one

                                           w

the number of impulses given to the side, u being the velocity of
the molecule.
   With respect to the directions of the several molecules, we
must assume that on the average each direction is equally repre
sented.    From this it follows, that the number of molecules
moving in directions which form with the normal angles included
between 3 and S + dS, has to the whole number of molecules the
same ratio that the surface of the spherical zone, whose limiting
circles correspond to the angles 3 and dS, has to the surface of
the hemisphere, that     the ratio
                            is,

consideration in determining its intensity; the second, however,
whose magnitude is represented by u cos 3, will be changed by
the shock into an equal velocity in the opposite direction.     The
action of the side upon    the molecule, therefore, consists in  de
priving it in one direction of the velocity wcosd, calculated
according to the normal, and of imparting to it an equal velocity
in an opposite direction; in other words, of imparting to it a
velocity of 2m . cos 3 in the latter direction. Hence the quantity
of motion imparted to the molecule will be

   Let us now conceive the side Jo be capable of moving freely ;
then in order that it may not recede before the shocks of the
molecules, it must be acted upon on the other side by a counter
force, which latter may in fact be regarded as continuous, in con
sequence of the great number of shocks and the feebleness of
each.    The intensity of this force must be such as to enable                          it,

    As particular cases, we obtain the following numbers corre
sponding to the temperature of melting ice : —

    These numbers are the mean velocities which, for the totality
of molecules, give the same vis viva            as would their actual velo
cities.    At the same time, however, it is possible that the actual
velocities of the several molecules differ materially from their
mean value.
    19. By means of the equations above established, we will
lastly examine what relation exists between the vis viva of the
 translator]/ motion and the whole vis viva, or heat, in the gas.
    In doing so we will conceive the quantity of heat to be mea
 sured, not by the ordinary unit of heat, but by the mechanical
unit of vis viva, or what is equivalent, by the unit of work. To
this end we have only to divide the quantity of heat measured
in the ordinary manner by the thermal equivalent of the unit of

                          which we call Heat.                    125
 work, which as before    I will denote by A. Let H be the quan
 tity of heat thus determined.
     Further, let c be the specific heat of the gas under constant
 volume, in other words, the true specific heat ; then the increase
 of the quantity of heat in the quantity q of gas corresponding
 to an elevation of temperature dT is
                              dR=^dT.A
 Integrating this equation, we have
                              H=
                                   f   T                          (9)
 No constant need be added, since,      as before remarked, the heat
 in the gas is proportional to the vis viva of the translatory mo
 tion, and hence also to the absolute temperature.
    The expression on the right of this equation may be replaced
 by another which is very convenient for our present investigation.
    The quantity of heat which must be imparted to the quantity
 of gas q in order to elevate its temperature by dT and its volume
 by do is expressed thus,
                             ^dT+pdv,
wherein the first term represents the increase of the heat con
tained in the gas, and the second the quantity of heat consumed
by work. If we assume the gas to be heated under constant
pressure, the relation between dT and dv is thereby defined. For
we have generally
                           pv=T . const.;
and differentiating, under the supposition that p is constant, we
obtain
                           pdv=dT    . const. ;
whence the undetermined constant may be eliminated by means
of the foregoing equation, and we have
                            dv=^dT.
Let us substitute this value of dv in the above equation, and at
the   same time note that, d being the specific heat under constant
pressure, the whole quantity of heat imparted to the gas in the
                                                     QC
case under consideration    may be represented by =-;-  dT.  In this
manner we arrive at the equation

   20. Let us now return to the equation (6a) before established,
and for brevity let us denote the vis viva of the translatory mo
tion by K, then
                                                   K=\pv.
By combining this with the foregoing equation we obtain

    Thus is corroborated what was before stated, that the vis viva
of the translatory motion does not alone represent the whole
 quantity of heat in the gas, and that the difference is greater
the greater the number of atoms of which the several molecules
of the combination consist. We must conclude, therefore, that
besides the translatory motion of the molecules as such, the
constituents of these molecules perform other motions, whose vis
 viva also forms a part of the contained quantity of heat.

          XII. On the Formation of Sulphide of Aluminium. .
    By Charles W. Vincent, Assist. Lib. Royal Institution*.
            sulphide of aluminium has hitherto been prepared by
 THEthe        action which its components exert on each other when
 brought     into   contact at a high temperature.        In the process
 described below, I have endeavoured to effect the same object by
 the deoxidation of sesquioxide of alumina by the monosulphide
 of sodium.
    Monosulphide of sodiumf was gently heated in a porcelain
 crucible to the fusing-point (when it acquires a flesh-coloured
 hue), powdered alumina was then gradually added, the whole
 being constantly stirred until the mass began to acquire .a pasty
 consistence ; the crucible was then closed and the temperature
 gradually raised to a dull red heat, at which temperature it was
 kept for about half an hour. On allowing to cool and then
 extracting with water, a yellow solution was formed containing
 soda, and the excess of sulphide of sodium together with a small
 quantity of alumina. The greater part of the last, however,

remained in the form of a somewhat bulky black precipitate of
sulphide of aluminium at the bottom of the crucible.           This preci
pitate was washed by decantation until tolerably free from alkali,
the presence of a small quantity of which seemed to prevent its
decomposition by water.       In proportion, however, as the alkali is
removed, the addition of water causes an evolution of sulphur
etted hydrogen, a grayish-white precipitate of the hydrated ses-
 quioxide of alumina being formed.
    The original black precipitate, when exposed to the air on a
filter, is converted in a very short time almost entirely into the
oxide of aluminium.        The sulphide, when heated in the air,
 ignites, sometimes burning quietly, at others giving off bright
 scintillations much resembling those of the metal, in both cases
 sulphurous acid being formed.
    The alumina used in the above experiments was prepared by
igniting alum, previously deprived of its water of crystallization ;
but alumina in almost every state appears to be attacked by the
sulphide of sodium, even emery-powder and pipe-clay being, the
first wholly, the second partially deoxidized by it.

    Liquidity of Lavas. By G. Poulett Scrope, Esq., M.P.,
     F.R.S., F.G.S.*
                             Introduction.
                                              I published two works f
  IT upon the Phsenomena
        is now some    thirty years   since
                                of Volcanoes, Active and Extinct.         I
 described in them, as accurately as      I could, by pen and pencil,
 what   I had observed during a residence of some duration among
 the volcanic districts of France and Italy ; and explained, in
 considerable detail, the laws which, from those observations,            I
 believed to regulate the remarkable developments of subter
 ranean energies usually called volcanic, which have played so
 important a part in the construction of the superficial crust of
  our planet.
     The general principle on which     I  proceeded in the theoretical
 portion   of these  works  was the  same   which had been previously
 employed by Hutton and Playfair, and was subsequently adopted,
 with signal success, by Sir Charles Lyell, —namely, to refer, so
 far as is possible, appearances the origin of which has not been
 witnessed, to such causes as are seen or known to produce ana
 logous appearances in the present day, — instead of resorting for
 the purpose to imaginary hypotheses.

    la  the earlier volume of the two (the ' Considerations on Vol
canoes'), however,     I certainly overstepped thiswholesome rule, by
entering towards the conclusion of the work upon some rather
crude speculations on a general theory of the globe ; and this,
together with defects of style and arrangement, and likewise of
illustration, of which      I became sensible only when it was too
late to amend them, sufficiently accounts for the different re
ception these two works met with from geologists at the time.
Neither, however,      I  presume to hope, were wholly without some
beneficial result.     At the period of their publication, the Wer-
nerian theory of the precipitation from some aqueous menstruum,
not merely of granite, and what were then called the primitive
formations, but even of all the trap-rocks, still prevailed, and
had the support of a large school of geologists in this country.
I  venture to think that the facts reported in my two volumes
(especially those represented to the eye in the atlas illustrative
of the volcanic remains of Central France) had some share in
the final extinction of that German romance, — which some geo
logists as old as myself may remember to have been regarded
almost in the light of a gospel-truth, and defended with all the
acrimony of polemical controversy.
    Some of the opinions, however, expressed in these works with
respect to the laws that govern volcanic action, were severely
criticised at the time.       Others have been since opposed by rival
theories.      And, as these disputed questions have an important
bearing on some of the most interesting problems of geology,
I  trust it may not be unprofitable to call attention to the more
prominent among them.
    I  will advert on this occasion to two subjects especially, viz.
    I.  The origin, or mode of formation, of volcanic       cones and
           craters.
  II.   The nature of the liquidity of lava at the time of its pro
          trusion from a volcanic aperture.
    I. Formation of      Cones and Craters. — In both of the works
to which I have alluded,       I referred the formation of those re
markable      circular  hollows, usually called craters, which are of
such frequent occurrence in volcanic districts, to explosive aeri
form eruptions, breaking their way through the superficial rocks ;
and that of the external more or less conical hill or mountain
which generally, but not always, environs a crater, — and which,
indeed, often occurs without a crater, but always characterized
by the qua-qua-versal dip of its constituent beds of lava and
conglomerates, — to the accumulation, round and above an erup
tive vent, of its fragmentary ejections and the lava-streams
poured out from it.

130        Mr. G. P. Scrope   on the  Formation of Craters,
   I  considered this law to be without exception; attributing
the differences in figure and structure apparent among volcanic
cones to the greater or less number and violence of the erup
tions to which they were owing, — some being the product of a
single eruption, others of a vast number, often repeated through
a series of ages, — to differences in the position of the orifices of
discharge, whether from the summit of the cone, or its base, or
any intermediate points, — and whether from under water, or in
the air, — to the varying mineral character of the products, —
and to the influences of subsequent degradation.
   At the same time       I remarked that the earthquakes which
always   more    or less accompany    volcanic eruptions render pro
bable a certain amount of elevation in mass of the pre-existing
superficial rocks ; and moreover that the rents they cause in the
solid substance of the cone of a volcano in repeated eruption,
into many of which rents liquid lava will be injected from the
column rising in the central chimney, and cool down afterwards
into more or less vertical dykes of solid rock, must have added
considerably to the bulk and elevation of such a mountain, by a
sort of inward distension.
   This was no closet-theory, — because, as respects the cone and
crater of Vesuvius at least, I had the advantage, in the years
1818, 1819, and 1820, of watching with my own eyes the out
ward growth of that cone, through a series of almost continual
eruptions of    a comparatively   tranquil character, which during
those years added considerably to its height and bulk by ex
ternal accretions of ejected scoria and lava-currents.          These
last, the lava-streams, issued from small cones and craters formed
upon the solid platform which then composed the summit of the
 great cone, and dribbled slowly down its slopes, consolidating so
rapidly there as in few instances to reach the base of the Cone
at all ; although night after night they were to be seen flowing
from the summit in streams of considerable breadth and bulk,
and glowing with a bright light on its steep sides.
    Afterwards, in the latter part of the year 1822,      I had seen
the upper portion of this solid cone blown into the air (by which
it lost a full third of its height), and a crater of vast dimensions
drilled through its axis by continuous eruptive explosions of
twenty days' duration.
    I had previously made a close examination of the cones and
craters of Etna, the Phlegraean Fields, the Lipari Isles, Central
France, and the Rhine district ; and their appearances accorded
so completely with the supposition of an analogous mode of
formation in their instances, that, upon the principle of ex
plaining the unknown by the known, it seemed impossible, or
at least unnecessary, to imagine any other origin for them.

                  — It was, therefore, with no small           surprise that
I  have since found this simple and natural mode of production

    Sir Charles Lyell, M. Constant Prevost, and others, have
amply refuted this unphilosophical theory; which, however,
still appears to hold its ground to some extent on the Continent,
through the prestige of the great names attached to it. It may,
therefore, not be wholly useless to adduce some additional proofs
of its unwarrantable character.       But must first be permitted
                                               I
to remark, that even Sir Charles Lyell, while supporting the
view indicated above, of the generally eruptive origin of volcanic
 cones, has had recourse, in the case of some craters, to another
agency, the influence of which         am induced to think he over
                                       I

         I
 he calls " craters of denudation."

                  a

                             is
 "Principles,"    and    imagine, therefore, that he

 desirous of maintaining its propriety.
    I   byno means doubt, that in the case of craters formed be
 neath the sea, or in such close vicinity to     as to allow its waves
                                                     it
 and currents to enter and sweep round their interiors, these
 circumstances must have considerably modified the result.           In
 the former case, that of subaqueous eruption, the resistance of
 theVater above the vent would probably tend to throw off the
 ejected materials over     wider area. And thus, perhaps, we may
                             a
 account for the vast horizontal dimensions of the great crateri-
 form basins of Italy, — Bolsena, Bracciano, Albano, and others,
 evidently of submarine origin.       In the latter case, that of sub-
 aerial craters to which the sea has had access through some
 lateral opening, no doubt great degradation of their internal
 slopes and cliffs, as well as of the outside, will have often taken
 place.    Many, indeed, will have had their enclosure reduced to
a   mere skeleton, like Santorini.     Some, like Graham's Isle, have
 been entirely swept away.       But the question being as to the
 origin of these crateriform hollows, not as to the cause of any
 subsequent alteration of figure, this,        believe, may in every
                                                 I
 instance, without exception, be most reasonably referred to vol
 canic explosive eruptions.     Arid, therefore, the employment of
 such   aphrase as
                     " craters of denudation," in contradistinction

132         Mr. G. P. Scrope    on the   Formation of Craters,
to  "  craters of eruption/' can only lead to a wrong conception
of the originating forces.
    Where, indeed, is to be found a crater, the formation of which
cannot be accounted for (making allowance for the subsequent
modifications already referred to) by eruptive phsenomena of the
same character as those which have before the eyes of trustworthy
observers repeatedly drilled enormous craters through the axis
of the cone of Vesuvius I
    Is it the vast size of some craters which should render such
an origin incredible in their instances ?         For example, — of the
Val di Bue on the flank of Etna, the Caldera of Teneriffe, that
of Palma, Santorini, or the external crater of Barren Island ;
which measure some three, five, or even six miles in diameter ?
But the crater of Vesuvius, formed in 1822, before my eyes, by
explosions lasting twenty days, measured a mile in diameter, and
 was more than a thousand feet deep.          The old crater of Somma,
which half encircles the cone of Vesuvius, is about three times
 as wide as the crater of 1822.         Are we, then, on that account
 alone, to believe that it could not have been produced by an
 eruption of proportionately greater violence, — when, too, such
 an eruption is known to have occurred about the time this crater
must have been formed, namely, in the year 79, and to have
 overwhelmed three cities at the base of the mountain beneath
 its enormous fragmentary ejections ? Is it not, on the contrary,
 much more in accordance with sound philosophy to ascribe the
excavation of the old concentric crater of Somma to the same
cause which but the other day was seen to excavate the new
crater of Vesuvius, through the heart of the same mountain,
than to invent for the former a different and fanciful process ?
But if Somma be admitted, notwithstanding its extent, to be a
 true crater of eruption, the same origin cannot be denied to that
of Palma, Santorini, or others, on the ground of their size, which
 scarcely, if at all, exceeds that of Somma.
     Sir Charles Lyell seems to doubt the Val di Bue* being a true
 crater of eruption upon two grounds.          First, because the beds
composing      the  surrounding    cliffs  do not  show the usual qua-
qua-versal dip,    but  generally slope   towards  the sea.  This, how
ever, is merely the result of the eruption having broken out on
one side of the central axis of the mountain, — a circumstance of
frequent occurrence ; and naturally so, because the old central
vent is apt to be sealed up by the consolidated products of former
eruptions, and the point of least resistance to the subterranean
eruptive force will often, therefore, be a little on one side, —
probably on a fresh point of a fissure broken through the flank
of the mountain.
    In fact, there must be a contest between the resisting powers of

             and the Nature      of the Liquidity of Lavas.            133
the sides of the mountain and of its upper part ; and the weakest
part, whichever it         is,
                          will give way, and be blown up.
    Sir Charles's second reason            is,
                                          that      sufficient amount of
                                                     a
conglomerates    is not   to be  seen  on the  mountain      slopes around
the Val di Bue, to account for the vacuity.             But, besides that
he himself speaks of " enormous masses of scoria on the flanks
of Etna,"  it  should be remembered that the aeriform explosions,
when long continued, triturate the ejected matters, owing to
their repeated fall into and rejection from the crater, to such            a
degree as to reduce the greater part at length to an impalpable
powder, which    is  carried     bythe winds to      distance, sometimes
                                                     a
of hundreds of miles, and spread in thin layer over an enor
                                                 a
mous area of sea or land.       And, moreover, the larger the dimen
sions of any crater, the more powerful and enduring will have
been, in all probability, the explosions, and the more thoroughly
triturated, during the process of its gradual enlargement, would
be the fragments thrown up            by
                                      them.
 I    remember being exceedingly surprised, after the termination
of the Vesuvian eruption of 1822, forming              continual fountain
                                                         a
of stones and ashes some miles in height, lasting through
 twenty days, and in the end completely gutting the mountain,
 to find that the prodigious amount of fragmentary matter
 thrown out from the crater had coated the outer slopes of the
 mountain only to an average thickness of foot or two at most.
                                                         a
 But then the ashes which day by day were reduced to              a   finer
 and at length to an impalpable powder, so fine as to penetrate
 the closest rooms in the houses of Naples, were borne to vast
 distances  by  the winds.     Much, too, was carried down into the
 plain, or the sea below the mountain, by the torrents of rain
 (producing lave di fango, or mud-lavas), such as overwhelmed
 Herculaneum, and which accompanied, as usual, the paroxysmal
 eruption of 1822.
    Indeed, if   we consider the statements adduced on good
 authority, of the prodigious distances to which ashes, and even
 large fragments of lapillo and of pumice, have been occasionally
 borne away from some of the volcanoes of South America and
the Pacific (as, for example, in the eruption of Coseguina in
 1835, and of Galongoon in 1822), — distances of more than                 a
 thousand miles        large segment of the circumference of the
                      (a
 globe), the whole of which intermediate space must have been
 strewn with them (and, in the first of these instances,              it   is
 said, to the'depth of ten feet at the distance of twenty-four miles
from the volcano), we may well conceive that eruptions productive
of such an enormous amount of ejected matters may (nay, must)
have blown into the air entire mountains of             magnitude far ex

sition, without attempting to dispute its possibility,         I    must say
that am not aware of any such process having been ever wit
      I
nessed    by any credible observer so placed as to be able to distin
guish between engulfment and ejection             ; and consequently that
it  were well to be cautious in admitting the occurrence of such
a  phenomenon,      if  the ordinary mode of action be sufficient to
 explain the   facts  really observed.       We possess reports,     it   true,
                                                                          is
of eruptions and earthquakes in Java, Sumatra, the Andes, and
elsewhere, having caused the disappearance of the entire summit
of   a  mountain, leaving vast cavity in its place.

precisely the    result   that    was   observable after the eruption of
Vesuvius in 1822.         And in that instance we know there was no
 subsidence.     The leading example usually adduced of such im
 mense (supposed) engulfments          is  the truncation of the lofty cone
 of Papandayang,       in   Java,     by an eruption in the year 1.772.
                                                                T'
 There,   it   always said,
               is               a  great area of the volcano       fell in and
 disappeared," swallowed up in the bowels of the earth, together
with forty villages and their inhabitants.         '
                                                      Such are the phrases
 usually made use of         on  these occasions, and very naturally so,
 by   alarmed and unscientific observers.           But recent explorers,
 especially Professor Junghuhn, have stated that these towns and
 villages of Papandayang were not swallowed up at all, but buried,
 like Pompeii, under the ejectamenta of the volcano; and Dr.
 Junghuhn, therefore, very properly refers the truncation of the
 mountain to eruptive explosions, rather than to subsidence.
     It is, no doubt, quite conceivable, that within              a  volcanic
 mountain some internal reservoir, or subterranean lake of liquified
 lava, coated over     by   a coat of hardened rock or the accumula
 tion of fragmentary matter, may be tapped, as               it  were,       anby
 earthquake,    and   empty    itself  out  of an  aperture  in  the   side  of
 the mountain      at a   low    level, leaving    acavity, which     another
 earthquake, or the explosion of vapour and gases accumulated
 within   itand increasing in temperature, may cause to burst like
a   vast bubble, — the overlying crust of rocks falling inwards.
But such supposition
               a                is,in the present state of our knowledge,
 purely conjectural, and unwarranted,            if,
                                                   as  I have endeavoured
 to show, the ordinary phenomena of eruption suffice to account
 for the formation of the largest known craters.               If it   is to be
 resorted to in any case,       it would be perhaps in that of the very

             and the Nature  of the Liquidity of Lavas.            135
small pit-craters occasionally met with in volcanic districts, such
as the Gour de Tazana, and the lakes Pavin, Du Bouchet, and
Servieres in Central France.        But even these show marks of
explosive eruption in the scoriae sprinkled around their banks.
And the occurrence of even a single bed of scoria is certain proof
of some explosions having taken place from a body of liquid lava
beneath ; though, as      I have said, this may have been accom
panied or followed by engulfment.         Perhaps the singular cha
racter of the crater of Kilauea, in Owyhee, may be thought to
claim for it an origin in subsidence rather than eruption.        It is
described as a vast sudden depression in what would otherwise
be almost a level plain, on the side of the gently sloping vol
canic mountain of Mauna Loa.          It has an irregularly oval form,
from three to five miles in diameter, and is usually encircled by
vertical cliffs some hundred feet high.      Its bottom consists of a
lake of lava, on some points (which occasionally change their
situation) in continual ebullition, and at a white heat; but
coated over for the most part by an indurated crust upon which
it is often possible to walk.     Sometimes, however, the incrusted
portion is in the centre of the lake, forming a rough platform,
surrounded by a circle of incandescent and seemingly fused lava,
— sometimes the outer circle forms a solid shelf, within which
an inner basin of lava boils at a greater or less depth below its
edge.     It is evident, from the account of this crater given by
Professor Dana, in the American Journal of Science, as gathered
from the relations of various observers during nearly a century
past, that the surface of a vast boiling lake of subterranean lava
existing here, rises and sinks at irregular intervals of several
years in duration ; sometimes filling the entire cavity, and even
pouring over its outer margin sheets of a very liquid lava, —
sometimes sinking to a depth of a thousand feet or more, —
especially when some outburst from a lower vent, or chain of
vents, has tapped the internal reservoir.      But, however interest
ing the characteristic features of this crater, both from the faci
lities it affords for observation, and the great scale on which they
are developed, they do not seem to me to prove the origin of the
cavity other than that of ordinary craters.        The phenomena of
Kilauea are not so exceptional as at first view might be sup
posed. Visitors who looked down into the great Vesuvian crater
for a few years after its formation in 1822, saw pools of liquid
and incandescent lava at its bottom, and small cones of scoria
thrown up by an almost constant ebullition.          The difference in
the violence of the explosions, and in the amount of ejected
scoria, arises, no doubt, as Professor Dana very justly observes,
from the difference in the relative liquidity of the lavas, — those
of Kilauea being very liquid, those of Vesuvius much more viscid

136            Mr. G. P. Scrope        on the   Formation of Craters,
and unyielding*.         So also during the Vesuvian eruption of
1753, persons who ventured to the summit of the cone observed
jets of liquid lava thrown up from the surface of a mass which
occupied the bottom of the crater, and conducted itself exactly
 in the manner of a liquid in ebullition.       Spallanzani remarked
 a similar appearance within the great crater of Etna in 1788.

     Circular form of Craters. — A consideration which has not,
 perhaps, been sufficiently adverted to by geologists speculating
 on the origin of volcanic craters, is the cause of their invariably
 circular or nearly circular figure.            If I
                                             am right in attributing
 their formation exclusively to aeriform explosions, it follows that
 each    is,
           in fact, simply the external orifice of more or less cy
                                                             a
 lindrical bore drilled through the pre-existent rocks               by
                                                               repeated
  discharges of highly expansive aeriform fluids (probably for the
 most part steam) forcing their way upwards at some weak point                     ;
 and that      it to the equal pressure in all directions of the ex
                    is
 panding fluid that the circular form of the section of this orifice
is   due, — the same cause, in fact, which gives        spherical form

                                                                              is
 peculiarity, that the lavas have not in modern times,' at least, overflowed
 the pit and moreover the country around, neither in its height or slopes
         ;
 or scoria bears evidence of long-continued overflows.          There is  no cone
 about the crater.     Itis
                         a     pit, which certainly overflowed at first, but for   a
 long period has discharged itself by lateral fissures.         There are several
 other large pit-craters in the vicinity of Kilauea which are without any
 cones or slopes around them, being literally pits; they once contained
 boiling lavas to their top like the small active pools in the bottom of Kilauea,
 but a subterranean opening discharged them, and left        a  deep pit with ver
 tical walls like Kilauea. The sides of the walls in such case are as clear
                                                                 a

                    a

the origin of the Val di Bue (Bove) of Etna to the same cause that has pro
duced Kilauea, and       Istill believe the view right.    There is, in     certain
             " engulfment

such a bubble from the surface of the liquid mass of lava in the
vent.     In moderately tranquil eruptions these succeed each other
at considerable intervals.                                 I
                                In the case of Stromboli, noted that
about five minutes usually occurred between every two explo
sions. When the eruption assumes a violent character, as in
the Vesuvian one of 1822, the eructations, for such they are,
succeed each other so rapidly as to produce an almost continuous
roar, like the blowing-off of a thousand steam-boilers.       And each
explosion gives     birth to one  of those  great globular   volumes  of
white vapour, which, rolling over and over each other as they
rise in the air in a vast column, occasion one of the most remark
able and magnificent appearances of a paroxysmal volcanic erup
tion. In the midst of these clouds of snowy vapour, a black
column of stones, scoria, and ashes may be seen to shoot up to
a vast height, generally attended with copious discharges of elec
tricity generated by the friction of the ejected fragments, and
forming a singular contrast to the jet of aeriform matters.
     In some rare cases it is possible to witness the actual rise and
bursting of these great bubbles of vapour.         Spallanzani on his
 visit to Stromboli in 1780 saw the liquid surface of lava at a
 white heat within the orifice of the volcano surge alternately
 upwards, and after bursting like a great bubble, fall back again
 out of sight.               I
                   In 1819 was myself able to witness the same
 interesting phaenomenon probably from the same position, a high
 point of the external crater-rim which overlooks the vent.          At
 each belch, a shower of tattered fragments of lava, torn from the
 surface of the bubble as it broke, rose into the air with a cloud
 of vapour and a fierce roar, while steam seemed to be at inter
 vals blowing off from another neighbouring vent.              Hoffman,
 who visited the same volcano a few years later, describes in
 minute detail precisely the same phenomena.
     The vast size of some craters, already noticed, may afford a
 notion of the enormous volumes of gaseiform matter that must
 have been discharged through them at the time of their forma
  tion by continuous explosions lasting for weeks and even months ;
  since each individual bubble of vapour must have been of a
  magnitude to fill the entire horizontal section of the crater ; and
 even for some time to aid in enlarging the area of this aperture
 by violent pressure against its rocky sides.         The prodigious
 force with which they ascend, and therefore the great depth at
  which they are generated, may be judged from the vast vertical
 height, measured in miles, to which they have been seen to
  shoot up a continuous columnar fountain of ejections, consisting
  not merely of scoria and ashes, but often of rocky fragments of
 great size.
      These, by their mutual friction, as they alternately fall back

138        Mr. G. P. Scrope      on the   Formation of Craters,
and are thrown up again, become, as has already been said,
greatly comminuted ; and the source of the explosive vapours
having sooner or later exhausted its energies, the accumulation
of these ashes in the vent at length appears to stifle their further
development, and quiescence for a time ensues.               [I am speak
ing here, of course, of the case of such a paroxysmal eruption as
I  had the advantage of witnessing in 1822.]
    I have said that every crater is more or less circular in figure ;
but, since the orifice of discharge will almost necessarily be
opened on the least resisting point of some fissure broken through
the solid pre-existing rocks, we might expect its section to be
often lengthened in the direction of this fissure, and consequently
to be rather oval than strictly circular.        And this expectation is
justified by observation.          Sometimes two orifices have been
opened upon the same fissure so near together that their craters
or cones intersect each other.       In the range of Puys of Auvergne
and the Velay such examples are frequent.           And in the eruption
of 1850 of Vesuvius two craters were formed on the summit of
the cone divided only by a narrow ridge; their common hori
zontal axis coinciding with the line of the great fissure, which
in the preceding year had been visibly broken through the side
of the cone towards the north-east.          Sometimes aeriform explo
sions take place from openings upon lateral fissures, and produce
those minor, or (as they are often called) parasitic cones, of
which several examples occur on the flanks both of Vesuvius and
Etna.     At other times the explosions are confined to the central
vent of the volcano, the lava alone welling out, perhaps, at some
lateral orifice.    This, indeed, is the normal character of these
phenomena.        And   it is this habitual predilection (as it may be
called) of volcanic eruptions for the same identical vent, that
occasions in so many instances the heaping-up of some vast moun
tain mass above and around       it,  subject to the occasional blowing-
up  of  the central portion,   to be re-formed   again and again  by  sub
sequent eruptions.        The result of the irregular alternation of
these paroxysmal explosions and subsequent gradual expulsions
of new matter    is  the appearance, so common in volcanic moun
tains, ofa   minor and central cone with its crater, rising within
the circumference of some larger crater of earlier date, or in its
immediate vicinity.       The walls of the latter crater are of course
often broken down on one or more sides (generally on the line
of the original fissure) — perhaps reduced to
                         ;                          a   mere segment of
its original circuit, by the combined operation of volcanic con
vulsions and aqueous erosions.           Whoever will take the trouble
to examine carefully an accurate map, on           a    sufficiently large
scale, of almost any volcanic district (such, for example, as Vesu
vius and the Phlegrsean Fields, Etna and the Lipari Isles, the

mitted to illustrate this law by the trite, but instructive, example
of Vesuvius, — which only comes so often before us because from
its proximity to Naples it has been open to more constant and
accurate observations than any other known volcanic mountain.
What, in brief, is the history of this volcano during the last cen
tury? Precisely one hundred years ago, in the year 1756,
Vesuvius possessed no less than three cones and craters, one
within the other, like a nest of boxes, besides the great encir
 cling crater and cone of Somma (fig. 1).                   Sir W. Hamilton
 gives  us  a  drawing of its appearance in this state.
           Fig.  1. — Outline-sketch  of Vesuvius as it existed in 1756.
                             (After Sir W. Hamilton.)
     By the beginning of the year 1767, the continuance of mode
 rate eruptions had obliterated the inmost cone and increased the
 intermediate one, until it very nearly filled the principal crater
 (fig. 2, a, b).     An eruption in October of that year, 1767, com
 pleted   the   process, and re-formed the single cone into one con
 tinuous slope all round from the apex downwards (fig. 2, c).
 The dotted lines in fig. 2 (after Hamilton) represent the shape
 of the outer and inner cones before this eruption, and the space
 between them and the firm outline represents the amount by
 which the cone was in the intervening ten years augmented in
 bulk and height by the ejectamenta of that eruption. An in
 terval of comparative tranquillity followed, until, in 1794, the
 paroxysmal eruption occurred, described by Breislak, which com
 pletely gutted this cone, then solid, lowered its height, and left

140        Mr. G. P. Scrope        on the Formation    of Craters,
a crater  of great size bored through its axis. Later eruptions,
especially that of 1813, not merely filled up this vast cavity with
their products, but once more raised the height of the cone by

      dotted outlines   of its form in July and in May of the same year.
some hundred feet.     When         I
                                 first saw it in 1819 the top formed
a rudely convex platform, rising towards the south, where was
its highest point. Several small cones and craters of eruption
were in quiet activity upon this plain, and streams of lava trickled
from them down the outer slopes of the cone. So things went
on until October 1822, when the entire heart of the cone was
again thrown out by the formidable explosions               I
                                                        have so often
referred to, and a vast crater was opened through it ; while the
cone itself was found to have lost several hundred feet from its
top.    In fact nothing but an outer shell of it was left (fig. 3).
Eruptions, however, soon recommenced.            In 1826-7 a small
cone was formed at the bottom of the crater, and, continuing in
activity, had reached a height which rendered it visible from
 Naples in 1829, when of course it must have nearly filled up the
crater.    In 1830 it was 200 feet higher than the crater's rim ;
and in 1831 this cavity was completely filled, and the lava-
streams began to flow over it down the outer cone.            In the
winter of that year a violent eruption once more emptied the
bowels of the mountain, and left a new crater, which soon began
to fill again from ejections upon its floor ; and by the month of
August 1834 this crater had been in its turn obliterated, and
lava overflowed its edge towards Ottaiano.         In 1 839 the cone
was again cleared out, and a new crater appeared in the shape of
a vast funnel, accessible to its bottom, which for a few years then
remained in a tranquil state.      In 1841, however, a small cone
began to form within         it,
                           and increased so rapidly, that in 1845
it was visible from Naples above the brim of the crater, which

soon after was completely filled. And the cone from that time
went on increasing in bulk and height from the effect of minor
eruptions, until in 1850 one of a violently explosive character
    Fig. 3. — Crater of Vesuvius after    the   Eruption of October 1822.
opened the two deep craters on its summit, of which          have     I
already spoken.    The more recent eruption of May last, being
confined chiefly to a prodigious efHux of lava from the outer side
of the cone, unaccompanied by any extraordinary explosive bursts
from the summit, has not altered materially the form impressed
upon it in 1850.
    It is thus seen that within the last 100 years the cone of
Vesuvius has been five several times gutted by explosive eruptions
of a paroxysmal character, viz. in 1794, 1822, 1831, 1839, and
1850; and its central craters formed in this manner as often
gradually refilled with matter, to be again in due time blown
into the air. Meanwhile the old external crater of Somma is itself
becoming choked up by the accumulation of all the lava-streams
and fragmentary matter that are expelled towards the northern
and outer side of the cone.     It would be, therefore, in exact ac
cordance with the habit of this volcano (as of volcanic mountains
in general),  if,after some further period either of quiescence or
of moderate activity, the entire cone of Vesuvius should be blown
up  by   amore than ordinarily violent paroxysm, and the crater
of Somma itself reformed.
    With this well-authenticated history of the mountain within

                          it
 (except upon such grounds of impossibility as have never been
 adduced) that the larger containing crater in the case of Vesuvius
 (and the argument applies to other similar volcanic mountains)
 had the same origin as the smaller contained ones      and that the

to believe the former to be of eruptive origin must be prepared
to extend their incredulity to the latter.      Indeed the elevation-
crater theorists usually do not shrink from this consequence.
With them the cone of Vesuvius, and that of Monte Nuovo itself,
were not the products of eruption, but of elevatory expansion by
a single shock.      Obviously, it ought to follow, that no volcanic
mountain was ever in eruption at all, that the whole is an ocular
illusion ; at least, that the lava- streams we see pouring for weeks
and months from the summit of a cone and hardening there, and
the enormous showers of fragmentary matter which, during
equally long periods, we see thrown up from the crater and fall
ing on the surface of the cone, do not, even in the lapse of ages,
add to its bulk, or tend by their frequent repetition to compose
the substance of a volcanic mountain, but by some unaccountable
process disappear without leaving a trace behind.         I  own that,
to my mind, such an hypothesis is wholly unintelligible.          I see
in the ordinary phenomena of a volcanic mountain, such as I
have described them in the brief record of the principal erup
tions of Vesuvius during the last century, a simple and natural
process by which such a mountain is gradually built up ; and
having observed this mode of formation going on in some in
stances before my eyes, I think it reasonable to apply it to
explain the mode of formation of other mountains of the same
class with their cones and craters, old and new, central and lateral,
or parasitic ; and making allowance, as I said at first, for a cer
tain amount of internal accretion and elevation, by means of in
trusive dykes and earthquake shocks, I know nothing in the
appearance, figure, or structure of any volcanic mountain yet
discovered, which such an ordinary and observed mode of forma
tion will not account for.

general manner, and without entering into any analytical detail,
the general form of the curve corresponding to different values
of the quantity C.
     It is proper to remark, that the curve is not altered by
changing the signs of each or any of quantities m, m', C (in fact,
analytically the distances r, r1 are essentially ambiguous in sign),
so that we may without loss of generality consider m, ml, C as
all of them positive.            The different branches of the complete
analytical    or   geometrical curve have distinct mechanical signifi-
cancies ; thus r,       r1 being positive,      —

then since r, r1 cannot be both of them small in comparison of a

     The case m = mf is an exception, and must be considered sepa

perpendicular to the axis midway between the two centres M, M'.
The curve in the first instance, i. e. when k is greater than
( \/m+ <v/m)2=4w, consists of the two ovals B, A about M,
and the two ovals B', A' about M'.           As k decreases to 4m, the
two ovals A, A' gradually increase        in  magnitude, and at length
come together, as before, into a figure of eight, AA' ; and as k
continues to diminish, the figure of eight opens out into an hour
glass form AA', which continues increasing in magnitude, and
degenerating into the form of an oval.          The interior ovals B, B'
approach more and more nearly together, lengthen out in the
direction perpendicular to the axis, and present to each other a
more and more flattened portion.           The second value,

arises when k = 0 ; and there is not then any node, but the
curve degenerates in a similar manner to what happens for k=0
in the general case; viz. the oval A A' disappears at infinity,
while the ovals B, B' coalesce together (their outer parts disap
pearing at infinity) into a pair of lines coincident with the per
pendicular to the axis midway between the two centres.

 Gasometry, comprising the leading Physical and Chemical Properties
     of Gases. By Robert Bunsen, Professor of Chemistry in the
     University of Heidelberg.    Translated by Henry E. Roscoe, B.A.,
     Ph.D. With Sixty Illustrations.      London : Walton and Maberly.
"OOR many         years the reputation of Bunsen as a gas analyst has
 ¦*-
         been   so high, that working chemists generally have felt the
necessity for a complete collection of the processes, the methods of
manipulation, and the formulae employed by him in his highly im
portant and valuable researches.        It is for such persons that the
volume before us is intended.
     One of the reasons, perhaps, which makes the methods of Bunsen
more popular than those of Regnault and Reiset is, that they do not
require the operator to start with so expensive an apparatus. But
the method of Regnault, especially as regards the convenience of the
apparatus, has great advantages, the chief fault being that by its use
large variations in bulk are expressed by small numbers.      One of the
most successful of Bunsen's pupils* has so far combined the two me-

thods, that while he takes the beautiful apparatus of Regnault as his
model, he avoids his method of determining volumes by ascertaining
the pressure of a constant volume.
   The operations of gaseous analysis, more perhaps than any of the
numerous brandies of chemical research, involve the necessity for
skill and tact in the construction and management of delicate appa
ratus.    For some years past we have been accustomed, in perusing
the researches of the more distinguished of his pupils, to notice how
greatly the production of those researches was facilitated by the use
of appliances having a character peculiar to the contrivances of
Bunsen.     They possess a neatness, a perfect adaptation to the pur
pose in view, which renders it as easy to distinguish the style of
Bunsen in his apparatus, as of some artists in their pictures. The
same remark applies with equal, if not greater force, to instruments
owing their origin to Regnault.
   We find in the work before us a complete treatise, not merely on
the methods of examining and analysing gases, but on the construc
tion of all the apparatus described, and the manipulation necessary
therewith.
   The work commences with a description of the methods of col
lecting gases from geisers and springs, with certain parts of the ap
paratus for which we are familiar, modifications of them having been
used in some of the researches of Bunsen's pupils.   The same remark
applies to much of the apparatus used in the transference of gases,
we having already become acquainted with the peculiar glass gaso
meter (fig. 16), described in a paper of Dr. Maxwell Simpson's
 (worked out in Bunsen's laboratory) on some new methods of deter
mining nitrogen.
   The construction and graduation of eudiometers, according to the
author's own method, is very fully entered into ; and now that che
mists are pretty generally agreed on the superiority of his plan over
any other, will be found very useful.
   One great advantage of the work is, that none of the more minute
 details are omitted on the score of their being unimportant ; such,
for example, as the best and safest mode of cleaning eudiometers,
&c.     The book becomes, therefore, a truly practical guide for the
working chemist.
   Those who have been accustomed to eudiometrical analyses, have
all found how much time is often wasted owing to the electrical ap
paratus being more or less out of order, or the atmosphere of the
laboratory being so damp as to render it difficult at a short notice
to obtain a spark strong enough to fire the mixture.    This difficulty
is entirely avoided by the contrivance described in the book, which,
on account of its extreme usefulness, we transfer to our pages.
   " The firing of the gaseous mixture is always effected by the elec
tric spark. A small cylinder about 3 inches high and 1 broad serves
as a Leyden jar.    This cylinder is lined inside with tinfoil ; but in
order \o avoid amalgamation, the outer metallic coating consists of
platinum-foil.    Electrophori, or common electrical machines, are
very apt to become useless by remaining in the damp and cold

  rooms which are most suitable for gas laboratories.              The jar is
  therefore best charged by means of the simple and effectual arrange
  ment represented in fig. 32.
      "It consists merely of a large porcelain tube, which, when held
  before the iron wire of the cylinder and rubbed with silk and amal
  gam*, evolves so much electricity that the jar is charged in a few
  seconds."
      One great advantage of Bunsen's mode of treating the subjects is,
  that he illustrates by numerous examples, and enters fully into the
  best and shortest modes of calculating the results.
      A considerable portion of the volume is devoted to the description
  of the methods required to meet special cases of gaseous analysis, the
  whole being copiously illustrated by examples, and even the most
  minute precautions being detailed.
      Much new and interesting matter of the highest value is contained
  in the portion treating of the " manipulation in the absorption of
  gases;" and having described the order of the processes, the author
  proceeds to develope a general formula, enabling the operator to cal
  culate the relative volumes of the constituents of a mixture of known
  gases.
      The chapter   on the specific gravities of gases strongly shows the
  neatness   and ingenuity    of the author as an operator. This is well
  seen in his illustration of the determination of the density of gaseous
  bromide of methyle, made with a flask of only 44 cubic centimetres
  capacity.     Notwithstanding the small volume, the experiment gave
  3-253, theory requiring 3"224.
    . In addition to methods involving      the necessity for weighings, he
  uses effusion as a mode of determining the densities of gases where
  only small quantities are at the operator's disposal. The gas effuses
  through a minute aperture in a thin platinum plate attached to an
  apparatus resembling an inverted Mohr's burette with a glass stop
  cock. The observations of time are made with a pendulum vibrating
  half- seconds.    The contrivance by means of which the times of effu
  sion of the gases are determined, and warning is given of the ap
 proach of the termination of the experiment, is both simple and in
 genious.      In fact, when we couple the simplicity of the mode of
 operating with the fact that an experiment can be made on so small
 a quantity of gas as two cubic inches, it is scarcely too much to say
 that in many researches it will entirely do away with the necessity
 of weighings.

the silk is so arranged that only half the surface in contact with the porce

and it preserves its activity often for months."

       A large portion of the work is devoted to the consideration of the
    laws of the absorption of gases in liquids, the methods of determining
    the coefficients of absorption, and numerous examples showing the
    coefficients of a considerable number of gases. A most valuable result
    of the perfection to which the determination of the coefficients of ab
    sorption can be carried, and one that cannot be too highly appreciated
    by chemists, is, that it enables us to ascertain whether a gas under
    examination is a mixture in atomic proportions or a truly chemical
    compound.     It is well known to all who have paid any attention to
   this branch of chemistry, that Frankland and Kolbe have proved that
   eudiometric analysis (as might be expected) was incapable of show
   ing the difference between two volumes of marsh-gas and equal
   volumes of hydrogen and methyle.       Any process capable of throwing
   light on questions so difficult of solution will doubtless be thankfully
   received by chemists.      In the work before us, Bunsen shows how
   perfectly the question may be solved by the method alluded to, even
   in cases like the present, where the greatest difficulty might have
   been anticipated, from the fact that the differences in the coefficients
   of absorption are very little. The result obtained by the absorptiome
   try method clearly indicates that marsh-gas, prepared by heating
   together the acetate with hydrate of potash, and purified by means
   of fuming sulphuric acid and potash, is not a mixture of methyle
   with hydrogen, nor an isomer of natural marsh-gas, but the same
   substance which is evolved by the mud volcanoes of Bulganak in the
   Crimea.
      The author has incorporated in his work the results of the re
  searches which he made some years ago (in conjunction with Prof.
  Stegmann) on the laws of the diffusion of gases.       As usual, the ap
  paratus employed and the manipulation generally are both novel and
  ingenious.
      He deduces several facts from his experiments ; among others,
  that the pores of the gypsum diaphragms do not act towards gases
  passing through them as a system of fine openings in thin plates,
  but as a system of capillary tubes.     He has also made elaborate ex
  periments to solve several other important questions, among which
•the following stands prominently forward: — "Do the volumes of
  two gases which have diffused into each other, stand to each other,
  as is universally admitted, inversely as the square roots of their den
  sities ?" To our surprise we find that a negative answer is returned
 to this question. We do not feel it necessary to enter into a detailed
 account of the author's experiments and deductions, as he admits
 this portion of the investigation to be still in an unfinished state.
     A very important portion of the volume, and one which will be
 read with interest by all who are engaged in eudiometry, is on the
 phenomena of the combustion of gases.          The author considers in
 this, the last portion of the work, — the heat of combustion — the tem
 perature of the combustion — the explosive force of gases — and the
temperature of ignition of gases.       Several other instructive and in
teresting properties of gases are studied incidentally, such as their
diathermanous properties, and the influence of diluents ; moreover,

    The volume concludes with copious and most valuable tables for
 the calculation of analyses.
    To the chemist who is engaged in investigations of this nature,
 such a volume as that before us is invaluable ; unhappily their
 number in this country is so limited, that we fear the work is likely
 to have a less-extended sale than it deserves.

THE" Experimental                 Researches    on the Strength      of Pillars of Cast
Iron." By Eaton Hodgkinson, Esq., F.R.S., Professor of the Mecha
nical Principles of Engineering, University College, London.
   In a previous paper on this subject (Philosophical Transactions,
 1840),    I had shown, — 1st, that a long circular pillar, with its
ends flat, was about three times as strong as a pillar of the same
length and diameter with its ends rounded in such a manner that the
pressure would pass through the axis, the ends being made to turn
easily, but not so small as to be crushed by the weight ; 2ndly, that
if a pillar of the same length and diameter as the preceding had one
end rounded and one flat, the strength would be twice as great as
that of one with both ends rounded ; 3rdly,                  if,
                                                         therefore, three pillars
be taken, differing only in the form of their ends, the first having
both ends rounded, the second one end rounded and one flat,
and the third both ends flat, the strength of these pillars will be as
 1—2— nearly.
           3
   The preceding properties having been arrived at experimentally,
are here attempted to be demonstrated, at least approximately.
   The pillars referred to in my former paper were cast from Low
Moor iron No.        3   they were very numerous, but usually much
                          ;
smaller   than  those used   in the present trials.         felt desirous too of
                                                               I
using   the   Low   Moor   iron   in  the  hollow   pillars employed on this
occasion, not on account of its superior strength, but its other good
qualities.    The pillars from this iron were cast 10 feet long, and
from 2\ to inches diameter, approaching in some degree, as to size,
               4
to the smaller ones used in practice.         The results from the breaking
weights   of these  were  moderately     consistent   with the formula? in the
former paper, with         slight
                              a     alteration   of  the constants, rendered
necessary by    the castings being     of    larger size, and therefore softer

    To obtain some idea of the relative strengths of pillars of different
British irons,    I  applied, at Mr. Stephenson's suggestion, to Messrs.
Easton and Amos, who procured for me twenty-two solid pillars, each
 10 feet long and 2\ inches diameter, cast out of eleven kinds of iron
(nine simple irons and two mixtures).              The pillars were all from the
same model, and were cast vertically in dry sand, and turned flat at
the ends, as the hollow ones had been ; two being cast from the same
kind of iron in each case. The simple unmixed irons tried were as
below, and all of No. 1 .

       Old Hill iron              Staffordshire                 20-05
    The   mean strength of the pillars from the irons above varies from
20-05    to 29-50 tons ; or as 2 to 3 nearly.
    The pillars formed of mixed irons were found to be weaker than
the three strongest of the unmixed series.
    From many experiments, it was shown that the weight which
would crush the pillars, if they were very short, would vary as 5 to 9
nearly.
    The pillars in general were broken of four different lengths, 10 feet,
 7 feet 6 inches, 6 feet 3 inches, and 5 feet, the ends of all being turned
flat, and perpendicular to the axis.            It was found that when the
length was the      same,  the  strength     varied   as the 3-5 power of the
diameter ; and when the diameter was the same and the length varied,
the strength was inversely as the 1-63 power of the length.                 Both
of these were   obtained   from  the  mean     results  of  many  experiments.
    The formula for the strength of a solid pillar would therefore be
where w is the breaking weight, d the diameter in inches, J the length
in feet, and m a weight which varied from 49-94 tons in the strongest
iron we tried, to 33-60 tons in the weakest.
    The ultimate decrement of length, in pillars of various lengths but
of the same diameter, varies inversely as the length nearly. Thus
the ultimate decrements of pillars 10 feet, 7 feet 6 inches, 6 feet

 152                                Royal   Society*.
3 inches, and 5 feet, vary as 2, 3,          3-^       and 4 nearly, according to the
experiments, from which it appeared                     that the mean decrement of
a 10-feet pillar was -176 inch.
                           Irregularity in Cast Iron.
     The   formulaearrived at in this paper'are on the supposition that
the iron of which the pillars are composed is uniform throughout the
 whole section in every part ; but this was not strictly the case in any
of the solid pillars experimented upon. They were always found to
be softer in the centre than in other parts.           To ascertain the
difference of strength in the sections of the pillars used, small cylin
ders   |inch in diameter and 1£ inch high, were cut from the centre, and
from the part between the centre and the circumference, and there
was always found to be a difference in the crushing strength of the
metal from the two parts, amounting perhaps to about one-sixth.
The thin rings of hollow cylinders resisted in a much higher degree
than the iron from solid cylinders.     As an example, the central part
of a solid cylinder of Low Moor iron No. 2, was crushed with 29*65
tons per square inch, and the part nearer to the circumference re
quired 34-59 tons per square inch ; cylinders out of a thin shell half
an inch thick, of the same iron, required 39-06 tons per square inch ;
and other cylinders from still thinner shells of the same metal, re
quired 50 tons per square inch, or upwards, to crush them.
    As these variations in cast iron have been little inquired into, ex
cept by myself, and have never, so far as I know, been subjected
to computation,       Ihave bestowed considerable trouble upon the
matter, in an experimental point of view, and endeavoured to intro
duce into the formula? previously given, changes which will in some
degree include the irregularities observed.

              " On      some Comparative Sections in the Oolite                           and Ironstone
Series of Yorkshire."                  By John Phillips, M.A., F.R.S., F.G.S.,
Reader in Geology in the University of Oxford.
   The author first called attention to the problem presented to geo
logists for solution, which      suggested by the extremely unlike
                                                is
mineral aspect, and only partial agreement in fossil contents, of the
two separated oolitic tracts of North Yorkshire and the south of
England.    He showed on what principles W. Smith proceeded in
 1817 and subsequent years to investigate the contemporaneous lines
in these two tracts, and explained his own researches in the same
direction in 1824 and following years.       Though in regard to the
main determinations arrived at and published by himself in 1829

  1 54                     Geological Society : —
  there is no material change, he thought   it desirable to  place on record
  some facts ascertained with precision,     which may help to fix our
  ideas of the affinity of certain calcareous beds in the Yorkshire series
  with some of the well-known members of the Oolite in the south of
  England; and at the same time give a basis for inquiry as to the
  geographical range of the ironstone, coal, and limestone of the di
  strict, and, by consequence, the physical conditions of the sea or estu
 ary in which, or on the shores of which, the mingled deposits of the
 north-eastern part of Yorkshire were deposited.
     For this purpose he presented, in the first place, the details of two
 great general sections, one on the actual sea-coast, the other on the
 old glacial sea-coast of the Hambleton Hills.
     By comparing these sections, and adding to them other lesser sec
 tions, he showed the existence of five special plant-producing bands
 of sandstones and shales (occasionally yielding coal in three zones),
 four calcareous bands, and several layers of ironstone, in the lower
 oolitic series ; and described in a general sense their geographical
 distribution, and the relation of certain lines of equal deposition
 (" isocthonal lines," as he terms them) to the general strikes and
 dips of the district.
     In passing from the sea-coast, near Scarborough, westward toward
 Thirsk, the uppermost of the four calcareous bands of the coast is
 obliterated ; the others undergo great modifications to the northward
 and westward.       The sandstones, shales, and coal, with ironstone,
 diminish in thickness from the northern parts of the coast, where
 they amount to 700 feet ; so that on proceeding southward a great
 part of this whole thickness is lost before reaching the Derwent.
 The inferior oolite is richly ferruginous north of a line passing from
 Thirsk to Robin Hood's Bay, having its maximum value in Rose-
 dale ; the ironstone-bands at the base of the upper lias are very pro
 ductive in the same district, and acquire their maximum of value in
 the district farthest to the north-west, namely about Eston Nab,
 Lofthouse, and Skinner's-grave.
     The discussion of the geographical range of organic remains and
physical conditions of the sea-bed was glanced at ; but the details
were reserved for a further communication.
    2.   " On  the Oolite  Rocks of Gloucestershire and North       Wilts."
By Prof. Buckman, F.G.S.
    The object of this communication       was to point out the general
characteristics of the different members of the Oolitic group of rocks
as they occur in the Cotteswold Hills and in the extension of the
higher beds of the series into North Wilts.         In illustration of this
subject the author supplied two carefully prepared sections, the result
of surveys made by the professors and students of the Royal Agri
cultural College of Cirencester.       One of the sections extends from
the Vale of Gloucester through the bold Cotteswold scarp at Birdlip
to the Chalk-hills in Wiltshire ; the other from Cirencester, through
the Vale of Moreton, to Shipston on Stour ; each following one of
the great Roman roads.
    After noticing the labours of previous workers in the Oolites of this
district, especially those of Mr. W.Smith, Mr. Lonsdale, SirR. Murchi

             Prof. Ansted     on the Geology    of Andalusia.          155
son, and Mr. E. Hull, Prof. Buckman commenced the description of
the different deposits from the basement- beds of the Inferior Oolite
to the Portland Oolite, inclusive.       In treating of the Inferior Oolite,
the author reviewed the opinions of Murchison, Strickland, and
Brodie on the relations of the members of this lowest part of the
series, and criticised the views lately brought forward by Dr. Wright
as to the association of the Inferior Oolite sands with the Lias, rather
than with the Oolite.        In this collocation Prof. Buckman does not
agree, believing     that, although some of the shells from the fossilife-
rous beds accompanying these sands are peculiar, and, especially as
regards a few of the Ammonites, are sometimes Liassic in their type,
yet by far the greater portion of the fauna, including the local and
non-migrating mollusca, is characteristically Oolitic ; and that the
two particularly Liassic Ammonites that have been brought forward
as evidences of the Liassic character of these sands were derived from
the true Lias, far below the sands in question.        After the considera
tion of these basement-beds          of the Inferior Oolite, the author
described in detail the geological characters of the several members
of the Oolite series, viz. 1. the Inferior Oolite; 2. the Fuller's
Earth; 3. the Great Oolite, with the Stonesfield Slate; 4. the
Bradford Clay; 5. the Forest- marble; 6. the Cornbrash; 7. the
Oxford Clay and Kelloway Rock ; 8. the Coral-rag; 9. the Kim-
meridge Clay ; and 10. the Portland Oolite and Purbeck beds at
Swindon.       The author differed in the details of this description from
previous    writers  in several respects ; and, in conclusion, expressed a
hope   to  be  enabled  to offer remarks on the physical conformation of
this Oolitic district, on the palaeontology of the strata, and the geo
logical changes thereby indicated, at some future period.
    3. "On     the Geology of the Southern part of Andalusia between
Gibraltar    and  Almeria." By Prof. D. T. Ansted, A.M., F.G.S.
    In this paper the author first described the mica-schists of the
 Sierra Nevada, in which, on the south-west, irregular deposits of
 highly argentiferous copper occur. On the north-west, crystalline
limestone, with galena, overlies the schists ; and thick beds of ter
tiary marls repose on the limestone. Superficial detritus is irregu
larly spread over all. Thick beds of shale with copper-ore are at
some places found between the old schists and the limestone ;
near Malaga they pass into a conglomerate and then into triassic and
Jurassic beds.      These shales and the schists are both traversed by
 serpentine- veins.     Not far east of Malaga the author observed a
black foetid magnesian limestone (distinct from the dolomites of the
 Sierra de Mijas adjacent), underlying shales and sandstones on which
 rests a grit containing remains of Calamites or Equisetites.          This
limestone corresponds in position with the conglomerates between
 the shales and sandstones near Malaga, which last extend along the
coast from some distance west of Malaga to the eastern side of the
 Sierra Nevada. They comprise white and red sandstones with marls,
and are occasionally gypsiferous and lignitiferous.           Near the top
of the series a white sandstone, used for building, has afforded the
 Equisetites above referred to.
    Next in order are the blue and black limestones of the Sierra

    de Gador on the north side of the Sierra Nevada, passing towards
   the west into the light- coloured limestones of Gibraltar.          These are
   probably of Jurassic age, are much altered, and traversed by fissures
   containing enormous deposits of galena. The red marble of San
   Anton, probably of cretaceous age, was next noticed. A peculiar cal
   careous breccia, reposing on the Jurassic and cretaceous rocks, near
   Malaga, is at the base of the tertiary series ; on it lies a hard lime
   stone of oolitic structure, with which is associated a compact rock
   of the nummulitic series, formed of Alveolina, Orbitoides, &c. The
   upper tertiary formation consists of the Tejares beds, — comprising,
   1st. (lowest) blue clay loaded with univalve and bivalve shells, and
   exceedingly rich in Foraminif era ; 2. Marly sands, with land, fresh
   water, and rolled fossils ; 3. Coarse gravel, with sands, abounding
   in Pectens, Oysters, and some other shells, and occurring in the
   Caleta river-bed. Of later age than the above, are the raised beaches
   along the coast-line between Malaga and Almeria.

             ON SOME SPECIAL         LAWS OF ELECTRICAL FORCE.
        To the  Editors of    the Philosophical  Magazine and Journal.
           Gentlemen,
        is not without regret that I am led to offer a few remarks
  IT on     the several notices of my papers on electricity by Professor
  Thomson and other writers, which have from time to time ap
  peared in the Philosophical Magazine.           In the first place, I observe
  (Phil. Mag.    vol.  viii. p. 42)  Mr.  Thomson    states, that Dr. Faraday
  and myself have undertaken researches with a view of invalida
  ting the theory of Coulomb, — certainly a gratuitous and unproved
  assumption to begin with.            Then the experimental result I ob
  tained, F«Q8, is represented as having been adduced by me in
 opposition to the theory ; and the Report made to the British Asso
 ciation in 1837, by the Rev. Dr. Whewell, is referred to in sup
 port of Mr. Thomson's views.            In this Report I am represented as
 having    been  surprised    at finding the force to be as the square of the
.quantity;    and   in  another    place, Hist, of Induct. Sciences, vol. iii.
 p. 28, new edition, it is said that I considered the result as
                                                                         " inex
 plicable."     Now if Mr. Thomson or the Rev. Dr. Whewell. for
 whom I must ever entertain the greatest regard and respect, will be
 so good as to point out where in any of my works even the shadow
 of all this is to be found, I should feel myself very greatly obliged.
 So far from having been surprised at the result, or considering it in
 explicable, I distinctly say in my paper in the Philosophical Transac
 tions for 1834, referred to by Mr. Thomson, p. 226, that " I do not
advert to these experiments as containing any unexpected results,
but rather in explanation of particular methods of research," &c. ;
and at page 236 I refer the law in question to electrical induction
upon the attracted disc, &c, being just what Mr. Thomson has been
so obliging as to repeat, virtually in as many words, and with a view
of exposing the delusion he assumes I labour under in regard to the

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous   Articles.           157
Coulombian theory.        In Mr. Thomson's paper, Phil. Mag. for 1854,
vol. vii. p. 193, I observe the following remark : — " The amount of
heat is proportional to the square of the quantity discharged, as was
first demonstrated by Joule, although it had been announced by Sir
Snow Harris, as an experimental result, to be simply proportional to
the quantity."      Riess, Joule, and Clausius appear to agree as to my
having made this announcement, and confidently allude to the inac
curacy and to the refutation of my deductions.      Now I do here most
emphatically and most positively deny, ever having stated anything of
the kind ; but since these gentlemen say I have done so, and pre
tend to have corrected my error, I call upon them as a point of
honour to say when I made such an announcement, or where in
any of my published works it is to be found.        The fact is, that so
far from having stated the law of electrical heat to be simply as the
quantity of electricity discharged, I was really the first to discover
with precision, and demonstrate with exactitude, the law in question ;
and that, too, long before Mr. Thomson and the other gentlemen
above mentioned were at all known in the world of science.        If Mr.
Thomson will turn to pages 67 and 68 of the Transactions of the
Plymouth Institution, published in 1830, and quoted in the Journal
 of the Royal Institution, 1830-31, p. 380*, he will find in the former
work a series of original experiments on the heating effects of the
electrical discharge, and at page 68 the following announcement :— ¦
 " It may be hence inferred that the effects of an electrical discharge
 on a metallic wire, all other things remaining the same, is directly
 as the square of the quantity."     See also Journal of Royal Institu
 tion, p. 381 (vi.).     Moreover the date of my paper is so far back
 as November 1825; and I may say in the words of Dr. Riess
                                               " an assertion of such a
 (Phil. Mag. 1854, vol. vii. p. 348), that
 general character as that ventured by Mr. Thomson ought to be the
 consequence of a careful examination," especially of what has been
 done at home.
    As this subject is of importance, I may further remark, that the
 experiments of Cuthbertson and others, referred to by Becquerel and
 quoted by Joule, Phil. Mag. October 1841, can scarcely be said to
 have established the law in question, or even its probability.    In the
 first place, they had no accurate measure of the quantity of electri
 city accumulated ; they were unaware that twice the quantity accu
 mulated on a given coated surface would counterpoise four times the
 weight, regulating Cuthbertson's own steel-yard electrometer, in
 which, a charge of 30 grains was taken as twice that of *15 grains.
 Their methods of research by the fusion of wires appears to have been
 anything but exact, and all sorts of tricks were played with the bat
                                                              '
 tery, as by breathing into the jars, &c. Cuthbertson says, Practical
 Electricity,' pp. 180 to 186,    "If 18 inches of wire be taken and a
 given charge just causes it to run into balls, much shorter lengths
 will still be only converted into balls ; if only 7 inches be taken,
 nothing but balls will appear ; the only difference will be that the
 balls will be smaller, and will be dispersed to a greater distance,

  Royal Society.                            ....

 158              Intelligence and Miscellaneous      Articles.
which may he easily overlooked."           Now what confidence can be
placed   in all this  as experimental  research  ? Van Marum found his
batteries produce a heating effect proportional to the coated surface.
Cuthbertson, by his most exceptionable method of breathing into his
jars when he wanted a greater effect, did, it is true, obtain a higher
ratio, yet no direct satisfactory comparison between the quantity
discharged and the heat produced was ever arrived at, and various
results ensued.       This we see admitted at page 182 of Mr. Cuth-
bertson's work, Exp. 149 ; here the law in question evidently failed :
at page 185 we observe that when the quantities of electricity were
said to be as 2 : 3, another result ensued; for experiments 150 and
151 show that the lengths of wire fused, instead of being as 4 : 9,
were as 2:6, that is, as 1:3.           It is quite impossible to repose
any   confidence   in  such  a state of  things.    Indeed, we have only
to examine Mr. Cuthbertson's experiments attentively as given in
his work, and in Nicholson's Journal, 4to, vol. ii. p. 218, to be
assured of the inexactitude of the experimental processes.          In the
latter we find the lengths of wire melted to he as the quantity of
electricity: see p. 218. However true, therefore, it may be that
Cuthbertson obtained results which led him to imagine that twice the
quantity of electricity would melt four times, the length of wire, he
cannot be said to have demonstrated and established that law ; and
I may therefore, without any philosophical injustice, claim to have
been the first to have clearly developed that law by exact electrical
measurements,      and by new methods of research, as my paper dated
 1825, and quoted in the Journal of the Royal Institution, 1830-31,
fully shows. There also will be found the hypothesis advanced by
Mr. Joule, that increased velocity is probably the source of the qua
druple heat. I endeavour to show that the heat is as the velocity with
which the unit of charge traverses the wire, that a double quantity
passes with a double velocity, and the effect is
                                                      " as the momentum,"
or quantity into velocity. I again therefore ask Mr. Thomson to state
when or where I ever announced "as an experimental result," that the
heating effect of an electrical discharge was
                                                  " simply proportional to
the quantity of electricity."      Mr. Joule, in referring to my paper in
                     '
the ' Transactions for 1 834, appears to have confounded this question
with that of the same quantity accumulated under different electro
meter intensities, a question discussed in my late differences with
Dr. Riess. What I said in my paper in the ' Philosophical Transac
tions,' and which I still insist on, was simply this : viz. that under
whatever ekctrometer intensity you accumulate a given quantity of
electricity, provided the battery surface be undivided, that quantity,
when discharged through a metal wire, will still excite in it the
same degree of heat.         Thus if a quantity of electricity = A, for
example, be collected on a Leyden jar, exposing 2-5 square feet of
coating, and then be collected on a jar exposing 5 square feet of
coating, I say, that notwithstanding the electrical intensity in these
two cases may be as 4 : 1 nearly, yet that the discharge of the
quantity A in each case will excite the same heat in a metallic
wire ; that is, if the same charging rod and circuit be employed.
And I ask the gentlemen to whom I have just alluded, to make that

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous           Articles.              159
experiment.      Until they do so, they have no          right to talk of
                                                                              " the
memoir in which Riess refuted my statement," &c. (Phil. Mag.
1854, vol. vii. p. 297).

ON THE COMPOSITION           OP BEUDANTITE.           BY M. RAMMELSBERG.
   The author obtained Beudantite from Cork from Dr. Krantz ; it
formed small, green octahedra, partially covered with a rust-coloured
coating, which, like those from Horrhausen, were seated upon a
brownish-black, racemose brown haematite, or rather iron-sinter.
   When heated in the air, Beudantite furnishes an acid liquid, but
nothing else of a volatile nature, and becomes red. It is infusible
before the blowpipe, but diffuses an odour of sulphurous acid, and
deposits a yellow coating on charcoal ; with fluxes it gives the reac
tion of iron and some copper ; when reduced with soda it furnishes
a black slag, a yellow coating, and granules of lead, together with
spangles of iron.
   If the powder be boiled with water, nothing is dissolved, and espe
cially no sulphuric acid is extracted.             Nitric acid behaves in the
same way.      Muriatic acid attacks the powder slowly when boiled ;
the reddish-yellow solution contains sulphuric acid and oxide of lead,
and deposits chloride of lead on cooling.
   Boiling solution of potash colours the powder brownish-red, but
dissolves no oxide of lead ; it dissolves phosphoric acid, however, as
is proved by its behaviour with silver salts, salts of magnesia, and
molybdate of ammonia.
   The specific gravity of the purest fragments was = 4*295. The
results of various experiments are, —

      Gentlemen,                                              July 4, 1857;
   Mr. Hearder, in his last letter to you,      has again asserted   that the
induction coil contrived by me is perfectly similar to the instrument
invented by himself.      This is the fourth time he has made this asser
tion ; and as it is always accompanied by his claim to priority, it
makes it appear that I had really copied his machine, or adopted his
ideas on the subject.
   As my coil has, for protection, been enclosed by a box which has
not been opened in Mr. Hearder's presence, he may not be aware of
the dissimilarity of our instruments.          First, Mr. Hearder uses a
gutta-percha bobbin for his secondary helix, and winds the wire to
be placed thereon until it is close to the cheeks of the bobbin.        This
method was adopted by me at first, but I found that the sparks passed
from the upper layer of wire to the lower one. To prevent this I
constructed my present coil without a bobbin, and wound my wire so
that each layer was shorter than the one beneath ; the intervals thus
left were filled by the gutta-percha tissue with which I insulated the
layers of wire.     The coil thus assumed the form of a cylinder having
rounded ends, and the space thus gained was sufficient to prevent
the discharge taking place between the inner and outer layers of
wire.    By adopting this arrangement, Mr. Ladd of Chancery Lane
has constructed an instrument which gives sparks 4£ inches long in
air of the natural pressure.
   My iron core also differs from Mr. Hearder's, and is formed of
very fine parallel wires, each wire being magnetically and electrically
insulated from the others. I formed it thus because such a mass
ckn be magnetized and demagnetized with greater celerity than any
other arrangement, and allows me to break contact with the battery
from 50 to 2000 times a second.         This rapidity of action was noticed
by Mr. Hearder at the London Institution as being peculiar ; and it
also allows me to obtain a beautiful arc of flame between the second
ary terminals, instead of sparks following each other slowly.
   I could name other peculiarities, such as using a great number of
coatings of thin gutta-percha instead of fewer layers of thick tissue,
&c, but I think the differences which I have pointed out will be suffi
cient to show that I have not copied Mr. Hearder's induction coils.
   Trusting you will excuse me for again troubling you* I remain,
                                  Yours very obediently,

XVIII.     On the Measurement of the Chemical Action of Light.
    By John W. Draper, M.I)., Professor of Chemistry and
    Physiology in the University of New York *.
           recent experiments of Professor Bunsen and Dr. Roscoe
THE       encourage the hope that the attention of chemists will
before long be particularly directed to photo-chemistry, which
undoubtedly offers at this moment one of the most promising
fields of research.
    To be satisfied what a boundless opportunity for investigation
is here presented, it is enough to recollect that in the decompo
sition of carbonic acid by the solar rays lies the starting-point
of all organization, both vegetable and animal ; and that if it
were not for that effect, the whole surface of our globe would be
a mere desolate waste, presenting no appearance of life.     Besides
this relation to the world of organization, the influences of light
are now recognized as occasioning combinations and decompo
sitions not inferior in number or importance to those produced
by heat and electricity.
   Impressed by such considerations,     I  devoted a great deal of
time some years ago to the study of the chemical action of light,
as the readers of this Journal know.        But at that period the
attention of chemists was so completely absorbed in the depart
ment of organic analysis, and in the application of the discoveries
so made to vegetable and animal physiology, that it seemed im
possible to divert it even to the fundamental fact which in reality
is at the bottom of all those investigations.      Organization im-

 163            Prof. Draper   on the Measurement     of
plies the prior action of light.     The time has now probably come
 when the wants both of chemistry and physiology will require
 the conditions of that action to be determined.          The field of
 organic analysis has been pretty completely reaped ; there is not
 now much to be done except by the gleaners.
    Even among those who have devoted themselves to experi
 ments in optical chemistry, the tendency has been to the im
 provement of the art of photography, rather than to the exami
nation of facts which are at its scientific basis.     A great amount
 of information, destined ere long to be advantageously used, has,
 however, in that way been indirectly obtained.
    It is quite evident that in the contemplated inquiry the first
thing to be done is to invent some means for measuring with
exactness the chemical force of light.       More than twenty years
ago I commenced making attempts with that view. These were,
first by the comparison of stains made on paper covered with
chloride or bromide of silver.      Subsequently (December 1843)
 I described in this Journal, under the name of Tithonometer, an
 instrument which is well adapted to such inquiries.        It consists
of an arrangement by which there may be obtained from hydro
chloric acid, decomposed by a voltaic battery, a mixture of equal
 volumes of chlorine and hydrogen.         This mixture will remain
 without any change in the dark ; but on exposure to the rays of
a lamp, the two gases unite in proportion to the quantity of the
incident light.     So great is its sensitiveness, that an electric
 spark, which lasts, it is said, less than the millionth of a second,
affects it powerfully even at a distance, and sometimes occasions
an explosion which destroys the tithonometer.
    By the aid of this instrument may be illustrated the change
which I discovered that the sun's rays occasion in the properties
of chlorine, and likewise the preliminary absorption of light
which is necessary before chemical actions ensue.            It is this
period of preliminary absorption, in the case of the iodide of
silver, which is of such interest in the art of photography — the
period during which invisible impressions are made on the da
guerreotype plate and collodion film ; capable of development in
the one case by vapour of mercury, and in the other by pyro-
gallic acid or protosulphate of iron.
    The tithonometer is the instrument of which Professor Bunsen
and Dr. Roscoe, in an improved form, have made such excellent
use.    In its original construction    I  can still recommend it to
those who are disposed to engage in these inquiries, as possess
ing extraordinary sensitiveness; and if suitable corrections for
variations of temperature and pressure be applied, of sufficient
exactness.
   To such   I would in addition suggest another means for mea

                   the Chemical    Action of Light.                163
suring the chemical action of light. It will be found well adapted
where extreme sensitiveness is not desired.        It is an aqueous
solution of peroxalate of iron. This substance, which is of a
golden-yellow colour, may be kept, as I found, for more than
three years (probably for any length of time) without exhibiting
any change, if in total darkness ; but on exposure to a lamp or
the daylight, it undergoes decomposition,        carbonic acid] gas
escaping, and the lemon-yellow protoxalate of iron precipitating.
If set in the sunshine, it actually hisses through the escape of
the gas.   The ray which chiefly affects it is the indigo, the same
which affects the tithonometer, and the silver compounds used
in photography. This ray, to produce its effect, undergoes ab
sorption, as may easily be proved by causing a sunbeam to pass
through two parallel strata of peroxalate, when it will be found
that the light which has gone through the first portion is inope
rative on the second.
   Other properties which the solution of peroxalate of iron pre
sents strongly recommend it as a photometric agent to the
chemist.    Unlike solution of chlorine, it may be very conveni
ently confined in glass tubes by mercury. In its use there are
two points which must be attended to: — 1st, the lemon-yellow
protoxalate must not be permitted to incrust the side of the glass
exposed to the light, and thereby injure its transparency; 2nd,
the solution of peroxalate must be kept nearly at a constant tem
perature, for its colour changes with the heat.      At the freezing
of water it is of an emerald-green ; at the boiling, of a brownish-
yellow. With these variations of tint its absorptive action on
light varies, and therefore its liability to be changed.
   It may be remarked that the peroxalate of iron is an excellent
photographic agent.        A piece of tissue-paper made yellow by
being dipped    in  a neutral  solution of it,when dried in the dark
   very sensitive.
a is
                      Its invisible impressions may be developed by
   weak solution of nitrate of silver, two grains dissolved in an
ounce of water answering very well.
   In the application of peroxalate of iron to photometry, several
different methods may be followed.          The courseI   have most
commonly taken has been to determine the quantity of carbonic
acid produced — sometimes     by   volume, sometimes   byweight.    It
is of course understood, that before any carbonic acid can be
disengaged, the solution must become saturated therewith and   ;
that before we can correctly measure the quantity of light      bythe
quantity of acid produced, this dissolved portion must be ascer
tained.    In one of my photometers the expulsion of the dissolved
gas     accomplished by exposure to small bath of boiling water,
       is                              a
in another  by a   stream of hydrogen.     Both processes yield satis
factory results.
   But this method, by the determination of the produced car

bonic acid, is only one of the numerous plans which the employ
ment of peroxalate of iron suggests ; for instance, we might use
in the determination the weight of certain metals which the solu
tion after exposure will precipitate.         Thus a portion which has
been made and kept in the dark, may be mixed with chloride of
gold without any action ensuing ; but if it has been illuminated,
the amount of metallic gold precipitated is in proportion to the
incident light.       On this principle I commenced an attempt to
determine the hourly and diurnal illumination of a given locality.
At the bottom of a hollow metal tube, arranged as a polar axis,
was placed a bulb containing a standard solution of the iron salt,
and at the close of the proposed periods the weight of gold it
could reduce was ascertained.           There is something fascinating
in determining the quantity of light which the sun yields us by
the quantity of gold it can produce.           Upon the whole, however,
I  would recommend to those who are disposed to renew these
attempts, to select a method depending on the volume of car
bonic acid, for it is always easier to make an observation than
an experiment.
    Among the important results which may be expected from
these new modes of photometry, and which will doubtless be
furnished at an early period, are the hourly, diurnal, and annual
quantities of the sunlight.         These are not only important in a
meteorological point      of  view,  but also as respects physical geo
graphy, and the great interests of agriculture.             The sum of
vegetable organization is in all climates and localities a function
of the light distributed thereto.          Even so far as heat is con
cerned, the indications of the thermometer are of little use.          It
is not the intensity, but the absolute quantity which should be
measured.        To each plant, from the moment of its germination
to the moment of its maximum development, and the completion
of its physiological functions, a definite quantity of heat and also
of light must be measured out.            As respects the heat in such
inquiries,    it is not the  thermometer but the calorimeter which
should be used ; and as to the light, the photometers here recom
mended determine its quantity, but not its brilliancy, and there
fore answer the indications required.           And since it is the light
of the sun, and not the temperature of a locality, which is the
effective condition of vegetable growth, we see how important,
even in agriculture itself, these proposed determinations really are.
    I hope that these remarks may draw attention to the problem
of the chemical action of light.          To those who are disposed to
devote themselves to such inquiries,           I recommend as a photo
metric means a mixture of chlorine and hydrogen where great
sensitiveness is required, and in other cases the peroxalate of iron.

XIX.    On the Chemical Changes which       Pig Iron undergoes during
   its conversion into Wrought Iron.         By F. Crace Calvert,
   F. C.S., and M.R.A. of Turin ; and      Richard Johnson, Esq.*
                   to make some improvements in the manufacture
WISHING  of iron, we carefully examined    the various analyses which
had been made of pig iron and wrought iron ; but we found that
no comparison could be made between the recorded results, as
the samples analysed had been obtained from different sources,
and also as no detailed analysis had been published of the
various chemical changes which pig iron undergoes in the pro
cess of puddling during its conversion into wrought iron. We
therefore decided to undertake this task, with the hope of throw
ing some light upon this important operation in the manufacture
of iron, and of thereby enabling practical men to make those
improvements in the puddling of iron which on many accounts
are so much to be desired.
   To fully investigate and closely follow the progressive and
interesting chemical ehanges which pig iron undergoes during
its conversion into wrought iron, we took samples every five or
ten minutes after the pig iron had melted in the furnace. These
chemical actions are clearly defined in the furnace by the peculiar
appearance which the mass assumes as the operation proceeds.
Before describing the various chemical changes, the appearance
of the melted mass as taken out of the furnace, and its chemical
composition, we shall describe with some details the analytical
processes which we have adopted to determine the elements
which exist in pig and wrought iron, and in the samples taken
during the operation.     These details of analysis appear to us the
more important, when it is remembered that most of the hete
rogeneous substances existing in pig iron are present only in
minute quantities, and that it is on their gradual removal or
decrease that the subsequent quality of the wrought iron depends.
Also it is necessary to bear in mind, that we had to trust entirely
to the exactitude of the analytical methods adopted, to appreciate
the chemical changes which gradually took place in the melted
mass during the time that the conversion of the pig iron into
wrought iron lasted.
   Iron. — The quantity of iron was determined by dissolving 1
gramme of iron in pure hydrochloric acid, reducing the solution
to a perfect protosalt by a little pure zinc, and then determining
the amount of iron by Marguerite's process.
    Carbon. — To determine this element, we found after many
trials that the best process was to reduce the iron into very fine
                    * Communicated  by the Authors.

 1G6     Messrs. Calvert and Johnson on the Chemical Changes which
 powder, either by pulverization or by means of a file, and then
 to burn the carbon under the influence of a red heat by a slow
 current of pure and dry oxygen gas. The apparatus which we
 used was the following : —
    a, a flask containing a mixture of chlorate of potash and oxide
 of copper, which by gently heating gave off a regular current of
oxygen.
    b, a bottle containing a concentrated solution of caustic pot
 ash, so as to retain any chlorine or any oxygenated compound of
 this gas which might be produced.
    c, a tube full of pumice-stone     moistened with solution of
caustic potash, and employed with the same view as the last.
    d, a U-tube filled with pieces of solid melted caustic potash,
 also used for the same purpose.
    e, a bottle containing sulphuric acid for retaining any moisture
which might accompany the oxygen gas.
   /, a porcelain tube in which was placed a small porcelain dish
containing the pulverized iron.
    g, a tube filled with small pieces of pumice-stone moistened
with sulphuric acid, with the view of retaining any moisture.
    h, a Liebig-tube full of concentrated solution of caustic pot
ash, to determine the amount of carbonic acid produced by the
combination of the oxygen with the carbon of the iron.
    i, a small tube with fragments of caustic potash, to retain any
trace of carbonic acid which might not be absorbed in the Liebig-
tube.
    To render the absorption of the carbonic acid complete, it is
necessary to conduct the operation very regularly and slowly ;
therefore about two hours are required to burn all the carbon
existing in about 3 grammes of iron.
    By this method two analyses of the same sample seldom pre
sented a greater difference than 0-05. We also took the pre
caution to dissolve the oxide of iron obtained after combustion,
in order to see that no hydrogen gas was given off, and conse
quently that no metallic iron remained.

  Pig Iron   undergoes during its conversion into Wrought Iron.   167
   ¦ Silicium. — There is considerable difficulty in determining with
  precision this element in cast iron, and it was only after several
 fruitless trials of various processes that we adopted the following,
  which gave us very satisfactory and concordant results.     5 grms.
  of the iron were dissolved in aqua regia containing excess of
  nitric acid, the whole was then evaporated to dryness and fused
  in a platinum crucible with three times its weight of a mixture
 of pure carbonate of potash and carbonate of soda. The mass
 obtained was dissolved in water and boiled with aqua regia until
  the whole of the peroxide of iron had entered into solution, and
 then was evaporated a second time to dryness and heated care
 fully to about 200° C.       The mass was then treated with hydro
 chloric acid and water, and the silica on being gathered on a
 filter, was washed with dilute hydrochloric acid until it was per
 fectly white, dried and calcined, when its weight gave the amount
 of silicium in the iron analysed.
     Sulphur. — In consequence of the small proportion in which
  this element exists in pig iron and wrought iron, considerable
 difficulty is experienced in ascertaining with accuracy the various
 proportions of sulphur existing in iron, and this difficulty was
 increased by the fact that none of the methods recommended
 gave satisfactory results in our hands.      Thus, for example, the
 method which consists in determining the sulphur in the state
 of sulphuretted hydrogen, failed, owing to the difficulty of re
 moving the last traces of sulphuretted hydrogen held in solution
 in the liquid in which the iron is dissolved, and in which the gas
 is produced.      As to the process which consists in dissolving the
iron in aqua regia and boiling off the greater part of the acid,
 and then adding nitrate of baryta to the solution, it cannot be
 followed with security ; for one of us has shown that sulphate of
 baryta is soluble in acid liquors, especially in those containing
 nitric acid, and often in such quantities as to make a greater
 difference between the analysis of two samples of the same iron,
 than the real difference which exists in two samples of iron from
 different ores.    These considerations induced us to modify the
last-mentioned process in the following way : — 5 grammes of the
 sample of iron to be analysed were reduced to fine powder, and
gradually and slowly added to a strongly oxidizing aqua regia,
composed of four parts of fuming nitric acid and one part of
hydrochloric acid.      The iron being dissolved, the solution was
evaporated to the consistence of a thin syrup, and then gradually
mixed with four times its weight of a mixture of pure carbonate
of potash and soda, and heated to redness for one hour in a pla
tinum crucible. The fused mass was then heated with pure
boiling water until all the soluble portion was dissolved.       This
liquor    was  then  rendered  slightly acid  with  hydrochloric acid,

168     Messrs. Calvert and Johnson   on the Chemical Changes which
evaporated to dryness, and heated at 200° C. to render the
silica insoluble. The whole was then treated with water slightly
acidulated with acetic acid, and on the silica being separated
by filtration, the amount of sulphate, and consequently of
sulphur, was determined from the weight of sulphate of baryta
obtained.
    Phosphorus. — We also attached great importance to the exact
valuation of this body, because, like sulphur, its presence even
in small quantities is most injurious; the more so, as such
minute quantities as a few thousandths, more or less, will com
pletely alter the value of iron for many uses. To determine
phosphorus, the process which we followed was similar to that
employed for the sulphur ; with this difference, that we added
some muriatic acid, and to the liquid from which we had sepa
rated the silica, ammonia in excess instead of acetic acid, as we
had done in the analysis of sulphur. The liquid was allowed to
stand, to see if any alumina separated ; and if not, we added
hydrochloric acid in excess, then pure chloride of calcium, and
then ammonia again, when phosphate of lime having the following
formula, PO5 3CaO, was precipitated, from which the quantity of
phosphorus was calculated.       We always took care to operate on
such a bulk of fluid as to prevent the precipitation of any sulphate
of lime, and we also washed rapidly to prevent any carbonate of
lime being formed. We verified this method several times during
our analysis, by determining the amount of lime in our precipi
tates, and the amount of phosphoric acid, by M. Reynoso's
process.
    Aluminium. —   If there was any aluminium, it was separated
during the last process and its amount determined.          We also
 made several fusions of iron dissolved in aqua regia and evapo
rated with a mixture of alkaline carbonates to which we had
 added a little caustic alkali, and we found no aluminium, or only
 mere traces in the iron analysed by us.
     Manganese. — 5 grammes of iron were dissolved in aqua regia,
and the whole evaporated to dryness and calcined with alkaline
carbonates.     The fused mass was treated with boiling water, and
to the solution were added small pieces of Swedish paper to
                           '
 reduce the manganate.       The iron and manganese were then col
lected on a filter, well washed, and then dissolved in hydrochloric
 acid.   This solution was again evaporated, and heated so as to
render the silicic acid insoluble. The residue was then treated
 with some weak hydrochloric acid, and the solution filtered to
 separate the silica.   Carbonate of baryta recently prepared was
then added to precipitate the oxide of iron ; this was separated
by filtration, and to the liquid, sulphate of soda and a little hy
 drochloric acid were added to separate the baryta in solution ;

and finally, the manganese was precipitated by a little caustic
potash, washed, dried, calcined, and its amount ascertained.
    It is necessary that we should describe in a rapid manner the
physical conditions which pig iron assumes during its conversion
into wrought iron. When first heated in a puddling furnace, it
forms a thick, pasty mass, which gradually becomes thin, and as
fluid as mercury.      When it has reached this point it experiences
a violent agitation, technically called " the boil," which is pro
duced no doubt by the oxidation of the carbon, and the escape
of the carbonic oxide then generated.           During this period of the
operation the mass swells to several times its primitive bulk, and
the puddler quickly agitates the melted mass to facilitate the
oxidation of the carbon.       After a short time the mass gradually
subsides; the puddler then changes his tool, and takes the
" puddle " to gather with it the granules of malleable iron float
ing in the melted mass of scoria or slag.          The granules or glo
bules of iron gradually weld together and separate from the
scoria ; and this separation is hastened by the puddler gradually
 forming large masses, called balls, weighing about 80 lbs., from
which the scoria drains out. This part of the operation requires
 great skill in the puddler ; for nearly the whole of the carbon
 has been oxidized, so that if the current of air is not managed
 with great care, the iron itself is oxidized, or as it is technically
 termed,
            " burnt ; " and thus not only does great loss ensue in
 the quantity of malleable iron produced, but also the iron con
 taining a certain quantity of oxide of iron is brittle, and of bad
 quality.
     We shall now examine the various chemical changes which
 pig iron undergoes during its conversion into wrought iron.
     The iron we took for our experiments was a good cold- blast
  Staffordshire iron ; the pig was rather gray, being of the quality
 used for making iron wire, or a gray No. 3.              Its composition
 was as follows : —

     224 lbs. of the above pig iron were introduced at 12 o'clock,
  on the 4th of    April, 1856, into a puddling furnace which had

  170    Messrs. Calvert and Johnson        on the Chemical Changes which
  been cleaned out with malleable iron scraps.                  After thirty
  minutes the pigs began to soften and to be easily crumbled, and
 ten minutes more had hardly elapsed when they entered into a
 state of fusion.     The first sample was taken out of the furnace
 at 12h 40m p.m., from the centre of the melted mass with a
 large iron ladle and poured on a stone flag to cool. The flue of
 the furnace, which up to this time had been kept open, was now
 nearly closed by a damper at the top of the chimney, so that the
 products of combustion came out by the door of the furnace and
 other openings, whilst little or none escaped by the chimney.
                        Appearance     of the Sample.
    On breaking the sample as taken out of the furnace, it had no
 longer the appearance of gray No. 3 pig iron, but a white, silvery,
 metallic fracture, similar to that of refined metal.              The rapid
 cooling   of the  sample     was   no  doubt   the  cause   of  the    change
 noticed, for it contained quite as much carbon as the pig iron
 used ; and further, the carbon was in a very similar condition,
 as in both cases a large quantity of black flakes of carbon floated
 in the acid liquors in which the iron was dissolved.                 The fol
 lowing is the amount of carbon and silicium which the above
 sample contained      per cent.    —

    These results are highly interesting, as they show that the
 iron had undergone during the forty minutes which it had been
 in the furnace, two opposite chemical changes; for whilst the
 proportion of carbon had increased, the quantity of silicium had
 rapidly decreased. This curious fact is still further brought out
 by the sample which we took out of the furnace at 1 p.m., or
 twenty minutes later than the last sample analysed, as is shown
in this Table : —

Therefore the carbon had increased 0-625, or 21-5 per cent, of its
own weight, and the silicium had decreased in the enormous pro
portion of above 90 per cent.          It is probable that these opposite
chemical actions are due, in the case of the carbon, to the excess
of this element in a great state of division or in a nascent state
in the furnace, and that under the influence of the high tempe
rature it combines with the iron, for which it has a great affinity,
whilst the silicium and a small portion of iron are oxidized and

    It had the same white, silvery appearance as No. 1 ; but had
this difference, that it was slightly malleable under the hammer,
instead of being brittle like No. 1.             The scoria also was on the
upper     surface   of  the  mass    when     cold, and not mixed with the
metallic iron, as in succeeding examples.

quantity was ladled out. When cold it was quite different from
that of the two previous ones, being composed of small globules
adhering to each other, and mixed with the scoria ; the mass
therefore was not compact, like the former ones, but was light
and spongy ; its external appearance was black, and the small
globules when broken presented a bright metallic lustre, and
 were very brittle under the hammer.                 We had for some time
considerable difficulty in separating the scoria from the globules
of iron ; but we found that by pulverizing the whole for a long
time the scoria was reduced to impalpable powder, and by sieving
we could separate it from the iron, which was much less friable.
The iron thus cleansed from its scoria gave us the following

    As soon as the last sample had been taken out, the damper of
the furnace was slightly raised so as to admit a gentle current of
air, which did away with the smoke which had been issuing from
the puddler's door, and a clear and bright flame was the result.
This was done, no doubt, to facilitate the oxidation of the carbon
of the iron, and to increase this action the puddler quickly agi
 tated the mass.        Under these two actions the mass swelled tip
 rapidly, and increased to at least four or five times its original

bulk          lh 20m, the mass being in full boil, this 4th sample
         ; and at
was taken out. Whilst cooling, it presented the interesting fact,
that in various parts of it small blue flames of oxide of carbon
were perceived, no doubt arising from the combustion of carbon
by the oxygen of the atmosphere.       It is curious that this phe
nomenon was not observed in the previous samples.         It is due
probably to the following causes: first, that the cast iron,
having been brought by the boil to a state of minute division,
offers a large surface to the action of the oxygen of the air, and
thus the combination of the oxygen with the carbon of the iron
is facilitated j and second, that at this period the carbon seems
to possess little or no affinity for the iron ; for one of us has
often observed that when pig iron, rich in graphite, is puddled,
the carbon is liberated from the iron ; for if a cold iron rod is
plunged into the mass of melted iron in the puddling furnace,
it is covered with iron and abundant shining scales of graphite
carbon.
   The appearance of this No. 4 sample was most interesting ;
and the best idea that we can give of it     that             is,
                                                        so light and  it   is
formed of such minute granules as to be exactly like an ants'
nest.   The particles have no adherence to each other, for                                   by
mere handling of the mass      falls into pieces. This

under the hammer, and when broken they present                bright,            a
silvery, metallic fracture.    The scoria was separated            the                  by

    The reason why this sample was taken only five minutes after
the last sample, was, that the mass in the furnace was rapidly
transforming itself into two distinct products, viz. the scoria on
the one hand, and small globules of malleable iron on the other.
We attached some importance to this sample, as the workman
was on the point of beginning the balling or agglomerating the
 globules of iron, so as to form large balls of about 80 lbs. weight,
 to be hammered and rolled oat into bars.                  Whilst the mass
 taken out for analysis was cooling, small blue flames of oxide of
 carbon issued from it.            These were similar to those observed in
 Nos. 4 and 5, but were not so abundant.                  The appearance of
 this sample was very similar to the last one, with the exception
 that the scoria was not so intimately mixed with the globules of
 iron, and that these were larger, and slightly welded together
 when hammered.           The proportions of carbon and silicium were
  as follows : —

     When these figures are compared with those of the previous
  analysis, it is interesting to observe, that whilst the silicium re
  mains nearly stationary, the carbon rapidly diminishes ; for in
  the five minutes which elapsed between the taking out of the
  two samples, there was 28 per cent, of the carbon burnt out.
  This rapid decrease of carbon in the iron is maintained during
  the remaining ten minutes of puddling.               In fact, in one quarter
  of an hour, viz. from lh 35m to lh 50m, the iron lost 50 per cent,
  of the carbon which it contained at lh 35m.
                     7th Sample, taken out at        P  45m.
     This sample was obtained when the puddler had began to
  ball.    The appearance of the sample, although similar to the
  last,  differs from it by the granules being rather larger, and
  nearly separated from the scoria, which forms a layer at the top
  and bottom of the mass. These granules are also much more
  malleable, for they are easily flattened under the hammer. This

last fact is easily accounted for by the small amount of carbon
which it contains, as stated above and shown by these results : —

    This last sample was taken a few minutes before the balls
were ready to be removed from the furnace, to be placed under
the hammer, and was a part of one of the balls which were sepa
rated and placed to cool.        It was observed that no blue flame
issued from the mass as it cooled.             The appearance of the
sample showed that the mass constituting the ball was still
spongy, and granulated similar to the previous ones.         The only
difference was, that the granules adhered together sufficiently to
require a certain amount of force to separate one from the other,
and also that they were much more malleable under the hammer.
They were found to contain the following quantities of carbon
and silicium per cent. : —

    We should observe here, that the black coating which covers
the granules of iron, even of No. 8 sample, preserves the iron
from all oxidation; for none of the samples became oxidized
 during the nine months they were in the laboratory, exposed to
the atmosphere, and to the various acid fumes floating about.
This black coating is probably composed of a saline oxide of
 iron.

   To complete the series of products in the conversion of pig
iron into wrought iron, we analysed the scoria or slag which
remained in the furnace after the balls had been taken out, and
found its composition to be as follows : —

Therefore in the scoria are found the silicium, phosphorus, sul
phur and manganese which existed in the pig iron ; and pro
bably the phosphorus and silicium are removed from the iron
by their forming fusible compounds with its oxide.
   We shall conclude this paper by giving our results in a tabu
lated form, so that the removal of the carbon and silicium may
be better appreciated by those who may consult it with the view
of obtaining such information as may lead them to those im
provements to which we think our investigations tend.

23.
     ilA    QUESTION       has not unfrequently arisen in regard to
             the charging of the proof-plane and simple electrified
conductors, which admits of an easy solution upon the element
ary principles and subsequent experimental inquiries we have been
considering.    It has been doubted whether these bodies take up
electricity upon all their surfaces, or upon one only.         Now it is
evident, (3) and Exp. 4, that neither the proof-plane nor any other
conductor can take up electricity upon either face, except we dis
place from the face of contact a portion of its own electricity (3).
The charge virtually consists of its own displaced electricity (9),
consequently the charge it receives will be entirely dependent on
this induced change, as we have already seen (17).        In the case of
an insulated conducting surface exposed to the operation of sur
rounding matter, a stratum of accumulated electricity must always
be found upon all its surfaces upon the principles already exposed
(10). Let, for example, a, b, c, fig. 18, be three concentric hollow
spheres placed one within the other, and so sustained as not
anywhere to touch ; let the interior middle sphere be perfectly
insulated, whilst the spheres a and c communicate with the
ground; then in communicating electricity to the insulated
sphere b, we find it charge on both its surfaces, and so produce
an electrical stratum, b c, on each side of it.      If we cut off the
influence of the sphere a or c, then it charges on one surface
only ; at least the charge on the opposite surface is so small as
to admit of being neglected in such an experiment.            In the case
of the double induction, twice the quantity of electricity may be
accumulated under the same degree of the electrometer.               The
following experiments are instructive, and very conclusive.
    Exp. 14. Let a light circular disc of gilded or silvered wood, c,
fig. 19, about a foot in diameter and something less than -25 of
an inch thick, be suspended from a varnished glass arm by an in
sulating thread of varnished silk gut (2) ; connect it with the
hydrostatic electrometer E, or with the fixed ball of the balance,
as in fig. 17 (22).   Let two other perfectly similar plates, a, b, be
suspended    in like manner   at an equal distance upon each side of
the plate c.
    Connect one of the external plates, a, with the ground, and
proceed to charge the centre plate c with a given number of

    Sir W. Snow Harris's Researches in Statical Electricity.       177
measures of electricity, the opposite plate b being turned aside
during this process.      Observe now the electrometer intensity in
degrees at a given distance of the attracting discs p, n.     Suppose
the number of measures 5 ; distance of the plates a, c '5 of an
inch, distance of the attracting discs p, n "6 of an inch, and the
index indication 10 degrees.
     Replace plate b, and put it also in connexion with the
ground. Discharge the air between c and a by a communi
cation between the two coatings or plates a, c in the usual way,
and repeat the former process; the number of measures now
requisite to produce 10 degrees of force will be 10 measures, or
just double the former.         The plate c, therefore, or rather the
 air, has now charged in proportion to the two surfaces of the
plate, which in this case have been each exposed to a free induct
 ive action, and the electricity proper to the plate c has been en
abled to retire, as it were, outward toward the stratum of air on
 each side of it.
     24. This is precisely what happens in the case of what we term
 the charging simple insulated conductors, except that from the
 distance of other conducting matter taken as the opposite or un
 insulated coating to the charge, the accumulation is less complete
 and more feeble.      If we look at this question somewhat critically,
 we may probably be led to conclude that the essence of the charge
 is virtually the displaced electricity proper to the plate itself (9),
  (17). Suppose, for example, that we are about to communicate
 a given measure of electricity to the rectangular plate adb,
 fig. 20, through the intervention of a small carrier-ball c, charged
 to saturation, suppose positively, and applied to any point c of
 the plate.    The first action will be that of direct and reflected
 induction, already explained (3), fig. 2 ; that is to say, the elec
 tricity proper to the plate recedes in every direction, ca, cd, cb,
 from the point c, and a powerful negative space, c, is for a moment
  produced all around it ; at the same instant, the charge, before
  distributed uniformly over the carrier-ball, concentrates itself by
  the reflected induction immediately upon the point c in contact
  with the plate ; a neutralization of the opposite forces ensues, and
  the plate and surrounding air remain charged with the displaced
  electricity. If the magnitude of the plate be considerable in
  respect of the carrier-ball, all its charge, or nearly all, will have
  disappeared on a first contact ; and the charge communicated as
  in the Leyden jar will be so greatly masked by the inductive
  action of surrounding matter, that comparatively little effect is
  produced on an electrometer, n, placed in connexion with the
  plate.    On a repetition of this operation, the same actions are
  apparent: another quantity of electricity becomes displaced, and
 again the carrier-ball becomes robbed of its electricity.          The
     Phil. Mag. S. 4. Vol. 14. No. 92. Sept. 1857.              N

178     Sir W. Snow Harris's Researches in Statical Electricity.
electrometer now begins to evince an increased action.        A third
application becomes     still more  sensible.  The  carrier-ball may
yet yield up so large a portion of its electricity, that the residue
on it may be neglected, and the march of an electrometer of
measure E, fig. 13, will be as the square of the quantity of elec
tricity displaced.   A stratum of air everywhere surrounding the
metal becomes in this way charged ; or, according to Faraday,
polarized and inductive action becomes propagated through con
tiguous or next particles to bodies at a distance : in this sense,
simple insulated conductors, as distinguishable from a more regu
larly coated surface or stratum, may be conceived to charge upon
all their surfaces.   That this is not only possible but certain, is
shown in our last experiment 14, the charge itself being re
solvable into the displaced electricity of the plate itself. When
the possible displacement becomes exhausted, the charge is at a
maximum under the given circumstances and conditions of the
experiment.
    In the case of a coated stratum of air, fig. 19, Exp. 14, in
which two coatings only, a, c, are employed, plate b being turned
aside, the intervening air on one surface of the plate may be
considered as the more immediate recipient of the charge : still
the air in contact with the exterior surface of the plate may be
conceived to participate in the operation.     We have here merely
to suppose, in the case of employing both the plates a, b, that
plate b has been removed to an indefinite distance.       It is only
on account of the small induction of distant matter, as com
pared with that of the near and directly opposed coating on
plate a, that we commonly neglect the charge by distant induc
tion upon its opposite surface, and consider only the charge de
veloped immediately between the two plates or coatings a, c.
When we bring into operation, however, a third plate b, in the
way shown, Exp. 15, then the equal induction upon the exposed
surfaces of the centre plate c is complete, and we obtain a full
or double charge.
     25. It may be worth while to define here more explicitly what
 is to be understood by the term charge, considered as an expres
 sion of quantitative measurement.      By the term electrical charge
 of an insulated conductor, we are to understand the measured
 quantity of electricity it can sustain under a given degree of the
 electrometer as referred to some unit of measure.      Thus, fig. 21,
 let a globe S, a circular plate P, of twice the diameter of the
 sphere, and a rectangular plate R, of the same area as the sphere
 and plate, be put successively in connexion with the fixed disc
p of the electrometer E, fig. 19, or with the fixed ball of the
 balance p, fig. 17 (22).     Then the same quantity of electricity
 communicated to these three bodies, S, P, R, affects the electro

   Sir W. Snow Harris's Researches in Statical Electricity.      179
meter very differently, notwithstanding that the surface is the
same in each.     And in order to give to the electrometer the same
indication, different quantities will be required.     Thus, if five
measures communicated to the sphere indicate 10 degrees of
force, seven measures will be required to be disposed on the plate
to indicate the same force : for the rectangle some other number
will be required.    The number of measures thus requisite to
bring the electrometer index to the same point, is the electrical
charge of the given conductor as accepted by Cavendish, and
may be supposed to represent the electrical capacity of any given
surface.
   26. This understood, we may now proceed to consider an in
teresting and beautiful experiment by Coulomb, on the relative
charges of a hollow sphere and a circular plate of twice the dia
meter ; from which it has been inferred that the plate charges
in proportion to its two surfaces, and the sphere only in propor
tion to its outer surface. There can be but little doubt of the
perfect accuracy of the experiments of this most ingenious and
profound philosopher, nevertheless    I am led to believe that they
admit of a somewhat different interpretation from that generally
given to them.
    Exp. 15. Take two equal spheres, A, B, fig. 22, and a plate,
P, of twice the diameter of the sphere ; charge one of the spheres
A with a given quantity of electricity, and subsequently touch it
with the insulated plate P. The charge by the method of Cou
lomb will be found shared between the sphere and plate in the
proportion of 1 : 2 ; that is to say, the plate will have abstracted
two-thirds of the charge, and will have left one-third. Now, as
already observed, although there can be little doubt of the accu
racy of this result as stated by Coulomb, yet the sharing the
charge between these bodies is not the same thing as charging
the bodies separately with measured quantities of electricity (25).
If we attempt to place a unit of quantity on the sphere, and twice
that quantity on the plate under the same degree of the electro
meter, we fail to do it : the plate will not receive it.    And we
have just seen (23), Exp. 14, that when a plate really takes up
electricity as charge in proportion to both its surfaces, we then
have a double accumulation, and we can place the same quan
tity of electricity on each surface as compared with a given
 unit of quantity. Now in the sharing of the charge between
the sphere and plate, the plate would necessarily appropriate
to itself an amount of electricity proportionate to the free in
ductive action between it and the sphere : in fact, as may be
clearly seen, its remote surface P is twice that of the remote
surface p of the sphere, and consequently has twice the direct
inductive capacity, so that the near face n would be in a position
                                N2

180        Sir W. Snow Harris's Researches in Statical Electricity.
to receive, in sharing the charge, twice the quantity of electricity
which would be retained on the sphere A. Hence, when by con
tact the increased induced electrical charge of the sphere in the
hemisphere s next the plate is communicated to the plate, and
the sphere and plate are taken together as a whole, then it is
that the plate receives a quantity proportionate to the magnitude
of the inductive change in each, without which there would not
be an equilibrium of distribution between the two bodies (3),
tig. 2.  The perfect success of this experiment is entirely de
pendent on insulation, and the absence of foreign induction ; if
any adventitious circumstance should arise calculated to increase
the capacity of the sphere; by induction, as by the presence of
near matter, some particular hygrometric states of the air, or
imperfect insulation, the plate and sphere will appear to share
                      I
equally, as have found in a great variety of instances, and as
stated in my paper in the Philosophical Transactions for 1836.
Such, however,               I
                   have since found is not really the case when
the experiment is very perfectly conducted with due regard to
disturbing influences.
   27. The result of this experiment, therefore, although it may
well determine the relative division of the electricity between the
two bodies, does not really determine their relative capacity for
electricity or their charge (25).  In order to determine this, it
is requisite to compare each with a third body, on the principles
laid down by Cavendish, and which may be very well managed
in employing a third body, suppose a sphere B, fig. 20, which
may be either equal or not.     For the sake of simplicity let it be
equal.
  Exp. 16. Let the sphere A, charged as before, be touched by
an equal and similar neutral sphere B ; then the charge becomes
shared equally between the two spheres, and the capacity of a
sphere equal to the plate P, of twice its diameter, may be repre
sented by the fraction |.      Repeat this experiment with the
plate P; then, as just seen, its capacity deduced in a similar
way may be represented by the fraction |.       The capacity of the
sphere, therefore, is to the capacity of the plate of twice the dia
meter in the proportion of ^ : § ; that      as    V2 very nearly,
                                                        is,   1

the two bodies will sustain under      given degree of the electro

 nication with the fixed disc of the hydrostatic electrometer
 (fig. 18), or the fixed disc of the balance, fig. 17. Deposit 5
 measures on the sphere, and 7 measures on the plate : the index
 will stand at the same number of degrees in each case as before.
 A great many such experiments may be adduced to show that
 this is really the proportionate electrical capacities of a sphere
and circular plate of twice the diameter of the sphere ; and that
if we attempt to place twice the quantity of electricity on the
 plate, according to the ordinary deduction, that it charges in
 proportion to its double surface, we entirely fail : the plate will
 not receive any other proportion of charge than that just stated.
    28. The fact that simple insulated conductors do not always
 take up electricity in proportion to their surfaces has been long
 known. It was first observed by Le Monnier in 1746, by Volta
 in 1779, and was observed in certain cases by Coulomb himself in
 his justly celebrated memoirs on electricity in L'Histoire de
I'Academie, in 1785.      The law, however, of this species of elec
 trical action has never been fully investigated in all its generality.
                                                                I
 In the case of spheres, circular plates, and plane surfaces, have
 been enabled to arrive at a very simple expression for the rela
tive quantities of electricity which such bodies can sustain under
 a given degree of the electrometer, that is to say, their charge ;
 and which comes very near the result of experiment in almost
 every instance.    If P represent the circumference or perimeter,
S the surface, and C the charge, then we have C= v^SxP,
taking P and S as abstract numbers.           That this is true for
spheres, circular plates, and plane surfaces of other forms, may
be most satisfactorily shown in the way just described, Exps. 17
and 18.      Take, for example, two spheres, Q, R, whose diameters
are 5#67 inches and 9 inches respectively; then we have for
 charge of sphere Q, of diameter 5"67, and surface 101,
                a/S + P= */101x 17=42-4 nearly;
and for charge of sphere R, of diameter 9, and surface 2545,
                </SxP= ^254-5x28-27 = 84-8           nearly;
that is to say, the relative quantities of electricity which may be
accumulated on these two globes under the same electrometer
indication, or in other words, their relative charge, will be as
42-4 : 84-8, or as 1 : 2, their surfaces being as 1 : 2-5.
    Exp. 19. Place 5 measures on globe Q, and 10 measures on
globe R, and take the reactive forces by the method of Coulomb ;

electrical force we may be led to adopt.      They evidently indicate
a  disposition in the electrical molecules to increased action when
grouped closely about each other ; when subjected to a state of
linear extension, they become placed, as it were, further without
each other's influence, and appear to repose with greater tran
quillity on a conducting surface considered as a portion of a
charged system (12).       It is well known that when two similarly
electrified bodies are brought into the presence of each other,
the electrometer indications of these two bodies begin to increase,
and continue to exhibit further excitement as the bodies are
caused to approach each other.         Now it is quite apparent that
the molecules of an electrical stratum will be further with
out . each other's influence when accumulated on a long rect
angular plate, R, fig. 21, than on a circular plate P of equal sur
face.      I
           am not, however, prepared to enter upon any theoretical
explanation of these phsenomena, much less do         adduce them in       I
opposition to any accepted theory of electricity. AVhether the
several facts        I
                 have been considering be explicable or not upon a

                                          perhaps, nothing more cal
culated to retard the advance of natural knowledge than undue
subserviency to what may be designated as philosophical doc

to the establishment of         long-cherished hypothesis
                                            a                 and the          ;

but as to their agreement with theory. It was thus with the
Ptolemaists rather than endanger their doctrine of planetary

motion, they encumbered the heavens with cycles and epicycles
in order to maintain it. My own impression       that so far from        is,

usually assigned to                it,
                           of an extremely simple form, and that

184             Mr. F. Guthrie    on Iodide  of Acetyle.
upon considerably more than an equivalent of dry phosphorus in
a dry, Jong-necked flask, and dry iodine added in small quan
tities at a time in rather more than equivalent weight.      The flask
is then warmed till action has ceased.         The liquid containing
uncombined iodine is poured into a retort containing a piece of
 dry phosphorus, and placed in an inverted position in connexion
 with a condenser.       After boiling for a few minutes, the retort
is reverted and the contents distilled off.         The boiling-point
remains tolerably constant at 108° C. ; the temperature may,
however, be pushed to 120° C, at which point the residue in
 the retort is inconsiderable.    The distillate is vigorously shaken
 with mercury until it becomes transparent, and then quickly
 decanted and rectified at 108° C.       However cautiously the di
 stillation be effected, a portion of the iodide appears to suffer
 decomposition ; hydriodic acid escapes, and a solid residue con
 taining iodine is left in the retort.    This is probably a substitu
 tion product, containing iodine in place of hydrogen.
    In the above manner, by acting on 3f ozs. anhydrous acetic
 acid, with 9^ ozs. iodine and about 1 oz. phosphorus,     I obtained
 5 ozs. of iodide of acetyle.
    Iodide of acetyle is a transparent liquid of brown colour. This
 coloration is specific, and does not arise from dissolved iodine,
for it cannot be removed by agitation with mercury.         It boils at
 108° C. at 757 millims., and has the specific gravity l-98 at
 17° C.    Its vapour-density could not be determined with accu
racy, owing to the above-mentioned fact of its not being perfectly
volatile without decomposition.        It fumes strongly in the air,
has a most suffocating odour, and an intensely acid and corro
sive taste. Water decomposes it instantly and with violence,
hydriodic and acetic acids being formed.          To this reaction is
due the energetic action it has on organic bodies containing the
elements of water.
    In the analysis of this body, the carbon and hydrogen were
determined in the usual manner, moderately heated copper-
turnings being employed in the anterior of the combustion-tube
to arrest volatilized iodine.    The iodine was estimated as iodide
of silver.   For this purpose a bulb containing a weighed quan
tity of liquid, and provided with two capillary tubes, was im
mersed in a solution of nitrate of silver.     The point of the lower
tube being then broken against the side of the vessel, and that
of the upper with the fingers, the air was forced gradually
through, and the bulb subsequently washed into the silver
solution.
    Burnt with oxide of copper, -7827 grm. gave -4416grm. car
bonic acid and "1641 grm. water.
    •3038 grm. yielded -4140 grm. iodide of silver.

   The excess in carbon and hydrogen, and the deficiency in
iodine, show that the liquid was not quite free from anhydrous
acetic acid.
   Zinc and sodium decompose iodide of acetyle at ordinary tem
peratures.        Mercury, aided by the sun's light, also effects a re-
composition, iodide of mercury being formed, and little or no
permanent gas being evolved.                The products of the action of
these three metals appear to be alike, and to consist of a body
or bodies, soluble in sether, and rapidly solidifying in contact
with the air, probably owing to the absorption of oxygen. These
bodies have not been obtained in a state fit for analysis.
   If dry ammonia be passed over iodide of acetyle, an elevation
of temperature occurs, the ammonia being abundantly absorbed.
In the first place, two atoms of ammonia are concerned, the pro
ducts being acetylamine and iodide of ammonium, according to
the formula
              2NH3 + C4H302I = NH4I + NH2C4H802.
The iodide of ammonium, being insoluble in acetylamine, sepa
rates in the solid form.          On continuing the action of ammonia
upon   this     heterogeneous product, another atom of ammonia
engages in the reaction, the iodide of ammonium dissolves, and
a heavy, brown-coloured, oily liquid results, of spec. grav. l-52
at 19° C, which becomes colourless on standing.                    This liquid
yields up     its  third   atom  of  ammonia     even   on exposure to the air,
leaving behind acetylamine and iodide of ammonium.                      Heated
with soda-lime, according to Will and Varrentrap's method,
"2684 grm. gave a platinum salt containing -3376 grm. of pla
tinum, or the liquid contained 21-82 per cent, of ammonia.
The formula C4H302I + 3NH3 requires 23'08 per cent.
   With respect to the rational constitution of this body little
can be predicted.           If the ammonium type be preserved, as is
probable,    it may     be represented by the self-explicatory       scheme, —

        XXII.    On the Preparation    of the Double jEthers.
                     By Freoerick Guthrie*.
BY      acting upon chloride of amyle with an alcoholic solution
        of caustic potash in a sealed tube at 100° C, M. Balard
obtained a volatile setherial liquid boiling at 112° C, which he
described as oxide of amyle.         The boiling-point induced Dr.
Williamson to regard this product as the double sether of the
composition C10Hn 0, C4II50, being, in fact, identical with
the sether he himself obtained by the action of iodide of amyle
on sethylate of potash, or of iodide of sethyle on amylate of
potash.
   The latter chemist also describes this sether as a product of
the action of sulphuric acid upon a mixture of the corresponding
alcohols.    As  I required the sether in point in rather large quan
tity, I endeavoured to form it in the last-mentioned manner;
but after modifying the process in many different ways, and em
ploying large quantities of the mixed alcohols,         I was forced to
abandon it ; for although the product had the characteristic smell
of double aether, yet    I was unable to deduce a liquid of fixed
boiling-point.     The cause of this appears to lie in the fact, that
the minimum temperature sufficient for the setherification of the
sethylic alcohol effects a more profound decomposition of the
amylic alcohol, amylene or even sulphurous acid being formed.
   The experiment of M. Balard therefore naturally presented
itself as suggesting a possible and, if possible, economical
method of attaining my object.        The following modification of
it was found to answer very satisfactorily.
   A retort connected with an inverted and well-cooled condenser
was half-filled with amylic alcohol.      Into this about two equiva
lents of very finely-powdered caustic potash were introduced in
small quantities at a time, and the whole boiled for half an hour.
To the contents of the retort, which became solid on cooling, an
equivalent of iodide of sethyle was added gradually through a

funnel-tube.      Double decomposition at once began ; heat was
evolved, the contents of the retort becoming liquid and boiling.
The action was allowed to go on by itself for two or three hours,
but was then assisted by the heat of a water-bath.              After some
hours' digestion the contents of the retort ceased to boil. The
clear liquid was then decanted from the iodide of potassium and
excess of caustic potash and rectified.
    The rapidity with which the boiling-point rises from 100° to
 110° C, its constancy at and about that point, and the stnall-
ness of the residue having a higher boiling-point, were evidences
of the completeness of the reaction.            In fact, after six rectifica
tions the weight of the double aether obtained was two-thirds of
that of the amylic alcohol employed.             It boiled at 111°, 112°,
 113°  C,   and gave on analysis (mean of two),

    In the above process the excess of caustic potash combines                  ¦
with the water arising from the separation of the amylic aether
 from the amylic alcohol, so that no water appears in the free

  "There can be little doubt that analogous recompositions occur
 between the iodides of the other radicals and the solutions of
 potash in the several alcohols ; the chief point to be attended to
 being, of course, such selection of the two that the boiling-point
 of the product shall differ as widely as possible from those of the
 iodide and alcohol employed.          The advantage of this mode of
 preparation consists wholly in dispensing with metallic potassium
 or sodium, metals which of course entirely lose value as soon
 as oxidized.
    It is clear that all such bodies may be regarded in three ways :
 as double aethers, as single aethers, or as alcohols, according to
 the general formulae

    The action of pentiodide of phosphorus upon a member of this
 class seemed to promise to throw light upon the above question.
Accordingly an ounce of the aethylate of amyle, prepared as above,

   188        Mr. G. P. Scrope     on the Formation of Craters,
   was subjected to the action of 2| ounces of iodine in presence of
  an excess of phosphorus, as in the preparation of iodide of jethyle.
   Reaction ensued, and the decanted liquid gave a distillate which
  was heavier than water ; but on redistilling, this distillate showed
  no fixed boiling-point ; and on rectification, two liquids were iso
  lated, having the respective boiling-points and all the properties
  of iodide of aethyle and iodide of amyle.        Now, according to the

 XXIII.     On   the  Formation of Craters, and the Nature of the
     Liquidity of  Lavas.     By G. Poulett Scrope, Esq., M.P.,
     F.R.S., F.G.S.
                          [Concluded from p. 142.]
II. rl1HE      Nature of the Liquidity of Lavas. — So much for that
            branch of my subject, — the formation of cones and
 craters.   I  wish now to ask attention to some circumstances
 respecting the mode of emission and nature of the lavas that
proceed from them.         I have already spoken of the comparatively
tranquil   manner    in which   some lava-streams are seen to well out
from the flank of a volcano, or its summit, and the probability
 that differences in the liquidity or viscosity of the heated matter
 at the time of its efflux may occasion corresponding differences
in the character of the phenomena. Observation confirms this
expectation ; and it has been remarked, that the very liquid and
vitrified lavas, such as those of Kilaueaand Bourbon, are poured
6ut more or less tranquilly without any very violent explosions,
their imprisoned vapours evidently escaping with comparative
ease, while the more viscous and ultimately stony lavas, possess
ing a minor degree of liquidity, and consequently not allowing
so easy a passage to the vapours that rise through, and struggle
to escape from them, are protruded with fiercer explosive bursts,
and the ejection of far greater quantities of scoria and other
fragmentary matters.
    This observation, coupled with other reasons to which I shall
presently advert, led me to an opinion expressed in the works pre
viously referred to, that the ordinary crystalline or granular lavas
(making exception of the vitreous varieties), although at a white
heat at the moment of their emission from a volcanic vent, are

           and the Nature        of   the   Liquidity of Lavas.                   189
not in a state of complete fusion; that a large proportion at
least, if not all, of the crystalline or granular particles of which,
when cooled and consolidated, they appear composed, are already
formed and solid, their mobility being aided by the intimate
dissemination     through the mass of a minute but appreciable
quantity of some fluid, — in all probability water, — which is pre
vented from expanding wholly into vapour by the pressure to
which it is subjected while within the volcanic vent, or in the
interior of the current, until that pressure is sufficiently reduced
 to allow of its expansion in bubbles, or its escape through pores
 or cracks, by which it passes into the open air from the surface
 of the intumescent lava.
   I   was strengthened in this opinion by several concurrent con
 siderations : —
     1. If all lavas are (as they are usually supposed to be) in a
 state of complete fusion when they issue from a volcano, how is
 it that they do not all present the same glassy texture which is
 seen in some, the obsidians, the pitchstones,          and pumiceous
 lavas especially, and in the ropy, cavernous, filamentous basalts
 of Kilauea, Iceland and Bourbon, and which these very crystal
 line and stony lavas themselves put on when melted under the
 blowpipe or in a furnace ? The usual answer                  is,
                                                           that the gra
  nular and crystalline texture      acquired subsequently to emission
                                       is
 by   slow cooling  ;  and  the experiments of Gregory Watt and Sir
  James Hall are cited in support of this assertion.        In the present
 day, probably the process            by
                                    which Messrs. Chance and Co. of
 Birmingham, devitrify       a mass of fused basalt (from the Rowley
 rag, near Dudley)      by causing     to cool slowly in an " annealing
                                        it
  furnace," would be considered as         strong confirmatory fact.
                                              a
     But there is   no fact more certain than this, that the superficial
  portions at least of lava-current flowing in the open air do not
                        a
  cool slowly.     On the contrary, they are rapidly,           might say
                                                                    I
  instantaneously,    upon their exposure, consolidated and cooled
  down to a    temperature which permits them to be handled and
  even walked upon without damage.             How        that this scori-
                                                         is   it
  form crust, or   the  solid cakes  and  slabs which  so  instantly form
   upon every exposed surface of lava, nay, even the scoriae which
  are tossed up in  a   liquid state by the eruptive jets, and harden
  while yet in the air before they fall, exhibit on fracture no glassy
  texture, but much the same earthy or stony grain, and occasion
  ally crystals of considerable size in the solid matter separating
  their cellular cavities, as     found in the interior of the current
                                 is
   which is   known to have cooled very slowly            How
                                                           ?           that
                                                                        is   it
   some lava-currents are stony throughout, others vitreous through
   out, as, for example, some of the large pumice-streams of Lipari,
   Iceland, and the Andes    ?

 190        Mr. 6. P. Scrope    on the Formation of Craters,
     I have recently visited the manufactory of Messrs. Chance and
 Co., at Oldbury, near Birmingham, for the purpose of examining
 the mode in which the basalt used there (and which is the same
 upon which Mr. Gregory Watt experimented) conducts itself in
 their furnaces, and    I found that when the liquid and fused con
 tents of a furnace at a white heat are poured out upon a brick or
 other floor into the open air, so as to represent a stream of lava
 flowing out of a volcanic vent, the mass consolidates throughout,
 whatever its bulk, into a homogeneous and purely vitreous black
 obsidian, in fact an absolute glass, with a conchoidal fracture
 and sharp cutting edges.       It is only when made to consolidate
 very slowly in an oven kept at a high temperature for some days,
 that it assumes the deadened and semi-crystalline texture of the
 manufactured article.
     If this process be interrupted, it is found to have commenced
 by the formation, at numerous points within the vitreous mass,
 of globular concretions about the size of a small pea, of a lighter
 colour than the base, and having a pearly lustre and radiated
 structure.     The multiplication and confusion of these crystallites
 or sphserulites ultimately destroy the glassy character of the sub
 stance altogether, and give to it a pearly semi-crystalline texture,
 without, however, restoring the far more crystalline aspect of the
 basaltic rock.     A similar change may be often observed to have
 taken place in nature among the vitreous lavas, which pass into
 pearlstone and pitchstone by the formation of the same kind of
 sphserulitic concretions, and of course there is no question as to
 the complete state of fusion in which such lavas have been pro
 duced.     But there is no trace of such a process in any of the
 ordinary earthy, and stony or crystalline and porphyritic lavas.
 I  am not aware of a single current from either Etna or Vesuvius
 having ever exhibited, even on its most rapidly cooled surfaces,
 any passage into true obsidian, or sphserulitic pearlstone, or any
 portion of such vitrifactions.       A pellicle or glaze of a semi-
 vitreous appearance coats the surface in some parts, or lines the
 cellular cavities ; but it seems evident that the bulk of the matter
could not have been at the time of its emission in that thoroughly
fused condition which it assumes when melted in a furnace or
 under the blowpipe.
    2. It struck me that temperature does not alone determine
the fusion or liquefaction of substances ; and that compression
may prevent the liquefaction of a solid at a high temperature,
just as it prevents the vaporization of a liquid, in the common
experiment of boiling water at a lower temperature in a rarefied
atmosphere.       If so, the intense pressure to which heated lava
must be subjected before it rises from the bowels of the earth to
discharge itself on the surface, intensified by the reaction of its

              and the Nature  of  the  Liquidity of Lavas,          191
own expansive force from the confining surfaces, might perhaps
prevent its complete fusion, however high the temperature.
    3. I had long been impressed by the vast volumes of aqueous
and other elastic vapours evidently discharged from every volcano
in eruption, and to all appearance the chief agents in the expul
sion of lavas from the bowels of the earth.        That this vapour is
liable to be developed in every part of the mass of lava is shown
by the formation of vesicles throughout its substance wherever
the pressure is so reduced as to permit their expansion ; for
instance, in the superficial portions of a current, and in some
lava-currents throughout the entire mass.
    The experiments of Mr. Knox, related in a paper read before
the Royal Society in 1824*, had taught me that water in an
appreciable quantity is mechanically combined with the elemen
tary particles of all the crystalline rocks of igneous origin. The
questions therefore arose, — Might not the water thus intimately
disseminated through a mass of crystalline lava, although at an
intense temperature, remain unvaporized,           owing to the still
greater intensity   of the pressure by    which  it  is confined while
yet within the bowels      of the   earth ? And   would   it not, under
these circumstances, exert an intense expansive force upon all the
confining molecular or crystalline surfaces between which it lies,
and thus occasion a tendency to separation among these solid
particles whenever the compressing forces were relaxed, or the
 temperature increased sufficiently, so as to give a certain degree
 of mobility to these particles inter se, and an imperfect liquidity
to the mass composed of them ? And, supposing the intumes
 cence thus occasioned to raise any portion of this semi-liquid
 matter into the open air, would not the instantaneous absorption
 of caloric from the contiguous particles that must accompany the
 vaporization of this water, and its escape in bubbles or pores and
 through cracks, owing to the nearly absolute cessation of pres
 sure, account for the sudden cooling down and setting, or con
 solidation, of the exposed surfaces, without having undergone
 complete fusion (except in the case of mere superficial films),
 notwithstanding their previous intense temperature, amounting
 even to a white heat ?
    This supposition seemed to me to account satisfactorily, not
 only for the absence of a vitreous texture even in superficial por
 tions of many lava-streams, and their instantaneous consolida
 tion on exposure, in cellular or porous slabs and cakes, but also
 for several other characteristics of igneous rocks, not easily to be
 reconciled with the idea of their having always issued from the
 earth in a state of absolute fusion ; such, for example, as the
 cracked and vitrified aspect of the felspar-crystals of many tra-
                           * Phil. Trans. 1825.

than at its source, the brecciated lavas which appear to have
enveloped fragments in great number of the same material with
out any fusion even of their finest angles.          So also might be
explained the more or less spongy, porous, and loosely crystal
line texture of many trachytes, and their disposition in thick
beds or dome-shaped bosses, attesting their protrusion in          veiya
imperfect state of liquidity, more resembling the intumescence
of some kinds of dough in an oven than the fusion of metal in
a  furnace.
    And here let me remark, that Dr. Daubeny, and some other
writers on volcanic phenomena, have spoken of the vesicles or
air-bladders in lavas, as being proofs of their having been in             a
state of complete fusion.        But have the loaves baked in our
ovens been in fusion     ?  The comparison of cellular scoria with
                                                     a
a loaf or   a French roll will show that vesicles of precisely similar
appearance to those of lavas are producible in substances of               a
pasty consistence, which owe their liquidity to an aqueous vehicle,
the heat applied being only sufficient to develope the contained
gases.     Other kinds of baked cakes are porous rather than cel
lular, and aptly represent the texture of the earthy and porous
trachytic lavas.
    Plutonic Rocks. —This theory as to the nature of the liquidity
of many lavas appeared to me so reasonable, that         Iproceeded to
examine its applicability to the still more generally crystalline
plutonic rocks, from the alteration of which             by
                                                        heat lavas are
usually   supposed   to  derive.   I asked   myself, what   would pro
bably   be  the effect on    mass
                             a    of  granite, for example, containing
water intimately combined with its molecular particles, and con
fined beneath overlying rocks and seas, under circumstances of
intense compression, and at the same time high and increasing
temperature      ?Surely tendency to intumescence, which, wherer
                          a
ever, and in proportion to the extent to which             takes place,
                                                              it
must elevate and fracture the overlying rocks, and likewise dis
integrate more or less the crystalline particles of the swelling
mass, through the irregularities of their internal movements and
mutual friction.       Many of the crevices broken through the
neighbouring rocks would be injected            by
                                                the intumescent mat
ter.    Some may be sufficiently enlarged to allow of its forcing
its way into the open air as        a lava, perhaps accompanied            by
eructations of the gases and vapours developed in the lower parts
of the mass or, should the liquefaction not be sufficient to admit

 of the rise of aeriform bubbles, as matter of a porous, pasty, or
 glutinous consistency, perhaps even semi-solid in texture and
 bulky in form.
    It might happen that, circumstances occasioning in turn the
 preponderance of the compressing over the expansive forces (by
 reason, for example, of a diminution of temperature), portions of
 the subterranean crystalline mass will, after a partial intumes
 cence of the kind supposed, return to a state of solidity.             The
 result may be a more fine-grained rock, owing to the partial dis
 integration of the crystals; or, if the disintegration had pro
 ceeded sufficiently far, new mineral combinations might take
 place.   Indeed, Watt long since proved that the particles of
 even apparently solid rocks are capable, through changes in
 temperature, of internal motion sufficient to admit their re
 arrangement according to polarity, that      is, of crystallization. Still
 more likely  is this result to occur on the condensation or escape
 of any fluid which had previously kept them from contact with
 each other, since the crystalline polarity can only exert itself
 within minute distances.       And thus might be accounted for
 the frequently observed passages of granite and gneiss into
 syenite, greenstone, trap, or trachyte, and the varieties of mineral
 composition which these rocks at times exemplify.             So also the
 transitions from the larger crystalline grain to the finer, and the
 dykes and veins which these rocks so often contain themselves,
or intrude into their neighbours.         So, too, the finer grain of the
sides or selvages of such dykes might be owing to the greater
disintegration of the crystals      byfriction along these sides as the
 matter -was driven through them.
    Another problematical fact which this theory of an aqueous
vehicle in heated granite would account for,         is the usual appear
ance of the quartz in this rock, not in crystals, but as      a    paste or
base, seeming to be moulded upon the crystals of felspar.              Had
the rock crystallized from      state
                                a        of  fusion,  the  felspar, being
far more fusible than quartz, might have been expected to be
the last, not the first, to crystallize.     But    ifthe water dissemi
nated through the rock were supposed to have taken the quartz
into solution   by aid of the alkalies present in the felspar, the
fluid vehicle would in fact become liquid or gelatinous silicate
                                         a                              ;
and upon consolidation would naturally mould itself on the fel
spar crystals, or appear as       paste to them.

proofs that heated water under such circumstances could dissolve
silex.

194         Mr. G. P. Scrope       on the   Formation of Craters,
forth, perhaps at too great length, and in a form which may
have hindered their obtaining at the time of their publication
the attention which I believe they merited.
    Certain it   is, that they were at that time, now thirty years
back, neglected or generally discredited.             was told that my
                                                          I
views were " unchemical."          I was represented as asserting in
candescent lava to be "cold or thereabouts*."               The igneous
and the aqueous origin       of certain rocks had been so hotly con
tested, and fire and water were usually considered so antagonistic,
that  it  seemed at first view an absurdity to imagine that both
could be combined in         a substance seemingly in fusion.       Pro
bably   also the  idea  was  scouted   at first  through the notion that
water could not be present within an incandescent mass of lava
without causing    it  to explode like mine a      which might of course
                                                     ;
be the result of any considerable body of water being localized
at one point.      But the view entertained, as has been explained,
                                   I
was that the water (and to some extent, perhaps, liquefied gases),
to which    I attributed much of the liquidity of some lavas, was
disseminated throughout its mass, occupying minute interstices,
and in intimate, though probably mechanical, combination with
every molecule, —indeed intercalated between the plates even of
its solid crystals ;   and moreover that the pressure to which the
rock was subjected while beneath the earth was so enormous, as
to prevent the vaporization of these minute portions of liquid
anywhere except at points where the intensity of temperature,
and consequently        of  expansive force, overcame the resisting
forces, and thereby caused either the formation and rise of great
bubbles of vapour from the lower depths of the subterranean
lava-mass, or the inflation of minor bubbles and pores through
out   it, or at least in the superficial portions which             by
                                                                   intu
mescence were forced into the open air.
    Of late, however, views precisely in accordance with the theory
printed by me in 1824 have been put forward, and have attained
extensive adhesion among continental geologists.
    M. Delesse has proved          byexperiment the solubility of the
silex of rocks in heated water containing either of the mineral
alkalies.    And, indeed, the manufacture of artificial stone now    is
carried on in this country (Messrs. Ransome's process)              by
                                                                   satu
rating loose sand with an artificial hydrate of silica.            Huge
blocks of flint,I     understand, are thrown into the hot alkaline
water, and melt down like so much sugar.
    Again, the experiments of Boutigny have shown that water at
a  white heat remains unvaporized, in the form of spheroidal
globules, in which form       it   obvious how readily
                                   is                        would com

entangled ; and how (according to these experiments) it might
flash into bubbles of vapour on the reduction of its temperature
 by exposure to the air.
     M. Deville, in his recent observations on the vapours disen
 gaged from Vesuvius since the eruption of May in last year (for
the perusal of which        I
                          am indebted to the kindness of my friend
Dr. Daubeny), arrived at the conclusion, to use his own words,
 that " water in the proportion occasionally of 999 per mille must
have formed an integral part of the Vesuvian lava at the moment
of its emission ; and, consequently, that in the interior of the
incandescent lava there is such an arrangement of molecules as
to permit the gaseous and volatile matters to remain there im
 prisoned until, in the progress of cooling and consolidation, they
 evolve themselves."
    Above all, M. Scheerer of Christiania, the eminent Norwegian
geologist, who is better acquainted perhaps than any other with
the granites of that country, published in 1847 a theory, which,
he says, his observations had suggested to him in 1833, on the
production of granite, entirely identical with that which had            I
ventured to suggest in 1824-25.       I take the following account
of it from the paper read before the Geological Society of France
in 1847, and published in the fourth volume of the Bulletin de
 la Soc. Geol. p. 468.
     M. Scheerer attributes what he calls the " plasticity" of gra
nite when protruded on or towards the surface of the earth (a
condition evidenced by the veins it throws into the fissures of
 neighbouring rocks) to the combined action of water and heat.
 He describes the water as " intercalated between the solid atoms
of the crystalline and other constituent minerals, endeavouring
to escape by its tendency to vaporization, and consequent elas
ticity, but unable to do so owing to the pressure to which the
enclosing mass is subject."     He considers the water so contained
in granite to be "primitive;" that            is,
                                          one of the original bases
of the rock, and not the result of infiltration.   He attributes to
it  the solution of the quartz, aided         by
                                          the alkali, and the con
sequent moulding of this mineral on the felspar-crystals.        He
even goes the length of styling the condition of granite before
its protrusion       the term " une bouillie aqueuse,"
                     by                                     granitica
 broth.
    These theoretical opinions of M. Scheerer appear to have
received the assent of M. Elie de Beaumont and other French
geologists*.     Their exact conformity with those which were first
developed   in my treatise on Volcanoes, published in 1824-25,
and repeated in the Preface to my volume on Central France in
         See Bulletin de la Soc. Gtol. France, new series, vol. iv. p. 1312.

196      Mr. G. P. Scrope    on the Formation   of Craters,
1826-27, will be evident to any one who will take the trouble
to refer to those works.
   It is not, however, for the vain purpose of claiming a priority
in these views that     I
                        now ask the attention of the Society to
them, but because the subject has not,   I think, yet attained the
consideration it deserves from the geologists of this country ;
and especially because of its leading, if followed out, to further
inferences of considerable importance, which were likewise sug
gested by me in 1825, but have been hitherto only partially
pursued to their legitimate consequences.
   Laminated or schistose rocks, slaty cleavage, and folded rocks. —
I refer to the mechanical changes in the texture and structure
of the plutonic rocks which could not fail to have resulted from
the mutual friction of the component crystalline particles attend
ant on their internal movements, whether caused by mere dila
tation and recompression in place, or by a shifting of the entire
mass in any direction, under intense and opposite, but irregular
pressures.
  I  was led to reflect on this by observation of the ribboned
pitchstones of Ponza and Ischia, in which, while in a state of
vitreous fusion, crystallites had formed (just like those of the
Oldbury obsidian), and subsequently been broken up by the
movement of the semi-liquid mass, and drawn out into long
stripes, giving a ribboned appearance to the rock.
   Further examination proved to me that the ribboned trachytes
of Pouza and Ischia, and some ribboned clinkstones, owed that
character to a similar elongation of the felspar crystals and fels-
pathic particles which they previously contained, in the direction
in which the semi-liquid mass flowed, or rather was forced to
move, and in which the pores or cells, when there are any, are
equally elongated.     These observations suggested to my mind
the reflection, that the solid particles of any crystalline rock
which is put in motion while in a state of imperfect solidity, and
under the influence of opposing pressures, must be subject to a
great amount of mutual friction or disturbance, by which their
final arrangement when wholly consolidated will be determined.
    Thus, suppose a mass of granite, of which A B (fig. 4) repre
sents the section, consisting of crystals of felspar and mica irre
gularly disposed in a basis of more or less liquefied or gelatinous
silex, exposed to movement in the direction A B, while under
vast pressure both from above and below, that      C is,
                                                       in the oppo
site directionsC   and I).   Whether the surface      or D, or both,
remained fixed, or merely moved, owing to resistances, at         a
slower rate than the other parts, the crystals in the latter would
be turned round    by internal friction, and rearranged and drawn
out in stripes or planes in the direction of the motion, while the

             and the Nature    of the Liquidity of Lavas.       197
proportionate dimensions      of the mass would be equally varied so
as to produce    a section   something like E, F, 6, H (fig. 5) ; in
      Kg.   4.                                  Fig.   5.
fact, a rock which, if no further change occurred in it except
consolidation    in place, would have all the characteristics of
gneiss.   The same movement, if still further continued, might,
it appeared to me, be expected to disintegrate the angular cry
stals of felspar altogether, so as to cause them to disappear,
perhaps to force their elementary molecules to melt into the in
tensely heated silicate, to which they would impart their alkalies.
And the" resulting rock, supposing the lamina? of the mica-
crystals to slide readily past each other, when lubricated by the
silicate, and not therefore to be so far disintegrated as those of
felspar (as from their peculiar form might be expected), would put
on a lamellar structure, and very much resemble mica-schist, —
especially since the great flexibility of the mica would render its
lamina; extremely liable to yield to the irregularities of pressure
pervading the mass in a variety of directions, and consequently
to take such wavings and contortions as are often exemplified in
that rock. Whoever will examine the tortuous way in which
the plates of mica envelope and bend round nodules of half-
melted quartz or crystals of garnet in mica-schist, will be con
vinced, I   think, that the whole mass has been subjected to great
internal movement and consequent friction in the direction of
the layers of mica, while under intense pressure, and in a com
paratively softened state, the mica being lubricated, as it were,
by a vehicle of liquid or gelatinous quartz. Whatever fissures or
cracks were formed during this movement in the semi- solid rock,
or subsequently, so long as the silicate remained unconsolidated,
would be necessarily filled by      it,
                                     and ultimately appear in the
shape of the quartz-veins so frequent in this class of rocks.
    Under this supposition, gneiss and mica-sclftst would bear the
same relation to granite as the ribboned trachytes and schistose
lavas (clinkstone) to ordinary crystallized or granular trachyte  ;
and the quartz-rocks associated with granite represent the quartz-
ose trachytes of Hungary, Fonza, and the Andes.
    These views, developed     byme       in
                                        1825,  I  cannot but think

 198       Mr. G. P. Scrope     on the  Formation of Craters,
 deserve the attention of geologists engaged in investigating the
 origin of the so-called
                           " plutonic " and " metamorphic " rocks-
 It seems to me more probable that some process of this kind
 may have metamorphosed granite into the laminated rocks of
 plutonic origin, gneiss and mica-schist, than that these rocks
 should have been formed by the mere fusion and reconsolidation
 or crystallization in place of sedimentary strata already laminated,
 according to the usual
                           " metamorphic " doctrine.       I can under
 stand the clay-slates and other fine-grained schists to have been
 formed through the mechanical disintegration of mica-schist, but
 not mica-schist by the baking or melting and cooling of the clay-
 slates in place, in the manner suggested by Sir C. Lyell.
    In the formation of the clay-slates, perhaps, the action of heat
 was not concerned (except as engendering the pressure to which
 they have evidently been subjected), but that of water or an
 aqueous silicate only.      Still in their case also internal move
 ments and mutual friction of the component particles under
 extreme and irregular opposing pressures have,        I am convinced,
 had a primary influence in occasioning that parallel arrangement
 of the scaly and flaky micaceous particles to which their slaty
 cleavage is due.     This, at least, was the conviction forced upon
my mind by a close examination of the fissile clinkstone of the
 Mont Dor and Mezen, which is used for roofing-slate, and is in
its lamination and cleavage undistinguishable from many clay-
 slates.   And that opinion    I  recorded at the time in my ' Consi
 derations on Volcanoes*/
    I have since found this view of the origin of slaty cleavage
                                               ' On Volcanic
 supported by Mr. Darwin in his work                           Islands,'
and by Mr. Sorby in his paper on slaty cleavage in the Edin
burgh Philosophical Journal for 1853.         I  need not say that such
 support affords strong confirmation of its correctness.
    Of course we are led to connect the movements under extreme
pressure, to which this peculiar texture of the laminated rocks
is here attributed, with the action of those same forces by which
their beds have been so generally bent and contorted into a
 series of folds or wrinkles, more or less at right angles to the
general strike.
    If we seek to discover under what circumstances these flexures
were brought about, we can hardly be wrong in ascribing them
to the same violent process by which they have been elevated,
usually on the flanks of some protruded ridge or enormous dyke
of crystalline rock, which is seen to form the axis of the moun
tain range to which they belong.
    Now what may we suppose to have been the character of this
elevatory process   ?
                      * See pp. 103, 144 and 202.

            and the Nature   of the Liquidity of Lavas.           199
    The phenomena of active volcanoes, and the protrusion of in-
tumescent crystalline matter on so many points of the earth's
 surface, and af all periods of its history, may be admitted to
 prove the continued existence beneath a very large area of that
 surface — if not the whole — of a mass of intensely heated crystal
 line matter, having disseminated throughout its substance (in
 the manner already dwelt upon) some fluid or fluids, such as
 water, affording an imperfect liquidity to the mass, and, by its
intense elastic force, communicating to it a powerful tendency to
 expansion.    Now suppose any considerable diminution to occur
locally in the amount of pressure confining this expansible mass
beneath the crust of the globe, — such as might be brought about
by any extraordinary      concurrence of the ordinary barometric,
 tidal, oceanic, or excavating causes (not to suggest others), — or,
 on the other hand, any considerable increase of its expansive
tendency, owing to a local increase of temperature, from some
 unknown, but easily imagined, cause, — we should anticipate, as
the necessary result, the violent fracture and elevation of the
overlying crust of rocks, and the extrusion through some prin
cipal fissure, or line of fracture, of a ridge of the subterranean
intumescent crystalline matter.
    It seems very probable that under such circumstances the cen
tral axis of the protruded ridge may retain its irregularly crystal
line grain and structure, but that the portions of crystalline
matter that from either side would rush or be thrust up by
pressure from behind (consisting partly of the weight of the
overlying rocks on the semi-liquid matter below them) towards
the opening should be subjected to so much internal friction of
their crystalline particles, and so much pressure at right angles,
or nearly so, to the direction of the movement, as must stretch
and draw them out into parallel planes, —just as happened evi
dently to the striped and ribboned trachytes in the protruded
dykes of Ponza and Palmarola.           This friction and pressure
would be extreme, of course, along the lateral parts of the pro
truded mass, that   is, the selvages of the great dyke ;   which,  if
the original mass were granite, would thus appear composed of
an axis of granite, passing on either side into gneiss (or squeezed
granite) and further on into mica-schist.
    But every irregularity, whether on the large or the small scale,
obstructing more or less the even motion of the layers, must
createa   waving or contortion in them, especially in the planes
of slippery mica-plates, such as    is   exemplified even in hand-
specimens of the Ponza trachytes, and also on the largest scale
in the same locality. And the extreme irregularities of motion,
occasioned on the upper layers of the intumescent mass       by  the
pressure and resistance of the overlying beds, may be expected

 200        Mr. G. P. Scrope    on the Formation of Craters,
 to carry their wavings still further, and at the throat of the
 fissure, where the squeeze and jam of the protruded matters
 must be at its maximum, to occasion those enormous and repeated
 zigzag foldings of the laminated beds, so frequently observed in
 mica- and chlorite-schists in such positions.
     Meantime another influence would be similarly affecting the
 overlying stratified rocks above, or on the outer flanks of the
 elevated axis, namely their own specific gravity, urging them to
 slide or slip laterally when tilted up at (perhaps) a considerable
angle on either side.      The more compact and indurated strata
 would be partly fractured into cliffy masses, partly broken up
into breccias and conglomerates by this movement ; but the
 softer beds, especially those which were saturated with water
 (perhaps even yet under the sea), or which contained interstra-
tified beds of silt, shale or clay, permeated with water, would
 glide laterally away from the axis in extensive laudslips, and be
wrinkled up into vast foldings under the intense pressure com
pounded of their own weight, and that perhaps of portions of the
protruded matter thrust against them, — in a manner very similar
to the contortions produced in the more crystalline laminated
rocks by the violent squeeze which accompanied their protrusion.
It may even be difficult to draw a line between the effects of
these two replicating and fracturing forces.       But, together, they
seem to me sufficient to account for most of the phenomena of
the kind observable in mountain-chains.
    These were the ideas on this subject which       I  endeavoured to
develope, though very imperfectly      I am   aware, in  the more theo
retic portion of my work on volcanoes, so often referred to, and
they were illustrated by a rude ideal section of an elevated
mountain-chain in the frontispiece to the volume.           I still think
they   will be found   a not improbable  solution  of  this the  greatest
problem in the dynamics of geology.         It appears to me that the
results would be much the same, whether we suppose this eleva-
tory action to have been paroxysmal and simultaneous or gradual,
taking place by minor and successive expansive throes or shocks,
or even still more slowly in the manner of a creep, as Sir Charles
Lyell would probably conceive it to have operated, and to be
still continuing.     On these last assumptions, the earthquake-
shocks which certainly accompany at present every effort of
elevation, and appear to be propagated in waves through the
substance of the earth's crust, in directions usually at right
angles to the principal axes of elevation, or fissures of crystal
line protrusion, may indicate the force by which the extreme
replications and slaty cleavage of the laminated beds are occa
sioned.

              and the Nature       of the   Liquidity of Lavas.           201
    I  would ask of geologists to consider whether such a mode of
protrusion of the laminated crystalline rocks, and of the lateral
replication of the more earthy schists and marine strata, as is
here suggested, does not accord with the general facts known
respecting their position ? Let me take two clescriptions of the
general position of the crystalline rocks from two writers of ex
perience, judgement, and wholly impartial character, as respects
the theory here indicated.            Mr. Evan Hopkins* gives as the
results of his extensive mining experience in the Andes and else
          " that the great base
where,                                   [of all mountain-chains] is below
more or less granitic, strongly saturated with mineral waters,
and that this passes upwards by insensible gradations from a
crystalline homogeneous compound into a laminated rock, such
as gneiss, and still higher up into schists in vertical planes ; the
peculiar varieties of the higher rocks depending on the mineral
                     '                 '
character of the parent rock below ; the schistose rocks form
ing, in short, the external terminations of the great universal
crystalline base," — that is to say (as I would phrase it), the
squeezed out, and therefore laminated, upper and lateral portions
of the inferior crystalline mass.
    Mr. Ruskin, in his recently published volume, having closely
examined the structure of the Alps with the eye of a geologist
no less than of a painter, but certainly without any theory to
support, declares that the central axes of
                                                    " irregular crystallines "
 (as he calls the granitic rocks) uniformly graduate on either side
into the foliated or "slaty crystallines," i. e. into gneiss and
ultimately mica- and chlorite-schists.
     One point observed in the structure of the Alps and many
 other mountain-chains        I  may notice before        I conclude, namely
 the occasional dip of the elevated strata towards the central axis
 of extruded crystalline rock, producing a synclinal instead of an
 anticlinal ridge. Another section copied loosely in the frontis
 piece to my work on volcanoes, from Von Buch's paper on the
 Tyrol, may show the mode in which                  I  conceive this to have
 occurred through the injection of a mass of crystalline matter
 into a wedge-shaped fissure, opening downwards ; such as must
 have frequently occurred among the fractures of the overlying
 strata — giving occasion in some cases to the further rise of the
 heated and intumescent matter into the hollow between the outer
 slopes of the synclinal valley.           It would indeed accord with the
theory suggested       above,   if  such    dykes or extravasations at syn
 clinal axes were found    to  alternate     frequently with the elevated an
 ticlinal axes, for the cracks formed in indurated beds of Overlying

rock would very frequently open alternately         upwards and down
wards*.
   Time will not allow of my dwelling now upon other points
explanatory of geological problems, which are afforded by the
theory of an expansive subterranean crystalline mass preserved
by external pressure in a more or less solid condition beneath
the crust of the globe, but always ready to expand and perhaps
to intumesce upwards on any relaxation occurring in the over
lying pressure.     But    I suggest it now, as      I did thirty years
since, as the  solution   most  reconcileable   with the  known facts of
the structure and relative position of the great elevated rock-
formations of the globe, and as a theory founded, not upon mere
guess-work, but on careful and extended observation of the phae-
nomena of both active and extinct volcanoes, and the disposition
of volcanic products of all ages.

                       I.   The Action   of Lead.
          solvent   action of water on lead is a subject of special
THEimportance,        and one that has attracted the attention of
many of the most able chemists of the day.
   To determine by analysis whether or not a particular water
will become impregnated with lead when placed in contact with
that metal, is a question of high scientific interest, and one affect
ing the health of every civilized community. This question has
occupied my attention for several years, and with the view of
elucidating it still further I have undertaken a series of experi
ments, the result of which1 will be communicated in the following
   On referring to the opinions of the distinguished chemists
who have investigated this subject, many discrepancies are ob
served.    Some consider the action of water on lead to be due to
the softness of the water, and absence of any considerable quan
tity of earthy salts ; some attribute it to free carbonic acid ;
others to oxygen dissolved in the water ; whilst some conjeeture
it to be due to the presence of nitric acid, which is one of the
products resulting from the oxidation of organic matter contain
ing nitrogen.

         and the Constituents of Well- and River-waters.        203
Don, from the former of which the supply for the city of Aber
deen is obtained, states that he found in various samples of
the Dee water, which had passed through leaden pipes and had
 been stored in leaden cisterns, quantities of lead varying from
-j-^dth to ^th of a grain per gallon, the quantity rapidly increa
 sing with the time the water remained in contact with the lead.
.   With the view of ascertaining the cause of the Dee water pos
 sessing such an energetic action on lead, Dr. Smith performed a
 series of experiments on the action of this water upon bright and
 on tarnished surfaces of lead.    He found the quantity of lead
 dissolved varied from T^sdth to £th of a grain per gallon ; and
he observed that tarnished surfaces of lead were more readily
 acted upon than those which were perfectly bright.        The con
clusions arrived at by Dr. Smith are, —
    "1st. That the action of water on lead is dependent on the
deration of the water; since in rainy weather, when the Dee
water is coloured and contains but little air, the quantity of lead
it dissolves is less than when the water is bright and well
aerated.
    " 2ndly.   That the water at all times acts more strongly upon
old and tarnished lead than it does upon bright surfaces of the
metal."

with some observations on their action upon Lead," was published
in 1852.    The author was led to examine a sample of water from
 a well near the old church of Highgate, in consequence of the
powerful action of the water on leaden pipes and cisterns, and
also from the large amount of solid matter it contained.                 Of
organic  matter   there was  no  appreciable quantity,       but  the  pro
portion of nitric acid resulting from the decomposition of animal
remains was present in extraordinarily large quantities, as will
be seen from the subjoined      analysis : —

   From this analysis there appears to be the extraordinary
quantity of 38-87 grains of actual anhydrous nitric acid in each
gallon of the water !
   Another sample of water from a spring at Clapham was ana
lysed by Dr. Noad in 1848.          This water likewise acted strongly
upon lead.     A leaden cistern filled with this water was examined
at the same time, and the surface of the water was observed to
be coated with a " thick, greasy scum, which proved on exami
nation to consist almost entirely of oxide of lead." No signs of
lead could be detected in the clear water beneath the scum.
This water had the following composition : —

        and the Constituents       of Well- and River-waters.
    Here we have an instance of a water containing a large quan
tity of the so-called preservative salts acting strongly upon lead.
It may be remarked, that, in making the analysis of this water,
the author sought neither for nitric acid, ammonia, nor any
other oxidation product of nitrogenous organic matter, although
we may assume them to have been undoubtedly present.                      To
what,   the   author   inquires,  are  we   to ascribe   this   remarkable
action on lead ?       The reply      " to the large quantity of organic
                                       is,
matter."     It   was noticed that the corrosion of the lead occurred
chiefly  in  the  summer months, at time when the decomposition
                                                 a
of organic matter          assumed to be most active.
                          is                                   The author
explains the absence of lead      in  the  clear water,   on  the assump
tion that the carbonic acid arising on the bottom and sides
of the cistern from the decomposition of organic matter com
bines with the oxide of lead floating on the surface of the water,
and forms the carbonate which, unlike the carbonates of lime
and magnesia,        isalmost absolutely insoluble in excess of car
bonic acid.       Other examples are quoted of water containing
large quantities of sulphates and chlorides (which are supposed
to have  a   protecting influence) acting strongly on lead and in ;
every instance, except in the case of the Highgate water, the
water contained very large quantities of organic matter.            Finally,
the author found the deep well-waters of the London basin to
act upon lead    ;  and he attributes, in this case, the solvent action
to be due to the alkalinity of the waters.         Here we find, in the
papers quoted, the action of water on lead attributed, — 1st, to
the presence of nitrates       ;2ndly, to organic matter      ;3rdly, to the
 presence   of free  alkali.   Numerous    other authors,   amongst them
 Guyton Morveau, Christison, Captain Yorke, Dr. Lambe, &c,
might be quoted but as the investigations of these authors tend
                      ;
 to throw but little light on the subject,        shall, before entering
                                                     I
 into details of my own experiments, allude only to the opinions
 of the Government reporters, Professors Graham, Hofmann and
 Miller, who, at the request of Government, paid particular atten
tion to the action of waters upon lead*.
    In reply to the question, " Whether any comparative inconve
nience would arise from        asupply of soft water to the metropolis,"
 the authors remark upon the solvent action of soft waters upon
 lead as being calculated to excite alarm.              does not appear,

of which the power of acting on lead seemed to be very consider
 able.   Even river- and spring-water from the chalk strata, arti-

206       Mr. H. Medlock on     the  Reciprocal Action of Metals
ficially softened to 3 degrees of hardness, had 110 solvent effect
on lead.     Thus, then, the notion that waters containing a small
proportion of mineral matter necessarily act upon lead, seems
to have no foundation in fact.
    The conclusions resulting from many experiments arrived at
by these able investigators may be briefly mentioned.           They are
as follows : —
    1st. That certain salts, particularly sulphates, to which a
protecting effect is usually ascribed, appear not uniformly to
exercise this useful property.
    2ndly. That some salts, such as chlorides, and more particu
                                                              '
larly nitrates, may increase the solvent action of water.
    3rdly. That of all protecting agents, that of carbonate of lime
dissolved by carbonic acid is the most considerable and surest.
    The most important observation on this subject is in reference
to the extraordinary influence of a small quantity of carbonic
acid upon the lead actually in solution.       This acid seizes upon
the soluble oxide and converts it into carbonate of lead, of which
not more than ^th of a grain is soluble in a gallon of pure
water.     Even water per se free from carbonic acid, and contain
ing as much as six grains of oxide of lead in a gallon, by mere
exposure to the air for twenty-four hours was found to deposit
all its lead as insoluble carbonate, except j7th of a grain which
 still remained in solution. From this it will be seen, that
although carbonic acid does not prevent certain waters acting
upon lead, it nevertheless has the effect of precipitating the lead
 dissolved by other agencies, and so rendering it comparatively
innocuous. The authors conclude their observations on this
                                      "
subject in the following words : — The properties of water which
enable it to act at times with unusual vigour upon lead are little
understood, and seem often to arise from the accidental action of
local and very limited causes, such as the presence of decaying
leaves and other impurities."     That the conclusions of these and
other investigators are very unsatisfactory cannot be denied;
and the question, Why do some waters act on lead and others
not ? still remains unanswered.         That this is a question of
paramount importance, and one attended with unusual difficul
ties, is universally admitted ; nevertheless    I trust that the expe
riments detailed in the following pages will throw additional
light upon the subject.
    In looking at the analyses of waters which are known to act
strongly on lead, we invariably find either a large proportion of
organic matter or of its products of oxidation.       To these, as will
be presently shown,    is entirely  due the action  of such waters on
lead.
    The organic matters held in solution by water, and which

        and the Constituents  of Well- and River-waters.        207
cannot   be separated by filtration, are of two classes : one non-
nitrogenous, the other nitrogenous. The former consist of car
bon, oxygen and hydrogen, and in the natural progress of decay
are resolved into carbonic acid and water ; the other class con
tains in addition, nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus. These
elements unite in progress of time with hydrogen, and form
ammonia, sulphuretted hydrogen and phosphuretted hydrogen. The
ammonia, which is always formed in considerable quantity, is
ultimately resolved by combination with oxygen into nitrous acid
and water, according to the following equation : —
                     NH3+60=N03+3HO.
    If Thames   water, which, as is well known, contains a large
quantity of nitrogenous organic matter, be allowed to remain for
some time exposed to the air in an open vessel, the nitrogen of
the organic matter will unite first with hydrogen to form am
monia ; and this base may be readily detected by slightly acidula
ting the water with hydrochloric acid, evaporating to dryness on
a water-bath, and testing the residue with potash.      In progress
of time, however, a portion of the ammonia is resolved, accord
ing to the above equation, into nitrous acid, which unites
with an equivalent of ammonia, and may be found in the water
as nitrite of ammonia.     If to a portion of Thames water which
has been exposed for some time to the atmosphere, a little pure
potash is added and the water is then evaporated to dryness,
abundance of nitrous acid may be found in the residue by first
placing it in a flask, adding dilute sulphuric acid, and placing
in the neck of the flask a slip of paper moistened with acidulated
starch-paste and iodide of potassium.        In a few seconds the
paper   will become   intensely blue.  In warm weather this change
 takes place in a few days, and may be effected almost instan
taneously by application of heat.
    When Thames water is distilled, the complicated organic sub
stances contained in it are speedily resolved into more simple
compounds, and amongst these ammonia and nitrous acid occupy
a prominent position.       On testing the first portions of water
distilled from a 20-gallon still, it wa3 found to be decidedly acid
to test-paper.    Two gallons of this water were neutralized with
pure alcoholic potash, evaporated to dryness, and the residue
tested for nitrous acid ; the paper became blue instantly.        To
another two gallons of the same distilled water, acid to test-paper,
was added a few drops of hydrochloric acid, and the water eva
porated to dryness on a water-bath.         On testing the residue
with pure potash, abundance of ammonia was evolved.         The ex
periment was repeated on the first four gallons of water distilled
from six separate twenty gallons of Thames water, with the same

 208       Mr. H. Medlock     on the  Reciprocal Action of Metals
 results ; thus proving the existence both of ammonia and nitrous
 acid in the water distilled from Thames water.
     It has long been observed that certain specimens of distilled
 water act strongly upon lead, dissolving as much as five or six
 grains in a gallon ; and this circumstance has given rise to the
 opinion that soft waters in general cannot safely be conveyed
 through leaden pipes, or stored for consumption in leaden cis
 terns.     According, however, to the experiments of Professors
 Hofmann, Graham and Miller, neither the soft waters of the
 Surrey Hills, nor spring-water artificially softened, have the
 slightest action upon lead; although certain specimens of soft
 water, as in the case of the water of the Dee and of the Don,
 dissolve a considerable quantity of that metal.
     Having found in water distilled from Thames water a consi
 derable quantity of nitrous acid, free and in combination with
 ammonia, I was induced to study more fully the action of this
 water upon lead.       Into a gallon of this distilled water  I   placed
 a quantity of perfectly pure and bright sheet-lead, exposing a
 surface of 560 square inches.        In six hours the water became
 opake, and when      shaken  up  was  perfectly milky.    The lead was
 much acted upon, and in twenty-four hours the water was filtered,
 and the quantity of carbonate of lead left on the filter amounted
 to 6-4 grains per gallon, -g^th of a grain only remaining in solu
 tion. Six similar experiments were made with the following
 results : —

    To determine whether the action of the distilled water on lead
is due to the presence of free nitrous acid and nitrite of ammonia,
I   made the following experiments : — The 20-gallon still was
refilled, and to the water was added a few sticks of caustic
potash.       As soon as the water became warm, there was at the
end of the condenser a perceptible odour of ammonia, and the

           and the Constituents    of Well-    and River-waters.           209
first portion of water wjiich distilled over was strongly alka
line, the potash added having retained the nitrous acid and libe
rated the ammonia.           The water as it distilled became less and
less alkaline ; and after two gallons had passed over, the water
ceased to alter the colour of the most delicate red litmus-paper,
being perfectly neutral.         Six experiments with lead, similar to
the preceding, were made with this neutral water, and in neither
instance was the lead acted upon, nor was a trace of lead to be
 found in solution.
     Having proved, by the preceding experiments, that the solvent
action of distilled water upon lead is due entirely to the presence
of nitrous acid, either free or combined with ammonia, and that
water deprived of this acid has no action upon lead, as this ap
peared to afford a key to the difficult question regarding the
 solvent action of waters on lead in general, I instituted a number
 of additional experiments.
     Nitrous acid, as is well known, forms four different combina
 tions with oxide of lead : —
             Neutral monobasic nitrite          .   .   PbO, NO8
                                        ....
              Bibasic nitrite                         2PbO, NO3
             Tribasic nitrite (Bromeis)         .   . 3PbO, NO3
              Quadribasic nitrite                     4PbO, NO3.
     If, through    a solution of either of the basic nitrites of lead, a
  current of carbonic acid be passed, the basic atoms of oxide are
  precipitated as carbonate, and neutral nitrite of lead, PbO, NO3,
  remains in solution, e. g.
            4PbO, N03 + 3C02=3(PbO, CO9) -f PbO, NO3.
  If  this neutral nitrite of lead be placed in contact with more
  metallic lead and allowed to remain, the solution acquires in a
  few minutes an alkaline reaction from the formation of a qua
  dribasic salt and production of ammonia.                  This remarkable
  change is expressed in the following equation : —
     3(PbO,     N03)4 3HO       + 6Pb   = 2(4PbO, NO3) + PbO + Nil3*.
  The quadribasic      nitrite, by exposure to the atmosphere, is decom
  posed by carbonic acid, the three atoms of basic oxide combine
  with this acid and are precipitated as carbonate, neutral nitrite
  being left in solution, which again in contact with more lead
  forms another atom of ammonia, and is converted itself into the
  quadribasic salt.       Thus a very minute quantity of nitrous acid
     *  If a solution of neutral nitrite of lead be boiled with metallic lead, a
  quantity of ammonia is obtained which corresponds with the above equa
  tion.   The experimental results will be communicated in a subsequent
   paper.

210       Mr. H. Medlock on          the  Action of Water upon Lead.
resulting from the decomposition of nitrogenous organic matter
 will go on attacking and dissolving lead ad infinitum.                 Each
 atom of nitrous acid, in acting upon lead, forms an atom of neu
 tral nitrite of lead.     Three atoms of this neutral nitrite, accord
 ing to the above equation, attacks the lead vigorously, and forms
 the polybasic salt with simultaneous production of ammonia*.
 This ammonia is in turn converted by the action of the lead into
 nitrous acid, which in its turn attacks and dissolves its quota*o^i
 lead.    Thus, although the quantity of nitrogenous organic mat
 ter in water may be very small, and the nitrous acid directly
 resulting from the oxidation of ammonia may be in very minute
 quantity, yet it will be evident from the foregoing remarks that
 the quantity will rapidly increase from a process of self-manu
 facture which is continually going on.               The nitrous acid, in
 attacking the lead, produces ammonia: this ammonia in turn
 becomes transformed into nitrous acid by simple oxidation.
    When nitrates are present in water, a similar action on lead is
 effected.    The nitrate of lead produced in contact with the metal
is speedily transformed into the quadribasic nitrite with evolu
 tion of binoxide of nitrogen, which, by combining with another
 atom of oxygen, forms again nitrous acid.                The formation of
 quadribasic nitrite of lead, from the nitrate in contact with me
 tallic lead, is represented by the following equation : —
             5(PbO,     NO£>)  +  llPb=4(4PbO, N03) + N02.
    The foregoing observations sufficiently explain why leaden
pipes and cisterns are so rapidly destroyed by the action of cer
tain waters, while they are not acted upon by others.              The chief
conclusions arrived at from these investigations are, —
    1st. That the action of water upon lead is entirely due to the
presence of nitrous and nitric acids, resulting primarily from the
decomposition of organic matters and of ammonia contained in
the water.
    2ndly. That waters deprived of these acids, and of substances
capable of producing them, have no action on lead, and may be
conveyed with perfect safety through leaden pipes or stored in
leaden cisterns.
    3rdly. That carbonic acid exercises a most useful influence in
decomposing the basic nitrite of lead formed, and precipitating
the basic atoms of oxide as carbonate, leaving only very minute
quantities of the neutral nitrite in solution.
                                                                        .'i ~) ¦

ously into nitrous acid.    Most other metals, especially those which have a
powerful affinity  for oxygen,  possess the same property.

       Gentlemen,                                     August 22, 1857.
                  you deem it to be of sufficient interest, I shall feel
 SHOULD much obliged     by your republishing the enclosed paper, re
ferred to by Professor Clausius in his paper " On the Nature of
the Motion which we call Heat," inserted in your last Number.
I may observe in reference to the note at the foot of p. 109, that
the Memoirs of the Litcrai'y and Philosophical Society of Man
chester are at present regularly forwarded to the principal scien
tific societies of Europe and America.
                   I have the honour to remain,
                                         Yours very respectfully,
                                                           James P. Joule.
    In  a paper
                  " On  the Heat evolved during the Electrolysis of
Water," published in the seventh volume of the Memoirs of this
Society,    I stated that the magneto-electrical machine enabled us
to convert mechanical power into heat; and that                  I had little
doubt that, by interposing an electro-magnetic                engine in the
circuit of a voltaic battery, a diminution of the quantity of heat
evolved, per equivalent of chemical reaction, would be observed,
and that this diminution would be proportional to the mechanical
power obtained.
    The results of experiments in proof of the above proposition
were communicated to the British Association for the Advance
ment of Science, in 1843f.            They showed that whenever a cur
rent of electricity was generated by a magneto-electrical machine,
the quantity of heat evolved by that current had a constant rela
tion to the power required to turn the machine; and, on the
other hand, that whenever an engine was worked by a voltaic
battery, the power developed was at the expense of the calorific
power of the battery for a given consumption of zinc, the mecha
nical effect produced having a fixed relation to the heat lost in
the voltaic circuit.
    The obvious conclusion from these experiments was, that heat
and mechanical power were convertible into one another ; and it
became therefore evident that heat is either the vis viva of pon-

generating vis viva.
    It now became important to ascertain the mechanical equiva
lent of heat with as much accuracy as its importance to physical
science demanded.           For this purpose the magnetic apparatus
was not very well adapted, and therefore I sought in the heat
generated by the friction of fluids for the means of obtaining
exact results.      I found, first, that the expenditure of a certain
amount of mechanical power in the agitation of a given fluid
uniformly produced a certain fixed quantity of heat; and, secondly,
that the quantity of heat evolved in the friction of fluids was
entirely uninfluenced by the nature of the liquid employed ; for
water, oil and mercury, fluids as diverse from one another as
could have been well selected, gave sensibly the same result, viz.
that the quantity of heat capable of raising the temperature of a
pound of water 1°, is equal to the mechanical power developed
by a weight of 770 lbs. in falling through one perpendicular foot*.
    Believing that the discovery of the equivalent of heat furnished
the means of solving several interesting phaenomena, I com
menced, in the spring of 1844, some experiments on the changes
of temperature occasioned by the rarefaction and compression of
atmospheric airf.         It had long been known that air, when for
cibly compressed, evolves heat ; and that, on the contrary, when
air is dilated, heat is absorbed.           In order to account for these
facts,  it was   assumed     that  a  given weight of air has a smaller
capacity for heat when compressed into a small compass than
when occupying a larger space.                A few experiments served to
show the incorrectness of this hypothesis : thus,            I found that by
forcing    2956   cubic   inches   of  air,   at  the ordinary atmospheric
pressure, into the space of 136| cubic inches, 13°-63 of heat per
pound of water were produced ; whereas by the reverse process,
of allowing the compressed air to expand from a stopcock into
the atmosphere, only 4O-09 were absorbed instead of 13°-63,
which is the quantity of heat which ought to have been absorbed,
according to the generally received hypothesis.                I found, also,
that when strongly compressed air was allowed to escape into a
vacuum, no cooling effect took place on the whole, a fact like
wise at variance with the received hypothesis.              On the contrary,
the theory     I  ventured to advocate          J was in perfect agreement
 with the phenomena ; for the heat evolved by compressing the

   X I subsequently found that M. Mayer had previously advocated a similar
hypothesis, without, however, attempting an experimental demonstration of
its accuracy. — Annalen of Wohler and Liebig for 1842. — May 1851, J. P. J.

air was found to     be the equivalent   of the mechanical power em
ployed,    and,  vice versd,  the heat absorbed in rarefaction was
found to be the equivalent of the mechanical power developed,
estimated by the weight of the column of atmospheric air dis
placed.     In the case of compressed air expanding into a vacuum,
since no mechanical power was produced, no absorption of heat
was expected or found.         M. Seguin has confirmed the above
results in the case of steam.
    The above principles lead, indeed, to a more intimate acquaint
ance with the true theory of the steam-engine;             for they have
enabled us to estimate the calorific effect of the friction of the
steam in passing through the various valves and pipes, as well as
that of the piston in rubbing against the sides of the cylinder ;
and they have also informed us that the steam, while expanding
in the cylinder, loses heat in quantity exactly proportional to the
mechanical force developed*.
    The experiments on the changes of temperature produced by
the rarefaction and condensation of air give likewise an insight
into the constitution of elastic fluids, for they show that the heat
of elastic fluids is the mechanical force possessed by them ; and
since it is known that the temperature of a gas determines its
elastic force, it follows that the elastic force, or pressure, must
be the effect of the motion of the constituent particles in any
gas.    This motion may exist in several ways, and still account
for the phenomena presented by elastic fluids.           Davy, to whom
belongs the signal merit of having made the first experiment
absolutely demonstrative of the immateriality of heat, enunciated
the beautiful hypothesis of a rotatory motion.              He says,   "It
seems possible to account for all the phenomena of heat, if it be
supposed that in solids the particles are in a constant state of vibra
tory motion, the particles of the hottest bodies moving with the
greatest velocity and through the greatest space : that in fluids
and elastic fluids, besides the vibratory motion, which must be
considered greatest in the last, the particles have a motion round
their own axes with different velocities, the particles of elastic
fluids moving with the greatest quickness ; and that in setherial
substances the particles move round their own axes, and separate
from each other, penetrating in right lines through space. Tem
perature may be conceived to depend upon the velocity of the
vibrations, increase of capacity on the motion being performed
   * A complete theory of the motive power of heat has been recently com
municated by Professor Thomson to the Royal Society of Edinburgh.        In
this paper the very important law is established, that the fraction of heat
converted into power in any perfect engine, is equal to the range of tempe
rature divided by the highest temperature above absolute zero. — May 1851,

214                     Mr.  J. P. Joule  on Heat,
in greater space ; and the diminution of temperature during the
conversion of solids into fluids or gases may be explained on the
idea of the loss of vibratory motion, in consequence of the revo
lution of particles round their axes at the moment when the body
becomes fluid or aeriform, or from the loss of rapidity of vibra
tion in consequence of the motion of the particles through greater
 space*/1      I  have myself endeavoured to prove that a rotary
 motion, such as that described by Sir H. Davy, will account for
 the law of Boyle and Mariotte, and other phenomena presented
 by elastic fluids t; nevertheless, since the hypothesis of Herapath,
 in which it is assumed that the particles of a gas are constantly
flying about in every direction with great velocity, the pressure
of the gas being owing to the impact of the particles against any
surface presented to them, is somewhat simpler, I shall employ
it in the fallowing remarks on the constitution of elastic fluids ;
premising, however, that the hypothesis of a rotatory motion
accords equally well with the phenomena.
    Let us suppose an envelope of the size and shape of a cubic
foot to be filled with hydrogen gas, which, at 60° temperature
and 30 inches barometrical pressure, will weigh 36"927 grs.
Further, let us- suppose the above quantity to be divided into
three equal and indefinitely small elastic particles, each weigh
ing 12*309 grs. ; and further, that each of these particles vibrates
between opposite sides of the cube, and maintains a uniform
velocity except at the instant of impact ; it is required to find
the velocity at which each particle must move so as to produce
the atmospherical pressure of 14,831,712 grs. on each of the
 square sides of the cube.      In the first place, it is known that if
a body moving with the velocity of 32-^ feet per second be op
posed, during one second, by a pressure equal to its weight, its
 motion will be stopped, and that if the pressure be continued
 one second 'longer, the particle will acquire the velocity of 32-^
feet per second in the contrary direction.         At this velocity there
will be 32£ collisions of a particle of 12'309 grs. against each
 side of the cubical vessel in every two seconds of time; and the
 pressure occasioned thereby will be 12'309 X 32^ = 395 "938 grs.
 Therefore, since it is manifest that the pressure will be propor
tional to the square of the velocity of the particles, we shall have
for the velocity of the particles requisite to produce the pressure
of 14,831,712 grs. on each side of the cubical vessel,

                and the Constitution  of Elastic Fluids.          215
    The above velocity will be found equal to produce the atmo
spheric pressure, whether the particles strike each other before
they arrive at the sides of the cubical vessel, whether they strike
the sides obliquely, and thirdly, into whatever number of par
ticles the 36-927 grs. of hydrogen are divided.
    If only one-half the weight of hydrogen, or 18*4635 grs., be
enclosed in the cubical vessel, and the velocity of the particles
be as before, 6225 feet per second, the pressure will manifestly
be only one-half of what it was previously, which shows that the
law of Boyle and Mariotte flows naturally from the hypothesis.
    The velocity above named is that of hydrogen at the tempera
ture of 60° j but we know that the pressure of an elastic fluid
at 60° is to that at 32° as 519 is to 491.      Therefore the velocity
of the particles at 60° will be to that at 32° as ^519 : ^491,
which shows that the velocity at the freezing temperature of
 water is 6055 feet per second.
     In the above calculations it is supposed that the particles of
hydrogen have no sensible magnitude, otherwise the velocity
 corresponding to the same pressure would be lessened.
    Since the pressure of a gas increases with its temperature in
arithmetical progression, and since the pressure is proportional
 to the square of the velocity of the particles, in other words, to
 their vis viva, it follows that the absolute temperature, pressure,
 and vis viva are proportional to one another, and that the zero
 of temperature is 491° below the freezing-point of water.
 Further, the absolute heat of the gas, or, in other words, its
 capacity, will be represented by the whole amount of vis viva at
 a given temperature.      The specific heat may therefore be deter
 mined in the following simple manner : —
     The velocity of the particles of hydrogen, at the temperature
 of 60°, has been stated to be 6225 feet per second, a velocity
 equivalent to a fall from the perpendicular height of 602,342
 feet.   The velocity at 61° will be 6225    x/pfa = 623093        feet
 per second, which is equivalent to a fall of 603,502 feet.       The
 difference between the above falls is 1160 feet, which is there
 fore the space through which 1 lb. of pressure must operate upon
 each pound of hydrogen, in order to elevate its temperature one
 degree.    But our mechanical equivalent of heat shows that 770
 feet is the altitude representing the force required to raise the
 temperature of water one degree ; consequently the specific heat
 of hydrogen will    be       = l-506, calling that of water unity.
     The specific heats of the gases will be easily deduced from
 that of hydrogen ; for the whole vis viva and capacity of equal
 bulks of the various gases will be equal to one another ; and the

velocity of the particles will be inversely as the square root of
the specific gravity.        Hence the specific heat will be inversely
proportional to the specific gravity, a law which has been arrived
at experimentally by De la Rive and Marcet.
     In the following Table           I     have placed the specific heats of
various gases determined in the above manner, in juxtaposition

     The experimental results of Delaroche and Berard are invari
ably higher than those demanded by the hypothesis.                                  But it
 must be observed, that the experiments of Delaroche and Berard,
though considered the best that have hitherto been made, differ
considerably from those of other philosophers.                             I believe, how
 ever, that the investigation           undertaken by M. V. Regnault, for
the French Government, will embrace the important subject of
 the capacity of bodies for heat, and that we may shortly expect
 a new series of determinations of the specific heat of gases, cha
 racterized by all the accuracy for which that distinguished phi
 losopher is so justly famous.               Till then, perhaps, it will be better
 to delay any further modifications of the dynamical theory, by
 which its deductions may be made to correspond more closely
 with the results of experiment*.
    *  If we assume that the particles of a gas are resisted uniformly until
 their motion is stopped, and that then their motion is renewed in the op
 posite direction, by the continued operation of the same cause, as in the
 projection upwards and subsequent fall of a heavy body ; the maximum
 velocity of the particles will be to the uniform velocity required by the
 theory assumed in the text, as the square root of two is to one, and the
 comparison of the theoretical with the experimental specific heat will be as
 follows : —

       XXVI.      Note on the Action       of Bromine on Acetic Acid.
         £y W. H. Perkin, F.C.S.,            and B. F. Duppa, Esq.*
         a paper   upon monochloracetic acid that appeared in your
IN      Magazine last July, Dr. R. Hoffmann stated that bromine
does not act upon acetic acid even in the sunlight, which state
ment we are happy to confirm ; but having by another mode of
proceeding      induced these substances to act on each other, we
thought it advisable to send in a short account of our results.
    When a mixture of 4 vols, of glacial acetic acid and 1 vol. of
bromine is heated in a sealed tube to 120° or 130° C, the mix
ture becomes colourless, and on opening the tube torrents of
hydrobromic acid are evolved.               The liquid product, when sub
mitted to distillation, sometimes commences to boil as low as
90° C, when large quantities of hydrobromic acid are present,
and then gradually rises to 208° C, when the distillate com
mences to solidify in the condenser: this substance is bromo-
acetic acid, C4 (H3Br) O4.           It crystallizes in rhombohedrons, is
very deliquescent,       and     decomposes partially every time it is
 distilled, evolving hydrobromic acid.
     The silver salt was prepared by adding a little carbonate of           ¦
 silver to a solution of the new acid to separate any free hydro
 bromic acid, filtered, and then nearly saturated with carbonate
 of silver, which produced a dense crystalline precipitate; the
 liquid was then filtered off, the crystalline mass washed with
 cold water and dried in vacuo.            An aqueous solution of this salt
 decomposes slowly        even    at   the  ordinary temperature, bromide
 of silver being precipitated ; by boiling it is rapidly decomposed.
 The dry salt, on being heated to about 90° C, suddenly decom
  poses, leaving bromide of silver, together with a substance that
 carbonizes at a higher temperature : it seems to be very hygro-
  metric.    A determination of the silver gave 43-61 per cent.,
 theory requiring 43-9.
     The lead salt crystallizes in small, brilliant needles, taking
  a slight pink hue if exposed to light; it is very insoluble in
  water, and is decomposed by long boiling into a viscid, uncry-
  stallizable substance.      An analysis of this salt gave—
     42-774 per cent, of lead, and 331 of bromine; the formula
  C4(H2BrPb)04 requires 42-878 of lead, and 31-117 of bro
  mine.
     When a mixture of 1 vol. of phenic acid and 2 vols, of brb-
  moacetic acid is heated in a sealed tube to 130° C. for five hours,
  it becomes brown.        This product, when neutralized with potash,
  produces    a  carmine-coloured liquid, which is the potassium salts
  of two acids ; however, we refrain from giving an account of

these until we know more about them ; but it may be as well to
state, that if a mixture of phenic acid, acetic acid, and iodine be
heated in a sealed tube, there is a product obtained producing
salts of a similar colour to those obtained with bromoacetic acid ;
and also if acetic acid be replaced by any of its homologues,
similar acids are obtained, evidently showing the existence of a
whole series of these acids.              However, we expect soon to be able
to give a full account of bromoacetic acid, and hope to obtain
the bi- and tri-bromoacids, and also to give a complete account
of the acids procured by treating phenic acid with bromoacetic
acid.

think, be deduced from a very elegant formula of M. Borchardt

symmetric function of the roots, and contains potentially a method
for the calculation of the tables (b), but which, from the example                   I

    " Memoir     on the Conditions for the Existence of given Systems of
Equalities among the Roots of an Equation."                       By Arthur Cayley,
Esq., F.R.S.
    It is well known that there is a symmetric function of the roots of
an equation, viz. the product of the squares of the differences of the

              Mr. A. Cayley     on the Sturmian Functions.              219
roots, which vanishes when any two roots are put equal to each other,
and that consequently such function expressed in terms of the coeffi
cients and equated to zero, gives the condition for the existence of a
pair of equal roots. And it was remarked long ago by Professor
                                                    '
Sylvester, in some of his earlier papers in the Philosophical Maga
zine,' that the like method could be applied to finding the conditions
for the existence of other systems of equalities among the roots, viz.
that it was possible to form symmetric functions, each of them a sum
of terms containing the product of a certain number of the differences
of the roots, and such that the entire function might vanish for the
particular system of equalities in question ; and that such functions
expressed in terms of the coefficients and equated to zero would give
the required conditions.        The object of the present memoir is to
extend this theory, and render it exhaustive by showing how to form
a series of types of all the different functions which vanish for one
or more systems of equalities among the roots j and in particular
to obtain by the method distinctive conditions for all the different
systems of equalities between the roots of a quartic or a quintic equa
tion, viz. for each system conditions which are satisfied for the particular
system, and are not satisfied for any other systems, except, of course,
the more special systems included in the particular system.             The
question of finding the conditions for any particular system of equali
ties is essentially an indeterminate one, for given any set of functions
which vanish, a function syzygetically connected with these will also
vanish ; the discussion of the nature of the syzygetic relations
between the different functions which vanish for any particular system
of equalities, and of the order of the system composed of the several
 conditions for the particular system of equalities, does not enter into
 the plan of the present memoir. I have referred here to the indeter-
 minateness of the question for the sake of the remark that I have
availed myself thereof, to express by means of invariants or covariants
 the different systems of conditions obtained in the sequel of the
 memoir ; the expressions of the different invariants and covariants
referred to are given in my "Second Memoir upon Quantics," Phil.

    The general expressions for the Sturmian functions in the form of

 which their form is rendered somewhat more elegant ; I propose, on
 the present occasion, merely to give this modified form of the general

  " Photo-chemical    Researches.    — Part II.    Phenomena of Photo
chemical Induction."       By Prof. Bunsen of Heidelberg, and Henry
Enfield Roscoe, B.A., Ph.D.
   Chemical affinity, or the force which regulates the chemical com
bination of two bodies, is like all other forces, a certain definite
quantity.     Hence it is erroneous to say, that under different circum
stances the same body can possess different affinities ; more correctly
we should say, that in the one case the bodies are able to follow the
chemical attraction of their molecules, whilst in another case opposing
forces render this combination impossible.         These opposing forces
may be considered as resistances similar to those exerted in the
passage of electricity through conductors, in the distribution of
magnetism in steel, and in the conduction of heat. We overcome
these resistances when by agitation we increase the formation of a
precipitate, or by insolation effect a decomposition.
    We call the act by which these resistances to combination are
lessened, and the formation of a chemical compound promoted,
"chemical induction;" and we specify this as photo-chemical, thermo-
chemical, electro-chemical, or idio-cnemical, according as light, heat,
electricity, or pure chemical action is the force which promotes the
combination.
    The phenomena of photo- chemical induction are particularly
interesting, as affording starting-points from which we may gain a
knowledge of this mode of action of affinity.
   That on exposing a mixture of chlorine and hydrogen to the light
the action does not commence to its full extent at once, was observed
by Draper in 1843.       An explanation of this fact was given by the
supposition that the chlorine underwent on insolation a permanent
allotropic modification, in which state it possessed more than usually
                      This explanation
                                          by is,
active properties.                           as we shall show, erroneous,
and the whole phenomenon        is caused     the peculiar action to which
we have given the name of photo-chemical induction.              When the
standard mixture of chlorine and hydrogen           exposed to
                                                       is         constant
                                                                         a
source of light, no action    is at first perceptible   after;  short time,
                                                                     a
however, the action becomes visible, and gradually increases until           a
constant maximum      is  reached. Experiments made with different
amounts of light from different luminous sources, showed that the
times which elapsed from the beginning of the exposure until the
maximum was obtained, varied very much, according to circum
stances.    In one case the maximum action was reached in fifteen
minutes, in others after an exposure of three and four minutes.
The first action was in one case visible after six minutes' insolation,
in others after one minute, whilst in some experiments considerable  a
action was observed in the first minute.
    The condition modifying the action of the induction which we
first examined, was the action of the mass of the insolated gas. From
various experiments,  it   was found that the duration of the induction

Prof. Bunsen and Dr. Roscoe         on Photo-chemical     Induction.  221
increased with the volume of exposed gas (by constant amounts ot
light), and curves have been drawn, representing the increase of the
induction for the various volumes of gas employed.
    We next examined the dependence of the duration of induction
upon the amount of light to which a constant volume of gas was
exposed, and experiment showed —
    1. That the time necessary to effect the first action of the photo
chemical induction decreases with increase of light, and in a greater
ratio than the increase of light.
    2. That the time which elapses until the maximum is attained
also decreases with increase of light, but in a much less ratio.
    3. That the increase of the induction proceeds at first in an ex
panding series, attains a maximum, and then converges when the
true maximum action is attained. The law regulating the increase
of the induction by increase of light, we have rendered visible
 by curves.
    The results of these experiments suggested the question, Is this
condition of increased combining power, into which the mixture of
chlorine and hydrogen passes by insolation, permanent, or is it
 confined to the time during which the gas is exposed to the light 1
 In order to determine this question, the sensitive gas, which had
 stood for some time in the dark, was exposed to a constant source of
 light, and the time noted which elapsed before the maximum action
 was reached ; the apparatus was then darkened for one minute, and
 then again insolated, and the time watched until the maximum action
 was again observed.      These observations were repeated several times,
 each period of darkening being longer than the preceding.           Thus
 conducted, the experiment led to the important conclusion, that the
 resistance to combination overcome by the influence of the light is
  soon restored when the gas is allowed to stand in the dark.       Curves
 expressing the effect produced on induction by darkening, and by
  exposure to light, have been drawn.
     We have explained the fact, that the mixture of chlorine and
  hydrogen does not combine in the dark, by the supposition of the
  existence of a resistance to combination which is overcome when the
  gaseous mixture is exposed to light.      This resistance to combination
  can be increased by various circumstances.       The presence of a very
  small quantity of foreign gas in the standard mixture of chlorine and
  hydrogen is sufficient to cause the resistance to be increased to a
  very great extent. An excess of 10300 of hydrogen over that con
  tained in the normal gas, reduced the action from 100 to 38.
     In these experiments we have to do with the purest form of the
  so-called catalytic actions, to which the photo-chemical phenomena
  are closely related.     The quantitative estimation of the relations
  which exist in the phenomena of contact, between the mass of the
  substance   the time and other modifying conditions, has not as
  yet been possible, owing to the absence of any case in which these
  relations are exhibited in their simplest form.          Our method of
  photo-chemical measurement points out a direction which promises
  to afford interesting results concerning these quantitative relations ;

222                         Royal Society   .—
but in this communication we restrict ourselves to the consideration
of these phenomena in so far as they influence the action of photo
chemical induction, intending on a future occasion to enter more
fully into the new field of research indicated.
   The contact action of foreign gases is still more strongly seen in
the case of small quantities of oxygen. This gas, when present in
quantities amounting only to 10*00 of the total volume of gas,
diminishes the action from 100 to 4-7, whilst xh%s reduced the
action from 100 to P3.          Excess of chlorine acted in a similar
manner, though not to so great an extent, y\%0 of this gas reducing
the action from 100 to 60'2, and Ty^ from 100 to 41-3.                 On
examining    the  effect of small  quantities of hydrochloric   acid   gas
upon the induction maximum, we found, fortunately for the accuracy
of the indications of our instrument, that an amount of -j-^fo of this gas
does not produce any appreciable effect on the action of the induction.
Uninsolated gas was found to act similarly on the normal mixture,
the admission of -^^-^ of non-insolated gas reducing the action from
 100 to 55.      Curves have been drawn, representing the relation
between the action and the amount of foreign impurity introduced.
Several series of experiments also showed that a mixture of chlorine
and hydrogen, which was so nearly pure that no alteration of the
maximum action was observable, was longer in attaining the maximum
than the perfectly pure gas; hence the duration of the induction
serves as an exact measure of the absence of all foreign gases in the
standard mixture.
   An explanation of the laws of photo-chemical induction derived
from the above-mentioned experiments, might easily be found in the
assumption that the chlorine or the hydrogen, or both gases, undergo
upon exposure to light a change similar to that between common
and ozonized oxygen, or that these two gases can, under certain
circumstances,    be invested with active, and, under other circum
stances, with passive properties.     If this hypothesis be true, each
gas must undergo this peculiar modification when separately exposed
to the action of the light.     That this is not the case was shown by
the following experiment : — The two gases were separately evolved,
and each led through a long glass tube, in which they could be
separately exposed to the action of diffuse and direct sunlight. After
this exposure, the gases passed through a connecting tube into the
apparatus, in which a constant source of light gave the duration of the
induction.    Thus alternately insolating and darkening the separated
gases, we observed the effect on the gases subsequently mixed and
exposed to lamplight.     No difference was perceptible in the duration
of the induction between the gases previously insolated and those
evolved in the dark.     Hence we may conclude, that the light does
not effect a permanent modification, either of the chlorine or hydrogen,
but that the combination produced by the light must depend on
photo-chemical action affecting only the increasing attractions of the
chemically active molecules.
   All the curves representing the increase of the induction under
various conditions have a common form, and a point of flexure at

Mr .Williams     on the Destructive  Distillation of lionhead Coal.    223
which the maximum increase occurs. In order to determine whether
this common property of the curves arises from the general mode of
action of affinity, or whether the light plays an essential part, we
have made experiments upon idio-chemical induction, i. e. action
in which pure chemical attractions alone effect the alteration. For
this purpose we employed a dilute aqueous solution of bromine with
tartaric acid, which mixture, when left to itself in the dark, under
goes decomposition, hydrobromic acid being formed.             By determi
ning the amount of free bromine contained in the liquid at different
times, we became acquainted with the rate at which the decompo
 sition occurred.     Analysis showed that the amount of hydrobromic
acid formed was not the same in equal spaces of time ; and curves
representing this increase were found to have the form obtained for
the photo-chemical induction.         Hence the cause of this maximum
increase appears not to lie in any peculiar property of light, but
rather in the mode of action of affinity itself.
     One of the many interesting applications of the laws of photo
 chemical induction relates to the phenomena of photography.            As
 an instance of this application we cite the remarkable observations
 of Becquerel, which induced him to assume the existence of certain
rays which can continue, but not commence, chemical action.              In
 order to explain the phenomenon observed by the French physicist,
 we do not need to suppose the existence of a new property of light, as
 the facts are easily explained by the laws of photo-chemical induction ;
 and we are satisfied that these relations, which we have examined
 only in the case of chlorine and hydrogen, occur in a slightly modi
 fied form in other photo-chemical processes.
     Having determined in this part of our investigation the most im
 portant phenomena        of photo-chemical induction, we shall in the
 next section consider the laws which regulate the chemical action of
 light after the induction is completed.

 fact of his having obtained a substance possessing the composition
 and vapour-density of butyle*, and had expressed a belief that he
 should succeed in isolating not only that radical, but also propyle,
 amyle, and caproyle. The composition of the radicals varies so little,
 that to determine the boiling-points it was necessary to take the
 density of the vapour of all those fractions which distilled anywhere
 near their known boiling-points ; and in each case he regarded that

point of the radical as obtained from the source mentioned.
    Propyle presented itself under the form of a colourless, very mobile
fluid, having a pleasant odour, and boiling at 68° C. At 1 8° it had
the very low density of 0-6745.       Combustion gave results agreeing
closely with the formula

had not been previously obtained.
    Butyle from the Torbane-hill mineral distils at 1 1 9°, and has a

The vapour-density was found to be 3-88, theory requiring 3'94.
    Amyle distilled at 159°, and had a density of 0-7365 at 18°.        On
analysis,   numbers  were  obtained  agreeing perfectly  with the formula

 The vapour-density    was found to be 4'93 ; theory requires 4'91.
     Caproyle boiled at 202° ; its density at 18° was 07568.           The
 results of analysis accorded with the expression
 which indicates a vapour-density of 5-87, while experiment yielded
 5-83.
     The experiments detailed in the paper appear to demonstrate the
 radical nature of the hydrocarbons, and to negative the assumption
 of their being homologues of marsh-gas.
     The paper concludes with a description of a method, by which,
 where numerous vapour-density determinations are to be made, the
 necessity is avoided of refilling the balloon with water or mercury
 in order to determine the residual air.
     " On  the Optical Characters of certain Alkaloids associated with
  Quinine, and of the Sulphates of their Iodo-compounds."         By Wil
 liam Bird Herapath, M.D., in a Letter to Professor Stokes, Sec. R.S.
     You will probably recollect that I sent you some time since a
  small portion of an alkaloid, which at that time was called quinidine
 in Germany, but it has since been distinguished from it and named
  cinchonidine.    You then examined it for epipolism or fluorescence,
  and you pronounced the opinion that it possessed this property only
  in a minor degree, and you imagined that this arose from the presence
  of a small per-centage of a-quinine.
     I have since obtained, through the kindness of Mr. J. E. Howard,
  specimens of the perfectly pure alkaloids quinidine and cinchonidine,
  and find that quinidine, which I can now identify as the /3-quinine of
  Von Heijningen, possesses the phenomenon of fluorescence or epi-
  polic dispersion as powerfully as a-quinine ; whilst cinchonidine, if per
  fectly pure, is devoid of it altogether ; and recent experiments have
  shown me that a small per-centage of quinidine was the cause of the

Dr. Herapath       on the  Optical Characters of certain Alkaloids. 225
epipolic dispersion found by you in the specimen of cinchonidine sent
by me.
    It may be as well to state that the cinchonidine tested by water
of chlorine and ammonia gave no evidence of green tint, which it
would have done if only -g-jL^dth part of either a-quinine or quinidine
had been present, according to some recent experiments of my own.
    I have also found that 1 gr. of pure quinine or quinidine in 35,000
of water will give an evident " epipolic" appearance ; whilst when
diluted with 70,000 grs. of water we have still very evident appear
ances of "fluorescence"      upon the perpendicular wall of the glass
vessel exposed to the incident light ; whilst a bluish milkiness of
 "internal dispersion" may be seen when I gr. of either alkaloid is
diluted with 700,000 grs. or 10 gallons of distilled water, well
acidulated in all these cases with sulphuric acid.
    Some other interesting results have followed from these investiga
tions.    When quinidine is dissolved in an excess of diluted sulphuric
acid, and the solution mixed with about twice its bulk of spirit, and
warmed to 1 30° F., and tincture of iodine then added in sufficient
quantity, and subsequently set in repose, beautiful red acicular cry
stals are deposited ; these, upon recrystallization from rectified spirit,
acquire an increased size, become beautiful quadrilateral prisms, ex
hibiting a deep garnet-red by transmitted light, and possessing a clear
bluish-purple reflected tint ; they are optically doubly absorbent in
a slight degree, and transmit a brownish-orange body- colour when
polarized perpendicular to axis.     The primary form appears to be a
rhombic prism ; and as far as my present analyses go, the compound
seems to possess the following centesimal composition : —
                  Iodine                           39665
                  Sulphuric acid                    6-273

                  Hydrogen                          3-960
                  Nitrogen                          4-400
                  Oxygen                            5*040

                                                  100-712
The    excess  arises  from the hydrogen twice calculated in water of
crystallization.
    These numbers agree very closely with the formula
                    (O H'^N* 0< + P) SO' HO+5HO,
and prove it to be the sulphate of iodo-quinidine, very analogous to
the iodo-quiniue compound, yet differing materially in its optical
properties.
    There is another alkaloid frequently associated with quinidine,
which also crystallizes from spirit in the prismatic form like quinidine
and cinchonidine, but is another example of epipolism or fluorescence.
Its iodo-sulphate is deep olive-green in its reflected tint, orange-
yellow by transmitted light, and possessing in an eminent degree
optically doubly absorbent powers, thin lamina: being quite black,
but still thinner ones give a bistre-brown "body-colour" when pola
rized perpendicular to the axis.

    This alkaloid was also furnished me by the kindness of Mr. Howard,
but has not yet been sufficiently purified, or in the quantity necessary
to give certain results.
    It possesses one very peculiar property. When dissolved in chloro
form and evaporated spontaneously on glass, the gummy and uncry-
 stalline residue, mounted in Canada balsam, at once shows a deep
 blue-green, epipolic, or fluorescent appearance.
     Pure cinchonidine does not possess epipolic dispersion and does not
 become green by chlorine-water and ammonia ; and when it is dis
 solved in acetic acid or chloroform and the fluid is exposed on glass
 plates to spontaneous evaporation, beautiful crystals in circular spots
 or drusse develope themselves, which under polarized light exhibit
 black crosses and white or coloured sectors.
     These appearances are not exhibited by pure quinine or true qui-
 nidine (/3-quinine), both of which give a gummy, uncrystalline, and
 perfectly transparent residue.
     Pure cinchonidine, thus optically and chemically distinguishable
 from either quinine or quinidine, is still further remarkable for pro
 ducing with sulphuric acid and iodine an optical doubly absorbent
 compound of intense power, even equal to the sulphate of iodo-
 quinine compound ; these crystals are very similar in form to my
 artificial tourmalines, and have long been mistaken by me for them ;
 even at present I can only distinguish them by the tints in reflected
 light and the complementary body-colour, viz. whilst sulphate of
 iodo-quinine gives a cantharidine-green reflected tint, and a pink,
ruby-red, reddish-brown or black body-colour when polarized perpen
 dicular to the axis, according to the thickness of the plate examined,
 the sulphate of iodo-cinchonidine is golden-green by reflected light,
 and gives a sky or indigo-blue or black
                                           " body-colour" when polarized
 perpendicular to the axis.      I have not yet made sufficient chemical
 analyses of this substance to enable me to decide on its formula, but
I  have obtained 39-307 per cent, iodine and 8-864 per cent, sulphuric
acid, which sufficiently indicate a chemical diiference in constitution
from the sulphate of iodo-quinine, which,_ it may be remembered,
contains 32-609 per cent, iodine and 10-61 per cent, sulphuric acid.
    I hope soon to present these results in more detail when sufficient
leisure is afforded me for the purpose. —W. B. H.

was necessary to increase the resistance of the instrument a hundred
fold, by placing in the circuit a coil of fine wire. In thermo-electric
arrangement steel was found to be nearer copper than iron was.       By
hardening, steel was raised almost to the place of copper.    Cast iron
was found to surpass copper ; so that the junction cast iron and
copper is reverse to that of wrought iron and copper, and the

copper and wrought iron.      A new test of the quality and purity of
ferruginous metals is thus indicated, which will probably be found of
value to the arts.

   "On the Photography of the Moon." By William Crookes, Esq.
   The subject of lunar photography      is one which has engaged the
attention of scientific men almost from the first announcement of the
possibility of fixing the images in the camera. Owing to the extreme
difficulty of satisfying all the conditions of the problem to be solved,
                                   Q2

 228                      Royal Society   : —
 there are few good photographs of the moon yet in existence.           It
 was my good fortune in the autumn of 1855 to obtain several          ex
 cellent pictures of this kind, and since these form the starting-point
 of the work which, by the assistance of a grant from the Donation
 Fund of the Royal Society,    I  have been pursuing during the greater
 part of the last year, a detailed account of the means employed for
 their production will not, I think, be considered out of place here.
    The telescope in which these pictures were taken is the magnifi
 cent equatorial at the Liverpool Observatory.        This, together with
 all the resources of the establishment, was placed at my disposal by
 my kind friend Mr. Hartnup, to whom it is but due to state, that,
were it not for the invaluable assistance afforded me by his sterling
advice as well as steady hand, the results would not have been worth
keeping.
    The mounting of the equatorial is quite unique ; the polar axis and
telescope together weigh about five tons, and whilst all parts are so
truly and smoothly fitted that this enormous mass is moved equato-
rially by means of a small water-mill with such marvellous accuracy,
that a star viewed through it appears absolutely stationary, its firm
ness is such that a hard blow against the side merely produces a
scarcely perceptible momentary deflection. The object-glass is 8
inches in diameter, and has a sidereal focus of 12-5 feet — the dia
meter of the moon's image in this focus being about ] -35 inch.
    The eyepiece was removed, and in its place the body of a small
camera was attached, so that the moon's image might fall upon the
ground glass or sensitive film in the usual manner.          Much labour
had been saved me in finding the true actinic focus, by several pho
tographers of Liverpool, who were working for some time on the
same subject when the British Association met in that city in 1854.
They found that the object-glass had been over-corrected for the
actinic rays — the plate being required to be placed at a distance of
0-8 of an inch beyond the optical focus : a few experiments were
sufficient to enable me to verify this result.
    During the time above referred to, and frequently since, Mr. Hart
nup had taken many hundreds of pictures with chemicals recom
mended by various persons, but had not succeeded in obtaining a good
negative at all, and not even a positive with a less exposure than
from half a minute to a minute.        As   I succeeded in taking dense
negatives in about four seconds, with the temperature of the room
below freezing and the moon at a considerable distance from the
meridian, and as I attribute the greater sensitiveness which        I ob
tained to the great purity of the materials I employed,        I think it
right to give, after the mechanical arrangements are described, an
account of the way in which these were prepared.
    The clockwork movement was only sufficient to follow the moon
approximately when on the meridian, but as the pictures were nearly
all taken when she was some distance past the meridian, and when
consequently the declination and atmospheric refraction were changing
rapidly, it was necessary, notwithstanding the short time required
to take the pictures, to correct for the imperfect motion of the

            Mr. W. Crookes       on the   Photography    of the Moon.          229
  telescope.     This was done by means of slow-motion screws attached
  to the right ascension and declination circles, which are each 4 feet
  in diameter. The finder had an eyepiece with a power of 200 applied
  to  it, having cross wires in its field.
      The modus operandi of taking the picture was as follows — The       :
  telescope having been moved until the moon's image was in the centre
  of the focusing glass, the water-mill was turned on and the dark
  slide containing the sensitive collodion plate was substituted for the
  ground glass.       Mr. Hartnup then took his station at the finder, and
  with    a tangent rod in each hand, by          steady and continuous move
                                                   a
  ment, kept the point of intersection of the cross wires stationary on
  one spot on the moon's surface.
      When the motion was most perfectly neutralized, uncovered the
                                                                  I
  sensitive plate at     given signal and exposed
                         a                              it,counting the seconds
  by   means   of   loud-ticking
                    a              chronometer     by my side.
      From the ease with which on my first attempt               could keep the
                                                                  I
  cross wires of the finder fixed on one point of the moon by means
  of the tangent rods, confidently believe that with the well-tutored
                             I
  hands and consummate skill which guided this noble instrument, the
  moon's image was as motionless on the collodion plate as                 could
                                                                          it

     The negatives which         obtained by these means were exquisitely

  beautiful, and so minute that          Icould not obtain paper with     asuffi
 ciently   fine  surface  whereon     to  print  copies  which  would  do  them
 justice.     It was evident that they would bear magnifying several
 diameters and still remain sharply defined.            The expense of carrying
 out this design here stopped me, when by the kind advice of Pro
 fessor Wheatstone       Iapplied to the Royal Society, whose munificence
 has so frequently been the cause of bringing to          a successful termina
 tion investigations of the highest importance.
      A  half-plate photographic combination of lenses, by Ross, was
 screwed the reverse way into            large sliding camera body 10 inches

                                                                      8
                                                                      1
    feet long. At the end of the sliding body opposite to the lens, was
a 3
     groove to admit either          focusing glass or
                                     a                       dark slide for the
                                                              a
 sensitive plate.      A smaller camera body was screwed into the other
 end of the brasswork of the lens, having also            a  groove in front to
 admit of sliding box capable of holding the small negatives.
                a                                                          A re
 flector was placed in front of all, so arranged as to move in altitude
round       acentre, and, being fixed in any required position, to reflect
the diffused light of the sky through the negative and lens parallel
with the axis of the latter.
     Preliminary trials showed me that there was no good gained by
magnifying the small pictures more than about 20 times, as after
that the individual parts begin to get confused and indistinct             ;this
magnifying cannot, however, be effected at once.             In the small nega
tives the lights and shades are the reverse of what they are in nature,
consequently        print on paper therefrom gives the light and shade
                    a
correct.        A photographic copy of       a anegative, however, produces a
positive by transmitted light, and            print from this would have the

230                           Royal Society : —
shadows light and the light parts dark ; consequently, in magnifying
a negative with the intention of still producing a negative, an inter
mediate transmitted positive must first be taken, and this in its turn
magnified, when it will produce a negative.
     The relative distances of the negative and focusing glass from the
intermediate lens were so adjusted, that an image of the negative,
 enlarged to about two diameters, was thrown upon the ground glass,
 care being taken that the light from the sky was reflected parallel
through the centres of the negative and lens by means of the mirror.
 The aperture of the lens was then stopped down to half an inch by
 means of a diaphragm, and the focus most carefully obtained by
 sliding the end of the large camera in or out.       I found it necessary
 to verify this by experimental trials at different distances on each
side of the observed focus, as it was difficult to judge accurately with
 the eye on the ground glass, owing to the roughness of the latter and
 the feebleness of the light.
     A picture, or rather many pictures, were now taken, and the one
which by transmitted light most truthfully resembled a paper print
from the small negative was reserved for further magnifying.           This
 was effected absolutely in the same manner as the former : the nega
 tive being removed and the positive being placed in its stead, a further
 magnifying gave a large-sized negative.
     Although this precess seems very simple, it is impossible to esti
 mate the difficulties, unless by an actual repetition of the experiment,
 which I had to overcome before arriving at the beautiful result which
 I  have the honour to lay before the Society.       The double copying
had a tendency to slightly exaggerate the effect of light and shade,
 and this could only be obviated by exposing the plates for such a
time, that with the feeble light at my command it was verging on
 decomposition ; particles of dust, too, seemed most pertinaciously to
 fix themselves on the prominent mountains, giving rise to craters
 where none should be ; and even my finished pictures are not per
 fectly free from these faults, although each negative is the repre
 sentative of a month's work and upwards of a hundred failures.
     I doubt if much better photographs of our satellite can be taken
 by   the way I have pursued.     The future of lunar photography lies
in another direction : the image must not be received on a sensitive
plate and this copy submitted to an after process of magnifying.
 Defects quite imperceptible to the naked eye on the small negatives,
are expanded into great blotches when magnified.          In fact, upwards
 of a dozen seemingly equally good negatives with which          I  started,
have, with hut one or two exceptions, shown spots when enlarged.
    The magnifying must be conducted simultaneously with the pho
tographing, either by having the eyepiece on the telescope, or better
still, by having a proper arrangement of lenses to throw a magnified
moon image at once on the collodion.          The difficulty of want of
light could not be any objection, as supposing the enlarged image
to be equal to those which I have now taken, that would be an
increase of area of about twenty times, consequently 20 x 6 seconds,
or 2 minutes, would represent the average time of exposure ; a pe

riod which, even were it prolonged four or five times, would not then
be too severe a tax upon a steady and skilful hand and eye.
               Description   of the Photographic   Process.
   The glass employed for taking the original negative of the moon,
was that known as " extra white colour patent plate," that for the
intermediate positives and large negatives was ordinary patent plate.
Cleaning the surface, which is an operation of especial importance,
was effected  in the following manner.
   The  glasses were dipped into and then well rubbed over with a hot
solution of caustic potassa ; then, after washing with water, they were
transferred to hot nitric acid (one part strong acid to three of water),
where they were allowed to remain for about half an hour.
   A piece of soft wash-leather was plentifully rinsed, first in a warm
dilute solution of carbonate of soda, afterwards in clean water, and
then well wrung until all the superfluous water was squeezed out.
The glass plates were taken from the nitric acid and rinsed in abun
dance of clean water, and then rubbed well on every part with the
damp leather. This removed most of the superficial moisture ; and the
final drying was effected by means of another piece of wash-leather,
prepared the same as before, but allowed to become perfectly dry.
   Just previous to using, the plates, held in a pneumatic plate-holder,
had the last polish given to them by briskly rubbing with a warm
piece of fine diaper (which had also been previously washed in soda
and water, and then well rinsed and dried) until the moisture con
densed from the breath evaporated evenly and uniformly, especially
guarding against the slightest contact between the surface of the
glass and the fingers.
   The plate was now held with its clean side downward until the
collodion was about to be poured on, and every particle of dust
 (which was easily seen by bringing the source of light, the under
surface of the plate and the eye, nearly in the same line) was gently
wiped off by passing a warm piece of fine cambric lightly across.
   Care was also taken to have the atmosphere of the room as free
as possible from floating particles, and the dried collodion usually
adhering to the neck of the bottle was scrupulously removed.
   The collodion was poured on and the plate rendered sensitive in
the usual way. As the temperature both of the equatorial and ope
rating rooms was seldom far from the freezing-point, the great dimi
nution of sensitiveness, which that circumstance would have occa
sioned, was obviated by having the nitrate of silver bath and deve
loping solution warmed to about 30° C, and also by ^lightly warm
ing the plates before using. The source of light was a fishtail gas
burner in the outer room, and shining close to the orange glass
window of the dark room.
   The soluble paper for the collodion was prepared in the following
manner : — a mixture was made of
      Commercial nitrous acid               1 *43      4 fluid ounces.
      Commercial nitric acid                l-37       4       „
      Sulphuric acid                        1 "82      8       „

  232                          Royal Society   .—
      "When the temperature of the mixture had cooled down to 50°         C,
  one sheet of Swedish filtering-paper, torn up into small pieces, was
  completely immersed in the mixture, and allowed to remain therein for
  about half an hour.       It was then thrown into a large pail of water,
  and the paper removed and placed on a sieve under a running tap
  for a quarter of an hour ; after washing in very dilute solution of
  ammonia and then in plenty of water, the paper was pressed between
  the folds of a cloth, and then allowed to dry spontaneously in the
  air.
      The collodion was made with —
  Ether, sp. gr. -725 (previously freed from acid by
     rectification from dry caustic potassa)             5 fluid ounces.
  Absolute alcohol                                       3       „
  Soluble paper (dried at 100° C.)                      50 grains.
  Iodide of cadmium (pure)                              30    „
     The alcohol and ether were mixed together, and then the paper
  and iodide of cadmium were added : they dissolved in a few minutes
  with a little shaking.     As soon as the solution was complete, it was
  allowed to stand for twenty-four hours, and then half of the clear
  supernatant fluid was decanted carefully into a clean well-stoppered
  bottle for use.     I believe that collodion prepared in this way will
 remain uniform from one year's end to another.
     The nitrate of silver bath was made by dissolving 1 ounce of
 crystallized nitrate of silver, perfectly pure and neutral, in 2 ounces
 of water, then, with constant stirring, adding a solution of 4 grains
 of iodide of cadmium in 1 ounce of water, and a quarter of an ounce
 of the above iodized collodion, and water to make up the volume to
  10 ounces.      This was allowed to stand for a few hours at a tempe
 rature of about 25° C, and then filtered from the undissolved iodide
 of silver and precipitated paper. A glass bath was used in pre
 ference to gutta percha, and, as above stated, it was heated to 30° C.
 when used.
     The developing solution consisted of —
        Pure pyrogallic acid                           8 grains.
        Crystallized citric acid                      16    „
        Water                                          8 fluid ounces.
        Alcohol                                        |       „
     This developing solution is very slow in its action, 15 to 20
minutes being frequently required, but it ultimately produces nega
tives of such vigour and freedom from stains, that I much prefer it
to the usual formula.
    The fixing solution employed was the ordinary nearly saturated
solution of hyposulphite of soda.       After its employment the pictures
were well and carefully washed in warm water, dried before a fire,
and, after scratching the description or name on a corner, varnished

                                  Appendix.
    Besides the pictures taken in America — -which are almost valueless
 as moon maps,    as the sides are reversed in the copying from the
 daguerreotype plate upon which they were originally taken, — the
 moon has been photographed by Professor Phillips, Father Secchi,
 MM. Bertsch and Arnauld, several Liverpool photographers, and
 Mr. Hartnup and myself. It is interesting and instructive to
 compare among themselves the means employed and the time occu
 pied in taking the impression on these several occasions.
    Professor Phillips's telescope has a sidereal focus of 1 1 feet, and
 an aperture of 6| inches ; consequently the brilliancy of the moon's
 image in it3 focus is augmented 26 times over what she appears to
the naked eye.      The average time occupied for the collodion plate
 to receive the impression was about 3 minutes.
    Father Secchi' s telescope having a sidereal focus of 18 times its
 aperture, the moon's image was intensified 37'8 times, and the time
required for the impression was an average of 6 minutes.
    M. Porro's glass of 49 feet sidereal focus and 20 inches aperture,
gave a moon image 12-3 times brighter than she appeared to the
naked eye, and the average time of taking the picture was 17
seconds.
    Mr. Hartnup's telescope being 1 2£ feet focus and 8 inches aperture,
augments the intensity of the moon's image at its focus 35 -1 times.
The time which was required for the photograph of our satellite to be
taken, on the occasion of the meeting of the British Association
at Liverpool in 1854, was about 2 minutes ; and under the same
circumstances we ourselves succeeded in obtaining perfect and intense
negatives in 4 seconds.        These, however, were taken under very
unfavourable circumstances, the temperature being below the freezing-
point, and the moon at a considerable distance from the meridian,
which necessarily caused both a diminution of the light and also a
diminished sensitiveness of the collodion film.
    The rapidity with which the above pictures were taken may be
better understood by comparing them with those of terrestrial objects
under similar circumstances. According to Herschel* —
    " The actual illumination of the lunar surface is not much superior
to that of weathered sandstone rock in full sunshine.           I have fre
quently compared      the   moon   setting behind   the  grey perpendicular
facade of the Table Mountain, illuminated by the sun just risen in
the opposite quarter of the horizon, when it has been scarcely distin
guishable in brightness from the rock in contact with it. The sun
and moon being nearly at equal altitudes, and the atmosphere per
fectly free from cloud or vapour, its effect is alike on both lumi
naries."
   Thus by comparing the Liverpool object-glass as to power with
our ordinary camera lens, its focal length being nearly 1 9 times the
aperture, and the moon's image being copied by its means in 4
seconds, we find that it is equivalent to copying sandstone illuminated

             ON THE CALCULATION OF VAPOUR DENSITIES.
                            BY HERMANN KOPP.
               the atomic weight of a substance is calculated for oxygen
WHEN= 8,          and its vapour density for atmospheric air =1, sup
posing these data to be rigidly correct, it is found that the quotient
of the atomic weight by the density is equal to one of the following
numbers : —
                        28-88           14-44         722.
   The number 28-88 corresponds with            a condensation to 4 volumes.
          „        i^  ^^          a         ,i          ,»           ^    „

These numbers represent what may be called the normal quotients.
   When the density of the vapour of a substance has been approxi-
matively determined, the quotient of the atomic weight by this den
sity is a number very near one of these normal quotients.                  This
operation immediately indicates the mode of condensation of the
vapour.      On the other hand, it is always easy to calculate the theo
retical density of a vapour of a substance by dividing its atomic
weight by one or other of the normal quotients.                 Thus, for the
immense majority, if not the whole, of the organic compounds, the
theoretical vapour density is found by dividing the atomic weight by
the number 2888.
   Some examples will show the exactitude and the advantages of
this mode of calculation.        When the atomic weight of acetic aether,
C8H804=88, is divided by the vapour density, which experiment
                                                             88
gives for this substance =3-112,           the quotient             is equal to
                                                          o* 1 1 2>
28-2, a number very near 28-88. This result indicates a condensa
tion to four volumes.           The theoretical vapour density of acetic
                         88
aether is therefore — -— - =3-047.

    When the atomic weight of chloride of sethyle = 64-5 is divided
by the vapour density of this substance, 2-22, the quotient is
= 29'0. This result indicates a condensation to four volumes. The
theoretical density of the vapour of chloride of sethyle is therefore
 64'5
¦        =2233.
28-88
    When the atomic weight of chloride of titanium =96 is divided
by the vapour density of this substance = 6-8, the quotient ob
tained is 14-12.        This number indicates a condensation into two
volumes.      The theoretical density of the vapour of chloride of tita-
                         96
nium is therefore            =6-648.
                       14-44
    This  mode of calculating the vapour density presents several ad
vantages    : it does not at all require the knowledge of the vapour
 densities of the elements of which a substance is composed.
    The formula of a compound is only taken into consideration in as
far as it serves to fix and calculate its equivalent.   This equivalent
being known, the nature and number of the elements contained in a
 compound are of little consequence.      The density of the vapour may
 be calculated independently of these data.
    With a great many substances, in fact, the vapour density is
 observed to depend entirely upon the weight of the equivalent.
 Thus caproic alcohol, C'»H,4Oe, propionate of sethyle, C16H10O4,
 and anhydrous acetic acid, C8 H6 O6, which with very different for
 mulae have the same equivalent, 102, have also the same vapour den
 sity, 3-332.     Carbonic acid and protoxide of nitrogen have the same
 equivalent,   22, and the same density, 1-524.    Formic acid, C3H204,
 and alcohol, C4 H6 04, have the same equivalent, 46, and the same
 density of vapour, 1-592. Phenole, ClsJH6Oa, and bisulphuret of
 methyle, C4 H5 S4, the composition of which is so different, have
 the same equivalent, 94, and the same density of vapour, 3*255.
    In general the vapour densities of substances which have the
 same equivalent are equal, or stand in very simple relations.         It
 therefore appears rational only to take into consideration the equi
 valent in calculating the vapour density. — Comptes Rendus, June 29,

     ON THE FORMATION         OF WATER BY   PLATINUM ELECTRODES.
                               BY M. BERTIN.
    Electricity, like heat, may give laminated platinum the property
 of producing the combination of hydrogen with oxygen either slowly
 or with explosion.
    When platinum plates have transmitted the current of at least
 forty elements into acidulated water, if they are covered by a bell-
 glass to collect the mixture of oxygen and hydrogen, this mixture
 detonates spontaneously as soon as the bell-glass is nearly full of gas.
     If the current be less energetic, the explosion of the mixture does
 not take place, but its slow recomposition maintains the volume
 of the gases constant, notwithstanding the incessant decomposition
 which takes place at the lower part of the electrodes.

  236             Intelligence and Miscellaneous      Articles.
      When the acidulated water is replaced by common water, the
   current of a pile of fifty elements is incapable of producing the deto
   nation of the mixture ; but the slow recomposition becomes very
   energetic, and the liquid is seen to oscillate in the bell-glass in con
   sequence of the unstable equilibrium which is established between
   the decomposition of the gases which takes place at the lower part
  of the electrodes, and the recomposition which is effected at their
  upper part.
      These phenomena are manifested with platinum plates supported
  below by platinum wires to which they are soldered, whether the
  surface of the platinum be naked or platinized. — Comptes Rendus,

    ON   THE OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF MAGNETIC BODIES. — SECOND
                           NOTE.    BY M. VERDET.
      In his previous note* the author stated that the compounds of
  manganese     acquired a positive rotatory power under the influence
 of magnetism.       He has since found a compound of that metal, the
 double cyanide of manganese and potassium (corresponding in its
 composition with the red ferrocyanide of potassium), the magnetic
 rotatory power of which is negative. Thus manganese represents
 to a certain extent the connexion between the two classes established
 by the author amongst the magnetic metals ; that which is the rule
 for compounds of iron is the exception for those of manganese, and
 vice versd.
     The corresponding double cyanides of cobalt and chromium both
 possess a positive magnetic rotatory power.           The double cyanide
 of cobalt and potassium is even diamagnetic.
     The author has now no doubt as to the negative magnetic rotatory
 power of the salts of cerium.       A sufficiently concentrated aqueous
 solution of chloride of cerium, under the action of magnetism, exerts
 upon polarized light an action opposite to that of water ; it is easily
 ascertained in consequence of the perfect limpidity of the liquid.
     The compounds of uranium and lanthanium have a negative mag
 netic rotatory power.       Nitrate of uranium in a state of purity is
 diamagnetic ; but the red and black oxides of uranium, which may
be extracted therefrom by the action of heat, are both magnetic.
 Uranium must therefore be classed amongst the magnetic metals.
 On dissolving nitrate of uranium in water, aether or alcohol, liquids
are obtained, the action of which upon polarized light is less than
that of the proportion of solvent contained in them.            The negative
action of the dissolved salt is therefore indisputable.
     Perfectly pure carbonate of lanthanium is strongly magnetic. The
solution of chloride of lanthanium obtained by treating this carbonate
with pure muriatic acid, when submitted to the action of magnetism,
exerts a less action upon polarized light than water.          The magnetic
rotatory power of chloride of lanthanium is therefore to be regarded
as negative.

the magnetic rotatory power is positive, but weak.
    Lithium and glucinum are diamagnetic metals ; the compounds
of these metals, received by the author from MM. Troost and Debray,

                   THE IMPROVED      INDUCTION    COIL.
        To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       Gentlemen,
    I had hoped that after the statement which I have been obliged to
 give, in the course of discussion, in the Mechanics' Magazine, of
 the proceedings of Dr. Noad and Mr. Bentley, that the latter gen
tleman would hardly have ventured to repeat his erroneous state
 ments in proof either of his priority or his originality.
    In his last communication he has prudently dropped the former
 question, but still endeavours to substantiate the latter by assertions
 which will be found to prove the reverse.      Mr. Bentley states that
his machine was not opened in my presence ; but this is immaterial,
 I am content to take his own description of it ; and when I explain
the construction of mine, which was made twelve months before his
was commenced, I think it will be seen that the two machines are
perfectly identical.
    1st. Mr. Bentley asserts, but I do not know upon what authority,
except his peculiar propensity for guessing, that I wind my second
ary wire close to the cheeks of the gutta-percha bobbin ; and that
he tried this plan himself at first, but could not succeed, and then
adopted the plan of winding each layer shorter than the preceding
one, so as to gain insulating space over the ends.       Mr. Bentley has
misrepresented my mode of arrangement, for        / do not wind my wire
close to the cheeks of the gutta-percha bobbin, but allow as much
of the insulating medium to project beyond the layers as is sufficient
to prevent the passage of sparks between them. I suppose that Mr.
Bentley mistook the material with which the outside of my coil is
finished, for wire ; it is not wire, though it looks like it ; and the
cheeks of gutta-percha have nothing to do with the coil, but are
merely put on for the sake of neatness.      In this first point, then, the
two machines are not dissimilar, but identical.
    2ndly. Mr. Bentley says that "his own coil differs from Mr.
Hearder's, and is formed of very fine parallel wires, each wire being
                                                             "
magnetically and electrically insulated from the others ; but he does
not say how mine is constructed, which I submit he ought to have
done in order to prove the dissimilarity which he assumes.          It hap
pens, however, and his friend Dr. Noad was perfectly aware of the
fact, that my iron wire is also composed of fine parallel wires, elec

  238             Intelligence   and Miscellaneous   Articles.
  trically and magnetically insulated from each other : so much for the
  second point of dissimilarity, or rather identity.
      The interruption of contact in Mr. Bentley's machine, which he
  says I noticed as peculiar, did not proceed, as he states, from any
  modification of the wire, but from his having adopted my stiff spring,
  which is one of the distinctive characteristics of my machine, and a
  point of identity which Mr. Bentley does not find it convenient to
  allude to.
     The rapid vibrations and modified appearances of the sparks are
  as peculiar to my machine as to his, and I have also the power of
 varying them at pleasure.        I confess that I should like to know by
 what means Mr. Bentley has arrived at the conclusion, that his
 spring has ever vibrated 2000 times per second ; I think he must
 have inadvertently inserted one cipher too many, or made an erro
  neous guess.
     Again, Mr. Bentley     states that another feature of dissimilarity  is,
 that he uses a number of coatings of thin gutta-percha in preference
 to fewer layers of thick tissue, &c.         If Mr. Bentley will refer to
 the Philosophical Magazine for December 1856, he will find that I
 use a stratum of oiled silk or sheet gutta-percha between the layers.
 I have also used thin vulcanized india-rubber tissue, and I use the
 thinnest material I can get, in a number of layers precisely as he
describes. Thus it appears that Mr. Bentley's falsely assumed points
of difference are really all points of the most perfect similarity, and
that to identify his name with his coil is a complete piece of pla
giarism.     I will now take the liberty of pointing out the peculiarly
distinctive features of my coil as compared with that of M. Ruhm-
korff, and show how these distinctive peculiarities have all so
 strangely appeared in Mr. Bentley's machine.
     1st, then, Ruhmkorff's secondary wire is covered with cotton ;
mine is covered with silk, and so is Mr. Bentley's.
     2nd. Ruhmkorff insulates the layers of his secondary wire with
 paper ; I use gutta-percha, and so does Mr. Bentley.
     3rd. Ruhmkorff uses a hammer at the end of a lever, resting by
 its own gravity upon an anvil, to break contact ; but I use a very
 stiff spring for the purpose, the vibrations of which I can modify at
pleasure, and so does Mr. Bentley.
     4th. Ruhmkorff uses iron rods about a quarter of an inch thick for
the core of his machine ; I use thin wires electrically and magneti
cally insulated from each other, and so does Mr. Bentley.
     5th. Ruhmkorff for his condenser uses about twelve or fourteen
feet of tinfoil folded between sheets of oiled silk.      I have used oiled
silk, vulcanized india-rubber, gutta-percha, cartridge-paper, and var
nished paper, and I make my condenser of very large dimensions.
Mr. Bentley uses varnished paper and does the same.
    These peculiarities of my machine were all thoroughly known to
Dr. Noad more than six months before he and Mr. Bentley brought
out the machine in question ; and I may be pardoned for reassert
ing, though it should be for the fifth time, my claim to be con
sidered as the originator of this new form of induction coil in

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              239
England.     I have no desire to press this discussion further; but
if I find it at all necessary, I shall not hesitate to publish the whole
of the correspondence betwixt Dr. Noad and myself, by which my
position with regard to him and Mr. Bentley will be still better
understood.     In conclusion, I may state that the whole of this very
unpleasant affair would have been avoided if Dr. Noad, when he
introduced the machine to the public, had been candid enough to
allude to my previous labours, which he himself was the means of
keeping from the public.
              I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen,
                                         Yours very obediently,

ON A MODIFIED       FORM OF EUHMKORFf's INDUCTION APPARATUS.
                             BY E. S. RITCHIE.
   The induction apparatus made by RuhmkorfF and described by
Du Moncel is probably familiar to many of your readers.           By it is
obtained a spark three-fourths of an inch through the atmosphere.
Mr. Hearder has described in the London Philosophical Magazine
(Nov. and Dec. 1856) certain improvements by which he has length
ened the spark to 3 inches.
   The great difficulty experienced by him was in obtaining sufficient
insulation between one stratum of the wire and the next above or
below it, the entire thickness of the helix — including wire and insu
lation — being only about half an inch, and a tension of electricity
sufficient to throw a spark 3 inches existing between the outer and
inner strata.
   M. Stohrer has adopted the plan of dividing the coil into three
divisions, thus lessening the difficulty ; still, great danger exists of
the spark passing, which would ruin the helix.
    I have endeavoured to obviate this by winding the coil the entire
thickness as it progresses.    I commenced with a glass tube or bobbin,
laying the first course on a cone at as great an angle as the wire
could be conveniently laid — say about 50°. The diameter at the
tube was about 2^ inches, and the greatest diameter 3^ inches, the
length of the cone being nearly     \ an inch.   When the stratum was
laid and cemented by resin and bees- wax, a ring of thin vulcanized
india-rubber was stretched over and cemented, the wire passed down
to the glass cylinder, and this wire covered also by india-rubber;
then another stratum was laid in the same manner, that is, the
coil is built up precisely as a cop is laid by a mule- spinner.      The
advantages are, that the wire in each conical layer is very short, and
only a slight tension can exist between them.
   With a helix thus made, with less than 7000 feet of wire, I ob
tained a spark of 2£ inches ; and with one since constructed on the
same principle, with 30,000 feet of wire, differing only so far as I
found necessary to enable me to wind the helix by a machine which
I constructed for the purpose, I have obtained sparks over 6 inches
long.
   I  have constructed    the condenser  with oiled silk, with very thin

 240             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 gutta-percha, and with paper of different thicknesses; but find
 tissue-paper varnished and used double, according to Mr. Bentley's
 plan, the best. The surfaces used in the instruments above described
  are respectively about 30 and 75 square feet.        I have used all the
  interrupters alluded to by the writers above mentioned, but prefer
  one which I have made thus : — The anvil is a wire or small rod of
  platinum secured in a plate by a binding-screw ; over this a rod of
  platinum is secured in the same manner to a spring which presses
  them together ; another spring loaded acts like a hammer upon the
  end of the first spring, to separate the platinum rods.        A ratchet-
 wheel presses down this spring-hammer, and allows it to recoil and
  strike the other spring.      By this the interruption is more instanta
 neously    made,   and  the distance to which the platinum rods are sepa
 rated easily regulated. This point appears to be of importance.
 The spark is lessened if the platinum rods are separated further than
  actually to break their contact. The usual primary helix of large
 wire and the interior bundle of iron wires are placed within the glass
  tube.
     In my last instrument, I used a tube closed at the top, more effect
 ually to cut off the passage of the current from one end to the other
  through the primary helix or iron wires.        I have used a Biinsen's
 battery of four to Six cells ; four give the spark of as great length,
 but a few more cells increase the volume.         I have applied a battery
 of eighteen cells, and also a plate battery of fifty- six pairs, without
 endangering the coil.        The instrument is undoubtedly capable of
 being greatly increased in size and power.
     Boston, May 2, 1857.
     P.S. Since writing my paper, I have constructed a helix in which
 the plane of the strata of wires is perpendicular to the tube, insulated
 as before.    With one of the same length of wire as the largest one
 before: mentioned, — throwing a spark, with six cells, 6 inches, — I
 have used a battery of eighteen cells (Bunsen's) ; but by using a
 battery of three series of six cells (that is, an intensity of six, and
 quantity of three), a very voluminous spark was obtained ; as the
 action soon became feeble, I took the secondary coil from the glass
 cylinder and found that the current had passed through the glass near
 each end of the coil, forming a circuit through the primary wire ;
 two minute holes, of a hair's breadth, from one-tenth to one-eighth
 of an inch in diameter, were drilled through, but the glass was not
fractured ; it also passed through several thicknesses of vulcanized
 india-rubber.      The helix was uninjured, proving the insulation ob
 tained by the mode of winding it. A more perfect insulation between
 the helices is readily made ; and I now use a tube of gutta-percha over
 the glass. With powerful batteries the condenser of varnished paper
 is not sufficient, as the current passes entirely through, and with
 such I use oiled silk.      I have put several condensers in the same

      My dear Tyndall,              Jermyn Street, September 14, 1857.
       the following pages I have given you some account of the
 IN experiments      and observations upon the structure of glacier
ice, which, at your suggestion,      I commenced during our sojourn
at the Montanvert this autumn.            No one knows better than
yourself   how  much    these subjects grow under the hands of the
inquirer, and how little claim my brief investigations have to the
character of completeness.       Nevertheless my conclusions, so far
as they go, are based on such clear and decisive evidence, and
are so totally opposed to the views entertained by the highest
authorities, that  I  feel I shall be doing more good by publishing
than by withholding them.
   I  will in the first place state what      I have myself observed
with regard to the structure and the permeability of glacier ice,
and afterwards   I  will compare my results with those which have
been arrived at by others.
   Structure of Glacier Ice. — A mass of ice freshly extracted from
any part of the Mer de Glace, the Glacier du Geant, or the
glacier of La Brenva, at a depth of 8 or 10 inches from the sur
face, always presented the following characters when examined
either with the naked eye, or with a lens of a magnifying power
of thirty or forty diameters.
   It broke with a vitreous fracture ; and when the surface was
made even, either with a sharp knife, or by rubbing on a warm sur
face, it appeared perfectly smooth and glassy, exhibiting not the

least trace of fissures.       Minute shallow pits, however, were scat
 tered over   it,   and became particularly obvious when            a coloured
fluid was poured on to the surface and then wiped away again,
inasmuch as under these circumstances every pit retained                 a very
 small portion of the colour.
    The mass was, as usual, traversed         by   a larger or smaller num
ber of parallel blue veins (whose lenticular form was almost
 always very apparent, particularly in the Brenva)             ;  and when a
 thin section was made perpendicular to the plane of the veins
 and viewed      by  transmitted light,  it    became obvious that the ice
 formed one continuous mass,         without    fissures or interruptions of
 continuity of any kind.        It  contained, however, a multitude of
 small, closed, and perfectly distinct chambers, and           it   was to the
 absence or rarity of these in the course of the veins that the
 latter owed their transparency and blueness.
    The form and contents of these chambers were exceedingly
remarkable.        In blue vein, and in those parts of the interme
                      a
 diate " white ice
                       " which were contiguous to blue vein,
                                                           a               they
 were always round or oval disks, with extremely flat and closely
 approximated sides so that, viewed in one plane, they looked
                       ;
like circles ;    but in   a  plane at right angles to this, like narrow
parallelograms.          In  the  white ice midway between the blue
veins,   on  the  other   hand,I   very generally noticed an irregularity
of form, which was in many instances so great that the cavities
appeared to be ramified.             The walls of the chambers very
frequently     appeared     to  be a   little roughened, or, as         itwere,
frosted.
    Every chamber, without exception, which            I  carefully examined
contained both water and air.                The former was commonly
present in larger quantities than the latter, which swam as                  a
bubble in the water, and could very often be made to move
about in the chamber like the bubble of                a    spirit-level.    It
seemed to me, though           I   will not pretend to lay     it   down as  a
rule, that the air was more abundant in proportion to the water
in the more irregular chambers. Where the air was in large
proportion to the water, the bubble of course became more or
less completely supported          bythe walls of the containing cavity,
and to  a   certain extent assumed its form        ;   but where, as in the
majority    of  cases,  the  air-bubble    was  small   in proportion to the
water,   its figure   was   spheroidal,    and  totally different from that
of the containing cavity.       I    mention this particularly, because,
as
 I    shall show below, the chambers (which for distinction's sake
I  will term the " water-chambers       ")     have been confounded with
the air-bubbles, and the form which           is   characteristic of the one
has been erroneously ascribed to the other.
I     had no means of measuring the dimensions of the water-

           Prof. Huxley    on the Structure of Glacier Ice.       243
chambers, but at a guess I should say they varied from a tenth
to a fiftieth or a sixtieth of an inch in diameter.
    The line of contact of the water in the water-chambers with
the ice was optically perfectly well defined, and easily distin
guishable.             I
                Hence have no hesitation in saying, that if canals
or fissures of any appreciable size filled with water had existed
in the ice,   I must, with the magnifying power employed, have
discovered some trace of them ; but,        I repeat, nothing of the
kind was discernible in perfectly fresh ice.
    If the existence of fluid water dispersed through its substance
in closed chambers is shown by future observations to be a
universal character of glacier ice (and     I cannot imagine that a
structure universally prevalent      in the Mer de Glace, the Geant,
 the Brenva, and, as    I shall show by-and-bye, from M. Agassiz's
figures, in the Aar glacier also, is a mere local peculiarity), it
 appears to me to be a fact of primary importance.         For what  I
have described is the structure of the unchanged ice of the
glacier — of ice which has been protected from solar or atmo
 spheric influences by that which covered it ; and it must be
 remembered that the ice which is within a foot of the surface
 on the Mer de Glace opposite the Montanvert, must have
 formed a part of the very depths of the tributary glaciers.        In
 other words, the ice which is at this moment, say a hundred
feet below the surface in the Glacier du Geant, will, in conse
 quence of ablation, form the superficial ice of some part of the
 Mer de Glace years hence. Consequently, unless it can be
 shown that the substance of a glacier, as it approaches the sur
 face, is exposed to some influences capable of developing the
 water-chambers and their contents, it is to be presumed that
 the structure found near the surface in the lower part of a
 glacier is the structure which prevails throughout the thickness
 of the higher part ; and hence that the structure described is
 that of unaltered glacier ice in general.       This conclusion, as I
 shall immediately show, is directly confirmed by the boring
 experiments and by the figures of M. Agassiz.
     M. Agassiz's deductions, however, are totally at variance with
 mine; and he is so generally quoted as an authority in these
 matters, that    I feel compelled, however unwillingly, to enter
 into a detailed criticism of his views, which are contained in the

 the sake of more convenient reference, in successive order.

 glacier ice) contains, like the ice of the Neve, a notable quantity
 of air. But there is this difference between the two, that in
 the compact ice the air, instead of being distributed through
 the whole mass, is united in small perfectly circumscribed

bubbles,  whilst the interspaces of these bubbles are perfectly"
transparent, so that without being as diaphanous as ordinary
water-ice, the compact ice has not the opacity of Neve ice.
Moreover, it is more compact, and what is especially character
istic, it presents no trace of granular structure : a fragment
exposed to the action of heat does not become resolved into
grains of Neve, but breaks up into angular fragments.
    " This difference of structure is accompanied by a greater
impermeability ; water no longer traverses the mass with the
same ease and uniformity, but is seen to follow in preference
certain angular routes which are the capillary fissures." — P. 151.
        " The means employed by nature to maintain this

amount of plasticity and compressibility in glacier ice is the

                      the bubbles of air which on approaching the
 surface escape through the ice, where they have been dilated                    by
the effect of diathermanicity, and cause the parietes of the ice to
burst when they are no longer sufficiently strong to resist the
 dilatation of the air."— P. 153.
    (4)
         " The air-bubbles undergo no less curious modifications.
In the neighbourhood of the Neve, where they are most nume
rous, those which one sees at the surface are all spherical or
ovoid ;   but     by
                   degrees they begin to be flattened, and near the
end of the glacier there are some which are so flat, that they might
be taken for fissures when seen in profile.       The drawing, pi.               6,
fig. 10, represents        bit of ice detached from the gallery of
                           a
infiltration.    All the bubbles are greatly flattened. But what
is  most extraordinary         is,
                              that, far from being uniform, the flat
tening      different in each fragment, so that the bubbles, accord
           is
ing to the face which they offer, appear either very broad or very
thin.     I know of no more significant fact than this, since                    it
demonstrates that each fragment of ice         capable of undergoing
                                                   is

depth.     While    engaged   in my boring experiments,     observed  I
attentively   the  fragments of ice brought up to the surface                    by
the borer.      found in them almost flat bubbles, perfectly similar
                I

to 65 metres.      I observed, besides, that in the fragments which
proceeded from a great depth, all the bubbles without exception
were strongly flattened, whilst at less depths there were some
less compressed and even altogether round, as at the surface.
   " It follows, hence, that a strong pressure is exercised in the
interior of the glacier." — P. 167.
        " ought also to mention a singular property of these

air-bubbles, which at first was very surprising, but afterwards
admitted of very satisfactory explanation.        When a fragment
containing air-bubbles is exposed to the action of the sun, the
bubbles insensibly enlarge. Soon, in proportion as they enlarge,
a transparent    drop shows itself on some point of the bubble.
This drop in enlarging contributes its share to the enlargement
of the cavity, and as it progresses it predominates over the
air-bubble.     The latter then swims in the midst of a zone of
water, and incessantly tends to reach the most elevated point, at
least if the flatness of the cavity does not hinder it." — Pp. 167,
168.
    (7) In a note appended to this passage, M. Agassiz speaks
of the irregularity of the walls of some of the bubbles, and adds,
 " The same effect has been
                                 produced upon the bubbles of the
fragment fig. 10.      There also all the bubbles have enlarged by
diathermanicity, and a little drop has developed in the middle of
each.     But as the cavities are very small, the drops do not yet
move freely in their cavity."
    It will be observed that in Nos. 1, 4, 5, 6, M. Agassiz con
founds together the water-chambers and the air-bubbles under
 the common term of " bubbles," and he affirms (6) that the pre
 sence of water in the " air-bubbles
                                         " is the effect of exposure to
the sun's rays, and of the different diathermanicity of air and ice*.
A careful analysis of M. Agassiz's facts, however, is very in
 structive.                         I
               In the first place, recognize in his fig. 10. pi. 6, a
fair, though rough and sketchy, representation of the general
arrangement and form of the water-chambers with their con
tained air-bubbles.      The chambers are as usual flattened, but
the artist has rightly represented their contained air-bubbles as
spheroidal.      The strangest thing     is,however, that M. Agassiz
has taken the air-bubbles for drops of water, and the drops of
water for air-bubbles, as any one who           familiar with the mi
                                               is

description in (7) with the figure 10. In the next place,           re

peatedly    exposed thin  plates of ice to the sun, carefully watching
the air-bubbles, without being able to observe the phaenomena

and partial phenomenon.

  detailed by M. Agassiz in (6) ; and I must frankly confess              I
  do not understand how such changes as those described are re-
  concileable with the commonest properties of ice and air. How
  do the bubbles enlarge when exposed to the sun ? M. Agassiz has
  already admitted that the chambers are closed (1), and we know
'that ice is not readibly distensible; and therefore          I  hold it to
  be impossible that the bubbles should visibly dilate before
  the melting of the adjacent ice ; and as to enlarging by the
  melting of the ice- wall, the fractional difference between the
 volume of water and the ice from which it proceeds, would be
  wholly imperceptible on such a scale. With regard to the ex
  planation of the crackling noise given in (3), 1 can only say
  that  I  have repeatedly watched a thin lamina of ice melting,
  both by transmitted and reflected light, and that I have seen
 the walls of the chambers reduced to the thinnest pellicle with
  out being broken by pressure from within.              The air-bubbles
  escape quite quietly as soon as their wall is perforated.       Further
 more, the cavities left where the air-bubbles have been, are not
 fissures at all, but, as    I have said above, rounded pits. Indeed,
 this is a necessary consequence from M. Agassiz's own state
 ments with regard to the shape of the bubbles.
     M. Agassiz affirms in (5), that ice brought up from a depth
 of 65 metres was perfectly similar in structure to that repre
 sented in his figure 10.         The fact is important ; but surely it
 alone affords sufficient evidence that " diathermanicity
                                                                     " has
 nothing to do with the formation of the cavities and their watery
 contents.       And indeed in (4) this same piece of ice (fig. 10)
 is said to have come from the " gallery of infiltration," a cavity
 perfectly shaded, and bored many feet below the surface of the
 glacier.     So that either this figure does not represent the struc
 ture   of  the glacier at this point, or the structure is unaltered,
 and diathermanicity has nothing to do with it.
     It follows, therefore, that there is no evidence to show that
 the influence of solar radiation has anything to do with the
 structure; on the contrary, M. Agassiz's facts strengthen my
 case.
     If  it be the universal character of glacier ice to be full of
 closed cavities containing fluid water and air, it becomes a matter
 of extreme interest to ascertain how the air and the water come
 there ; how it is that the water retains its fluidity, and how it
 is that the water-chambers are compressed.             It may seem a
 common-place comparison,          but the ice and  its cavities  contain
 ing   water   remind   me of nothing so much as a Gruyere cheese,
 in which one so often meets with closed cavities containing fluid
 and air.      Let the Neve represent moist curds and the glacier
 valley   the   cheese-press, and the analogy is perhaps closer than

              Prof. Huxley on   the Structure   of   Glacier Ice.         247
it looks.    But these are questions for you to solve ; and I will
 only venture on one other supposition, viz. that the water-cham
 bers have the value of a register thermometer, indicating that
the minimum temperature to which the mass of a glacier de
 scends is never for long less than 32° ; otherwise    cannot conI
 ceive how the water should remain fluid ; and if it were once
 frozen, how could it melt again ?
    M. Agassiz makes a very important observation in (4), and one
which I am glad to be able to confirm in the main.           I took
some pains to ascertain the general direction of the planes of
the water-chambers, and I found that in the substance of the
blue veins they were sometimes parallel to the plane of the
latter, while in the white ice their planes were always more or
less inclined to the veins, usually forming an acute angle, and
never, so far as   I
                   have seen, a right angle with them.     Further
more,   as Prof. Agassiz points out,   the water-chambers are ar
ranged in groups, all the members of the same group having
parallel planes, while their direction is more or less inclined to
that of neighbouring groups. It seems to me very probable that,
as Prof. Agassiz suggests, the different directions of the planes
of the cavities may indicate internal changes of place of segments
of ice corresponding with the groups ; but, as               I
                                                      have already
said, no fissures separating these segments are to be found in
the deep ice of a glacier, and hence we cannot with propriety
speak of them as
                   " fragments."
    Such is the structure which        I
                                       have found to obtain in all
"  deep
        "  glacier ice, by which   I
                                   mean, all ice situated more than a
few inches below the surface. It is as solid as glass or marble, and
as devoid of any but accidental and gross fissures.         The glacier,
however, where exposed to the atmosphere, presents what may
be called a " superficial layer
                                 " of very different character. Every
one who has had occasion to cut an escalier, must have been
struck with the difference between the resistance to the ice-axe
at the first blow and that at the fourth or fifth.         At the first,
the jar to the hand is slight, and fragments of ice          fly
                                                            in all direc
tions but, at the last, one might almost as
     ;                                            well be  hewing some

    7 or 8 inches is perhaps rather above than below their average

    whenever you clear away the superficial layer, you find beneath
    it whatI    have termed " deep

    parallel to the veins, and shows no disposition to break up into
    the angular fragments so characteristic of the superficial layer.

    to disprove the existence of fissures in the deep ice, and that
    such fissures are present, though invisible in consequence of
    being filled with water.      I have already shown that the line of
    contact of water and ice       optically well marked, and that there
                                  is

    of experiments made with coloured fluids. It         said that glacier

and the west shore of the Mer de Glace, where the veins were
well developed, their planes having a general north and south
direction, but dipping at an angle of about 70° towards the
centre of the glacier.                                             I
                               On the northern aspect of the ice cut
away the superficial layer, so as to form two faces of a cube
of about a foot in the side on the deep ice.               One of these
faces    looked   westward,   and   was   consequently nearly parallel to
the cleavage; the other looked northward, and was therefore
nearly perpendicular to it. Perpendicular to the west face, and
therefore to the structural planes, I bored a hole with an auger,
about an inch in diameter and 9 inches long, and just suffi
ciently inclined to the horizon to hold the infusion of logwood,
with which I filled it. I then thinned away the north face of
the cube very carefully until the north wall of the hole was
 less than 2 inches in thickness — until, in fact,      I  could see the
 dark fluid through the substance of the several blue veins which
 it traversed with perfect distinctness.
     For two hours not the slightest trace of leakage or infiltra
 tion into the substance of the ice forming the walls of this
 cavity could be observed; and the contour of the contained
 liquid remained perfectly sharp and well defined. It then began
  to leak at one point near its upper end through a small crack
  in the white ice, which led directly outwards. The liquid spread
  neither up nor down in the crack.            Four hours afterwards no
  change whatever had taken place in the liquid contained in the
  lower part of the hole.       At this time you joined me upon the ice,
  and you will recollect that I carefully thinned away the wall with
  a sharp knife until in some parts it was not more than      \ of an inch
  thick.     Still no infiltration occurred. The knife at length acci
  dentally penetrated the wall, and the liquid at once flowed out.
   I then poured some clean water through the hole, and all trace
   of the coloured infusion was at once so thoroughly removed,
   that, on cutting away one wall, the other appeared perfectly
   clean and of its natural aspect.
      I have given the details of this one experiment in order to
   show in what manner all were made ; but it is unnecessary to
   be equally prolix with regard to the others.          Suffice it to say,
   that,  whether   the  holes   were  bored  perpendicular to the struc
   ture or parallel with     it, or at any intermediate angle, whether
   in white ice or in blue vein, the result was precisely the same,
                     a
   not particle of fluid making its way into the surrounding sub
     a
   stance of the ice along the veins, nor in most cases in any other
   way.     Occasionally a    leakage would take place in the manner
   described above, but the fissures in these cases were gross and
   visible, and their direction had no reference whatsoever to that
    of the structure.       Indeed, as the leakage always took place

 towards the surface, and not into the depth of the ice,        am inI
 clined to think that these cracks were produced in cutting the
 ice to thin away the outer wall of the cavity.
   I   repeated these experiments in the neighbourhood of the
 Grand Moulin ; on the Moraine du Noire, somewhat higher than
the Couvercle ; and on different parts of the Glacier du Geant,
and everywhere with similar results.             Furthermore, having
 carefully  bored  a vertical hole in   the   deep ice of the Mer de
Glace, opposite the Montanvert,        I
                                      filled it with the infusion, and
having covered over the aperture with a roof of ice-blocks,        left  I
it until the next morning. It rained hard during the night ;
and on revisiting the spot after an interval of about fifteen
         I
hours, found that the covering blocks had slipped off, and that
the liquid occupied only about the lower two-thirds of the cavity.
No trace of infiltration could be discovered ; but the lower part
of the cavity had changed its figure from cylindrical to irregular
and botryoidal.        I
                      conceive that the sinking of the fluid must
be accounted for by the enlargement of the cavity consequent
upon this botryoidal excavation of its walls ; and         I
                                                          suppose that
the ice-blocks proving an insufficient shelter, the rain poured
into the hole, and keeping up a constant supply of comparatively
warm liquid, eroded its walls in the way described.           However
this may be, the fact that the liquid had produced a fresh sur
face for itself, is important, as it shows that the absence of in
filtration through the veins intersected by the cavities containing
the coloured infusion is not dependent on a condensation of
their walls by the auger.
     To eliminate any error of this kind, however,         I
                                                      took a small
 block of the deep ice, and with a sharp knife fashioned it into a
 cup, whose walls varied in thickness from          \
                                               to frds of an inch.
 Filled with the infusion and surrounded with ice, this cup re
mained for two hours without showing a trace of infiltration
along its structural planes.
   • I can
           only conclude from these experiments, that the chief
substance of a glacier is as essentially impermeable as a mass of
marble or slate ; and that though it may be traversed here and
there by fissures and cracks, these no more justify us in speaking
of glacier ice as " porous/' than the joints and fissures in a
slate quarry give us a right to term slate porous.      We do not
call iron porous because water runs out of a cracked kettle.
    The extreme porosity of what I have termed the " superficial
layer," however, is no less certain, and inasmuch as this layer
is continually and rapidly wasting away at its surface, it must
be as constantly reformed from the solid glacier ice beneath.
    The fact observed by Professor Agassiz, that under a moraine
(that   is,   where covered and protected     by   stone and gravel)         the

            Prof. Huxley    on the Structure  of Glacier Ice,       251
superficial ice is of the same character as the deep, suggested
the idea that the superficial layer is the result of the operation
of atmospheric influences ; and that just as a bed of impervious
rock becomes broken up into fragments, separated by permeable
interstices, down to a certain depth wherever it is exposed to
the atmosphere, so the glacier ice when left unprotected under
goes a similar weathering and disintegration.           I submitted this
notion to the test of experiment in the following way : — Not far
from the upper end of the Moraine du Noire, and on one bank
of a stream which cuts its way down the Glacier du Geant,              I
cleared away the superficial layer and cut out a block of the
deeper ice, which was then divided into two equal portions of
irregular cuboidal form, and about 8 inches in the side.
   The logwood infusion was poured on both of these, and was
retained only by such portions of the superficial layer as had
been allowed to remain.           Water poured on to the blocks ran
off them as it would run from marble or glass, sinking only
into the remains of the superficial layer.           I  then placed the
two blocks side by side, on an elevated ridge of the glacier,
with their natural upper faces turned towards the sun, at this
time (1*15 p.m.) shining brightly; the one block I left with
out protection,      while the other was just covered by a stone
of 4 or 5 inches in thickness, resting upon its upper face. At
                                                          I
l-40, that is to say in less than half an hour, removed the
block of stone and poured the infusion over both pieces of ice.
The covered one could be as little infiltrated as before, while the
face of the uncovered became at once beautifully injected, the
fluid instantly running into a network of little superficial fissures
which had developed themselves, and out of which the infusion
could be only partially extracted by washing.
   Both pieces of ice were well washed, and the stone was re
placed on the one, while the other was left uncovered as before.
                                                I
   In the course of the ensuing half-hour examined bath blocks
several times.       The covered ice remained unchanged; but in
the uncovered, the fissures extended further and further into the
mass, which gradually assumed throughout the granular aspect
of the superficial layer.       Water poured on its surface soaked
into it immediately,     and  a  small quantity of the infusion spread
out, the moment it reached the block, in the most beautifully
ramified figure through the fissures.        Particularly large and ap
parent   fissures  could  thus  be frequently observed traversing the
middle   of  the  blue veins.   At length the fissures extended com
pletely through the mass, which thus became truly sponge-like.
Water poured on its surface, filling the interstices, gave the
mass a clear and semitransparent         aspect, though by no means
to be compared to that of a blue vein.             But as soon as the

252             Prof. Huxley        on the Structure        of Glacier Ice.
supply of water ceased, the fissures of the side uppermost imme
diately began to lose their water, which drained away below, and
becoming filled with air, a whitish opake hue succeeded.        On
reversing the block suddenly, what had been its under surface
appeared at first clear, but the water soon deserting       rapidly        it,  it
whitened, while the previous upper and white surface became
clear. Water poured upon the upper surface, traversed the mass
and flowed out again below with the utmost ease.       In fact                       it   is
impossible to conceive any more striking contrast in these re
spects, than that between the freshly extracted ice-block (or that
which had remained under cover) and that which had been exposed.
    So far as    may be permissible to draw
                    it                             conclusion from

weathering but  ;        it        by
                            no means essential, for the northern

    But one conclusion appears to me to be deducible from these
experiments, and that      in perfect accordance with the results
                                   is
of ocular investigation. Glacier ice      essentially devoid of all
                                                       is

not essential.    But          remarkable feature of glacier ice,

different from the superficial fissures which have just been de

on the walls of crevasses and in the interior of cavities where
the rays of the sun never penetrate.      They are larger than the
little fissures which have just been mentioned, and far less nu
merous, particularly in the regions in which the latter abound.

ranged in bands and zones, which, becoming more completely in
filtrated with water than the intermediate ice, appear blue and
transparent, and are the blue veins.

          " Thequantity of bubbles with which the white ice is
    (9)
filled, is the reason why the fissures are more slowly propa
gated in it; the air, by its elasticity, being unfavourable to
the formation of fissures (l'air qui est de sa nature elastique ne
favorisant aucunement le crevassement) .    By degrees, however,
and in proportion as the infiltration perpetuates itself, the ri
gidity increases, and the fissures multiply in proportion. Every
bubble that a fissure meets in its course loses its aeriform con
tents.    It becomes transparent, and the opacity of the mass
is so far diminished.   The consequence of this multiplication of
fissures is continually to diminish the number of bubbles, and
by this means to render the ice more and more transparent and
blue.
    " It will be evident to any one who has followed the progress
of modern physics, that this phsenomenon is due solely to the
diathermanicity of ice. The air first and then the water becomes
heated through the ice.       However minute may be the degree of
heat which is thus transmitted to them, it is enough to melt a
part of the ice which surrounds them, and thereby to increase
the cavity in which they are imprisoned.             I
                                                   do not think, how
ever, that any very great importance should be ascribed to this
phenomenon ; and the fact that it is produced only when the ice
is exposed directly to the rays of the sun, is in my eyes an indi
cation that it exercises no notable influence on the mechanism
of glaciers."— P. 157.

in  it,water and air penetrate into the fissures with great facility.

     a                      few decimetres on the side be detached
                            a
from the bottom of crevasse, in that part of the glacier where
                        a

a  few fissures will appear on the surface, then these fissures will
be gradually propagated into the interior, and the network be
coming more and more complex, will             by
                                              degrees reach the base.
If, then, the block of ice be turned upside down, and water be
poured upon       it,
                   all the fissures will disappear from above down
wards, in the same order as they were formed.          The block will
remain perfectly transparent      so long  as   it saturated
                                                     is        but so
                                                                 ;
soon as one leaves off watering, the fissures reappear where they
last appeared when thu block was reversed." — P. 161.

the more numerous the fissures. The same thing would happen
to the glacier if its thickness were less, and if the external heat
had access to it on all sides.       Nevertheless its surface decom
poses more or less, the fissures dilate in consequence of the
circulation, and the fragments are so dislocated as to be
moveable on one another without however becoming detached."
—P. 163.
           " The angular fragments and the capillary fissures
    (12)
seem to disappear the moment the ice is covered.                Thus on
sweeping clean a part of a moraine, or the side of a gravel
cone, the ice beneath is found to be perfectly smooth, and appa
rently without a trace of a fracture.          But it is sufficient to
leave these same surfaces uncovered for some instants, and the
capillary fissures immediately show themselves, and, in conse
quence, the angular fragments.          They appear with such regu
larity, that one might be tempted to believe that they are formed
spontaneously at the very moment of their appearance.              But on
examining them with a little attention, one becomes convinced
 that they are of older date.
 -  " by no means pretend to deny that heat, acting suddenly
        I
at the moment the moraine is uncovered, may not develope
some cracks.      I have myself seen such cracks form suddenly
 (par eclat), but I   conceive they are but few.       If it were other
wise, and if the fissures were formed as they appear, it would
be necessary to suppose that there are none in the ice of the
moraine before it is uncovered, which would be contrary to all
we know of the transformations of the ice." — P. 165.
           " Let us now make the opposite experiment, and cover
    (13)
with sand and gravel a portion of the surface of the glacier.
 However fissured and disaggregated it may be, the fissures and
 angular fragments will disappear at the end of some time so
 completely, that on removing the gravel the surface will be
found as compact and transparent as that of a portion of mo
raine which has never been uncovered.           And yet it is not pro
 bable that the fissures have reunited during the interval.          Itis,
on the contrary, the gravel, which, intercepting the air and
keeping the fissures full of water, renders them invisible, and
gives to the whole mass        a   false appearance of compactness,
which ceases the moment the air again has access to the
fissures." — P. 166.
   If   the extract (8) were to be taken merely as    a    description of
the superficial layer of   a   glacier,
                                     I    should only have to object,
 that, so far as
              I    have been able to observe, the colour of the dis
integrated blue veins    is   not much affected      by  the water they
 contain,   and  that  no  amount    of  watery infiltration  will confer
 on the white ice the beautiful transparency and colour of the

blue veins.    But Prof. Agassiz over and over again affirms that
the whole substance of the glacier is traversed by capillary
fissures, and his infiltration experiments are supposed by him
self conclusively to demonstrate the fact.                       I
                                                 must confess, how
              I
ever, that have neither been able to observe what Prof. Agassiz
supposes he has observed, nor, were our observations in unison,
could   I admit his explanations.
    Take for instance the citation (9).    How can the elasticity of
the air-bubbles influence the formation of fissures in the con
tinuous mass of rigid and eminently brittle ice which encloses
them ?     How is the statement, that the ice becomes more rigid
 as the fissures are developed in                   it,
                                      these fissures being supposed
 to be filled with water, compatible with that made in (2), that
 this same water       the chief source of the plasticity and com
                            is
 pressibility of ice        ?
    Again,   Iam at    loss to understand the " diathermanicity"
                            a
 theory.    Prof. Agassiz brings forward no experimental proof
 that air contained within ice      more heated  is   the sun's rays  by
 than the ice itself; and, a priori,    seems improbable that the
                                                      it
 more diathermanous body should be more heated than the less.
 It true, cannot pretend to have " followed the progress of

 the fact, that you, who have, seem to find at least equal difficulty
in adopting Prof. Agassiz's explanation.
   With regard to the experiments detailed in (10), (12), and
 (13), will be observed that my results in the main agree with
        it
those of Prof. Agassiz,         as before, we confine ourselves to the

the    conclusions   drawn    from   the  structure of the superficial
layer to the deep ice. This, however,           what Prof. Agassiz has

                  it   is
out a    suggestion which would have led to the solution of his
 difficulty, because
                            " contrary to all we know of the trans

 formations of the ice."        What do we know at present of the
 transformations of the ice                 ?
    It  is important to remark again, that as regards matters                     of
fact,   Prof. Agassiz' statements with respect even to the deep
                                s
 ice are, so far as they go, not essentially different from mine.
 He admits (12) that no fissures are at first visible in the deep
 ice; — had he taken the trouble to make the experiment, he
 would have found also that coloured liquids cannot be made
 to enter    it— and he admits that the establishment of complete

singular that in (12) Prof. Agassiz states that "the angular
fragments and the capillary fissures seem to disappear the mo
ment the ice is covered," while in (13) the operation is said to
take some time ; but, supposing the fact to be as Prof. Agassiz
says, it seems to me to be in the highest degree probable that
the fissures have reunited during the interval.           At any rate, I
cannot admit Prof. Agassiz's explanation, for surely loose gravel
is not exactly a substance calculated to " intercept air and
keep fissures full of water."
    It would take up too much space, and serve no useful pur
pose, to quote at length the account Prof. Agassiz gives of his
infiltration experiments (Syst. Glaciaire, pp. 170-179).            Those
who will turn to the original, will find that they are all vitiated
by the absence of any discrimination between the deep and the
superficial ice, and between
                                   " capillary fissures" and accidental
cracks.      Not one of Prof. Agassiz's experiments affords the
slightest evidence that capillary fissures are a primitive and
essential constituent of the structure of the deep ice of a glacier.
    The experiments of the Messrs. Schlagiutweit         (/. c. p. 12) ap
pear to me to be equally inconclusive these gentlemen, like
                                                 ;
Prof. Agassiz, having omitted to take the precaution of clearing
away the superficial layer from the mouth of the cavity to be
filled with the infiltration fluid. Unless this be done, the super
ficial layer sucks up the coloured liquid, which becomes diffused
in the way they describe.          And if   the cavity (as may readily
happen, especially with such large ones as those employed             by
these experimenters) communicates           by an accidental fissure with
some other part of the surface of the glacier (say the wall of         a
crevasse, or the roof of such    a    cavity as Prof. Agassiz's infiltra
tion gallery), it  should be well remembered that the fluid which
drains through will not run out in        a  stream from the termina
tion of the crack, unless the superficial layer has been cleared
away  ;   otherwise,it   will fill the fissures of the superficial layer
and appear as   a   great patch. The observer then, seeing nothing
but fissures full of coloured infusion at each end of the course
of the fluid, naturally enough imagines that in its intermediate
course the fluid has traversed similar fissures.         This conclusion
would be at once dissipated          by   cutting away the superficial
layer and laying open the infiltration cavity, — precaution which
                                                     a
does not seem to have occurred to either Prof. Agassiz or the
Messrs. Schlagintweit.

            Prof. Huxley   on the Structure  of Glacier Ice.         257
has been shown that they may be the mere result of the in
fluence of the motion of the glacier upon the form of any patch
 of dirt scattered accidentally upon its surface ; but besides these
 " dirt-bands/' the dirt on a glacier frequently presents a defi
 nite arrangement upon a smaller scale, which is connected with
 the minute structure of the glacier.        We have both observed,
 for instance, in those parts of the Mer de Glace in which the
 structure is vertical, that the superficial layer of the wall of a
 crevasse is weathered into granules of tolerably even size and
 similar form. Nevertheless, dirt (or a coloured infusion) accu
 mulates in larger proportion in those fissures which are parallel
 with the cleavage, and thus, from a little distance, the surface of
 the ice appears as if striated or ruled with lines parallel to the
 structure. The lines are separated by the width of the granules,
 and there may be several interposed between two blue veins.
     Why it is that those intergranular fissures which are parallel
 with the cleavage are the larger, is a question     I will not for the
 present attempt to answer.       It may be that the weathering takes
 place more rapidly in this direction, or it may be that these
 fissures being in the course of the flow of the water produced
  by the superficial waste of the ice, become enlarged more ra
 pidly than the others.
     These markings, and the similar ones frequently to be ob
  served on the upper surface of a glacier, might be termed
  "                                                      " dirt-bands."

  There is a third mode of arrangement of dirt, which, like the
  " dirt-lines," is dependent on the weathering of the ice, but the
  resulting strise are broad streaks, and not mere lines.          These
  may perhaps     be termed  " dirt-streaks."
     I  became acquainted with these quite recently, when, induced
  by Prof. Forbes's description and representation of the
                                                                 " struc
                                         I
  ture" of the glacier of La Brenva, paid a visit to that glacier.
  Prof. Forbes states, —
     " The alternation of bluish-green and greenish-white bands
  which compose this structure, gives to this glacier a most beau
  tiful appearance    as seen from the mule-road.      An attempt has
  been made in plate 5 to give some idea of this most charac
  teristic display, and which is better seen here than in any other
  glacier whatever with which     I  am acquainted.    The sketch was
  taken by myself from the point marked k on the map in July
  1842."— Travels, 2nd Ed., p. 203.
     It  must at once strike any one conversant with the ordinary
  character of the veined structure, that at the distance of the
  point on the mule-road from which Prof. Forbes's view is taken,
  any veins of the usual dimensions must be totally invisible ; and
  I  therefore approached La Brenva with the desire, if not the

hope, of making the acquaintance of glacier structure on a hew
                                                                       *
and gigantic scale.
  . Viewed from the mule-path,         or from the old moraine at the
commencement of the pine wood celebrated by De Saussure, the
lower part of the glacier of La Brenva exhibits numerous cre
vasses, which appear to run nearly parallel with its length, so that
the icy mass is divided into a series of parallel crests or ridges.
The lateral faces of these ridges form perpendicular cliffs of ice,
and present dark stripes directed in a longitudinal and nearly
horizontal direction; but where an end view of a ridge is ob
tained, the stripes run either horizontally and transversely (as
in the more central parts of the glacier), or are curved up to
wards the sides (as in the more lateral parts).
    These markings are evidently those described and faithfully
figured, as the
                  " structure" of the glacier, by Prof. Forbes ; but
I   cannot say   I  should have called them bluish-green.         They
                                                   I
looked to me simply dark and dirty. But should state, that
the weather, when      I  visited the glacier, was wet and cloudy.
    Nevertheless, on descending on to the glacier itself,      I found
its structure, though very beautifully developed, to be in no
wise remarkable for the size of its veins, which varied in length
from an inch to eight or nine feet, and in breadth from a frac
tion of an inch to nine or ten inches. Veins of the latter dimen
sions, however, were rare ; the majority having a thickness of
less than an inch.       The lenticular form was very well marked,
and the veins were commonly separated by less than their thick
ness of white ice.       I  need hardly say that these veins became
indistinguishable     at a  very short distance.
    The streaks   so  conspicuous a long way off, on the other hand,
became less sharply defined as           I approached, and at length
showed themselves to be nothing more than accumulations of
the fine dirt — spread more or less over the whole cliff-like wall
of ice, — in streaks of four to ten inches in breadth, and of vari
able length.      They ran parallel with one another and with the
 structure, at a distance varying from a few inches to six or seven
 feet ; and they were entirely superficial, the dirt never extend
 ing deeper than the weathered superficial layer.
    It became clear, therefore, that the markings were neither
 structure nor stratification, but a peculiar kind of dirt-marks ;
 and the next point was to ascertain the conditions of their for
 mation.
    On close examination, the face of the ice-cliff exhibiting these
 markings appeared to be worn into a sort of wavy or rippled
 surface, the length of the ripples having a general direction down
 wards.    The close-set veins, on the other hand, traverse the
face  of the ice, as has been said, nearly horizontally.     The whole

           Prof. Huxley  on the Structure   of Glacier Ice.       259
surface of the ice is more or less dirty, not half-a-dozen square
inches being without its little grains of sand and minute gravel,
brought down, as      I imagine, by the water which continually
trickles from above ; but the greater part of this impurity is
invisible from a small distance, unless where it is specially accu
mulated.
    Such accumulation takes place in two localities ; in the first
place, on the little shelves afforded by the upper and more
southerly aspects of the
                            " ripples" above referred to. Here the
dirt accumulates quite independently of the structure, and as a
consequence either of the form or of the aspect of the part on
which it lodges.
   From a little distance these aggregations appear as spots and
patches, but further off they cease to be visible, and the glacier
between the horizontal streaks appears white.
   These streaks mark the second locality in which the dirt aggre
gates.    Now whenever I carefully examined the surface of the
glacier at these points,  I  found it to be weathered into large gra
nules, separated by coarse fissures which extended for a consider
able depth into the substance of the glacier ; while the parts
intermediate between the streaks, and which appear white from
a distance, presented very much smaller granules, with fissures
proportionately finer, and extending inwards for but a very small
distance.    In short, where the dark streaks existed, the ice was
deeply weathered and coarsely granular, affording lodgment for
dirt to a depth of two or three inches ; while the intermediate
substance had undergone only superficial weathering, and its
finely granular structure afforded but little facility for the intru
sion of foreign matters.
   The " dirt-streaks," then, are due to the unequal weathering
of the ice ; but why does the ice weather unequally ? On seek
ing for an answer to this question,    I found that every dirt-streak
corresponded either with a very large blue vein, or with a closer
aggregation than usual of smaller blue veins, while the interme
diate substance contained a preponderance of the smallest blue
veins ; so that the coarse granules were the result of the weather
ing of parts of the glacier, composed either exclusively, or for the
most part, of blue ice, while those in which the proportion of
white ice was larger, weathered less deeply and into finer granules.
   The markings of La Brenva, then, are neither ordinary dirt-
bands, nor direct expressions of structure, nor direct evidence of
stratification, but they are produced by the more ready lodgment
of dirt in some parts of the superficial layer of the glacier than in
others, in consequence of the more coarse and deep weathering of
these parts ; which, again, is the result of the predominance of
blue ice over white in these localities.

     Why blue ice should predominate at intervals in the substance
of this glacier, — whether the like alternation of structure holds
good in glaciers generally, — and whether it has any relation to
a primitive stratification, are problems of great interest and well
worthy of investigation.
   - With
            regard to the second,   I will merely express a belief that
some such alternation of structure does obtain in glaciers gene
rally ; for the appearances presented by good sectional views of
glaciers, such as that exposed on the north side of the Allalein,
are so similar to those exhibited by La Brenva, that             I  cannot
doubt the identity of their cause.         I had been in the habit of
regarding the appearances referred to as direct evidences of stra
tification ; but if my supposition be correct, they will merely be
evidences of an alternation of structure which may or may not
depend on stratification.

theorem of logarithms ; if it be y, in a series ascending by powers
of x, the exponential theorem ; and if it be y, in a series ascend

in the following paper to effect these developments by simpler
methods than those commonly in use, and thus to make easier
to the student one of the first stages of analytical research.
     First, let it be observed that when, in equation (1), #or z =0,
then y=0.         To determine x in terms of y, assume
                    x=Z1y + Z^ + Z^ + Zy + ,
where Z„ Za . . . are unknown functions of z.

becomes 2a? in equation (1), y becomes 2y + y3.               Substituting
these values for x and y in equation (2),
2x=Z1(2y+y3)+Zi(2y + yY + Z3(2y + yy + Z4(2y + yy+....
But by (2),
                 2x=2Z1y + 2Z#* + 2Z!&s + 2Z4y*+          . . .

  like powers of y in these equations, we have

XXXI.          On the Gases         of    the   Blood. By       Lothar Meyer, M.D.*
          information which we have up to the present time pos
THE      sessed respecting the composition of the gases of the blood,
is entirely derived from the valuable experiments which Magnus                                f
has instituted upon this subject.      The results obtained       this                   by
philosopher have been established and extended in the present
research, of which the details have already been laid before the
medical world in Henle and Pfeufer's Journal for Rational Me
dicine  J.
   The object of the following investigation, which was carried
out in the laboratory of Prof. Bunsen at Heidelberg, and com
pleted in September 1856, was, in the first place, to determine
the quantities of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbonic acid contained
in normal, and more particularly in arterial blood     and secondly,    ;
to examine how far the absorption of these gases in the blood was
dependent upon the well-known law first propounded by Dalton
and Henry.
   The gases dissolved in the blood were collected, according
to Bunsen's method,                   by
                              ebullition in      vacuous space, asa
described on pages 15 and 16 of the English edition of his

 temperature as possible by keeping the vacuous receiver cold.
 As soon as the free gases had been thus collected, the combined
 carbonic acid was expelled by allowing a few crystals of tartaric
 acid to fall into the liquid, and the gas thus liberated was col
 lected by a repetition of the process of ebullition in vacuo.                         The

 that called No. 2 was not full grown, and weighed 9'5 kilo
 grammes.            A distinct difference is observed in the composition
 of the gases from the blood of these two animals : that of the
 younger dog contained less combined carbonic acid and far more
  free oxygen.             The gases from the blood of the same animal
  appear to possess a tolerably constant composition.
       The numbers which are enclosed in parentheses represent ex
  periments in which the crystals of tartaric acid were added to
  the blood before the free gases were removed by ebullition.
  These determinations gave the same quantity of carbonic acid
  and nitrogen as those in which the free gases were expelled
  before the addition of tartaric acid, but in the former, the quan
  tity of oxygen which is expelled by boiling is much smaller, pro
  ving that the acid has caused an oxidation of some of the con
  stituents of the blood to occur, without, however, forming car
  bonic acid.

scale.    The instrument, of which a more minute description is
given in the cited memoir, may also be employed for the deter
mination of the coefficients of absorption of other liquids which
cannot be brought into contact with mercury.                Experiments
conducted with the view of determining the degree of accuracy
attainable with this arrangement gave satisfactory results, and
are detailed in the original paper.
    For the purpose of determining the coefficient of absorption,
I employed defibrinated blood, freed from all dissolved gases by
ebullition in vacuo, at a temperature of about 30°.
    Absorptiometric experiments conducted with the blood thus
prepared, showed that with the three gases, carbonic acid, oxygen
and nitrogen, the quantity absorbed varied with the pressure to
which the gas was subject j and that the variation in the absorbed
quantity is proportional to the increase or diminution of the
pressure.     The total amount of carbonic acid and oxygen taken
 up by the blood from a pure atmosphere of either of these gases,
is, however, not proportional to the absolute pressure under
which the absorption occurs. In other words, this total amount
 of dissolved gas consists of two separate portions (as is the case
 in a solution of chlorine in water*), one of which is independent
 of the amount of pressure, whilst the other obeys Dalton and
 Henry's law of absorption.         The volume of gas dissolved by the
 volume of blood h, under the pressure P and at the temperature t,
 measured by the unit of pressure at 0° C, is
                                A = kh + aftP;
 in which « represents the coefficient of absorption, and k another
 constant, also dependent upon the pressure.
     In the case of nitrogen, on the other hand, the total quantity
 of absorbed gas is proportional to the pressure, so that the solu
 tion appears to be purely a phsenomenon of absorption.                As,
 however, the quantity of nitrogen dissolved in the blood is very
  small, averaging about from 3 to 4 per cent, of the volume of
  blood employed, and as the errors of observation may possibly
  reach as high a limit as 1 per cent., the determination           of the
 values of the absorption-coefficients      could not be conducted with
 any great degree of accuracy according to the method described.
     The coefficient a for oxygen is likewise small, so that the
  amount of this gas absorbed proportionally to the pressure, does
 not lie much beyond the limit of experimental error.          The value
 obtained for a at a temperature of 18° C. is 0'04 (see Exps. 19
  to 30 in the cited memoir).

  The value of the coefficients of absorption for carbonic                                    acid
were, lastly, found to be —
                          a.   = 1-15 reduced to 0°              C*
                          a=l-20         reduced to 12° C.
This value of a is but slightly different from that found by
Bunsen for carbonic acid in water, viz. 1'lOf.
   The cause of a retention of a portion of the oxygen and car
bonic acid (which we have designated as kh), independent of the
pressure, is to be sought in a special attraction which one or
more constituents of the blood exert upon these gases, that                                     is,
in the action of chemical forces.
   In the case of oxygen,         much larger than a. so that the

pressure exerted on the free gas.    The dissolved quantity varies,
on the other hand, with several circumstances      as, for instance,   ;
when the amount of solid constituents of the blood         reduced.                is
A  mixture of water and blood absorbs less oxygen than the blood
itself, and   would appear that this diminution
             it                                        directly pro          is
portional to the dilution.   The absorbed quantity of oxygen also
seems to depend upon the length of time which the blood, on
issuing from the artery, remained in contact with the air before
the dissolved gases were removed                       by
                                         ebullition in the vacuum.
Defibrinated calf's blood, which was brought under the air-pump
whilst still warm, gave for 18° C. (Exps. 19-30)
                            £=0-166,
reduced to 0° C. and    0m,76  as unit of pressure.     Other expe
riments gave     smaller value for
                  a                               k,
                                     A=009.
   The comparison of these numbers with those obtained            the                    by
ebullition  of arterial blood, and also of that which  had been satu
rated   by agitation with atmospheric air, shows that the quantity
of dissolved oxygen independent of the pressure remains the
same, whether     itbe derived from pure oxygen, atmospheric air,
or the air contained in the lungs. The presence of nitrogen or
carbonic acid does not alter, at all events to perceptible amount,a
the attraction exerted upon the oxygen.

organism     isvery evident     without this, the residence in atmo

 which bicarbonate of soda suffers in air free from that gas.                              If

 does not take place in the blood itself, but in the tissues, and
 especially in the muscles, which have as       rule an acid reaction.

 acid  is taken up from an atmosphere of this gas, independently

    Defibrinated calf's blood, which contained 33-8 per-centage
 volumes of combined carbonic acid, that            carbonic acid onlyis,
 set free       by
               boiling with excess of acid, measured at 0° and
 0m-76, took up from         pure atmosphere of carbonic acid, 63*0
                                   a
 volumes of this gas (at 12° C.) beyond the quantity previously
absorbed, so that at the end of the absorption the blood con
tained its own volume of carbonic acid dissolved independently
of the pressure.
    Eudiometric analysis has shown that the quantity of carbonic
acid contained in arterial blood          not nearly so large as this,
                                                        is
and hence       follows that the venous blood also cannot contain
                it
so much of this gas        for ;     easy to show, from the known
                                         it   is
rapidity of circulation of the blood through the lungs, and the
quantity of exhaled carbonic acid, that even under the most
favourable conditions, the venous blood can only contain            few              a
more per-centage volumes of carbonic acid than the arterial.
The total blood circulating throughout the body, therefore, does
not contain nearly so much combined carbonic acid as               able         it   is
to take up from an atmosphere of pure carbonic acid.             It                        is
scarcely possible to explain the absorption otherwise than by the

268               Dr. Meyer           on the Gases      of   the   Blood.
supposition that in the latter case the alkaline bicarbonates are
formed partly from the normal- and sesqui-carbonates, and partly
also from the alkaline phosphates which are contained in the
blood.     That these latter salts play a part in the reaction is seen
from the fact, that the 33*8 per-centage volumes of combined
carbonic acid combine with only 33*8 volumes of additional gas,
and leave 29'2 volumes unaccounted for.
   It appears from my experiments that little, if any, bicarbonates
of the alkalies are present in the circulating blood ; as, in the
first place, the quantity of carbonic acid which the blood gives
up in the vacuum without addition of acid, agrees very closely
with the amount which must be absorbed, in the strict sense of
the word, at the temperature and under the pressure of carbonic
acid contained in the air of the lungs ; and secondly, that the
blood when boiled, after the separation of this first portion of
gas, does not give out any appreciable quantity of carbonic acid,
whereas bicarbonate of soda very rapidly gives out half an equi
valent of carbonic acid, and continues to lose this gas, so that
the solution gradually approaches the composition of the neutral
salt.   The absence of the bicarbonates in the blood is the more
remarkable, as       Ihave shown by absorptiometric      experiments
(loc. cit.) that a dilute solution of normal carbonate of soda takes
up from an atmosphere containing but little free carbonic acid,
so much gas, besides that properly speaking absorbed, as is ne
cessary to form bicarbonate*.        This phenomenon ceases when
the amount of free carbonic acid in the gas diminishes to about
1 per cent.
   From these experiments, however, it follows that if bicarbon
ates were once formed in the blood, they would not undergo any
alteration in the atmosphere of the lungs.       Hence it is evident
that it is  a mistake to imagine that these salts perform an essen
tial function in the phenomena of respiration.
   In opposition to the former views, my experiments show that
the exchange of carbonic acid        with   very great degree of pro
                                          is,          a
bability,  to be regarded simply   as    phenomenon of absorption

whereas in the case of the solution of oxygen, chemical forces
also come into play.

                          [Continued from p. 108.]
                   has published a paper on the constitution and
WURTZ*       formula of oxalic acid, in which he establishes a
relation between that acid and glycol, the diatomic alcohol dis
covered by himselff. By the action of weak nitric acid on glycol
in the cold, glycolic acid is formed ; but when glycol is boiled for
a few minutes with weak nitric acid, a lively action ensues, red
fumes are disengaged, and the liquor on standing some time
solidifies to a mass of crystals, which are oxalic acid.             Treated
with stronger    nitric   acid, glycol yields besides       oxalic acid, car
bonic acid, and a certain amount of glycolic acid.
    The products of the regular and successive oxidation of glycol
are hence two acids, glycolic and oxalic, which stand to each
other in the following relation : —

    These acids are formed by the substitution of oxygen for a
certain quantity of hydrogen in the radical of the alcohol.              The
radical of glycol is olefiant gas ; when half the hydrogen is re
placed by oxygen, glycolic acid is formed; and when the sub
stitution is complete, oxalic acid is the result.
    Oxalic acid stands in the same relation to glycol as acetic acid
does to alcohol, and oxalic acid may be called the acetic acid of
the diatomic alcohol series.          Monatomic alcohol requires 4 equi
valents of oxygen for its transformation into acetic acid ; diatomic
glycol requires 8 equivalents to experience the corresponding
change,

tains 4 equivalents of carbon.          Wurtz considers that the other
organic   acids, such   as  succinic,  suberic,  sebacic, &c, which belong
to the oxalic acid series, will be found to be derived from the
higher glycols, the existence of which he has already demon
 strated.

Laurent denied that oxygen could replace chlorine, and the in
vestigation was made with the view of ascertaining if this were
the case.     But Wicke shows that chlorobenzole has none of the
characteristics of an aldehyde ; and these are generally so pro
nounced as not to be easily mistaken.        It is not acted upon -by
oxygen ;   it does  not reduce  metallic silver from its salts ; it does
not form a crystalline compound with ammonia, or with bisul
phite of ammonia, — all properties of the aldehydes.             Nor is
it likely that it is a substitution product, for its chlorine is most
readily separated as chloride of silver when it is treated with
silver solution, while the chlorine in substitution products can
not generally be detected until after the decomposition of the
organic substance.

obtained by adding an equivalent of chlorobenzole to 2 equiva

ing for some time.        The excess of wood-spirit is then distilled
off, the residue mixed with water, and the liquid which rises to
the surface removed by means of a pipette, dried and distilled.
Methylbenzolic aether is a transparent liquid, insoluble in water,
and heavier than that liquid; soluble in aether, alcohol and
wood-spirit, and boils at 208° C., but not without partial decom
position. It has an odour resembling geranium.
    iEthylbenzolic   aether,  .„4 „5.a vO4, was prepared in the same
 way as methylbenzolic aether,        to which it is very similar       in
 properties.     This is also the     case  with amylbenzolic      aether,

 double   decomposition of chlorobenzole and the silver salts of
the corresponding acids.        The acetic benzolic aether has alone
 been obtained in a pure form ; it crystallizes, while the others
 are thick viscous liquids, and cannot be distilled without de

 The mass is repeatedly extracted with aether, the filtered aetherial
 extracts distilled off in the water-bath : the residual oil, freed
 from acetic acid by washing with soda and then with water, is
 then dissolved in aether and left to crystallize. Acetic benzolic
 aether occurs in white lustrous crystals, very similar to the swal
 low-tail gypsum crystals.       It melts at 36 , and solidifies to a
 crystalline mass, and cannot be distilled without decomposition.
Treated with potash, it decomposes into hydruret of benzoyle and
 acetic acid.
    Valerianic and benzoic benzolic aethers were also prepared, but
 they could not be obtained pure ; still less could the compound
 benzolic aethers of the bibasic acids, sulphuric, oxalic, and suc
 cinic acids.

272           M. Wurtz           on the     Artificial Formation of Glycerine.
   In the paper* in which he described the formation of a new
series of diatomic alcohols, Wurtz expressed the opinion that the
same method would lead to the formation of glycerine.    Wurtz                           f
has lately realized that anticipation, and succeeded in forming
glycerine by synthesis.    A glycerine may be derived from the
bromide of    a carbohydrogen,    Cn Hn_1 Br3, by substituting for
each equivalent of bromine an equivalent of water and an equi
valent of oxygen.      Such a bromine compound is readily pre
pared by    the   action  of bromine on iodide of allyle, C6H5I.
When bromine is added in small portions to iodide of allyle, an
action takes place which must be moderated by placing the vessel
in a freezing mixture ; iodine is eliminated, and separates out in
crystalline form, and 3 equivalents of bromine remain combined
with the group C6 H5.
    This terbromide of allyle, when purified, is a colourless heavy
liquid, which         is,
                   however, generally of     beautiful rose tint, from

lizes in colourless prisms which melt at 17°;          distils withoutit
decomposition at 217°.
    Three equivalents of acetate of silver were mixed with        equi              1
valent of terbromide of allyle dissolved in crystallizable acetic
acid   ;the mixture was heated for several days to 120° C, and
the mass then extracted with aether.       The setherial solution was
distilled on the water-bath, and the residue treated with lime
and then with aether.      The colourless setherial solution left, after
evaporation   in the  water-bath,  neutral yellowish oil, which after
                                                a
appropriate purification was analysed.      It gave numbers corre
sponding to C18H1401S, which             the formula of triacetine,

liquid filtered and evaporated to dryness.      The residue was then
extracted with  absolute alcohol  the alcoholic; solution evaporated
on a  salt-bath left glycerine, which was distilled in vacuo. The
liquid which passed over had all the physical and chemical pro
perties of glycerine, and gave on analysis the numbers required
by  that substance.    When treated with iodide of phosphorus,
PI2,   it   gave iodide of allyle.
  The action of chlorides of the negative radicals on sodium
and potassium alcohols generally gives rise to compound aethers.

By the action of chloride of benzoyle on sodium-alcohol benzoic
aether is  formed:

   Sodium-alcohol.     Chloride of benzoyle.                Benzoic sether.
The action of chloride of cyanogen on sodium-alcohol might be
expected to give cyanate of sethyle.         Such, however, is not the
case : Cloez* has found that a new base isomeric with cyanate
of sethyle is formed.        When gaseous chloride of cyanogen is
passed   into  a  solution  of  sodium-alcohol in absolute alcohol, the
gas is rapidly absorbed and chloride of sodium is separated.
After the action is over, the mixture is distilled on the water-
bath, and the residual syrupy liquid is washed with water to free
it from admixed chloride of sodium.          This liquid has the compo
sition of cyanic aether, C4 H5 0, C2 NO, but quite different pro
perties. Cloez names it Cyanatholine.            Its formation is thus : —
                          +     CsNCl=NaCl          +  C6H502N.

                               cyanogen.
    Cyansetholine is insoluble in water, but soluble in all propor
tions in alcohol and aether.         It has a bitter taste, and an odour
resembling      that   of sweet   oil  of wine.     It cannot be distilled
without decomposition.            Concentrated potash decomposes it
with formation of ammonia.            It forms with most acids crystal-
lizable salts, of which the hydrochlorate unites with bichloride
of platinum to form a yellow double salt, and the nitrate with
nitrate of silver to form a double salt, which occurs in large
 crystals.
    By this action     a series of bases homologous with cyansetholine
may    be  obtained    from  other alcohols, which would run parallel
with the series which includes glycocoll, alanine and leucine.
    Schwanertf has investigated some of the decompositions of
leucine, and has been led thereby to suggest a new view of its
 constitution.      By the action of high temperatures it decomposes
                                         J
 into amylamine and carbonic acid . Leucine dissolves in fuming
 sulphuric acid, and the solution is the more colourless the less the
 temperature has been allowed to rise; but if heated to 100° C,
 the solution becomes very brown : on diluting the solution
 with water, adding carbonate of baryta and then filtering, pure
 leucine is obtained from the filtrate.         Anhydrous sulphuric acid
 acts on leucine with great energy ; the acid is rapidly absorbed,

and forms a brown, inodorous, thick solution, which, when
heated to 100° C, evolves carbonic and sulphurous acid.                By
mixing    this  solution  with   water,   and  submitting the  liquid to
distillation, the aldehyde of valerianic acid, C10H1002, was
obtained.
   By the action of chlorine on an aqueous solution of leucine, a
reddish-yellow oily liquid distils over, which after purification
and analysis proved to be valeronitrile, C10 H9 N, mixed with a
small quantity of chlorvaleronitrile, C10 H8 C1N.         A yellow acid
liquor remains in the retort, from which crystalline scales
deposit : these on recrystallization proved to be a compound of
leucine with hydrochloric acid, 2(C12H13N04), HC1.                Similar
compounds of glycocoll and alanine are known.             The products
of the action of chlorine on leucine are the same whether water
be present or not : the leucine is decomposed into carbonic acid,
valeronitrile and hydrogen ; the latter forms with chlorine hydro
chloric acid, which combines with a portion of undecomposed
leucine, while the chlorine acts upon the valeronitrile and forms
a substitution product.         Bromine has the same action upon
leucine. By the action of iodide of sethyle upon leucine no
hydrogen is substituted.
   These decompositions make it probable that leucine may have
the same composition as anthranilic or carbanilic acid.              The
decomposition by heat is in both cases quite analogous : leucine
gives amylamine and carbonic acid ; anthranilic acid gives ani
line and carbonic acid.        Leucine would hence be amylcarbamic
acid, —
                                                           + clOH18N

  Anthranilic acid.      Carbanilic acid.                     Aniline.
   Leucine and anthranilic acid yield, when treated with nitrous
acid, leucic acid and salicylic acid; both are corresponding
members of different series.        From this point of view Schwanert
hoped to obtain the sulphamylaminic acid corresponding to sul-
phanilic acid, by treating leucine with sulphuric acid : this ex
pectation was not fulfilled ; a further decomposition appeared to
set in.    But the products of decomposition, valeraldehyde, car
bonic and sulphuric acids and ammonia, may, however, be de
duced from that formula without forcing the interpretation.
   Kubel* has found       a  support for this view of the constitution

compounds with acids ; of these he has investigated the com

They are well-marked, definitely crystallizable bodies.
    Cahours*, in a communication on benzamic acid and its deriva
tives, points out the analogies which exist between the series to
which benzamic acid belongs, and the members of the glycocoll
series. While Schwanert shows that leucine has a similar con
stitution to carbanilic acid, Cahours views leucine as an alkaloid,
and shows that benzamic acid has the properties of a true alka
loid. Benzamic acid, and its homologues, toluamic, cuminamic,
anisamic acids, form compounds with phosphoric, oxalic, hydro-
bromic, and hydrochloric acids, which crystallize most readily,

    Glycocoll also forms with hydrochloric acid and bichloride of
platinum, a -compound crystallizing in brilliant orange prisms.
Just as glycocoll has isomers, so benzamic acid has isomers in
anthranilic acid and salicylamide.          Benzamic acid has the same
relation to salicylamide as glycocoll to glycocolamide, or alanine
to lactamide.       But salicylic acid, in becoming salicylamide, gains
NH and loses O2 ; while benzoic acid, in being converted into
benzamic acid, simply gains NH.             The position of the atoms is
therefore different ; as glycocolamide is produced, like salicyl
amide, by the reduction of its corresponding acid by ammonia,
and benzamic acid by reduction of nitrobenzoic acid, might we
not hope to obtain glycocoll by the reduction of nitroacetic acid ?

 this substance the formula C^H^O10, and considered it as
 composed of monobasic phloretic acid, C18Hn06, and phloro-
 glucine, C12 H4 O6. This view he has now had reason to alter :               J
 phloretic acid is bibasic, and has the formula C18 H10 O6 ; and
 instead of belonging to the group of lichen acids, belongs to the
 salicylic acid group, and is homologous with that acid.                     The
 salts of phloretic acid which he had previously described were
 acid salts, and he has now prepared and described a series of
 neutral salts which are obtained in the same way as the corre
  sponding neutral salicylates.

 less viscous liquid, whose boiling-point is higher than 265°, has
  a weak odour and an irritating taste.                Its optical properties

 purified is colourless, strongly refracting, has an aromatic odour
 somewhat resembling phenylic alcohol, and a burning taste;
 coagulates albumen almost as rapidly as phenylic alcohol ; forms
 with sulphuric acid a copulated acid, and with bromine and

 Its formula is C16H,0O2, and it forms with nitric acid a substi
 tution product occurring in yellow crystals, which has the for-
 mula   C16 /t\j/-)4\3 02j and would thus be homologous            with nitro-
 picric acid.      The body C16 H10 O2 is evidently, from its proper
 ties, mode of formation and formula, the homologue of hydrated
 oxide of phenyle, and would be xylenyle alcohol, the alcohol of
 the xylolef series, whose theoretical             boiling-point would be
  225° C.
     By the action of dry sulphurous acid on pentachloride                   of
 phosphorus,      a clear, strongly refracting liquid is obtained, which
 has the formula PCI5 S2 O4, and has been considered to be sul-

on submitting this liquid to fractional distillation, it can be
separated into oxychloride of phosphorus, and into a liquid boil

with alcohol into hydrochloric and aethylosulphurous acids.
   This body has the formula S2 O2 CI2, and is formed according
to the equation PC15 + 2S02=P02 CI* + S2 O2 CI2. If sulphurous

ensues, which must be moderated, and the result is the forma
tion of a white uncrystalline product, which consists of a mixture
of sal-ammoniac and the amide of this radical, thionylamidc, —

XXXIII.     On   the  Deviation from    the Primary Laws of Elastic
   Fluids indicated by the experiments of M. Regnault and of
   Messrs. Thomson and Joule.          By J. J. Waterston, Esq.
   To  the Editors of   the  Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      Gentlemen,
§ 1.  r|iHE     results
       JL ments on
                          of Messrs. Thomson and Joule's experi-
                          the thermal effects of fluids in motion, are
stated by the authors to prove that air and carbonic acid, on
being compressed, evolve more heat than the amount mechani
cally equivalent to the work of compression (Phil. Trans. 1854,
p. 341).    This announcement being calculated to weaken our
confidence in the principle of constancy in the mechanical equi
valent of heat,    I was induced to study closely the connexion
between these experiments and those of M. Regnault, so as to
obtain a clear idea of the modifying influence of a deviation from
the law of Mariotte in experiments that involve the conversion
of heat into work, and reconversion of work into heat.
   § 2. It is first necessary to keep in view the exact extent of
the information afforded by M. Regnault' s researches, and the
nature of the deviation indicated by them.         He has determined
the value of the difference of volumes under constant pressure,
and the difference of pressures with constant volume, correspond
ing to the difference of temperature between the freezing- and
boiling-point of water.       He has done this for several gases, and
for the same gas at different pressures, and found all to differ
from each other, which they would not do if the primary laws
were exactly maintained.        But M. Regnault has not determined
the change of absolute volume between any two different pressures :
thus the absolute amount of deviation from the law of Mariotte
between any two pressures has not been ascertained.          We have
also to keep in view, that the influence of temperature as affecting
the amount of deviation has not been ascertained by M. Reg
nault. All his observations were made on differences of volume
and of pressure between 0° and 100° C. ; they tell us nothing of
similar differences taken between 10° and 1 10°, or between 50°
and 150°, &c.
   § 3. On examining the rationale of Messrs. Thomson and
                                      I
Joule's experiments with plugs, find that by a simple process
of computation we may deduce from them the two important
items of information wanting in M. Regnault's researches.
   The details of the process are as follows : —
   The temperature of the experiment being, say 10° C. ; the differ
ence of pressure from two to one atmosphere; and the cooling effect

 280          Mr. J.  J. Waterston   on the Deviation  from
 in passing through the plug 0°26 C, — let C D, fig. 1, represent
 a cylinder of air at the pressure of
 one atmosphere and temperature
 10° C.     Let the elastic force of
 the air in this cylinder be wholly
'maintained by the counterbalan
 cing weight of the piston W, so
 that we have to suppose a perfect
 vacuum to exist on the upper side
 of it. By placing a small addi
 tional weight w on W, suppose it
 to descend to g, so that the conse- jj
 quent rise of temperature in the
 air contained in the cylinder may
 be 0°-26 C.       This increment of
  heat being withdrawn, the piston
  W descends from g to/. We may
  now suppose w withdrawn from W,
  which consequently rises from /to
  e by the elastic force of the air in
  the cylinder.     There is a conse
  quent loss of heat, and the tempe
  rature of the contained air' sinks
  0C-26.    This decrement of heat
  being restored, the piston rises to .
  D, its original position.
      The ratio of fg, or its equal De, to D C is nearly the same as
  that of 0°-26 to 273°+ 1(T, or of the increment of temperature
  to the G temperature, or temperature reckoned from the zero
  of gaseous tension.    The ratio of De to D/ is nearly 1 to 4, as
  determined by the experiments of MM. Clement and Desormes,
   also of MM. Gay-Lussac and Welter (Mecanique Celeste, book 12).
   The ratio of Df to DC is thus nearly 1-04 to 283, or 1 to 272 ;
   and this is the amount of deviation from the law of Mariotte in
   air at 10° C. between the pressure of two and one atmospheres,
   as derived from Messrs. Thomson and Joule's experiments on
   thermal effect.
      The above result may be exhibited in diagram by A B, another
   cylinder resting on the same plane as C D, and having one-half
   the transverse area.   The weight of the piston U being equal to
   W, and the weight of air in each cylinder being the same, as well
                                                     271
   as the temperature, we have AB = /C equal to jj=~ of CD.

the action has subsided, the resulting temperature of the expanded
air is  assumed to be the same as before, and this whether or not
there was  a  vacuum originally in W.          Mr. Joule has put this to
the test of experiment (see Phil. Mag. May 1845, vol.xxvi.p.369),
and found no sensible deviation from it.           (Note A, Appendix.)
   If the resulting temperature were lower than before, then heat
has disappeared without performing any apparent work; but
there may be conversion of heat into work not apparent to the
senses, into work concealed in the molecules of air, or in their
physical habitudes with the higher agents of force                 and vice      ;
versd, the resulting temperature may be higher heat appearing,        ;
without apparently the equivalent work being converted, the

results differed sensibly, we then would have direct proof that air,
on being compressed or dilated, did not alter its temperature in

puting the deviation by means of

son and Joule's experiments.
    § 6. Let the two upright cylin
ders G H and E P, fig. 3, of un
equal diameters,     be connected   at
P P by    a  plug of compressed cot
ton, as    in Messrs. Thomson and
Joule's experiments.        Let the
weight of the piston     HW   be first
considered as equal to PV, and
 above them a perfect vacuum, so
 that the elastic force of the air in
 each cylinder may be maintained
 by the superincumbent weight of
 the pistons only. We have also
 to assume that the motion of each
piston has attained uniformity, i. e.
 PV descends, and HW ascends
 with uniform velocity.     The con
version of heat into motion, and of
 motion into heat, that took place
 through the whole spaee S W,fig.2,
 now takes place insensibly within
 the pores of P.    The space in which the alternate conversion and
reconversion take place, instead of being, as in S W, one and of
very sensible magnitude, now consists of an infinite number of in
definitely minute receptacles, in each of which the same kind of
reciprocal action may be supposed to be going forward.        If the
law of Mnriotte were perfectly maintained, the obvious result
would be a rise of W equal to the descent of the same weight V,
and the air changed from the higher density to the lower without
either the performance of work or change of temperature.
    If, in condensing air at a constant temperature, its elastic
force increases in somewhat a less proportion than its density
 (which we can infer to be the case from M. Regnault's experi
 ments, although not the absolute extent of the divergence between
 any two given densities), the weight of the piston V must be
taken as somewhat less tban that of W, to maintain the densities
in the inverse ratio of the square diameter of the cylinders. In
consequence of this diminution (say of T^dth) of the weight of
V, the work performed by it in descending (F E) a unit of height
is less than the work required to raise W through (G H) a unit

               the Primary Laws of Elastic Fluids.               283
of height. It is thus obvious that the equivalent work would be
completely transferred to W in raising it through (Gd) = T9(j9wdths
of the unit. But the density then, instead of being of the nor
mal amount corresponding to the ratio that subsists between the
weight W and the transverse area of its cylinder G H, would
exceed that by myth : hence to arrive at an equilibrium, the
ascent of VV would be continued a little further beyond, the
Y^dth (viz. to a), and the work required to effect this must be
derived from the conversion of some of the heat of the air con
tained in the T9595dth of the unit of the height of the cylinder GH.
A lowering of its temperature is the consequence, and equilibrium
is attained before W has reached fully to the top of dii, the last
Tp3dth of the unit.
    The proportion da to dH of the -j-^dth through which W is
driven has been determined by the experiments above referred to,
as detailed in the twelfth book of the Mecanique Celeste.        It is
nearly three-fourths ; and it is such, that if the small amount of
heat lost were exactly replaced from external sources, W would
be carried through aH, the remaining fraction of the
                                                         T^dth. It
will be remarked, that the ratio of da to dU. is the well-known
ratio of the increments of heat required for the same incre
ment of temperature with volume constant and with pressure
constant.
    In the above demonstration we must keep in view, that, to
facilitate our reasoning, it is allowable to assume the plug to
extend from the last or lower position of V to the first or lower
position of W j also that the unit of height may represent an
incremental quantity, and thus the phenomena which, in order
 to fix our ideas, we consider as taking place in consecutive order,
may be simultaneous.
    § 7. Professor Thomson assumes that the cooling effect in his
experiments with plugs is proof that the gas, on being com
 pressed, evolves more heat than the amount mechanically equi
 valent to the work of compression ; that, in short, it does not
 alter its temperature in correspondence with the mechanical
 equivalent of the apparent work.        It has not occurred to him
 that the depression of temperature may simply be eaused by the
 conversion of heat into the mechanical force or work required to
 acquire against the atmospheric pressure that small augmenta
 tion of volume which a deviation from Mariotte's law demands.
 It is surely proper to take this first into consideration, yet the
 necessity of doing so seems never to have suggested itself.      The
 experiments were originally proposed as a means of testing
 Mayer's hypothesis only* (see Phil. Mag. vol. iv. pp. 432, 433,
 §§ 73, 78), and up to the present time this is supposed to have
 been successfully accomplished (see Phil. Trans. 1854*).

   § 8. The formula, § 4,    A=         — -, expresses the law of the
                                  ^=^
deviation, viz. that for a constant difference of density it varies
directly as the amount of the thermal depression or cooling effect,
and inversely as the temperature of the experiment reckoned from
the zero of gaseous tension.        In the experiments of Messrs.
Thomson and Joule with carbonic acid, the cooling effect was
about four and a half times that of air, giving a deviation of ^jjth
for a difference of density equal to one atmosphere.
   If  the deviation at 100° were the same in absolute amount as
at 0°, the cooling effect ought to be greater in the ratio of 373°
to 273°.     But if the deviation were less in proportion with the
diminished density, the cooling effect ought to be unchanged.
    If the cooling effect diminish as the temperature increases,
the deviation must diminish for the same constant difference of
pressure, not only with the density, but also in some inverse
ratio of the temperature.      This last seems to be the case, judging
from Messrs. Thomson and Joule's experiments with carbonic
acid.
    § 9. M. Regnault's observations provide us with the coeffi
cients of expansion under constant pressure, and of augmenta
tion of pressure with constant volume, all at the temperature of
50° C. or 273 + 50=323° G temperature, or temperature reck
oned from the zero of gaseous tension.            If we denote this G
temperature by     T, the volume   by   V, and tension  or elastic pres
sure by P, the primary laws of gases in their entirety are ex
pressed by T=VP, the equation of the hyperbola referred to
its asymptote, in which we set out with a unit of each of the
elements as a basis of comparison with standard measures.
    From M. Regnault's experiments alone, we may infer that the
actual coordinates of volume and pressure do not trace out this
curve exactly, because his coefficients increase with the density ;
but the amount of the deviation cannot be inferred, because only
 one value of V for the same value of T has been supplied.
    The actual coordinates of volume and pressure may neverthe
less trace out the exact hyperbola, if they are assumed not to
have reference to the actual asymptotes, but to a subordinate
 unknown hyperbolic curve lying near to and belonging to the
 same asymptotes, and that expresses by its equation the unknown
 cause of the deviation.      Upon this assumption we obtain the
 means of computing the deviation by the coefficients alone.          In
 this way the deviation    comes out      j^.    This value, compared
 with z»z> the value computed by the first process, does not show
 such accordance as to establish the hypothesis,      but sufficient per
 haps to make it worthy of passing remark.

Dynamical Theory of Heat) : the following extracts prove this state
ment : —
      " From equation III. it follows, that if Mayer's hypothesis be true,
there is neither emission nor absorption of heat, on the whole, required
to reduce the temperature of the air after passing through the orifice
to its primitive value                Hence the simplest conceivable test of
Mayer's hypothesis      would   be, to try whether the temperature of the
air is exactly the same on the two sides of the orifice.
       P. 433, § 78. " Should the differential method of experimenting
just described indicate any difference of temperature whatever on the
 two sides of the orifice, Mayer's hypothesis would be shown to be not
exactly fulfilled, and, according as the air leaving the orifice is found
 to be warmer or colder than the entering air, we should infer that
 the heat absorbed, when air expands at a constant temperature, is less
 than or greater than the equivalent of the mechanical effect pro
 duced by the expansion."

 Prof. Thomson thus refers to those experiments of Mr. Joule : —

  through a small orifice, from one vessel to another previously ex
  hausted by an air-pump.        Here the first mechanical effect produced
  by the expanding gas is vis viva generated in the rushing of the air.
  By the time equilibrium is established, all this mechanical effect
  has been lost in fluid friction ; and no truth in physical science can
  be more certain, than that by the time thermal as well as mechanical
   equilibrium is established at the primitive temperature, the contents
  of the two vessels must have parted with just as much more heat than
   they would have parted with had the air in expanding pushed out;
  the piston against an external resisting force, as is equivalent to the
   mechanical effect thus produced externally."        How are we to recon.
   cile this with the fact, that the contents of the two vessels were
   found not to have parted with any heat ? Perhaps the word more is
   a misprint, and should have been less.        Prof. Thomson frequently
   makes use of the word friction.        His view appears to be, that the
   motion of the air rushing e. g. from S to W, fig. 2, is lost in
                                                                       " fluid
                               "                 "
   friction;" and then the heat of friction restores the temperature
   to nearly what it was before, but not quite, the difference being what
   is shown in the experiments with plugs.        Thus in the second paper
    on Thermal Effects (Phil. Trans. 1854, p. 339), he expresses himself
    as follows : — The thermal effect
                                        " shows precisely how much the heat
    of friction in the plug falls short of compensating the cold of expan
    sion. But the heat of friction is the thermal equivalent of all the
   work done actually in the narrow passages by the air expanding as it
    flows through."     Thus the plug does not allow the air to pass from
    a higher to a lower density without performing work.            Again, a
    little further on, Prof. Thomson thus writes: — " In any case, w deno

  286           Mr.  J. J.  Waterston   on the Deviation   from
   ting the whole work of expansion," &c.        The value given to to is
                                       p
  found at p.    341, viz. tp=PVlog-pi, the hyperbolic area of expan
  sion at constant temperature. Prof. Thomson assumes that the work
  represented by this area must inevitably be done when air passes from
  one state of density to another at constant temperature.          If not by
  "pushing out a piston against external resisting force," then by ge
  nerating
             " heat friction," " stirring its own mass." P. 338.
                    of
       (3) The dynamical theory of heat rests on the idea that heat is
  the motion of the elementary parts of bodies, — intestine vis viva,
  accompanied with apparent quiescence, because the motion exists in
  every direction alike, e. g. through every part of the air contained in
  S (fig. 2). By the removal of the partition kk, the intestine action
  in the direction S W has now scope to make its appearance ; and when
  the particles of air have filled the whole of S W, the apparent motion
  in one direction relapses into intestine motion in all directions alike.
  This theory of heat involves no necessity for introducing the idea of
  friction.   So far from fixing our ideas or facilitating our reasoning,
  its manifest tendency is to obscure and confuse. As an illustration,
  we may take the case of a rigid vessel impervious to heat, filled with
  air and moving at a high velocity in a straight line.        Suppose it to
  be stopped instantaneously, and without fracture or any change in
  the vessel.    At this instant the motion of translation of the airwould
 necessarily   be  converted into heat, and there would be a rise of its
 temperature.      Now it is impossible in such a case to introduce the
 idea of friction, but it is easy to conceive the apparent motion of the
 particles in the one direction changed into motion in all directions
 alike by simple impact with the sides of the vessel and with each
 other. In the arrangements for making the experiments with plugs,
 all work by the expansion of the air in passing through the plug
 seems to have been carefully prevented.       If the air acted disruptively
 on the fibres of the cotton, then work would be performed.             Also
 the extra velocity of the current of air in passing out of the plug
 would cause a slight effect equivalent at a maximum to about -j-J-odth
 of a degree.      Even this might be prevented by having the plug
 shaped like the frustum of a cone, and thus equalize the velocity of
 the current on both sides.        It may also be remarked, that as the
 cooling effect is a quantity of the differential kind, the differential
 thermometer seems to be the proper instrument to measure it by.
      (4) There appears to have been considerable difficulty in equali
 zing the pressure of the air entering the plug ; might not this be
attained with greater facility by interposing between the condensing
pump and plug a cylinder with a heavy piston, with its weight ad
justed to the pressure required ? The action would be similar in
principle to the bellows of an organ. The induction and eduction
pipes might be at the bottom of the cylinder, and the motion of the
piston would probably be confined to so narrow limits as to enable
it to act sufficiently as a regulator.
     (5) In the second paper on Thermal Effects, at p. 336 a small
Table of results appears, the last column of which is headed " Theo

                the      Primary Laws of Elastic Fluids.                                   287

the adjacent column of experimental results, we find such complete
 accordance that apparently Prof. Thomson's calculus has enabled
him to predict in a satisfactory manner the results of observation.
This is the test of a successful theory. On inquiring further what
 this theory is, we come to what Prof. Thomson calls an " empirical
          "

 cated by Mr. Rankine, who states that its constant coefficient a "has
 been determined solely from Regnault's experiments on the increase
 of pressure at constant volume between 0° and 100° C." Mr. Ran

 sion at constant pressure, compression at constant temperature, and

 Mr. Rankine the means of determining the value of the constant a, and
 thus enabled Prof. Thomson to predict by his calculus the thermal
 effect in passing that gas through the plug (see Table, p. 336), we
 may ask, why has the same process not afforded the means of com
 puting the results of the experiments on air ? Some explanation of
 this may fairly be expected from Prof. Thomson.
    (7) Table XII. p. 335, contains a series of experiments on air and
 carbonic acid at the temperature of about 90° C. The first part of
 this table compared with the last, shows such discrepancy, that it is
impossible to accept the results, either in the case of air or carbonic
acid, as established thereby.     In the first part, the thermal effect in
air would appear to be augmented by the high temperature ; in the
last, to be diminished.      Prof. Thomson merely remarks that the
lesser number is probably the more correct value, and thus that the
thermal effect is lessened.     The calculus that in Prof. Thomson's
hands has so exactly anticipated results in the case of carbonic acid,
appears to be of no avail in the case of air, although the experimental
data to work upon are more abundant.

        XXXIV.      On the Occurrence    of Indigo-blue in Urine.
                By Edwakd Schunck, Ph.D., F.R.S.*
            occurrence of urine exhibiting various peculiar and ab
THEnormal         colours is a phenomenon which has frequently
attracted the attention and excited the curiosity of pathologists.
Of these variously tinted urines the most remarkable and
striking are the black and the blue, but they are at the same
time so rare, that it has been deemed of importance to record
minutely the symptoms exhibited in each case as well as the
chemical and physical properties shown by the urine itself.

  Dr. Schunck              on the Occurrence      of Indigo-blue in Urine.       289
These urines have been observed in diseases of the most different
kinds, as well as in cases in which the general health seemed not
to be in the least degree affected.      The pigments themselves, to
which the colours are due, have not until lately been subjected
to any chemical examination,         and great doubts still prevail
regarding    their true nature.   The   blue pigment to which    pro         I
pose to confine myself on the present occasion, has been dis
covered in two states.       In some cases it has been found ready
formed so as to impart to the urine a blue colour, but merely in
a state of suspension and therefore easily separated by simple
filtration, whereas in other cases it has only made its appearance
when the urine was left to stand or was subjected to the action
of various reagents.     In the cases described by Janus Plancus*,
Proutf, Braconnot {, and Simon §, it existed in the former state.
Hassall developed the blue colour by means of putrefaction, in
urines exhibiting the usual appearance, while Neubauer found
the same effect to be produced by the addition of acids to the
urine. As regards its chemical nature, the blue colouring matter
seems to have been of three kinds, as far as can be ascertained
from the descriptions given by the observers, which are not
always very precise.      In some cases, such as those described by
Julia-Fontenelle||, and Cantu^f, the colour was evidently caused
by prussian blue, the iron of which appears to have been derived
in one case from a quantity of ink which the person had swal
lowed.     The second kind of colouring matter has been minutely
described by Braconnot, who obtained it simply by filtering the
urine from the blue deposit found suspended in it. It was a
dark blue powder, insoluble in water and alkalies, only slightly
soluble in alcohol and yielding no crystalline sublimate when
heated.     From its dissolving in acids and its being reprecipitatcd
by alkalies and other bases, Braconnot inferred that it consisted
essentially of an organic base, to which he gave the name of
cyanourine.     If the substance which he examined was pure, it
 seems certainly to have been of a peculiar nature.      Nevertheless
no one has since then observed any colouring matter which
could be with certainty pronounced identical with             though   it,
instances have been met with in which the blue colour not being
caused, as     seemed,
                   it             by
                            any well-known body, has been attributed
to the presence of cyanourine.        In the third class of cases the
blue colour was produced by substance, which, on examination

290     Dr. Schunck      on the Occurrence    of Indigo-blue in Urine.
of its properties and reactions, was found to be indigo-blue.
Prout and Simon each mention a case in which indigo-blue was
deposited from urine on standing, in the shape of a blue sedi
ment.      Neubauer* observed that the urine of a young man of
18, apparently in good health, when mixed with strong acids be
came first purple, then blue, and deposited a blue powder, which
however he could not with positive certainty identify as indigo-
blue. Hassallf was the first to point out that the occurrence of
indigo-blue in urine was by no means so rare a phaenotnenon as
had previously been supposed.          The specimens of urine in which
Hassall discovered it were mostly of a pale straw colour and acid.
On standing they became thick and turbid and changed in
colour from yellow to brown, then to bluish-green, while the
surface became covered with a blue scum or pellicle, which was
found to consistof impure indigo-blue. Hassall considers that the
exposure of the urine to the oxygen of the atmosphere is essential
for the formation of the colouring matter ; however, I shall show
that this exposure is by no means necessary.             He also maintains
that indigo-blue does not occur in healthy urine, that its presence
is accompanied with strongly-marked symptoms of deranged
health, and that its formation in urine must be regarded as
a strictly pathological phenomenon, — conclusions               which are,
as will be seen, quite at variance with the results of my ex
periments.
    Such in a few words is the present state of our knowledge on
this rather obscure subject.
    In my paper "On the Formation of Indigo-blue J," have            I
 shown that the colouring matter exists in plants in a very differ
ent state to what had hitherto been supposed, that it does not
exist in them ready formed nor as reduced indigo, and that the
presence of oxygen is not essential to its formation, but that it
owes its origin to the presence of a peculiar substance, soluble in
water, alcohol and sether, which by the action of acids is decom
posed into indigo-blue, to which           I  have given the name of
 Indican, also a peculiar kind of sugar and a small quantity of
other products.       After having investigated the properties of this
 substance and its products of decomposition,         I  conceived it to be
 a matter   of  great  interest  to ascertain  in  what state indigo-blue
 exists in those urines, in which its presence is not indicated by
the external appearance, but is only made manifest by treatment
 with various reagents.       That such urines should contain a body

    Dr. Schunck     on the Occurrence      of Indigo-blue in Urine.    291
 resembling indican seemed indeed exceedingly probable, since
the same reagents which produce indigo-blue from indican lead
in most cases to the development of the blue colour in particular
kinds of urine. The extreme rarity, however, of these kinds of
urine appeared to present an insuperable obstacle to the further
investigation of the subject, and      I  therefore resolved to ascertain
whether any conclusions could be arrived at from an examination
of ordinary healthy urine.
    When muriatic or sulphuric acid is added to urine, the mix
ture on being heated becomes brown and begins to deposit dark
brown flocks, which increase in quantity when the heating is
continued.     When these flocks are filtered off, washed and dried,
they form a compact dark brown mass, from which cold alcohol
extracts a resinous matter, leaving undissolved a brown powder,
 which dissolves, however, in a boiling mixture of alcohol and
ammonia.        This powder contains nitrogen, and so much re
sembles indifuscine, one of the products of the decomposition
of indican, as almost to lead one to suspect their identity.            Its
composition,    however,   though   it   stands,   as I  have ascertained,
in a certain relation to that of indigo-blue, is quite different
from that of indifuscine.       Now if the liquid filtered from these
flocks be mixed with a salt of oxide of copper and an excess of
caustic soda, it becomes greenish, and if after being filtered it be
heated for some time, it gradually deposits a tolerably large
quantity of suboxide of copper, which is a proof of the presence
of sugar.     That the latter has been formed during the process
and did not pre-exist, may be ascertained by previously heating
a portion of the urine with a salt of copper and caustic soda, be
fore treating the remainder of it with acid.            Samples of urine,
which, when tried in this way, afforded very doubtful or no
indications of their containing sugar, were found, after being
boiled with acid, then filtered and made alkaline, to reduce oxide
of copper in a very marked manner.             This reaction, which is so
simple   that it is only surprising   it  should   never before have been
observed, seems to me to prove that there is contained in urine
some body, which by decomposition with acids yields sugar, the
brown flocks precipitated at the same time being probably the
substance with which the sugar was originally associated in the
form of a copulated compound.              From various considerations,
which I need not detail, I was led to infer that this body could
be no other than the very imperfectly known, so-called extractive
matter of urine, and     I  accordingly commenced an investigation
of this substance, which has led to conclusions of considerable
interest.    On discovering that the composition of the brown
flocks formed by the action of strong acids on urine is expressed
by the formula C14 H7 NO4, which is also that of anthranilic

considerations were necessary to induce me to proceed with the
investigation, notwithstanding the difficulties which    found at           I
tending it. Into the details of this investigation    shall at pre      I
sent only enter so far as they relate to the occurrence of indigo-
blue in urine.
    When acetate of lead is added to urine, it produces a cream-
coloured precipitate, which consists of chloride, sulphate, phos

of the lead compound of the extractive matter mixed with
some basic chloride of lead.      Both this and the first precipitate
give, when treated with sulphuric or muriatic acid, yellow liquids,
which, after being filtered from the sulphate or chloride of lead
and boiled, yield brown flocks exactly like those obtained from
urine itself. The liquid filtered from the precipitate with basic

It contains in most instances in combination with oxide of
lead, a   small quantity of     substance which, by decomposition
                                    a
with acids, yields indigo-blue. The first time that        treated thisI
precipitate with acid     was surprised to observe that the liquid
                          I
became immediately of purplish-blue colour, and deposited after
                               a
filtering and standing     small quantity of
                              a                  substance, which on
                                                          a
examination was found to consist chiefly of indigo-blue.          This
phsenomenon was observed on so many occasions that          came to         I
the conclusion that the occurrence in urine of an indigo-produ
cing body similar to indican, was                   by
                                             no means an unusual
circumstance.
   In order to ascertain whether this body         present,    adopt
                                                              is                I
the following method.       The urine having been mixed with basic
acetate of lead until no more precipitate      produced, is filtered,           is
and after the precipitate has been washed with water, the liquid
is mixed with an excess of ammonia, which always produces more
or less of    white or yellowish-white precipitate.
                a                                      This precipi
tate  iscollected on   filter, slightly washed with water and then
                          a
treated with dilute sulphuric or muriatic acid in the cold.
After the whole of the oxide of lead has combined with the acid
employed,       the liquid    is   filtered.    When there         is   much of the

    Dr. Schunck      on the Occurrence     of Indigo-blue in Urine.     293
indigo-producing body present, the filter acquires a blue tinge,
small particles of blue pigment are seen dotting the surface of
the sulphate or chloride of lead, and the surface of the liquid,
which is of a brownish-purple colour, in a very short time be
comes covered with a thin pellicle, which is blue by transmitted
and copper-coloured         by reflected light, particles of the same
blue substance being at the same time found attached to the
 sides of the vessel.     When there is less of the indigo-producing
body present, this pellicle only appears after some time, some
 times not until the next day.        After twenty-four hours, however,
 the action of the acid is always completed, so that if no indigo-
 blue then appears or can be detected on examination of the de
 posit, the total absence of the indigo-producing body may be
 inferred. On the succeeding day, however large the quantity
 of blue deposit formed may be, the liquid no longer appears
 purplish, but brown, and after being filtered and boiled, deposits
  a dark brown powder, having exactly the same appearance as
 that produced by the action of acids on the ordinary extractive
 matter of urine. The matter left on the filter, after being washed,
 is treated with caustic soda, which dissolves a portion, acquiring
  thereby a brown colour.       The portion which remains undissolved,
  after being again collected on a filter and washed, is treated with
  boiling alcohol.     In most cases the alcohol acquires thereby a
  bright blue colour.        When, however, the quantity of deposit
  formed is tolerably large, the boiling alcohol first dissolves
  another substance, which imparts to it a fine purple colour, and
  which I consider to be identical with indirubine*.             That which
  the boiling alcohol leaves undissolved, is a bright blue powder
  having the properties of indigo-blue.          It dissolves in an alkaline
  solution of protoxide of tin, and the solution on exposure to the
  air becomes covered with a blue film. It is soluble in concen
  trated sulphuric acid, forming a blue solution, which remains
  blue even after dilution with water.        It imparts to boiling alcohol
  a bright blue colour, and the solution on cooling and standing
  deposits blue flocks.      When heated in a tube, it gives a purple
  vapour which forms on the colder parts of the tube a blue sub
  limate.
      Provided with this test,    I proceeded to examine the urine of a
  number of individuals, and 1 succeeded in obtaining indigo-blue
  in so great a number of instances, that          I  have no hesitation in
  saying that the indigo-producing body, if not exactly one of the
  normal constituents of urine, occurs more frequently than any
  other of the abnormal ones.          The urines containing it exhibit
     * It is very probable that Heller's urrhodine, as well as Golding Bird's
  purpurine, are also identical with indirubine, which, as  I have shown, has
  the same composition as indigo-blue.

294      Dr. Schunck   on the Occurrence    of Indigo-blue in  Urine.
no remarkable or peculiar appearance whatever; they are acid,
clear, and of the usual colour.       Its occurrence, at least if its
quantity is moderate, is not to be considered as a pathological
phsenomenon.       I can at all events state from my own experience,
that its presence is not attended by any symptoms of ill health
or feelings of discomfort, and that neither from the state of the
health nor the appearance of the urine, can any conclusions be
drawn as to its presence or absence. The small number of
samples of morbid urine which          I  had an opportunity of exa
mining, yielded, with one exception, no more indigo-blue than
the generality of healthy urines.          Nevertheless, there are no
doubt diseases in which the quantity of the indigo-producing
body may become so large as to constitute a truly morbid sym
ptom, and it may therefore become a matter of importance and
interest for the medical man to have a ready means of detecting
it. The delicacy of the test which I have described, as well as
the small quantity of the substance usually present, may be
judged of from the fact, that by working for several weeks on
the urine of two individuals, which contained a comparatively
large quantity, I obtained one grain of indigo- blue.       Even when
the amount of indigo-blue formed was very small,              I  always
found that 16 fluid ounces of urine yielded an appreciable quan
tity of it.
    The urine of forty different individuals, all of whom were
apparently in a good state of health, yielded, with one excep
tion only, more or less indigo-blue, when examined in the
manner just described.         These individuals belonged to both
sexes, and they were of ages varying from 7 to 55.            The ma
jority were persons of the working classes. The largest quan
tity of indigo-blue was obtained from the urine of a man above
the age of 50, a publican by trade.        The urine of a young man,
aged 32, a servant in my employment, yielded almost as large
 a quantity.    Among the rest, the urine of a young man, aged
 25, an engraver, that of a clerk, aged 23, and that of a girl,
aged 12, who had been a cripple from infancy, were alone
remarkable for the amount of indigo-blue which they yielded.
 In all these cases the indigo-blue was accompanied by the
 substance imparting to alcohol a purple colour, and which I
 suppose to be indirubine.       The other specimens afforded much
 less, sometimes mere traces.        In all cases, however, in which
 the urine of the same individual was examined at different
 times, the amount of indigo-blue obtained from it was found
 to vary exceedingly, it being sometimes considerable, and occa
 sionally dwindling down to a mere trace.             It was only very
 rarely,  however,   that  none   was   found.    In   the case of the
 individual first referred to, the urine gave on one occasion not

  Dr. Schunck    on the Occurrence   of Indigo-blue in Urine.   295
a trace, and   this took place when he was engaged in performing
labour, unusual for him both in its nature and amount.        In my
own case, as well as that of my assistant, the amount varied
most capriciously from a tolerable quantity to a mere trace,
occasionally even none at all being obtained.
  I   performed several experiments with different kinds of diet,
in order to ascertain the effect on the amount of indigo- blue
yielded by the urine.       Only one experiment, however, led to
any decisive result. .Having selected an occasion when the
night urine gave no indigo-blue, 1 took on the next night,
before going to bed, a mixture of treacle and arrowroot boiled
with water in as large a quantity as the stomach could bear,
and the effect was that the urine of the following night gave
a large quantity of indigo-blue.       As, however, the same phse-
nomenon was repeated for several succeeding nights without
any additional quantity of food having been taken, it remained
uncertain to what cause it was to be attributed, though a re
petition of the experiment on a second occasion gave the same
result.
  I   have hitherto not had an opportunity of examining many
 specimens of urine in disease.       Of two samples of urine from
patients   with  albuminaria,  one  gave a small quantity of indigo-
blue, the other not a trace.         Several specimens of diabetic
urine yielded it. One of these, which       I  owed to the kindness
of Dr. Browne of Manchester, gave a much larger quantity
than  I  obtained from any other specimen of human urine.
    The urine of the horse and the cow, when tried in the same
 way as human urine, gave comparatively very large quantities
 of indigo-blue, especially that of the horse.
  I   think it is highly improbable that the indigo-blue obtained
in Hassans experiments was produced, as he supposes, by the
 action of oxygen on the urine.         Its formation was without
 doubt due to the decomposition of the indigo-producing body
induced by the fermentation of the urine, the indigo-blue at the
 moment of its formation dissolving in the fermenting alkaline
liquid and producing a trae indigo vat, from which it was
gradually deposited by the action of the atmospheric oxygen.
 When small quantities of indigo-blue only are formed in any
 specimen of urine, fermentation is not in my opinion to be
recommended as a means of detecting it.
    The occurrence of the indigo-producing body as an excretion,
 seems to me to be due to a disproportion between the oxygen
absorbed by the system and the matter to be acted on by          it,
which again may be caused either       by  an excessive waste of the
tissues or by   an obstructionof   the organs conveying oxygen, as
the lungs and skin, or, as   is  probably the case in   the majority

296                            Royal Society        :—
of instances, by an excess of food being taken over and above
the requirements of the system.      As regards the constitution of
this body,   I think there can be no doubt that it contains the
elements of indigo-blue and sugar, and that by oxidation within
the system it is converted into the ordinary extractive matter of
urine, which contains, as I have ascertained, the elements of
sugar and of the black substance which is formed by the action
of strong acids on urine, and which may be considered as a pro
duct of the oxidation of indigo-blue.     Having prepared the ex
tractive matter of urine in a state of purity, ascertained its
composition, and examined its products of decomposition,      think      I
it is probable that the indigo-producing body will be found, as
regards its formation and composition, to occupy a place between
the substance of the tissues and the ordinary extractive matter
iof urine. The very minute quantities of it ordinarily occurring
  n urine, and the difficulty of separating it from the extractive
matter, make      it,
                   however, impossible to ascertain whether this             is
the case or not.     My object in making known this portion of
the investigation in its present fragmentary state,      to induce  is
medical men,     who   have  an  opportunity of examining many
varieties of urine, to endeavour to discover among these varieties
 some containing      sufficiently large quantity of this body to
                        a

Major- General Sabine     on  Colonial Magnetic Observatories.       297
       March  5. —The   Lord Wrottesley, President, in the Chair.
    The following communication    was read  : —
    "On what the Colonial       Magnetic    Observatories  have   accom
plished."     By Major-General   Sabine,  R.A., Treas. and V.P.R.S.
    It has been suggested  to me, that a  brief review of what has been
accomplished by the Colonial Magnetic Observatories, instituted on
the joint recommendation of the Royal Society and British Associa
tion, would be acceptable ; and that the officer who has been en
trusted with the superintendence of these establishments is the person
from whom such a review may most properly be expected.              Fully
assenting to both propositions, I have readily undertaken the task ;
and have availed myself of the occasion to add a few remarks and
suggestions on the measures which appear to be required for the
further prosecution of the objects for which the observatories were
recommended.
    The magnetic investigations designed to be carried into execution
by the Colonial Observatories recommended by the Royal Society
embraced a much wider scope than had been contemplated by any
previous institutions, or than had been provided for by the arrange
 ments or instrumental means of any then existing establishment,
 whether national or private.     Not, as previously, limited to obser
 vations of a single element (the Declination), — or combining at the
 most one only of the components of the magnetic force, — the in
 structions of the Royal Society, and the instrumental means prepared
 under its direction, provided for the examination, in every branch of
 detail, of each of the three elements which, taken in combination,
 represent, not partially but completely, the whole of the magnetic
 affections experienced at the surface of the globe, classed under the
 several heads of absolute values, secular changes, and variations
 either periodical or occasional, — and proceeding from causes either
 internal or external.   To meet the requirements of inductive reason
 ing, it was needful that the results to be obtained should comprehend
 all particulars under these several heads, attainable by an experi
 mental inquiry of limited duration.        That no uncertainty might
 exist as to the objects to which, in so novel an undertaking, attention
 was to be directed, the Report of the Committee of Physics, ap
 proved and adopted by the President and Council of the Royal
  Society, stated in a very few sentences, remarkable alike for their
  comprehensiveness    and conciseness, the desiderata of magnetical
  science.   It may be convenient to reproduce these, when desiring to
  show the degree in which the Observatories have fulfilled their contem
  plated purposes : — "The observations will naturally refer themselves
  to two chief branches, into which the science of terrestrial magnetism
  in its present state may be divided.       The first comprehends the
  actual distribution of the magnetic influence over the globe, at the
  present epoch, in its mean or average state, when the effects of tem
  porary fluctuations are either neglected, or eliminated by extending
  the observations over a sufficient time to neutralise their effects.
  The other comprises the history of all that is not permanent in the

 298                           Royal Society    : —
 phenomena,       whether it appear in the form of momentary, daily,
 monthly,   or  annual   change and restoration ; or in progressive changes
 not compensated by counter-changes, but going on continually accu
 mulating in one direction, so as in the course of many years to alter
 the mean amount of the quantities observed." — Report, pp. 1, 2.
    With reference to the first of these two branches, viz. the actual
 distribution of the magnetic influence over the globe at the present
                                              "
 epoch, the Report goes on to state : — The three elements, viz. the
 horizontal direction, the dip, and the intensity of the magnetic force,
                                                                     ....
 require to be precisely ascertained, before the magnetic state of any
given station on the globe can be said to be fully determined
 and as all these elements are at each point now ascertained to be in
 a constant state of fluctuation, and affected by transient and irregular
 changes, the investigation of the laws, extent, and mutual relations
 of these changes is now become essential to the successful prosecu
 tion of magnetic discovery."
    With reference to the second branch, viz. the secular and periodical
 variations, it is observed that — " The progressive and periodical
 being mixed up with the transitory changes, it is impossible to sepa
 rate them so as to obtain a correct knowledge and analysis of the
former, without taking express account of and eliminating the latter;"
and with reference to the secular changes in particular, it is re
marked — "These cannot be concluded from comparatively short
series of observations without giving to those observations extreme
nicety, so as to determine with perfect precision the mean state of the
 elements at the two extremes of the period embraced ; which, as
 already observed, presupposes a knowledge of the casual deviations."
    It is clear from these extracts that in the discussion of the obser
vations the first point, in the order of time, ought necessarily to be
 an investigation into
                           " the laws, extent, and mutual relations of the
 transient and," (as they were called at the time the Report was
written,)
             " irregular changes," as a preliminary step to the elimi
nation of their influence on the observations from which a correct
knowledge and analysis of the progressive and periodical changes were
to be obtained. It will be proper to show therefore, in the first
place, what the Observatories have accomplished in regard to the so-
called casual or transitory variations.
    Casual Variations. — All that was known regarding these phe
nomena at the period when the Report of the Committee of Physics
was written, was, that there occurred occasionally, and, as it was
supposed, irregularly, disturbances in the horizontal direction of the
needle, which were known to prevail, with an accord which it was
impossible to ascribe to accident, simultaneously over considerable
spaces of the earth's surface, and were believed to be in some un
known manner connected, either as cause or effect, with the ap
pearances of the aurora borealis.         The chief feature by which the
presence    of  a  disturbance  of this class   could be recognized at any
instant of observation, — or by which its existence might be sub
sequently inferred independently of concert or comparison with other
Observatories, — appeared to be, the deflection of the needle from

Major-General Sabine       on  Colonial Magnetic Observatories,       299
its usual or normal position to an amount much exceeding what
might reasonably be attributed to irregularities in the ordinary pe
riodical fluctuations.    The observations which had been made on
the disturbances anterior to the institution of the Colonial Obser
vatories had been chiefly confined to the declination.       A few of the
German Observatories had recently begun to note the disturbances
of the horizontal force ; but as yet no conclusions whatsoever had
been obtained as to their laws : in the words of the Committee's
 Report, the disturbances
                              " apparently observe no law." By the
 instructions cited above, the field of research was enlarged, being
 made to comprehend the disturbance-phenomena of the three ele
 ments ; and the importance of their examination was urged, not
 alone as a means of eliminating their influence on the periodic and
 progressive changes, but also on the independent ground, that
                                                                     " the
 theory of the transitory changes might prove itself one of the most
 interesting and important points to which the attention of magnetic
 inquirers can be turned, as they are no doubt intimately connected
 with the general causes of terrestrial magnetism, and will probably
 lead us to a much more perfect knowledge of those causes than we
 now possess."
      The feature which has been referred to as furnishing the principal
 if not the only certain characteristic of a disturbance of this class,
  viz. the magnitude of the departure from the usual or normal state
  at the instant of observation, has, in the discussion of the observa
  tions, been made available for the investigation of their laws : it has
  afforded the means of recognizing and separating from the entire
  mass of hourly observations, taken during several years, a sufficient
  body of observations to furnish the necessary data for investigating
  at three points of the earth's surface — one in the temperate zone of
  the northern hemisphere, a second in the temperate zone of the
  southern hemisphere, and a third in the tropics —the laws or con
  ditions regulating or determining the occurrence of the magnetic
  disturbances.    The method by which this separation has been
  effected has been explained on several recent occasions, and will be
  found fully described in the Phil. Trans, for 1856, Art. XV.          By
  processes of this description, the disturbances of principal mag
  nitude in each of the three elements, the Declination, Inclination
   and Total Force, have been separated from the other observations,
   at the three observatories of Toronto, Hobarton and St. Helena,
   and submitted to an analysis of which the full particulars will be
  found in the preliminary portions of the volumes which record the
   observations.   By the adoption of a uniform magnitude as constitu
   ting a disturbance throughout the whole period comprised by the
   analysis, the amount of disturbance in the several years, months, and
   hours is rendered intercomparable.     The result of this investigation
  (which    could  not be  otherwise  than  a very laborious operation,
   since the observations at a single one of these stations, Toronto, con
   siderably exceeded 100,000 in number, each of which had to be
   passed through several distinct processes,) has made known to us
   that the phenomena of this class, which may in future with propriety

and advantage receive the appellation of " occasional," are, in their
mean or average effects, subject to periodical laws of a very system
atic character ; placing them, as a first step towards an acquaintance
with their physical causes, in immediate connexion with the sun
as their primary exciting cause.      They have — 1, a diurnal variation
which follows the order of the solar hours, and manifests therefore
its relation to the sun's position as affected by the earth's rotation
on its axis ; 2, an annual variation, connecting itself with the sun's
position in regard to the ecliptic ; and 3, a third variation, which
seems to refer still more distinctly to the direct action of the sun, since,
hoth in period and in epochs of maximum and minimum, it coincides
with the remarkable solar period of about ten, or perhaps more nearly
eleven, of our years, the existence of which period has been recently
made known to us by the phenomena of the solar spots ; but which,
 as far as we yet know, is wholly unconnected with any thermic or
physical variation of any description (except magnetic) at the surface
 of the earth, and equally so with any other cosmical phenomena with
 which we are acquainted.      The discovery of a connexion of this re
 markable description, giving apparently to magnetism a much higher
 position in the scale of distinct natural forces than was previously
 assigned to it, may justly be claimed on the part of the Colonial Ob
 servatories, as the result of the system of observation enjoined (and
 so patiently and carefully maintained), and of the investigation for
 which  it  has supplied the data;   since
                                         it  was hy means of the disturb
 ance-variations so determined, that the coincidence between the phe
 nomena of the solar spots and the magnitude and frequency of mag
 netic disturbances was first perceived and announced (Phil. Trans.
1852, Art. VIII.).
   The extent and mutual relation of the disturbance-variations of the
three elements, even at   asingle station, supply variety of points of
                                                    a
approximation and of difference, which are well suited to elucidate
the physical causes of these remarkable phenomena but valuable as

such aids may he when obtained for         asingle station, their value   is
greatly augmented when we are enabled to compare and combine the
analogous phenomena, as they present themselves at different points
of the earth's surface. To give but single example — there are cer

tain variations produced hy the mean effects of the disturbances
which attain their maximum at Toronto during the hours of the
night   ;the corresponding variations attain their maximum, at Ho-
barton, also during the hours of the night, but with    asmall systematic
difference as to the precise hour, and with this distinguishing pecu
liarity, that the deflection at Hobarton is'of the opposite pole of the
needle (or of the same pole in the opposite direction) to the Toronto
disturbance  ;  whilst at a third station, St. Helena, which   isa tropical
one, the   hours  of principal disturbance are those not of the night,
but of the day.    A   very superficial examination   issufficient to show
that for the generalization of the facts, — generalization which
                                                a                         is
indispensable for their correct apprehension and employment in the
formation of theory, — the stations at which the phenomena are to
              a
be known must be increased.         Those which were chosen for      a first

experiment were well selected to prove the importance of the inves
tigation, and thus to lead to its extension. It is only at the Colonial
Observatories that the disturbance-variations have hitherto been made
out ; and taking experience as our guide, we have before us the evi
dence of the means by which the inquiry may be further successfully
prosecuted*.
    Periodical Variations. — The'anticipation expressed in the Report
of the Committee of Physics, that for the purpose of obtaining a cor
rect knowledge of the regular periodical variations, it would be found
necessary to eliminate the
                                     " casual perturbations," has been fully
confirmed.       Had the latter been strictly " casual " (or accidental, in
a sense contradistinguished          from and opposed to periodical), a suffi
ciently extended continuance of observation might have occasioned
their mutual compensation ; but now that we have learned that the
mean effects which they produce are governed by periodical laws, and
that these laws and those of the regular periodical variations are dis
similar in their epochs, it is manifest that in their joint and undivided
effects we have two variations, due to different causes and having di
stinct laws, superimposed upon each other ; to know the one correctly
we must necessarily therefore eliminate the other.               A striking illus
tration of the importance of such elimination is furnished by the solar-
diurnal variation of the total force. It will readily be imagined that
the question must be an important one, whether a variation, which
is supposed to derive its origin from the sun, be a single or a double
progression ; whether it have two maxima and two minima in the
twenty-four hours, or but one maximum and one minimum in that
period.      When no separation is made of the disturbances, the pro
gression appears to be a double one, having two minima, one occur
ring in the day and the other in the night.                "With the removal of
the disturbed observations the night minimum disappears, and we
learn that the regular solar-diurnal variation of the total force has
but one notable inflection in the twenty-four hours, viz. that which
takes place during the hours when the sun is above the horizon.
   * The Colonial Observatories under my superintendence were originally four in
number, viz. Toronto, St. Helena, Cape of Good Hope, and Hobarton.           In July
1846 the detachment of the Artillery at the Cape of Good Hope was withdrawn
by orders from England, and the charge of the magnetical and meteorological ob
servations transferred to Mr. Maclear, the Government Astronomer at that station.
The magnetical observations made at the Cape, when the magnetic observatory
was one of those under my superintendence, were published in 1851, with a dis
cussion of certr.in of their results ; and the disturbance-variation of the declina
tion at the Cape has since been deduced by my assistant, Captain Younghusband,
Phil. Trans. 1853, Art. VI. Since the transfer to Mr. Maclear, Mr. Pierce
Morton, a gentleman of considerable mathematical attainments, who has been
added as an assistant to Mr. Maclear in that branch of the Cape observations,
has applied himself to the investigation of the lunar magnetic influence (as derived
from the Cape observations), with a view of presenting the results to the Royal
Society.   For this, and other deductions, — such as, for example, the laws of the
disturbances of the inclination and total force, — he will have the entire series of
observations, viz. those as above-stated already published, and those which have
been made since the transfer of the Observatory, up to the present time.

   302                        Royal Society     : —
  The night minimum is in fact the mean effect of the occasional dis
  turbances.    It is probable that the nocturnal inflection of the solar-
  diurnal variation of the Declination may be ascribed to the same
  cause, namely to the superposition of two distinct variations.
     A careful analysis of the solar-diurnal variations of the Declination
  at the Colonial Observatories has brought to light the existence
  at all these stations, of an annual inequality in the direction of the
  needle concurrent with changes in the sun's declination, having
 its maxima (in opposite directions) when the sun is in or near the
 opposite solstices, and disappearing at or near the epochs of the
 equinoxes.     An intercomparison of the results of the analysis at
 these stations has shown, that this inequality has the remarkable
 characteristics of having notably the same direction and amount in
 the southern as in the northern hemisphere, and in the tropical as in
 the temperate zones.       An ingenious explanation of these phenomena
 has been suggested by Dr. Langberg of Christiania (Proceedings of
 the Royal Society, vol. vii. p. 434) ; but whether this explanation be
 or be not the correct one, the theoretical importance of the facts can
 not be doubted, inasmuch as they appear to be wholly irreconcileable
 with the hypothesis which would attribute the magnetic variations
 to thermic causation. We may ascribe to the general and almost
 exclusive prevalence of the thermic hypothesis, and to its influence
 on magnetic reasonings, that the well-known erroneous opinion was
 so confidently promulgated by a deservedly high magnetic authority*,
 that a line must exist surrounding the globe, in which the needle
 would be found to have no diurnal variation.            We have now, on the
 contrary, reason to be assured, by the facts of the annual inequality
 thus discovered, that there is no such line ; but that everywhere in
 the regions of its supposed existence a diurnal variation subsists,
 having opposite characteristics in opposite parts of the year as in
 fluenced by the sun's position on either side of the equator, and dis
appearing only at the epochs when the sun passes from south to
north or from north to south Declination.
    Lunar Variation. — But if thermic relations have failed to supply
a connecting link between the sun and those magnetic variations
which are, without doubt, referable to the sun as their primary cause,
the failure of that hypothesis is made still more obvious by the ex
istence   of variations governed by the moon's position relatively to the
place of observation.      We are indebted to M. Kreil, now holding
the same position in Austria that         I have filled in England, for the
first suggestion of the existence of a lunar-diurnal variation of one
of the elements, viz. of the Declination, founded on observations at
Milan and Prague ; and in the Phil. Trans, for 1856, Art. XXII.,
will  be found an exposition of the facts of the moon's diurnal influ
ence on each of the three magnetic elements at Toronto, viz. on
the Declination, Inclination, and Total Force.            In the case of this
investigation, notwithstanding the smallness of the values concerned,

Major-General Sabine        on Colonial Magnetic Observatories.       303
been   found competent to determine, with an approximation suffi
cient for present theoretical purposes, the character and amount for
each element of the regular daily effect of the moon on the terrestrial
magnetic phenomena, the existence of which does not appear to have
been even suspected at the time when the Report of the Committee
of Physics was drawn up.        The discovery of the moon's influence on
any of the magnetic elements is due, as already stated, to M. Kreil ;
but Toronto is the first, and as yet the only, station, at which the
numerical values at every lunar hour of the lunar- diurnal variations
of the three elements have been published.           Corresponding state
ments to that which has been given for Toronto, will be found for
St. Helena and Hobarton, in the volumes of those observatories,
which are now in preparation.        All the results at the three stations
present the same general characters. The lunar influence does not
appear to participate in the decennial inequality which is found in
all the solar variations (Phil. Trans. 1857, Art. I.). The lunar-
diurnal variation of each of the elements is a double progression in
the twenty-four hours, having epochs of maximum and minimum
symmetrically disposed. In character, therefore, it differs from
what might be expected to take place if the moon were possessed of
inherent magnetism, i. e. if she were a magnet, as it is usually
termed, per se ; and accords with the phenomena which might be
expected to follow if she were magnetic only by induction from the
earth.    On the other hand, it is believed that the amount of the
variation, as observed at each of these stations, very far exceeds what
can be imagined to proceed from the earth's inductive action re
flected from the moon. In this theoretical difficulty we are naturally
thrown back to seek a more extensive knowledge of the phenomena
than we have yet obtained, and to the generalization which will follow,
when sufficient materials for it have been procured.       In subordinate
particulars, a difference, which is apparently systematic, is perceived
to exist in regard to the hours which constitute the epochs of maxima
and minima at the three stations, as well as in regard to the amounts
of the respective variations ; these differences are no doubt intimately
connected with the causes of the phenomena, and are likely to lead
to their elucidation.     It is therefore greatly to be desired that the
number of stations furnishing complete determinations, such as the
Colonial Observatories only have hitherto supplied, should be in
creased.
   The domain of periodical variations has thus been considerably
enlarged since the Report of the Committee of Physics was drawn
up ; and must henceforth be understood to comprise, in addition to
the variations " whose amount is a function of the hour-angle of the
                             "                                          —

1st, those variations of the     three  elements whose  amount  is a func
tion of the hour-angle of the moon ; 2ndly, those variations which
were classed in the Committee's Report as "irregular," or "appa
rently observing no law," but which are now known to be governed
by laws depending on the sun's declination, and hour-angle ; and
                                    " regular " and " occasional," which
3rdly, those variations, both

304                        Royal Society : —
have   their epochs and amounts dependent apparently on a solar
period of not yet perfectly ascertained duration, manifesting itself
also by periodical changes in the frequency and amount of the solar
spots.    With the exception of the last-named class, all these varia
tions require, for their generalization, that the phenomena should be
investigated at several points of the earth's surface widely distant
from each other ; and we have now the knowledge, grounded on
experience, that a very few years are sufficient for the observations
at each station, with the instrumental means and methods recom
mended by the Royal Society, and when the investigation is made a
primary object by those who engage in it.
    Absolute Values and Secular Changes, — But interesting and valu
able as is the acquisition  of a fuller and more precise knowledge of
the comparatively small magnetic variations produced at the surface
of the earth by the action or influence of external bodies, even
greater importance seems to attach, — when terrestrial magnetism is
in question, — to the purposes of that distinct branch of the duties of
a magnetic observatory, which consists in the determination of the
absolute values and secular changes of the three magnetic elements.
By the absolute values we seek to acquire a knowledge of the
actual present order and distribution of the terrestrial magnetic
influence at the surface of the earth, and to provide the materials by
which the constancy, or otherwise, of the earth's magnetic charge
may hereafter be examined ; and by determinations of the present
 direction and amount of the secular changes, we seek to become
 acquainted with the laws, and ultimately with the causes, of that
most mysterious change, by which the magnetic condition of the
 globe at one epoch passes progressively and systematically into that
 of another. It is specially by determinations of this class, obtained
with the necessary precision in different parts of the globe, that, in
the words of the Committee's Report, " the patient inductive inquirer
must seek to ascend to the general laws of the earth's magnetism."
At the time when the Report of the Committee of Physics was
written, doubts were reasonably entertained,       whether the limited
time, during which the Colonial Observatories were likely to be
 maintained in action, would be sufficient for the determination of
 the secular changes ; and it was therefore very properly argued, that
 " these changes cannot be concluded from comparatively short series
 of observations without giving to the observations extreme nicety, so
 as to determine with perfect precision the mean state of the elements
 at the two extremes of the period embraced."         It is with much
 satisfaction, and with a well-deserved recognition of the pains which
have been bestowed by the successive Directors of the Toronto Ob
servatory, and their Assistants, on this branch of their duties, that I
 am able to refer to the determinations of the absolute values and
 secular changes of the three elements contained in the third volume
of the Toronto Observations, in evidence that the instrumental means
which were devised, and the methods which have been adopted, have
proved, under all the disadvantages of a first essay, sufficient to de

 Major-General Sabine on Colonial Magnetic Observatories.            305
 termine these data with a precision which is greatly in advance of
 preceding experience, and, as far as may be judged, equal to the
 present requirements of theoretical investigation.     This is the more
 deserving of notice, because Toronto is a station where the casual and
 periodical variations, which it was apprehended would seriously in
 terfere with the determination of absolute values, are unusually large.
 We may derive, therefore, from the results thus obtained, the greatest
 encouragement to persevere in a line of research which is no longer
 one of doubtful experiment, and to give it that further extension
which the interests of science require.
    Amongst the results which have recompensed the labours of the
 Colonial Observatories in this branch]of their inquiries, perhaps there
is none of more importance in respect to the general theory of ter
restrial magnetism, than the conclusion which has been established
by means of the observations of the Declination at St. Helena, that
the current annual amount of secular change takes place by equal
aliquot portions in every month, and even in every fortnight of the
year.     The magnitude of the annual change of the Declination at
St. Helena, 8' (or more precisely 7'"93 in each of the eight years in
which the observations were maintained), and the comparative tran
quillity of the tropical regions in regard to magnetic disturbances,
were circumstances which rendered St. Helena a particularly eligible
locality for an investigation of this nature. The result has been, to
remove secular change altogether from the category of atnlospheric
or thermic relations, with which, in the absence of a correct know
ledge of the facts, it has frequently been erroneously associated ; and
to show conclusively that it is a phenomenon of far more systematic
order and regularity than has been generally apprehended (Proceed
ings of the Royal Society, vol. vii. pp. 67-75).
    It has thus been shown, that, in each and all    of the branches of
inquiry   for which  the institution of the Colonial  Observatories was
recommended, they have accomplished the objects which were con
templated, and have in many respects exceeded the expectations on
which their recommendation was founded.          Nor has the scope of
their performance beeirfimited to a mere registry of the observa
tions, or to their publication in a crude and undigested form. It was
well remarked by an authority of the greatest weight, when address
ing the British Association on the occasion of the assembly of the
Magnetical and Meteorological Conference at Cambridge in 1845
                                        " A man may as well keep a
 (Herschel, Address, p. xxxv), that
register of his dreams, as of the weather or any other set of daily
phenomena, if the spirit of grouping, combining, and eliciting results
be absent."     To advance by the simple and straightforward path of
inductive inquiry, in a science such as terrestrial magnetism in which
a physical theory has yet to be sought, the endeavour must be made
 " to grapple with the palpable phenomena, seeking means to reduce
their features to measurement ; the measurements to laws ; the laws
to higher generalizations ; and so, step by step, to advance to causes
 and theories."    The mere observational part is not, and ought never,

to be, viewed as the fulfilment of the duties of institutions such as
magnetic observatories ; those duties ought always to be held to in
 clude (either on the part of the Directors of the Observatories them
 selves, or on that of persons who, as Superintendents or otherwise,
 have constantly watched the progress of the work)

 deduction from the registered observations, of the mean values, and
 of the local coefficients of diurnal, annual, and secular change ; "
 because " no other class of persons stands in anything like so favour
 able a position for working out the first elementary laws of pheno
 mena, and referring them to their immediate points of dependence,"
 as those who have directed or superintended the processes by which
 the data required for the knowledge of the phenomena have been
  obtained. The introductory discussions prefixed to the several vo
 lumes which contain the observations at the Colonial Observatories,
 and a succession of papers presented to the Royal Society, and pub
 lished in the Philosophical Transactions, bear testimony to at least
 unsparing labour, on the part of the Superintendent, to give a com
 pleteness to the experiment of Colonial Observatories, corresponding
 to its original conception ; though no one is more sensible than him
  self that this portion of the duty might well have fallen into abler
 hands.     One great advantage in the task has undoubtedly been en
 joyed, viz. the union of the detailed knowledge above alluded to,
  with the opportunity of generalization and consequent insight,
  afforded by results admitting of strict comparison and combination,
  obtained from well-selected stations at such distant points of the
 globe, and by a uniform system of observation.
     It may be useful on the present occasion to recall to more distinct
 recollection the views and opinions entertained by those who were the
 principal instigators of the proceedings by which the Royal Society
 became the responsible advisers, — and Her Majesty's Government
 the chief supporters, — of measures which have placed this country
 in the very conspicuous position of taking that lead in the advance
 ment of certain branches of science, which other nations were willing
 and desirous that she should take. These views cannot be better
 stated than in the words of one to whom all will be willing to concede
 pre-eminence, as well in counselling the recommendation to Govern
 ment as in conducting the several points connected with it to a suc
 cessful issue (Herschel, in Quart. Review, No. CXXXL).           "Great
 physical theories, with their trains of practical consequences, are pre
 eminently national objects, whether for glory or utility. In effect,
such they ought to be considered by every nation calling itself civi
lized ; and if we look to consequences, we have only to point to the
history of science in all its branches to show, that every great ac
cession to theoretical knowledge has uniformly been followed by a
new practice, and by the abandonment of ancient methods as com
paratively inefficient and uneconomical.       This consideration alone
we think sufficient to justify, even on utilitarian grounds, a large and
liberal devotion of the public means to setting on foot undertakings
and maintaining establishments, in which the investigation of physical
Jaws, and the determination of exact data, should be the avowed and

primary object, and practical application the secondary, incidental,
and collateral one.      That the time is now fully arrived when other
great branches of physical knowledge must be considered as entitled
to share in that public support and encouragement which has hitherto
fallen to the lot of astronomy alone, will, we think, be granted with
out hesitation by all who duly consider the present state and pro
spects of science.      The great problems which offer themselves on
all hands for solution — problems which the wants of the age force
upon us as practically interesting, and with which its intellect feels
itself competent to deal — are far more complex in their conditions,
and depend on data which, to be of use, must be accumulated in far
greater masses/ collected over an infinitely wider field, and worked
upon with a greater and more systematized power, than has sufficed
for the necessities of astronomy.         The collecting, arranging, and
duly combining these data ar« operations, which, to be carried out
to the extent of the requirements of modern science, lie utterly be
yond the reach of all private industry, means or enterprize.          Our
demands are not merely for a slight and casual sprinkling to refresh
and invigorate an ornamental or luxurious product, but for a copious,
steady, and well-directed stream, to call forth from a soil ready to
yield it, an ample, healthful, and remunerating harvest. There are
secrets of nature we would fain see revealed, — resources hidden in her
 fertile bosom for the well-being of man upon earth, we would fain
see opened up for the use of the generation to which we belong. But
if we would be enlightened by the one, or benefited by the other,
we must lay on power, both moral and physical, without grudging
and without stint."
    If at the period when it was still doubtful what the Colonial Ob
servatories then just established might be able to accomplish, — and
when, in effect, the expectations from them were little more than
the anticipations of what a voyage of discovery upon an unknpwn
ocean might produce, — the propriety of embarking upon such inves
tigations was thus unhesitatingly affirmed, how much more confidently
may the duty of perseverance be insisted upon, when the results of
the first experiment have already more than realized the hopes which
caused it to be undertaken.        They have indeed confirmed the belief
that " the gigantic problem proposed to be resolved
                                                          " is of a nature
to yield in its full extent only to "continued and persevering inquiry ;

but at the same time they may.be said, in a certain sense, to have
narrowed the field of inquiry, by showing more distinctly than was
previously apprehended, both what is desired to be known, and how
and where it is to be sought.       If the history of magnetical science
is to be something more than a fragment, the research must be per
severed in.
    In considering the means by which the researches thus opened out
may be most advantageously prosecuted, it is natural that we should
look, in the first instance, to the adoption, at other selected stations,
of arrangements similar to those which were instituted at the stations
which were chosen for a first, and as it has proved, successful expe

  Toronto, St. Helena, and the Cape of Good Hope, to other of the
  British Colonies, where the same objects can be accomplished in an
  equally effective and economical manner.
      "In cases where the institution of similar establishments is
  Strongly urged by the Governor of a Colony, — where competent per
  sons are present and disposed to superintend the observations, and
  where soldiers of the Artillery are stationed whose services may be
  available, and whose employment has been shown to be economical
  and effective in a high degree in the execution of a laborious and
   exact routine of observation, — there is wanting only a supply of in
  struments, — the temporary allotment of a building to contain them,
  — extra pay, such as the individuals at the above-named Observatories
  receive, — and an authorized connexion with a head-quarter esta
  blishment whence they may derive instruction and guidance.
      "The cost of one of the Ordnance Observatories (including £\ 00
  a year for incidentals of all kinds) is .£392 a year, exclusive of pub
  lication.   It may be assumed that five years of hourly observation
  is a sufficient time of continuance for obtaining in any particular
  colony the mean values of the magnetical and meteorological ele
  ments, and their diurnal, annual, and secular variations, as well as
  the peculiarities of climate bearing on the health and industrial oc
 cupations of man.        If the observations were printed in full detail
 for the five years, they would occupy two quarto volumes ; but if it
 were thought sufficient hereafter that duplicate or triplicate manu
 script copies should be deposited in different public libraries, and
 that publication should be confined to abstracts and an analysis, the
 cost of the publication would form but a small addition.
     " The colonies of Ceylon, New Brunswick, Bermuda, and New
 foundland are in the described case ; their respective Governors are
 recommending the establishment of Magnetical and Meteorological
 Observatories in them ; competent directors are on the spot [this
 was written in 1845] ; and they are all Artillery stations."
     To the four stations thus named may be now added Mauritius and
 Demerara, as from both those Colonies, strong and repeated applica
 tions to the same effect have been sent through their respective Go
 vernors to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Both these Colo
 nies have offered to bear a portion of the expense of the proposed esta
 blishments ; and have earnestly solicited to be placed in connexion
 with a head-quarter establishment, from which they might receive
 properly constructed instruments, with instructions and guidance in
their use.      Can it be said that we perform our duty as a mother-
country when we put such applications on the shelf? — whilst, in the
interests of science, it would be difficult to estimate too highly the
value of such institutions, —in forming good observers, who might
subsequently extend their activity over a wider range, — in affording
to travelling observers the opportunity of testing and correcting their

instruments, as well as keeping up and perfecting their skill in ob
servation, — and in contributing to arouse, to nourish, and to extend
to other parts of natural knowledge, that desire for the greatest pos
sible accuracy, which was formerly met with only in astronomy and
in geodesical operations of the highest class.
    When it was first suggested that the officers and soldiers of the
 scientific corps of the army (Artillery or Engineers) stationed in the
 Colonies might, both beneficially to themselves and advantageously
to the public interests, be made available for the performance of
 such temporary services, the suggestion, from its novelty, might
 have been open to many objections.       None were, indeed, made by
 the military authorities of the time, who on the contrary approved
and encouraged the proposition.       There may have been doubts en
 tertained in other quarters whether persons, whose ordinary occu
 pations were so dissimilar, would be found to possess the necessary
 qualifications for carrying out a scheme of exact and varied observa
tion, in which there was then no precedent to guide, and of which
the performance would be sure to be extensively and closely scruti
nized : but such doubts, if they existed, have probably long since
subsided, as the successive volumes of the Colonial Observatories
have appeared.
    One great and unquestionable advantage    which future institutions
of this nature will have over those whose     duties are accomplished,
will be found in the assistance they will derive from the Physical
 Observatory of the British Association at Kew, as a head-quarter
Observatory, in which their instruments can be prepared and ve
rified, the constants, &c. carefully determined, new instruments be
devised as occasion may require, and tested by experiment before
they are sent out for use, and to which practical difficulties of all
kinds, which may present themselves to the directors, may be re
 ferred.
    The omission of a provision of this kind when the Observatories
were first formed, was undoubtedly a great fault, which has been,
and could only be, very imperfectly remedied by the Woolwich esta
blishment, designed for a very different purpose, and insufficient
even for the duties for which it was designed.
    There is another advantage (if it be one) which might attend the
early prosecution, viz. the opportunity of consulting (if it were
desired to consult) the experience of the person who has conducted,
— and, as he believes, successfully conducted, — the first experiment,
from its commencement       now almost to its close ; but this, in the
course of nature, can only be available for a few years to come.
    The Colonial establishments were instituted at the instance of the
Royal Society and British Association, with a more general concur
rence and approval on the part of the cultivators of science in all
parts of the globe than, it is believed, were ever before manifested in
regard to any purely scientific undertaking ; and with such a cordial
and effective cooperation of the public authorities as is well deserving
of being held in remembrance. It is for those two great scientific

     " On   the Immediate Principles of Human Excrements in the
Healthy State."       By W. Marcet, M.D., F.C.S.
     In a previous paper I had the honour of communicating to the
Royal Society the results of a first series of investigations on the
immediate principles of the feces of man and animals ; since then I
have continued my researches on human excrements,              being most
ably    seconded  by my   assistant,  Mr. Frederick  Dupre, Ph.D.
    The new results obtained were the following : —
     1. Margarate of lime, phosphate of lime, and margarate of mag
nesia were discovered to be immediate principles of human evacua
tions.
     2. I found a new method for obtaining excretine, and its chemical
formula has been established.
     3. The fact that vegetable food induces the presence of margaric
acid in excrements has been confirmed.
    4. The existence of a comparatively large quantity of cholesterine
in the spleen, which     I had mentioned before as probable, has been
confirmed.
     When human feces are exhausted with boiling alcohol, the fluid
being rapidly strained through a cloth, a clear extract is obtained,
which, on cooling, yields a deposit ; this substance, being collected
 on a filter, is partly soluble in boiling alcohol, and there remains un
 dissolved a residue insoluble in ether and alcohol. The residue in
 question being boiled with a solution of potash, dissolves almost
 entirely, and the addition of hydrochloric acid induces the formation
 of a precipitate in the solution. On examining this precipitate, it
 was found to consist of a crystallizable substance fusing at 60° Cent. ;
 its structure and other properties were precisely those of margaric
 acid.
     The acid filtrate contained phosphoric acid and lime.           From
 several quantitative analyses, I concluded that there was more lime
 than is required to combine with the phosphoric acid in the form of
 the neutral phosphate, the excess of lime being exactly that which
 was necessary to convert the margaric acid into a neutral margarate
 of lime, C34HaaO.! + CaO. Consequently it followed that the three
 substances existed in the form of margarate of lime and phosphate
 of' lime as immediate principles of human feces.
     The alcoholic filtrate from the deposit being allowed to stand for
 twenty-four hours, deposited another substance, of a nearly white
 appearance, and which proved to be margarate of magnesia.
     The peculiar action of a vegetable diet on human feces was inves
tigated by means of experiments undertaken upon myself, when I
observed that an entirely vegetable diet was attended with the form
 ation of a large quantity of margaric acid in the excrements, — most
 probably not in the form of a margarate, but in the free state, inas
 much as it was obtained from the decomposition, with hydrochloric

acid, of the precipitate induced by adding milk of lime to the cold
and clear alcoholic extract of fseces, after the separation of the above-
 described deposits.
   In the month of December 1855, I had an opportunity of noticing
that during a cold night, when the temperature falls below the
freezing-point, excretine crystallizes readily and in large quantity in
the clear alcoholic extract of faeces ; this method I employed as often
as possible, to prepare enough excretine for its chemical analysis ;
but the cold weather not lasting long enough, and this season having
been remarkably mild, I was compelled to adopt a modification of
the process by milk of lime, described in my former communication.
   Having prepared a sufficient quantity of excretine, partly by the
action of cold, and partly by means of milk of lime, the chemical
composition of this substance was now determined.           A qualitative
analysis showed it to consist of carbon, hydrogen, sulphur and
oxygen* ; there was no water of crystallization present. Oxide of
copper was employed at first for the combustions, but they were
subsequently undertaken with chromate of lead, on account of the
large proportion of carbon that excretine contains ; no substance
having been found to combine with                 it,
                                             its atomic composition was
calculated from the assumption that one equivalent contained one
equivalent of sulphur    and the following formula was obtained: —
                                 ;

          System of Train-Signalling,      by which also disabled Trains
 mav telegraph for assistance without the aid of portable apparatus."
 By Charles V. Walker, Esq., F.R.S.
    When, in the early days of telegraphy, messages were sent and
 trains were signalled on the same wires, no facilities existed for
reducing the apparatus employed for the latter purpose, to a simple
form.      The case is now becoming different, special wires being
largely devoted to train signals ; hence the present system.
    The instrument employed is a large electro-magnet, with a move
able armature, carrying a stem and a hammer, which latter strikes
 on a bell by the direct force of magnetism.           It is provided with a
contact-maker, a spring, the depression of which causes a current to
circulate.     The bobbins are 4 in. X 3 in. ; and are filled with ten
pounds of covered copper wire, No. 16 or No. 18.                The core is of
five-eight   inch   iron.   The  armature   and   appendages weigh 2-J oz.
Bells of this kind have been in action for five years without cleaning
or repairing. The battery is zinc-graphite, and a solution of 1 sulph.
ac. + 8 or 10 water.        The plates, 7y in. X 3 in., are placed in stone
pots   that  contain    about a quart, the zinc standing in a gutta-percha
slipper, containing mercury.         Batteries of this kind will do their
 work unteuded for half a year and longer.
    The language consists of blows on the bell ; the number of blows
varies according to the train-signal to be given.             The distinctions
required   for  ordinary purposes being     few,  the   bell-language is very
appropriate,    from   its addressing the ear, from  its simplicity and from
the facility with which the signals are given and taken.             One blow
is for the starting of an ordinary train ; two, for an express ; three,
For the arrival of a train ; five, for stopping all trains ; six, for testing.
This is a general code ; other forms of code . are used for protecting
level crossings and junctions ; but the fundamental signals of the
general code are of universal application.          This system was intro
duced five years ago on the South Eastern Railway ; and at the
present time consists of about 100 bells, to which additions are in
progress.
    The bells are connected in pairs, both bells being in a circuit that
terminates in the earth in the usual way, at each station. The
signal is made by depressing the spring from its earth-contact, upon
the zinc end of the battery, the graphite end being in permanent
connexion with the earth. The battery being thus introduced between
the bell and the earth, a current circulates along the wire and pro
duces one blow upon the bell.         The home bell may be excluded or
not from the circuit, when a signal is sent.

       Mr. C. V. Walker     on a System    of Train-signalling.      313
   By the   above arrangement signals are sent from station to station.
But the   extreme simplicity of the battery, the bell, and the language
allows the arrangements to be so modified that signals may be made
on a pair of bells from any joint, intermediate between two bell-
stations,  without the necessity of providing the signaller with any
telegraph or battery, or any electrical apparatus whatever. The ad
dition of this property to the bells does not in any way interfere
with their being in perfect action and constant use for the ordinary
work of train-signalling, and therefore if the guards of trains and
the plate-layers of the permanent way are provided with a signal for
expressing their wants, a great advance is made in telegraphy, and
a large element of safety is gained for the travelling public.
   It is well known to electricians that, if two equal and opposed
currents are presented to the respective ends of a wire, no evidence is
manifested of the circulation of electric force ; the wire is in a null
state, as much so as if no current was presented to it.       Taking ad
vantage of this law, in connexion with the simple bell-system above
described, the circuit is made to contain the two batteries, one at
each station, as well as the pair of bells ; the same pole, the graphite,
for instance, of each battery being connected with the earth.
   When the home-station signaller desires to make a signal, he
depresses the spring as before ; but the connexions are such, that
by this act he excludes his own battery from the circuit.     The circuit
then contains but one battery, —namely that at the pass station j the
current of which is now able to circulate from end to end, being no
longer counterbalanced by an equal and opposite current ; and con
sequently the bells are sounded. This, then, is the process for ordi
nary train-signalling, under this arrangement.
   By altering the contact- maker so that it inverts the battery in the
circuit, instead of putting it out of circuit, both batteries are made
available for each signal ; and consequently the power and with it the
cost of each may be reduced.
   But the null state of the wire is equally well and very readily
destroyed, by connecting it with the earth at any point intermediate
between the two stations ; for by this process a complete circuit is
made or channel opened for the discharge of both ends of both
batteries, each independently of the other, except that the attached
wire between the earth and the telegraph wire is common to both
circuits, and thus the bells at the respective stations are actuated by
the batteries of the respective stations.    If ten blows with a pause of
a minute, and then ten more, is the signal that the engine is disabled ;
ten blows, and a minute of contact, that an accident has happened ; a
ringing continued beyond ten, that the permanent way is obstructed,
the stations at either side are advised and can take the measures
necessary to meet the case.
   These contacts may be made by hooking a wire or rod on to the line
wire and making the necessary contacts with the rail ; or, which is
better, by establishing contact-makers, properly secured at frequent
intervals on the telegraph posts.
   This system gives to those in charge of disabled trains a certain

  without any training beyond that of counting ten slowly and cor
 rectly.     In practice, as between Red-Hill and Reigate, no inconveni
 ence or loss of electricity has been suffered from counterbalancing the
  two currents.
     The author states that there are other properties of opposed
 currents to be communicated on another occasion.

              NOTES ON FROTH.          BY  DR. GLADSTONE, F.R.S.
           liquids,  when shaken up with air, form bubbles ; but some
  ALLallow       these  bubbles to break and disappear the moment they
 are at rest, while others give rise to a more or less permanent froth.
 This difference among liquids appears to be of a specific character,
 and cannot as yet be shown to be dependent on any other quality.
     As a general rule, aqueous solutions of organic bodies are most
 disposed to froth.        Beer is a familiar instance.       In this case the
 formation of the froth is originally due in a great measure to the
 rising of carbonic acid gas through the liquid ; but its permanence
 is totally independent of that, or indeed of any dissolved gas.          This
 was proved by subjecting some beer to exhaustion by an air-pump
 till every trace of the carbonic acid and air it contained was removed,
¦withdrawing it from the vacuum, and shaking it immediately, when
 a fine froth was produced which was as persistent, or nearly so, as
 if the beer had continued brisk.
     Solutions of the acetates are peculiarly disposed to produce a per
 manent froth.       To such an extent is this the case, that in making use
 of mixtures of salts, I have sometimes distinguished those contain
ing an acetate by this property.          The acetate of iron is pre-eminent;
but the acetates of copper, lead, and other metals share this property
to a considerable extent.          Yet acetic acid itself shows no disposition
to froth ; and the bubbles made when alcohol or rether are shaken,
instantly disappear.        Acetate of iron gives off much dissolved air
¦when it is exhausted by the pump, but it froths equally afterwards.
The citrate of iron is analogous to the acetate.
    This property of frothing is quite independent of specific gravity.
A heavy solution of sulphindigotic acid froths, but a solution of
chloride of ammonium of high density produces no persistent bub
bles when shaken ; while, on the other hand, a weak solution of
soap, that differs little from distilled water, will produce, as every
one knows, a very permanent froth.
    The froth on the surface of a coloured liquid is always of a lighter
tint than the liquid itself. This is what might be anticipated, when
it is remembered that in looking at froth, we see the light which
has traversed only very thin films of the liquid, and hence has been
subjected to but little absorption.         Sometimes, however, the colour
of froth is totally different from that of the liquid on which it floats :
cochineal, for instance, givei a deep red aqueous solutaODi which

                  Intelligence and Miscellaneous    Articles.          315
froths considerably when agitated, but the bubbles appear of a pale
bluish-purple.      This is due to the dichromatic character of the liquids
in question ; they admit many rays of the spectrum for a certain
distance which are afterwards absorbed, and that in such a way that
the sum of the rays transmitted by the thin stratum conveys to the
observer a different impression of colour to that which is conveyed by
those rays which can penetrate a thicker stratum.           Thus the thin
film of cochineal solution which constitutes a bubble transmits the
red ray, a yellowish-green ray, a bluish-green ray, and nearly the
whole of the blue and violet of the spectrum ; the resulting colour
is accordingly bluish-purple mixed with much white light : a thicker
 stratum of the same cuts off both the green rays, and a still thicker
 one transmits only the red.
     Of a similar nature is an appearance observed in port- wine. The
 new wine, when shaken, forms a bubble which is faintly red, while
 old port forms one that is colourless.        This, indeed, is sometimes
 taken advantage of as an indication of the age of port.        The differ
 ence arises partly from a gradual change that takes place in the
 colouring matter of the wine, partly also on the diminished thick
                                                                            '
 ness of the film that constitutes the bubble of the older and ' thinner
 wine.     If old port be placed in a hollow glass wedge, and thus in
 terposed between the eye and a slit in the window-shutter in such a
 Way that the line of light is seen traversing the different thicknesses
 of the liquid, that line will appear white where the stratum is thin
 nest, and will become red very suddenly as the stratum increases ;
 almost as intensely red, in fact, as when the thickness is considerable ;
 and if this line of light be analysed by a prism, it will be seen that
  every ray of the spectrum traverses the thin stratum, but that sud
  denly they are cut off, all at very nearly the same distance, with the
  exception of the red ray and a portion of the orange, which are
  transmitted through almost any amount of the liquid.
     Some bubbles, as is well known, exhibit that beautiful pheno
  menon designated ' the colours of thin plates,' or 'Newton's rings.'
  This is most strikingly displayed by the froth on the surface of the
  black liquid produced by adding a few drops of sulphuric acid to oil
  of turpentine : the play of colours is beautifully relieved against the
  black background.
           NOTE ON CAPILLARY ACTION.           BY G. WERTHKIM.
     The theory of capillarity rests upon the hypothesis that the volume
  of liquid which is raised above the level is in proportion to the con
  tour of the section of the solid wall, whatever may be the curvature
  of this contour.      This hypothesis, enunciated by Laplace and coin
  cident with that of Young, serves as a point of departure from which
  we descend to the development of all particular cases, and rise on the
   other hand to the study of molecular forces.      It cannot therefore be
  too carefully verified ; but unfortunately the integration of the fun
  damental differential equation is only capable of being effected in

certain particular cases, so that its experimental verification has been
confined within very narrow limits.
   To effect this verification in a more general manner, I have ope
rated as follows :¦— I commenced by observing the asymptotic curve
 generatrix of the surface of the meniscus raised by a plane ; having
measured the corresponding values of the ordinates above the level,
for abscissae very close to each other, this curve was afterwards con
structed by points, and the area and position of the centre of gravity
of the surface comprised between this curve and the two axes were
determined by experiment.       The same determinations were effected
for menisci raised by a great number of convex cylinders of different
diameters, and by means of Guldin's theorem the volumes of the
solids generated by the revolution of these surfaces round the axes
of their cylinders were calculated. In the same way the capillary
surface of the liquid included between two parallel planes, placed at
different distances (2a), was found : let h be the height above the
level of the lowest point of this curve, b the area of the section of
the semi-meniscus, and / the breadth of one plane; 2l(ha, + b) will
be the volume of the liquid raised.
   The quotients of all the volumes which we have just found for
one liquid at the same temperature, divided by the corresponding
contours of the solid bodies, must be equal amongst themselves
if the hypothesis be correct, and must furnish the constant of
capillarity   — sin   <j>   (in which   is   the designation of the complement
                                       f
of the angle formed by the extreme element of the curve with                        the
wall).
   This process does not apply to concave cylindrical surfaces                  ;    in
these we can only observe the elevation       of the lowest point of the
                                                      h
surface, and this     what
                      is      have done with
                                   I             great number of tubes

of the well-known formulae of Poisson.
   Lastly, in order to avoid being entirely deprived of data with regard
to tubes of middle size,    had several drawn in zinc
                               I                        and after coat

slightly superior to that of fusion. The ascension took place, and
after cooling, the interior column retained very nearly its primitive
height, and the meniscus its original surface so that after dissolving

   From the numbers contained in this Table we may draw the fol
lowing conclusions : —
   1. Two parallel planes            raise a constant volume, whatever may be
their distance, and even when this distance is infinitely great. As
regards water, the curve which I have found for a single plane
accords very well with that observed by Hagen ; the values of h
between two planes differ but little from those found by Simon (of
Metz), only the latter physicist has wrongly attempted to apply to
all distances, a law which mathematicians have never enunciated
except as being approximative^ true for very small distances.
   2. The constant capillarity calculated from experiments made
with narrow lubes with some liquids is equal, and with others far
superior to that determined by means of two planes ; it is accidental
that with water the relation between these two values is evidently

318                Intelligence and Miscellaneous               Articles.
equal to     -,   as has been pointed out by Simon               :   this relation is nearly
2 for the chloride of iron and 1 for our other liquids.
   3. The wide tubes give a value which is comprised between the
two preceding values when the latter differ, and equal to them when
they coincide ; this is what takes place with alcohol, and it is for
this reason that the only experiment of verification cited by Laplace
and Poisson gave a result which accords exactly with the formula :
it would not have been so              if,
                                 in this experiment, Gay-Lussac had
made use of water instead of alcohol.         It will be seen also why
Frankenheim* found that experiment disagreed with the formula,
even when he employed tubes of an internal diameter of 14 millims.
   4. In proportion as the radii of convex cylinders diminish in de
parting from the plane where this radius      infinitely great, the volume
                                                         is
raised continues diminishing for the first two liquids with the others   ;
this diminution commences at        certain limit of curvature, and in
                                             a
creases gradually and apparently indefinitely.        Amongst the liquids
which  I have tried, aether   that which presents the most constant
                                  is
volume but unfortunately the results relating thereto are less cer
         ;
tain than the others, notwithstanding the precautions which            took         I
to diminish the evaporation during the experiment.            And, in any
case,  it  not to the absence of viscosity that this constancy would
            is
have to be attributed    comparative experiments with pure water and
                            ;
gum-water having shown that viscosity, although retarding the
movement when the equilibrium          established, has no sensible in
                                                  is
fluence upon this definitive state.
   To explain these facts, one might be tempted to admit that the
angle of contingence varies with the curvature of the wall           but            ;       it
may be demonstrated that this       not the case.
                                             is       Thus, we consider      if
only the menisci of water and chloride of iron raised by one plane,
for which we should have already < 90°, the area of the section

   It will be necessary, therefore, to have recourse to another hypo
thesis, and, I believe, to take into account the variable thickness of
the liquid stratum or sheath which adheres to the solid body.        This
hypothesis   has  been  suggested   to  me  by  a  series  of experiments
which I have made upon the elevation of the solution of protochlo-
ride of iron between two parallel iron plates which I fixed to the
                        '
poles of a Ruhmkorff s electro-magnet.         The lower extremities of
these plates were immersed in the solution, and the values A and b
for the different distances 2a were already known.          A current was
then passed into the apparatus, of which the intensity was gradually
increased and measured, when the magnetic liquid was seen to rise
between the two planes, often to twice or three times its original
height, whilst the surface acquired the curvature suitable to this new
elevation ; but for each intensity of magnetization the volume raised
remains evidently constant whatever be the distance of the two
planes ; in one word, things go on as if the constant capillarity had
been doubled or tripled. We know, however, from the experiments
of Brunner and Mousson, that the attraction of the liquid upon itself
is not altered by its magnetization ; and, on the other hand, the

may cause this thickness to vary, the influence of temperature may
be very different from that foreseen by the theory, only taking into
account the dilatation of the liquid. — Comptes Rendus, May 18/1857,

                  THE IMPROVED          INDUCTION       COIL:
      To the Editors   of   the Philosophical     Magazine and Journal.
     Gentlemen,
 I   am surprised to find that Mr. Hearder, after his communication
to the Mechanics' Magazine for July 11, has again accused me of
having copied his induction coil.    He there states, that at the con
clusion of one of his lectures at the London Institution, Mr. Shuter
of Farringdon Street, when speaking about my induction coil,
asserted " that he (Mr. Shuter) had had almost as much to do with
its construction as Mr. Bentley, since all the different plans for car
rying out the mode of insulation, &c. were concocted between them
at his house  ;  that Mr. Bentley had tried various thicknesses of
gutta-percha with different degrees of success, and at length on one
occasion came running to him (Mr. Shuter) with breathless delight,
telling him that he had actually produced spark nearly two inches
                                                   a
in length. These statements were made in the presence of my
friend Dr. Letheby, and with such an air of honest frankness that          I
covM not but credit them."

  820             Intelligence  and Miscellaneous   Articles.
     The whole of this statement, if made, is incorrect ; but as Mr.
 Hearder says he could not help giving credence to it, it follows that
 he cannot really believe me guilty of appropriating his contrivances,
  although he has accused me of doing so.         Mr. Hearder appears to
 think that I have acknowledged his claim to priority ; I have done
 nothing of the kind ; I merely consider the claim unworthy of dis
 pute, and not of sufficient importance to occupy any space in your
 Journal.
     Mr. Hearder wishes to know by what means I ascertained that
 my contact-breaker vibrated 2000 times a second, and suggests that
 I have added a cipher too many. The mere fact that my machine
 can be made to act ten times more rapidly than he imagined, shows
 that our instruments work differently, although Mr. Hearder will not
 admit any difference in their construction.
     The method adopted to ascertain the rate of vibration was simply
 to press a card upon the periphery of a toothed wheel, which was
 rotated rapidly until the musical sound emitted by the card was in
 unison with the tone which was produced at the contact-breaker ;
 the number of teeth on the wheel, multiplied by its revolutions per
 second, gave the number of vibrations for that particular sound,
 which was 200 X 10=2000.
     These rapid movements need not excite surprise, as small springs
 have vibrated before the poles of electro-magnets 20,000 times a
 second.
     If Mr. Hearder's statements about the coils which he exhibited in
 London be correct, I am not the only one deceived in their construc
 tion, for all those to whom I had spoken on the subject had formed
the same opinion as I had of their structure.
    Mr. Hearder seems determined to do what he can to deprive me
of any slight credit I may deserve, and he does not seem particular
about the means he adopts to do so.        He first tries to make my coil
the joint production of Mr. Shuter and myself; then he accuses me
of having copied his machine.
    It is evident that if I made my coil after Mr. Hearder's pattern, I
could not have been indebted to Mr. Shuter for his assistance, yet
Mr. Hearder says he believes I was. Mr. Hearder also intimates
that my name ought not to be associated with the improved induc
tion coils ; I suggested this myself in my January communication,
and said that my coil, and those made by others, ought still to be
called Ruhmkorff's coils.
                               I am, Gentlemen,
                                         Your obedient Servant,
                                                           C. A. Bentley.
   [Our readers, we doubt not, see very clearly the respective merits of
our correspondents, and the origin of their difference as to the ques
tion of priority.    We hope the discussion will terminate here. Each
of our correspondents has his coil. The next question is, to what
good purpose is he about to turn it ? The man who does most with
his instrument will eventually stand highest, — J, T.]

 XXXVII.      On the Influence of Light upon Chlorine, and some
    remarks on Alchemy.      By John W. Draper, M.D., Professor
    of Chemistry  and  Physiology in the University of New York*.
                years ago  I observed that when a mixture of chlo
 SEVERAL
      rine and hydrogen   is exposed to light, union does not occur
 at once, but that a certain interval must elapse, during which
 absorption takes place, the combination then proceeding in a
uniform manner.
    It is by the chlorine that this absorptive agency is exercised,
the indigo ray being chiefly influenced.     And not only is it that
ray which is thus absorbed : to it also must be attributed the sub
 sequent combination.
    Among several other facts connected with this subject, which
may be found in the Philosophical Magazine (July 1844), the
American Journal of Science, vol. xlix., and other publications
                                        I
of that time, there is one to which would particularly direct
attention. Chlorine which has been exposed to the sun has ob
tained properties not possessed by chlorine which has been made
and kept in the dark ; and the change is by no means transient,
but lasts for many hours and even days.
    In their recent examination of this fact, Professor Bun sen and
Dr. Roscoe do not appear to regard the modification in question
as being of so permanent a nature.      Perhaps it may have been
that the insolation to which they submitted the chlorine was not
continued sufficiently long, or perhaps the light was not suffi
ciently intense.    My opinion was founded on three different
conditions of the experiment : — 1st, on the behaviour of chlorine
                   * Communicated by the Author.
   Phil. Mag. S. 4. Vol. 14. No. 94. Nov. 1857.              Y

itself, confined over salt water ; 2nd, on the effects of a mixture
of chlorine and hydrogen in equal volumes, as disengaged from
hydrochloric acid by a voltaic current ; 3rd, on the action of a
solution of pure chlorine in distilled water.       In each of these
instances, the active properties imparted to the chlorine by ex
posure to light were plainly perceptible for a long time after.
          I
Indeed infer from the experiments of those chemists, that they
found the effects to continue for a certain brief period.      If they
do so continue, though only in a momentary manner, after the
light has been shut off,    I  do not see in what other way we are
to explain the result, than on the principle of a change in the
relations of the chlorine. In this interpretation it is very well
known that Berzelius coincided, in his account of my experi
                                  '
ments in the ' Annual Report for 1847.
   At first I thought that there was a general analogy between
the case of chlorine thus thrown into an active state, and that of
iron in its passive condition. An iron wire which has been made
passive, will quickly revert to the condition of activity if sub
mitted to any jarring, vibration, or other trivial disturbance ; its
passive state being in one sense permanent, though very easily
lost.    But subsequently    I  found many reasons for supposing
that the impression is of a much more lasting nature, and
resembles that on phosphorus after a similar exposure to the
indigo rays.     As an illustration of what is here meant,      I may
relate, that having obtained a thin stratum of perfectly white
phosphorus between two pieces of glass,     I exposed it to a motion
less solar spectrum, and found that it turned of a dark brown
colour in those spaces on which the more refrangible rays fell,
the effect reaching a maximum under the indigo ray.          The fixed
lines of Fraunhofer were very prettily depicted as white streaks,
particularly the larger ones at H.      I kept this sample of phos
phorus for several years without its showing any disposition to
resume the active state.
   Professor Bunsen and Dr. Roscoe dwell very appropriately on
the disturbing effects of minute quantities of extraneous gases,
mingled with chlorine, on photo-chemical induction.           No one
who has used a tithonometer can have failed to make a similar
remark.      My attention has been directed to that subject in its
more general aspect ; and     I                                 I
                                will ingenuously confess that have
made several attempts at the transmutation of metals, on the
principle of compelling them, by the aid of solar light, to be dis
engaged from states of combination, in the midst of resisting or
disturbing media.
   The following is a description of one of these alchemical
attempts.     In the focus of a burning-lens, 12 inches in dia
meter, was placed a glass flask 2 inches in diameter, containing

               Prof. Callan  on the  Induction Apparatus.             323
nitric acid diluted with its own volume of water.                Into the
nitric acid were poured alternately small quantities of a solution
of nitrate of silver and of hydrochloric acid, the object being to
cause the chloride of silver to form in a minutely divided state,
so as to produce a milky liquid, into the interior of which the
brilliant converging cone of light might pass, and the currents
 generated in the flask by the heat, might drift all the chloride
successively through the light.          The chloride, if otherwise ex
posed to the sun, merely blackens upon the surface, the interior
parts undergoing no change ; this difficulty I hoped therefore to
avoid.    The burning-glass promptly brings on a decomposition
of the salt, evolving on the one hand chlorine, and disengaging
a metal    on the other.     In   one experiment    the exposure lasted
from    11 a.m. to 1 p.m. ;   it was therefore equal to a continuous
midday sun of seventy-two hours.            The metal was disengaged
very   well.    But  what  is  it ?   It cannot  be silver, since nitric
acid has no action upon it.         It burnished in an agate mortar,
but its reflexion is not like the reflexion of silver : it is yellower.
The light must therefore have so transmuted the original silver
as to enable it to exist in the presence of nitric acid.         In 1837
I published some experiments on the nature of this decomposi
tion in the Journal of the Franklin Institute.
   Though this experiment, and several modifications of it which
I might relate, fail to establish any permanent change in the
metal under trial in the sense of an actual transmutation, it does
not follow that we should despair of a final success. It is
not likely that Nature has made fifty elementary substances of
a metallic form, many of them so closely resembling one another
as to be with difficulty distinguished; moreover, chlorine and
other elementary substances can be changed by the sunlight in
some respects permanently ; and if silver has not thus far been
transmuted into a more noble metal, as platinum or gold, it has
at all events been made transiently into a something which
is not silver.    Those who will reflect a little on the matter, can
not fail to observe that the sun-rays really possess many of the
powers once fabulously imputed to the powder of projection and
the philosopher's stone.
XXXVIII.        On   the Induction Apparatus.         By the Rev. N. J.
   Callan, D.D.,      Professor of   Natural  Philosophy    in the Roman
   Catholic College, Maynooth*.
       is now more than twenty years since             I discovered the
IT     method of making the induction coil, or a coil by which an
electric current of enormous intensity may be produced with the
                    * Communicated by the Author.

aid of a single galvanic cell, — a coil which is now to be used for
working the Atlantic Telegraph. Mr. Faraday was the first who
developed the laws of electrical induction ; but he did not discover
the method of making a coil by which a current of very great
intensity may be obtained by means of a very small battery.
This was first discovered in Maynooth College in 1836.               In the
summer of 1837,        I   sent the late Mr. Sturgeon a small coil
which he exhibited at a meeting of the Electrical Society in
London, and from which he gave shocks to several of the mem
bers. After the meeting,        I received a letter of thanks from him,
in which he described the astonishment of those who experienced
the extraordinary power of the coil.            This was the first induc
tion coil of great power ever seen outside the College of May
nooth.     The first notice of the discovery of the coil is found in
a paper of mine published in the London Philosophical Maga
zine for December 1836.                                  I
                                  In 1836 and 1837 also discovered
that the intensity of the current induced in the coil increased
with the number of cells employed, and that a shock may be got
from the coil at the moment of making as well as of breaking con
nexion with the battery. In April 1837 I published, in Sturgeon's
 '
   Annals of Electricity,' a description of an instrument which             I
devised for producing a rapid succession of electrical currents in
the coil by rapidly making and breaking communication                  with
the battery.      This, as Mr. Bachhoffner says in one of his papers
                               '
 published in Sturgeon's Annals,' was the first contact-breaker
 ever made.      Thus, before April 1837        I had completed the coil
 as a machine for producing a regular supply of electricity. From
 1837 till the end of 1854 my attention was directed to other
 matters.     Since the beginning of 1855, I made a long series of
 experiments on the various parts of the induction coil and appa
 ratus.    Although my experiments are not yet finished,         I thought
 it better to lay the results already obtained before the British
 Association*.
    The following are the results of my experiments : — First, a
 method of getting a shock directly from the armature of a mag
 net at the moment of its demagnetization ; secondly, the dis
 covery of what I believe to be a new fact or law connected with
 the action of iron on a battery by which it is magnetized, viz.
 that if iron be put into a coil of covered wire, the ends of which
 are connected with a battery, the quantity of electricity flowing
 from the same battery through another coil connected with it
 will be considerably greater when the first coil is nearly filled
 with iron than when there is little or no iron in it ; thirdly, a
    * This paper was read in Section A.
                                          (on Mathematics and Physics) at the
 late meeting of the British Association in Dublin.   The paper being hastily
 written, some things we*e omitted which are here supplied.

                Prof. Callan   on the  Induction Apparatus.          325
form of core which has five advantages over the cores in common
use, which will enable us to get intensity and quantity currents,
and may therefore answer for the Atlantic Telegraph and for the
electric light ; fourthly, an improved method of insulating the
secondary coil ; fifthly, a contact-breaker       in which the striking
parts are copper, and which acts as well as if they were platina ;
sixthly, an explanation of the action of the condenser, which
appears to me more satisfactory than any other             I have seen ;
lastly, some new facts regarding the condenser, and an improved
method of making it.
    The first result is a means of obtaining, not from a coil sur
rounding the armature of a magnet, but from the armature itself,
 a voltaic current capable of giving a shock.          This result is ob
tained by making a coil of fine insulated iron wire, and an elec
 tro-magnet of such a form that the coil will fit between its poles.
 The iron coil is then the armature of the magnet.         If the helix of
the electro-magnet be connected with a battery, the iron becomes
 magnetized ; and on account of its proximity to the magnetized
 iron, the coil of iron wire, or the armature of the electro-magnet,
 will be also magnetized, and will lose its magnetism when the
 connexion between the battery and electro- magnet is broken, or
 when the electro-magnet is demagnetized.            If, at the moment
 the iron coil loses its magnetism, the ends of it be held in the
 hands, a shock will be felt.       If  the ends of the iron coil be con
 nected with a delicate galvanometer, the needle will be deflected
 at the moment the coil is magnetized by the electro-magnet.
 Hence at the moment of magnetization or demagnetization, an
 electric current is produced in each section of the iron at right
 angles to its magnetic axis.         From this, two inferences may be
 drawn,  —   first, that if for the copper coils used in magnetic tele
 graphs, coils of iron wire were substituted, electrical currents of
 greater intensity might be obtained ; secondly, that if iron wire
 were used in the secondary coil of induction coils, the intensity
 of the secondary currents would be increased.
    Here   I  shall take occasion to explain the causes which produce
 the secondary current in the induction coil.         I believe that this
 current is the result of the combined action of three inductive
 forces ; one arising from the sudden cessation or destruction of
 the magnetism of the core, the second from the cessation of the
 magnetism of the primary coil, and the third from the destruc
 tion of the magnetism of the secondary coil at the moment the
 connexion between the battery and primary coil is broken. This
 supposes, first, that as long as the primary coil is connected with
 the battery, magnetic power is given, not only to the iron core,
 but also to the primary and secondary coils ; and secondly, that
 in each of them, at the moment of losing its magnetism, an electric

326          Prof. Callan   on the  Induction Apparatus.
current is produced in each of them as well as in all contiguous
conductors.           I
               Both, think, may be satisfactorily proved. First,
every  one knows  that the iron core is magnetized by the primary
current. Secondly, the primary coil itself is a magnet as long
as it is connected with the battery ; for every wire or conductor
through which a voltaic current flows has magnetic properties :
one of its sides will attract the north pole of a magnetic needle,
and the opposite will attract the south pole ; so that if the wire
be placed over the needle at rest, the latter will be deflected from
the magnetic meridian. The wire, or conductor of a galvanic
current has its magnetic poles, not at its extremities, but at its
opposite sides ; so that were the wire divided into two halves
along its length, one half would be a north and the other a south
magnetic pole.     The magnetic axis of such a wire is one of its
diameters, or a line joining its opposite sides.       Thirdly, the
secondary coil is a magnet when the primary coil is connected
with the battery.      This is evident when the secondary coil is
made of iron wire ; for the primary current magnetizes iron by
which it is surrounded as well as iron enclosed within it : it in
duces in each section of the surrounding as well as of the enclosed
iron, an electrical current which magnetizes the iron. I have
found by experiment that iron outside the primary coil is not so
strongly magnetized as iron enclosed within it. When, as is
commonly the case, the secondary coil is made of copper wire, it
is also a magnet ; for the primary current induces an electrical
current in each spiral of the secondary coil of copper, as well as
in each section of the iron core. This current magnetizes each
spiral of the copper coil, and makes the whole coil a magnet at
the moment the primary coil is connected with the battery.
Now we must suppose, that as the primary current, whilst it
continues to flow, maintains in the iron core the magnetic power
produced by the currents induced in each section of the iron at
the moment the primary coil is connected with the battery,
although these currents last but an instant, so also the same
primary current will maintain in each of the spirals of the cepper
coil the magnetism given to them by the currents induced in
them at the moment the battery connexion is made.            There is
no reason why the continuance of the primary current should
not maintain its first effect in the copper spirals as well as in
the iron, since. the first effect is the same in both, viz. the mag
netization of both. Hence, when the primary wire of an induc
tion coil is connected with a battery, the secondary coil is always
a magnet, as well as the core and primary coil ; and therefore in
every induction coil we have three magnets so long as its pri
mary coil is connected with a voltaic battery ; and the three lose
their magnetism the moment the battery communication is

             Prof. Callan  on the   Induction Apparatus.           327
broken.    Now in every magnet, at the moment of the cessation
of its magnetism, an electric current is produced in a direction
at right angles to the magnetic axis, in the magnet itself and in
all contiguous bodies.    First, it has been already shown that at
the moment iron loses its magnetic power, an electric current is
produced in each section of it in a direction perpendicular to its
magnetic axis.    By the laws of induction, these currents induce
parallel ones in every contiguous conductor.        Secondly, when a
current flowing from a battery through a copper wire ceases, the
wire loses its magnetism ; and it is found by experiment, that at
the moment of losing its magnetism, an opposite electrical current
is produced in the whole length of the wire, or in a direction at
right angles to its magnetic axis.       Hence, because in every in
duction coil excited by a battery there are three magnets, viz.
the core, the primary and secondary coils, having a common axis,
and because at the moment the connexion with the battery is
broken the three lose their magnetic power, an electrical current
is produced in each section of each of the magnets in a direction
perpendicular to their common axis ; and these currents in each
magnet induce electrical currents in the other two.         Therefore,
when the connexion with the battery is broken, a current is pro
duced in the secondary coil, which is the result of the combined
action of three inductive forces arising from the suspension of
the magnetism of the core, of the primary and of the secondary
eoil. When the secondary coil is made of iron wire, the mag
netic power it will receive from the primary current, and from
the magnetic inductive force of the core, will be far greater than
if it be made of copper wire j and therefore the intensity of the
secondary current in a coil of iron wire must be much greater
than that of the secondary current in a coil of copper wire.         I
showed, at the late meeting of the British Association in Dublin,
an induction coil in which the secondary wire was of iron : its
length was about 21,000 feet, and its thickness about theT^dth
of an inch. With a single cell, 6 inches by 4, and without a
condenser, this coil gave sparks half an inch long.           Should a
condenser of the proper size increase the length of the sparks, as
it does in Mr. Gassiot's great coil, in a thirtyfold ratio, my coil
ought to give sparks 15 inches long with a single cell.         I have
not yet tried it with a condenser : I made two large condensers,
in which, when both were united, the acting surface of each plate
exceeded 600 square feet.     After being used for some time, the
insulation of the plates gave way, and the action of the con
denser became feeble, and once ceased altogether.         I  intend to
reconstruct both condensers as soon as possible, and to try their
effect on the coil, on which      I   have, since the meeting of the
Association, coiled about 28,000 feet more of fine iron wire, so

328          Prof. Callan        on the Induction      Apparatus.
that at present the length of the secondary coil is nearly 50,000
feet.   Since the increased length of wire was put on the coil,               I
have got from    it,

with the same battery      will give sparks at least an inch long
                            it
without  a  condenser.   This          is,
                                    believe, the most powerful coil
                                       I
ever made.
   The second result    is,
                          that      bundle of iron wire be put into
                                     if  a
a coil of insulated thick copper wire connected with       battery,   a
the quantity of electricity which will flow through another coil
in contact with the same battery, will be considerably greater
when the iron wires are in the first coil than when they are
altogether or partly removed.         This    found
                                              I             by
                                                          using   contact-
                                                                      a
breaker worked by an electro-magnet, the helix of which was
connected with the same battery              by
                                            which an induction coil was
excited.    In trying the effect of the induction coil without an
iron core in its primary coil,     I found that the action of the elec
tro-magnet    of  the  contact-breaker    was slow and feeble. When
a   few wires were put into the primary coil, the action of the
contact-breaker was sensibly increased            and when the primary
                                                  ;
coil was filled or nearly filled with wire, the attraction of the
electro-magnet became considerably stronger, and consequently
the voltaic current flowing round           must have been considerably
                                             it
increased.     Since the core of the induction coil increases the
quantity of electricity flowing from the battery through the helix
of the electro-magnet, we must suppose that the iron of the
magnet reciprocally increases the quantity of electricity trans
mitted through the primary coil, and that therefore little or no
battery power   is   lost   by using an electro-magnet for making and
breaking contact,       instead   of the magnetized core of the coil.
 Hence appears also to follow, that secondary current of greater
       it                                     a
intensity may be got with          battery of given power from
                                   a                                 greata
number of small coils than from one large one, in which the
 conducting power of the primary coil             equal to the sum of the
                                                  is
 conducting powers of the primary wires of all the small coils                ;
 for the magnetic power of the core of each of the small coils will
 be increased   by  the magnetism of the cores of the others.
     The third result  is   a form of core which has five advantages
 over all the cores in common use, and which may enable us to
 get electrical currents having at the same time great intensity
 and considerable quantity, and may therefore be very useful for
 working the Atlantic Telegraph, and for producing the electric
 light.   In my experiments on the core, have used cores of six
                                                  I
 different forms, and varying in weight from one pound to two
hundred and     a   half of iron wire.        I have used, first,  core ofa
 uninsulated   iron   wire  coiled on  an  iron  bar   secondly, the ordi
                                                        ;

nary bundle of iron wires ; thirdly, an elliptical or flat bundle of
wires ; fourthly, a coil of covered iron wire ; fifthly, a core con
sisting of a coil of insulated iron wire and of a bundle of iron
wire ; lastly, a core consisting of two concentric coils of insulated
iron wire, one made of fine, the other of thick wire.
   When the uninsulated iron wire coiled on a bar of iron was
employed as a core, the spark produced by the secondary coil
was less in length and brightness than when the iron bar alone
was used ; because a complete circuit was formed between some
of the spirals and those above them, whilst the other spirals were
insulated from each other by the oxide of iron on the surface of
the wire.
    The elliptical or flat bundle of wire receives from a given
voltaic current flowing through a primary coil made of wire of
given length and thickness, greater magnetic intensity than a
cylindrical bundle does ; because when the length of the circum
ference of the two bundles is the same, a section of the former
is smaller, and contains less iron than a section of the latter.
Therefore, if the two coils be connected with the same battery,
the same quantity of electricity will flow through both ; and the
quantity of iron in the flat or elliptical one being less than in the
cylindrical one, it will be more intensely magnetized.
    I find that all cores consisting of bundles of parallel wires
have five defects.     First, in each section of every wire in such
cores an electrical current is induced by the primary current,
and all those currents may return to the points where they ori
ginated ; or there is a complete circuit for them, which is found
to diminish the intensity of the secondary current.        Some have
imagined    that  by insulating    the  wires of the core  from each
 other, they have prevented all complete circuits.     But these per
 sons seem to have forgotten, or not to have adverted to the fact,
 that when the wires of the coil are insulated from each other,
 the primary current induces an electrical current in each section
 of every wire.
     The second defect consists in this, that the currents induced
 in each section of every wire are opposed by those in the corre
 sponding sections of all the adjoining wires ; and thus the mag
 netic power which the primary current is capable of producing
 in the core is greatly diminished, and is less than it would be if
 all the wires were in close contact with each other ; and conse
 quently the intensity of the secondary current is diminished.
     The third defect  is, that the immense quantity of electricity
 set in motion  by  the primary current in all the sections of each
  wire in the coreis  lost
                         :    it remains within the core, and cannot
  be used for producing any electrical effect.
     The fourth defect       is,that wc cannot ascertain the effect

which     a condenser applied to the            primary coil has on these cur
rents.
   The fifth defect        is,
                        that we cannot apply      Leyden jar or any
                                                                 a
condenser to the currents themselves.
 I    have found that     core consisting of
                                a                coil of insulated or
                                                                a
covered iron wire     free from all these defects.
                           is                         In such core             a
there     no complete circuit for any current in any section of the
          is
iron for the electrical currents produced
      :                                                         by
                                                the primary current
in the sections of an enclosed iron coil move in the directions of
the spirals of the coil; and since no spiral returns to itself, no
current can return to the point where          originated. Neither
                                                           it
does the current in any spiral of the coil oppose those in the
adjoining spirals   for the currents in all the spirals How in the
                       j
same direction, or in the direction of the primary current.
Thirdly, since all the currents in the spirals of the iron coil
flow in the same direction from the beginning to the end of the
coil, they must unite and form one current, having an inten
sity equal to the sum of their intensities. This         have proved      I
by  using coil of very fine insulated iron wire, about 10,000 feet
               a
in length, as the core of     copper coil.
                                     a        "When the connexion
between the ends of the copper coil and      single cell was broken,

the thin iron wire without using        condenser. a    Fourthly, by
connecting the primary coil with         condenser,a      have found      I
that the intensity of the current in the core      increased as      is        it   is
in the current of the secondary coil. Fifthly,        connecting the      by
ends of the core or iron coil with    Leyden jar, the length of the
                                               a
spark     diminished and its brightness increased.
          is                                             The effect of
the condenser on the currents in the core may assist us in under
standing the action of the condenser, which has not yet been
satisfactorily explained.
  A   core consisting of     coil of insulated iron wire, has hot only
                                 a
the advantages of being free from the five defects to which all
the cores in common use are subject, but          will also enable us to
                                                           it
get electrical currents having at the same time great intensity
and considerable quantity, and may therefore be very advanta
geous for working the Atlantic Telegraph, and for producing
the electric light.   If we make core of thirty covered iron wires,
                                          a
each one-eighth of an inch thick and 100 feet long, and wind over
the iron coil covered copper wire one-fourth of an inch thick, we
                   a
can, with the aid of two cells and         suitable condenser, obtain
                                                   a
thirty electrical currents, each having considerable quantity of
                                                       a
electricity, because the wires are short and thick, and an intensity
greater than that which        required for the electric light.
                                    is                             Sixty
covered   iron wires, of the  same   length and thickness    as those in
the core, may be rolled on the copper coil.        Another coil of cop

per wire, one-fourth of an inch thick, may be put over the second
kon one, and over this copper coil we may wind sixty or eighty
covered iron wires, each 100 feet long and one-eighth of an inch
thick. Then the innermost iron coil will be the core of the first
copper one ; the second iron coil will be the secondary coil of the
first copper coil, and the core of the second ; the third iron coil
will be the secondary coil of the second copper coil. If the copper
wires be connected with a battery of six cells, each about 5 inches
square, and a condenser of sufficient size, an enormous magnetic
power will be given to the 150 or 170 wires of the iron coils;
and consequently 1.50 or 170 electric currents of considerable
quantity and intensity will be produced as often as the connexion
between the copper wires and the battery is broken.               If neces
sary,   the  number    of iron  coils, and  therefore the number    of  elec
tric currents, may be increased.           Mr. Shephard has got a bril
liant electric light from eighty electric currents produced in coils
of copper wire on the armatures of permanent magnets.               I  think
that 150 currents produced by the coil             I have described would
far exceed in quantity and intensity the eighty currents obtained
 from Mr. Shephard's machine.
     The electric light may perhaps be produced by several coils,
 like the one    I  showed at the meeting of the Association, and
 which has given sparks the yfth of an inch, with one cell and
 without a condenser.        The secondary coil is divided into four
 parts, each of which will give sparks about a quarter of an inch.
 I  intend to make four or five other coils of equal power, and to
 divide the secondary coil of each into six or eight parts.              The
 ends of the wire of each part will be left projecting from the
 coil. Thus in the five or six coils there will be between thirty
 and forty small secondary coils, each containing about 8000 or
  10,000 feet of fine iron wire.          Each of these secondary coils
 will give sparks at least one-eighth of an inch, with a battery
  of five or six cells and without a condenser. With a good con
  denser we may fairly expect that each will give sparks nearly 2
  inches in length.        Thus with a battery of five or six cells I
  think   I shall have between thirty and forty currents, each capable
  of passing through about 2 inches of air.           If the opposite ends
  of the  thirty  or forty  small   coils be  connected  with the opposite
  coatings of several large Leyden jars, and the sparks be passed
  between two coke-points, a brilliant light may be produced.
  Besides the coil which      I have described, and which was divided
  into four parts,   I  made another which was 40 inches long, was
  divided into nine parts, and in which there were at least 70,000
  feet of fine iron wire. Unfortunately, the secondary coil was seri

  ously injured before was able to make a single trial of its power.
  In dividing the two coils into several parts, I had three objects
                                                                             r

in view.    First, to secure better insulation.The division of the
secondary   coil for  the purpose   of preventing the passage of
sparks  from  one layer of the coil to the layer above or below            it,
was first recommended by Professor Poggendorff.          Although
this mode of preventing sparks within the coil occurred to myself
before
     I    saw his excellent paper on the induction apparatus,              I
was doubtful whether      would be of use, until tried
                           it                           I    in the
                                                                  it
last coil
       I    made.    My second object in dividing the secondary
coil into parts, was to try the combined effect of the currents
produced in each part        connecting the beginnings of all the
                                by
parts with one coke-point, and all the ends with another.       My
third object was to try the effect of Leyden jar connected with
                                              a
each part of the secondary wire, as well on the sparks produced
by the part itself, as on the sparks produced                by
                                                        the whole
secondary coil.
    In order to get currents of considerable quantity, and at the
same time of very great intensity, the core and secondary coil
should be one continuous wire, about one-eighth of an inch thick,
and the end of the core should be connected with the beginning
of the secondary coil.     I  made     flat coil of covered iron wire
                                          a
one-eighth of an inch thick. The length of the coil was about
18 inches, its breadth 14, and its thickness between     and inches.
                                                          4       5
The length of the wire was about 2000 feet. On this iron coil
I  wound 150 feet of copper wire nearly one-fourth of an inch
thick.    By connecting the ends of the copper wire with bat           a
tery  of two   or three 4-inch cells, and     condenser in which the
                                                  a
surface of each plate was 400 square feet, sparks about the twen
tieth of an inch would be made to pass between the terminals of
the iron core.   I have reason to think that had the condenser been
only  one-third   or one-fourth of the size, the sparks would have
been longer.     When  the ends of the iron core were connected with
a  condenser in which the acting surface of each plate was about
fifty square feet, and in which the plates were insulated from
each other      bywaterproof gutta-percha cloth, the current passed
from one plate of the condenser to the other as freely as        they
                                                                   if
were connected       byagood conductor.     When the terminals were
connected with three large Leyden jars, the brightness of the
spark was increased, whilst its length scarcely suffered any dimi
nution.    I  intended, but had not time, to coil over the copper
wire another iron one of great length, and the same thickness as
the one in the core, and to unite both together.          Had    been
                                                                  I
able to do so, the combined currents of the core and secondary
coil would form one of enormous intensity and considerable
quantity. Two coils of this kind, each having bar of iron in
                                                         a
the inner iron coil, and having the ends of the iron bars con
nected     byiron armatures, in the same way as in Mr. White

              Prof. Callan  on the  Induction Apparatus.          333
house's   coils, would, I think, answer better than his for the
Atlantic Telegraph.
    It appears to me that Mr. "Whitehouse's coils admit of three
important improvements.         First, they may be greatly improved
in the core by substituting for his secondary coil of copper wire
a coil of covered iron wire of the same length and thickness.
The iron wire would be intensely magnetized by the primary
current, and by the inductive magnetic power of the enclosed
iron bar ; and in losing its magnetism at the moment the battery
connexion is broken, a current will be induced in it of far greater
intensity than that of the secondary current in Mr. Whitehouse's
coil.   Mr. Whitehouse's object in connecting the ends of one
core with the ends of another by iron armatures, is to prevent
the rapid suspension of the magnetic power of the cores at the
moment the connexion between the battery and primary coil is
broken. By causing the cores to lose their magnetism gradu
ally, a series of currents corresponding to the successive diminu
tions of magnetic power is induced in the secondary coil : this
series of currents has the effect of a continuous current, which is
found to be of use in working the telegraph.         The same object
may be attained by using a core consisting of an iron bar and a
coil of insulated iron wire. The iron bars may be connected by
iron armatures extending over the ends of the iron coils, but
separated from them by a piece of gutta-percha about the one-
fortieth of an inch in thickness. Mr. Whitehouse's object might
perhaps be attained still better by connecting the cores of every
two coils, by six or seven, or a greater number of armatures.
This may be done by brazing or otherwise fastening to the iron
bar in each coil, plates of iron about a quarter or three-eighths
 of an inch thick, and sufficiently large to project an inch or two
beyond the iron coil of the core.        A small piece should be cut
out of each plate, that the primary wire may pass from one side
of the plate to the other.     The corresponding plates fastened to
 the two iron bars may be connected by a plate of iron.     Thus the
 two iron bars will have as many armatures as iron plates, and the
 magnetic power of the core will be retained longer than if there
be only two armatures, and consequently the series of induced
 currents will continue for a longer time.      Secondly, a great im
provement may be made in the primary coil.          Mr. Whitehouse's
primary    coil  consists of twenty-four copper wires, No. 14, or
 about the Tyth of an inch thick, and 100 feet long. Now if the
primary coil were made of copper wire of the same length, and
nearly half an inch thick, it would conduct as much electricity
as the twenty-four wires used by Mr. Whitehouse, and would
produce greater magnetic power in the core, because the elec
tricity flowing in the thick wire would be nearer to the core than

the electricity flowing through the twenty-four thin wires.                    A
third improvement may          be  made     by winding      over  the  primary
coil an insulated iron or copper wire of the same length and
thickness as the wire in the core, or of greater length, and uni
ting the end of the coil in the core with the beginning of the
coil outside the primary coil.            Such a coil would produce with
a given battery a current of far greater intensity than that which
would be produced by one of Mr. Whitehouse's coils, or a cur
rent of equal intensity with a much smaller battery.                 It appears
to me, then, that the use of coils such as                  I  have described
would be greatly to the advantage of the Atlantic Company, or
any company having a very long telegraphic line.
                                         I
    The fifth form of core which used consisted partly of a coil
of insulated iron wire, and partly of a bundle of iron wire.                  In
one core of this form the iron wire of the coil was about the
yA^dth of an inch, in another it was one-eighth of an inch thick.
From the part of the core which consisted of iron wire y^dth of
an inch thick,    I  got sparks a quarter of an inch with a single cell
and without a condenser.           The length of wire in this coil was
 about 15,000 feet.
    The sixth form of core which          I used consisted of two concen
tric coils of insulated iron wire : one of very fine, the other of
thick wire.      The coil of thick wire should be enclosed within the
coil of fine wire, and should be nearly 2 or 3 inches in diameter,
especially when the primary coil is made of thick wire.                       In
making     coils  of  thick  iron   wire,   great  care  is   necessary,  for  in
such wire there are cracks or flaws.             At  these cracks there are
sometimes sharp points, which cut the covering of a spiral in an
adjoining layer, and thus make a complete circuit, which is most
injurious to the intensity of all the currents induced in the
various parts of the coil.        It is necessary to know that the com
plete circuit which diminishes the intensity of the secondary
current in the greatest degree, is that which is made by connect
ing the ends of a coil of thick wire.               I have not had time to
 determine which of the forms           of   core I  have used induces the
 most intense current in the secondary coil, or which of them
makes the condenser act with the greatest effect.                  I once used
for the core a bundle of wires, 9 inches in diameter and 26
inches long.      The weight of the core exceeded two hundred and
 a half pounds.      This core acted so badly, as to convince me that
anyone who wishes to obtain currents of very great intensity,
or very long sparks, should never employ cores of very large
 diameter.
    The fourth result is an improved method of insulation for the
secondary coil.       In this mode the insulation is imperfect where
imperfect    insulation    is sufficient, and perfect where such insu

             Prof. Callan    on the     Induction Apparatus.             335
lation is required,     and consequently     each spiral is brought
 nearer to the core, to the primary coil, and to the other spirals
 of the secondary coil, than in the ordinary manner of in
 sulation, in which the parts of each layer for which very little
insulation is required are as well insulated from the layer above
 and below it as the parts which require the best insulation.
 My mode of insulation differs from the ordinary one in two
respects : — First, in the insulation of each spiral from the adjoin
 ing ones in the same layer ; secondly, in the insulation of the
 spirals of every layer from the contiguous spirals of the layer above
it.   I  do not cover the fine wire with thread of any kind ; but          I
coat it 'with a very thin film 'of varnish by drawing it through
melted rosin and bees-wax.          I
                                    draw it through the hot varnish
by winding it on the coil at the distance of about 25 feet from
the stove by which the varnish is heated ;            I
                                                   have found that at
this distance the varnish is cool and hard, even when the wire is
drawn through it at the rate of 8000 feet in the hour. Thus in
this mode of insulating the fine wire, a coil may be made in a
comparatively short time.       The insulation is sufficient, because
the difference between the intensity of any spiral and the ad
joining ones of the same layer is indefinitely small. On every
inch of each layer     I   can put eighty or eighty-two spirals of
wire T^jjdth of an inch thick.       My mode of insulating the spi
rals of each layer from those of the layer above or below                 it,
differs also from the way in which they are insulated           by others.
In the common mode of insulation,                as in Mr. Gassiof
                                                if,                       s
great coil, five thicknesses of gutta-percha, or of any other in
sulating substance, be thought necessary in order to insulate
the extreme spirals of any layer from those of the layer below
it, five thicknesses of the insulating substance are put between
the whole length of every two adjoining layers           so that
                                                          ;          there
                                                                    if
be twenty layers along with the first, there will be 100 thick
nesses of the insulating substance.      But, in my mode of insula
tion, there would, in such          case, be only sixty.
                                    a                          In order
to render my mode of insulation intelligible,         shall explain how
                                                      I
the first layer of spirals    is insulated from the second, and the
second from the third.        Every other layer, such as the third,
fifth, seventh, &c. represented        an odd number, will be insu
                                        by
lated from the one above      it,
                                in the same way as the first         insu
                                                                    is
lated from the second and every layer,
                        ;                    such  as  the fourth, sixth,
eighth, &c. represented by an even number, will be insulated
from the one above     it,in the same way as the second        isfrom the
third.    In insulating the first layer from the second, when five
thicknesses of the insulating substance to be used are deemed
necessary for the insulation of the last spirals of the second layer
from the first spirals of the first (there the difference of intensity

336            Prof. Callan   on the    Induction Apparatus.
is greatest), I divide the length of the layer into five equal parts.
I  then put one thickness of the insulating substance (let us sup
pose it to be what    I use, viz. the paper employed for copper-plate
engravings saturated with a solution of gutta-percha in oil) on
the entire length of the first layer, and then roll the fine wire on
one fifth of the layer.   I   next cover the whole length of the coil
with another thickness of prepared paper, and coil the fine wire
on the second fifth of the layer.         Ithen put on a third thick
ness of paper, and wind the wire on the third fifth of the coil.
I  then put on another thickness of paper, and coil the wire on
the fourth fifth, and so on.       Then between the first fifth of the
second layer and the spirals below it in the first, there is one
thickness of paper ; and one will insulate them as well as five
will insulate the whole length of the two layers from each other.
Between the second fifth of the second layer and the part of the
first layer below     there are two thicknesses of paper, and they
                    it,
will sufficiently insulate these two parts from each other. In
the same way the third        is insulated by three thicknesses, the
fourth  by  four, and the last     by five thicknesses of paper  thus
                                                                 :
the five parts of the coil are as well insulated from each other as
if  there were five thicknesses between the entire length of the
two layers.     To insulate the second layer from the third, as well
as the first   isinsulated from the second, only one thickness of
paper  is  necessary ;   for  by putting    single thickness of paper
                                              a
on the second layer, the first fifth       covered
                                          is                by
                                                       one, the second
 by two, the third by three, the fourth          four, and the last by
                                                   by
five thicknesses of paper.        Hence to insulate any two layers,
only  six thicknesses    of  the insulating substance are necessary,
or three for the insulation of each layer and therefore to insu
                                                   ;
late twenty layers, only sixty thicknesses of the insulating sub
stance to be used are required.        Thus in my mode of insulation,
every spiral   in  the  secondary   coil    brought nearer to all the
                                              is
contiguous spirals and to the primary coil and core, than in
the ordinary method of insulation; and consequently the in
ductive power of the core and of the primary coil on the
secondary one, as well as the inductive power of the spirals of the
secondary coil on each other, must produce          secondary current
                                                        a
of far greater intensity in mine than in the cpmmon mode of
insulation. The coil which was shown at the meeting of the
British Association was insulated in the manner just explained.
This coil and the contact-breaker, which will be presently de
scribed, were seen at work by Mr. Gassiot, Dr. Robinson,
M. Foucault, Professor Rogers, and other members of the Asso
ciation.   Mr. Gassiot was so much pleased with their action and
construction, that he ordered from Mr. Yeates, an optician in
Dublin, a   contact-breaker and two secondary coils like mine. In

               Prof. Callan  on the Induction Apparatus.            337
  each of these secondary coils there will be nearly 60,000 feet of
  iron wire about the T^dth of an inch thick.
     The fifth result is a contact-breaker in which the striking
  parts are copper, and which act as well as if they were platina.
 The contact breaker consists, first, of a small electro-magnet ;
 secondly, of its armature screwed to a board moveable on a hinge,
 and having attached to it a spring connected with the vibrating
 piece of copper ; thirdly, of a spring for pressing the striking
 pieces together ; and of a trough containing oil, in which
 these pieces are always immersed.          By means of the spring
 attached to the board to which the armature is fastened, the ar
 mature is brought within the most convenient distance from the
 small electro-magnet.      The spring presses the striking pieces
 together with the greatest force the electro-magnet is capable of
 overcoming, and the pressure is exerted immediately over the
 points of contact. The oil prevents in some measure the oxidation
 of the copper, and serves to stop the battery current more quickly ;
 for as soon as the pieces of copper are separated, the oil rushes
 in between them, and being a non-conductor, instantly stops the
 galvanic current from the battery.       In the first contact-breaker
 which   I made of this kind, there were two vibrating pieces, one
 of platina, the other of copper; the former struck against
 another piece of platina, the latter against a piece of copper :
 the copper was immersed in oil.           By means of two screws,
 both might be made to make and break contact together, or
 I could cause either to make and break contact. By first
 causing the platina, and afterwards the copper, to make and
 break contact, I found that the copper acted as well as the
platina. In the contact-breaker which        I showed at the meeting
in Dublin, there were three vibrating pieces of copper, each about
 three-eighths of an inch thick.      M. Foucault thinks that the
contact will be made and broken as well by one as by several
vibrating pieces. Though that should be the case, the addition
of two other pieces will not be useless ; for the three may be
immersed in different fluids, and thus we can discover the fluid
in which contact may be made and broken with the greatest
advantage.
     The sixth result is a more satisfactory explanation of the con
denser.     In order to understand the action of the condenser, we
must examine the electrical state of the primary coil at the mo
ment its connexion with the battery is broken, and the effect
which this state has on the core and secondary current. At the
moment the connexion between the battery and primary coil is
broken, the electricity which it received from the battery con
tinues to flow to the end of the coil to which it was moving ; but
being no longer urged forward by the battery, its velocity
     Phil. Mag. S. 4. Vol. 14. No. 94. Nov. 1857.                Z

              Prof. Callan   on the    Induction Apparatus.
is constantly diminished by the resistance of the wire.                 This
electricity moving more slowly than when the coil and battery
were connected, and in the same direction as the battery current,
 is not able to maintain in the core, or in the primary or second
ary coil, the magnetic power produced in them by the battery ;
but it maintains a part of       it,  and prevents the core, the primary
 and secondary coil,       from   losing their magnetism in an instant,
 and consequently diminishes the intensity of the secondary cur
 rent. The condenser prevents the gradual diminution of the
 velocity of the electricity flowing in the primary coil at the mo
 ment its connexion with the battery            is  broken, and probably
 accelerates  it
               ;     for in an instant after the battery connexion           is
 broken, the end of the coil towards which the electricity               mo
                                                                        is
 ving,  and   the  plate  of  the   condenser  connected   with   it,become
 positive.     This positive plate instantly renders the other plate
 negative :   the latter then attracts electricity to the former with
 an enormous force, on account of their very close proximity            ;and
if  the plates of the condenser be of sufficient size, the electricity
 moving in the primary coil will be drawn with such force to the
 positive plate, that its velocity, instead of being diminished, will
 probably be increased. Thus the condenser removes the obstacle
 arising from the electrical state of the primary coil, to the
 sudden suspension of the magnetism of the core, and of the pri
 mary and secondary coil, and probably increases their magnetic
 power by accelerating the current in the primary coil after its
 connexion with the battery       is   broken. The condenser not only
 removes an obstacle to the instantaneous suspension of the mag
 netism of the core and of the primary and secondary coil, but               it
 also supplies     a force tending to destroy that magnetism           for as
 soon as   all  the electricity moving in the primary coil          is ;
                                                                      drawn
 to the positive plate of the condenser,        itinstantly rushes back to
 the negative one through the primary coil, and         is  drawn to itself
 by  that plate with an immense force and in its passage through
                                            ;
 the primary coil, tends to reverse the magnetic poles of the core
 of the primary and secondary coil, and consequently to destroy
 their magnetism.         Hence the effect of the condenser       isto make
 the core, the primary and secondary coil, lose their magnetism
 instantaneously, and thus to increase the intensity of the second
 ary current, or the length of the sparks produced        is bythat current.
 This explanation of the action of the condenser              confirmed by
 the effect which  I    have found     itto produce on the electrical cur
 rents induced         bythe primary current in each section of the
 core, viz. an increase     of   their intensity.    Now the only causes
 that can produce an increase of intensity in these currents are,
 an increase of the magnetism of the core, and of the rapidity with
 which  it  loses its magnetic power, or either of these two causes.

              Prof. Gallan   on the Induction  Apparatus.          339
I   have shown that the effect of the condenser is at least to
increase the rapidity with which the core loses its magnetism, and
probably to increase its magnetic power. Hence my explanation
of the action of the condenser is confirmed by the effect of the
condenser on the currents produced in each section of the core.
    The principle of this explanation of the action of the condenser
suggested to me a new form of condenser, which              I expected
would Tact more powerfully than the condenser now in use. The
new condenser was to consist, not of sheets of tinfoil, but of a
large number of very thin sheets of iron, arranged in such a way
that one-half of them would form one plate, and the other half
the other plate of the condenser ; and that the electrical current
by which each plate would be charged, one positively, the other
negatively, should not enter simultaneously each of the iron sheets
forming the positive plate, nor leave simultaneously all the iron
 sheets in the negative one, but should flow through the whole
length of each sheet, before entering into the next.        In order to
 make a condenser of this kind,       I got 112 sheets of iron, each
 28 inches long, 10 broad, and about ^th of an inch thick.            I
intended to arrange them so that the current by which they
 would be charged, at the moment the connexion between the pri
 mary coil and battery would be broken, should flow successively
 through the whole length of the 112 iron sheets, or through one
plate equal in length to the sum of their lengths, which exceeds
250 feet.     Had  I had time to make, as    I intended, our iron con
 denser in this way, the iron plates would be strongly magnet
 ized by the electrical current flowing through their entire length;
 and in losing their magnetism, would produce a powerful second
 ary current, tending to destroy or to reverse the magnetism of
 the core, and thus increase the intensity of the secondary cur
 rent. In the ordinary condenser there is one electrical current
 tending to destroy the magnetism of the core : in an iron con
 denser made as I have described, there are two currents tending
 to produce the same effect; viz. the current arising from the
 rush of electricity from the positive to the negative plate of the
 condenser, and the current caused by the demagnetization of the
 iron plates.   In order to save time and trouble, I made our iron
 condenser in the ordinary way.          When    I have leisure  I may
 make it in the manner     I  have just described.
    The seventh result consists in the discovery of some new facts
 regarding the condenser, which have not been hitherto noticed
 in any publication.      First,   I  have found that the action of
 the condenser is feeble when the core is a solid bar of iron;
  secondly, when it is a coil of fine insulated iron wire not having
 a bundle of iron wire, or a coil of thick covered iron wire in the
 hollow part of it ; thirdly, when the quantity of iron in the
                                   Z2

 840                Mr.   J. Bridge on the Gyroscope.
 core is very great compared with the thickness of the primary
 wire.    Secondly,    I have found that the size of the condenser
 must be increased with the conducting power of the primary
 wire. Thus a thick primary wire requires a larger condenser
 than a thin one ; a primary wire of copper requires a far larger
 condenser than one of iron of the same length and thickness ;
 and a very short primary wire of any metal requires a condenser
 very much larger than that which is necessary for one of
 the same metal 100 feet long.        I  have found that when the pri
 mary wire is not more than 30 feet, a condenser of moderate
 size will not produce the slightest effect on it.      Thirdly, I have
found that when a condenser is very much larger than that
which is required to produce the full effect of a condenser on a
given coil, it not only does not increase the power of the coil,
but it makes it less than it would be without a condenser, and
sometimes destroys it ; and that in general there is a limit
to the size of the condenser, beyond which its effect on the coil
will be diminished. Fourthly,        I  have found that a condenser so
large as to diminish the power of a coil excited by one cell, will
increase its power when the coil is excited by ten or twelve cells.
 Hence the same condenser will not answer for the same coil
when batteries of very unequal powers are used.             Then, every
condenser should be made in such a way that the entire of it
will produce the full effect of a condenser on the coil for which
it is intended when the largest battery we wish to use is em
ployed, and that a small or a large part of the condenser may
be used when we wish to excite the coil by a weak or strong bat
tery.    I learned from Mr. Gassiot and M. Foucault during the
late meeting of the Association, that they were aware of the ne
cessity of making the condenser in this way.

ring is moveable   about a fixed vertical diameter c d at right angles
         '
to 66'.
   The facts to be explained are the following : —
   1. When the solid is in rapid rotation about a         let   weight                   a',         a
be hung to the first supporting ring at a.      Then, instead of an
accelerated motion about bo1, we have uniform motion about cc1.
                                                             a
The motion of a      in   direction right angle in advance of that
                           is        a                a
in which the weight alone would have caused            to move.   The           it
rate of this precessional motion about the axis           does not de                cd

force applied     increased, or when the rate of rotation of the
                   is

   2. When the outer ring, or the axis             fixed,            b',
                                                                will only

parallel to the earth's  axis.
    The following investigation contains an approximate solution
of these problems.

Hence the motion of the extremity of the principal axis may be
considered as compounded of a precessional motion with velocity
           about a vertical axis, and a nutational motion in a small

                                                                  r          ,,

represents all which it was required to account for.                     Also, since
            C                         aA
(1   + c) = -p its value is           =— J       and   aA is proportional to the mo
ment of the force applied,                 so that the expression     becomes     t^—,
which is independent of the moment of inertia about an axis at
right angles to the axis of figure.
   That the rate of precessional motion does not depend upon
the moment of inertia about a prfncipal axis at right angles to
the axis of figure, may be illustrated by means of a simple appa
ratus such as the following :— Two equal circular boards are
made to slide on a steel rod passing perpendicularly through
their centres.    They are placed at equal distances from the
middle of the rod, where there is a groove running in a socket
in which it may be made to rotate, and by which it is freely
suspended.    When this is weighted, it will be found that the
rate of precessional motion is independent of the distance of the
boards from the groove.       This may be best judged of by the
constancy of the ratio which the square of the number of seconds,
or ticks of a watch, in which the precessional motion increases by
a given quantity, bears to the number of turns.
   In the preceding investigation, the change in the value of to,
arising from the weight being applied to the principal axis
instead of the instantaneous axis, is neglected.  This will easily
be seen not to affect the approximate results.
                             The Second Problem.
   Let the axis a a' be now free to move only in the plane A a d ;
this plane will then be pressed upon at the points a, a' in a direc
tion perpendicular to the plane, and an equal and opposite pres
sure will be exerted on the axis at the points a d ; let the angular
acceleration due to these pressures be                       /3,
                                              and that due to the
external force applied in the direction of the plane, a.

force, or its power of overcoming resistance.          In order to come
as near as possible to the cause of different degrees of intensity in
different galvanic arrangements, let us analyse and compare any
two   ;for instance, the usual voltaic pair of two metals and one
fluid, zinc and copper in dilute sulphuric acid, and Grove's pair                             a
consisting of two metals and two fluids, viz. zinc acted on                                                    by
sulphuric acid, nitric acid being decomposed in contact with
platina. The electromotive force of the latter           much stronger                 is
than that of the former yet the only difference in the chemical
                                     is, ;
actions taking place         that at the platina end of the Grove's
nitric acid   is
               decomposed,   whilst  water    decomposed in the other.
                                                                    is
Now except for      this difference,  all things in the two arrange
ments being the same,         we measure the amount of electricity
                                       if
passing from one end to another of each circuit               means of                        by               a
galvanometer,    we  shall find that  the  quantity  as  well as the in
tensity  of the Grove's pair     greater than that of the other

many degrees with the current of the former as with that of the
latter. But, as might be expected,            we weigh the zinc bothif

of time in each, we shall find that in the Grove's three or four
times as much zinc has been dissolved as in the other.             What,
then, is the fact ? — that in the Grove's pair the electricity passes
with three or four times the rapidity it does in the pair with one
fluid j and the only difference between the pairs being, that in
 the latter water is decomposed, and in the former nitric acid, it
 follows that an equivalent of nitric acid is decomposed three or
four times more quickly than one of water under like circumstances.
     To proceed more exactly.       I  put a porous vessel into a gutta
 percha trough, and filled the latter with sulphuric acid, sp. gr.
 l'l.                             I
          In the sulphuric acid placed an amalgamated zinc plate,
 and in the porous cell a platina plate surrounded by several solu
 tions in succession, such as nitric acid, solution of sulphate of
 copper, solution of nitrate of silver, &c.       These solutions in the
 porous    cell   suffered  decomposition   when   the zinc and platina
 plates were joined externally, the base being thrown down on
 the platina plate.        There was therefore no polarization ; and     I
 introduced a sufficient resistance externally to render the resist
 ances of the solutions which were decomposed comparatively
 nothing.       I  had therefore several combinations similar in every
 way, except in the fluid that surrounded the negative or platina
 plate ; and the only difference in the chemical actions of the
 pairs was in the decompositions which occurred.            If, therefore,
 on transmitting the current produced by joining the metals
 through a galvanometer, there was any difference in the amount
 of electricity, this difference must have been occasioned by the
  decomposition alone.
     Sulphuric acid surrounding the porous cell, and amalgamated
  zinc in the acid,     I put the platina plate in the porous cell and
 filled it with nitric acid, thus forming a Grove's pair. When the
  metals were joined, a certain resistance and galvanometer being
  included in the circuit, the needle of the galvanometer stood at
  lOf degrees of the scale.
      I now removed the nitric acid and substituted solution of sul
  phate of copper, thus forming a Daniell's pair : with the same
  resistance and arrangement as in the former experiment, the
  needle stood at 5^ degrees.
      With solution of nitrate of silver in place of the sulphate of
  copper, the needle stood at 9.
      With solution of iodic acid, the needle stood at 10 ; with aci
   dulated water, at 3£.
      Now each of these numbers represents the quantity of elec
  tricity passing in a given time, or its rapidity ; and as the pairs
   only differ from each other in the decomposition cell, it follows
   that an equivalent of each compound is decomposed in a different
 period of time. The numbers likewise represent the electromo

 348                    Dr. Woods   on the Time required
 tive force of the pairs ; this force is therefore synonymous with
 rapidity of current.        They also represent the difference between
 the heat generated at the positive end of the battery by the for
 mation of sulphate of zinc, and that absorbed at the negative end
 by the decomposition.          The latter statement may be proved by
 subtracting the amount of heat absorbed by decomposition in
 each particular case from that generated at the positive end.
 Regnault has proved it in a paper, published,             I think, in the
                                       '                         '
 August number of the French Annals of Chemistry for 1855 ;
 a paper    I   unfortunately did not see until      I had made many ex
 periments myself for the same purpose.
    In all these pairs the same quantity of electricity is developed
 by the consumption of an equivalent of zinc, but the time it
 requires to make the circuit depends on the time the compound
at the negative end takes to be decomposed ; and this amount of
time depends, again, on the quantity of heat which such decom
position absorbs.         Now this proposition leads us to the interest
ing   fact,  that   all compounds require the same time to absorb the
same quantity of heat in decomposing into their elements.              For
instance, the decomposition of water absorbs 80* units of heat,
that of nitric acid 16*, that of sulphate of copper 62*, of nitrate of
silver 30*, &c. ; and the time they require to do so is exactly
proportional to these amounts.
    I  may here observe, parenthetically, that from the above we
can understand the difference of facility with which compounds
can be decomposed.           All compounds absorbing much heat in
decomposing, such as the alkalies, &c, require a comparatively
long time to separate into their elements ; whilst bodies which
absorb very little heat, decompose at once and from the most
trifling causes; for instance, all explosive compounds, such as
the fulminates, hypochlorous acid, &c. : these, not requiring time
to absorb heat when decomposing, allow the affinities which form
the elements into new compounds to satisfy themselves most
easily and rapidly.
    But the time required by compound bodies to absorb heat in
their decomposition is only equal under similar circumstances ;
for instance, when zinc is the positive pole of a galvanic couple,
an equivalent of all compounds at the negative decomposes with
a rapidity proportional to the quantity of heat they absorb.
Thus nitric acid, which absorbs only about one-third of the heat
that water does, decomposes three times as quickly, and hence
an equivalent of zinc is dissolved in one-third of the time in a
Grove's pair that it is in a Daniell's pair ; and an equivalent of
electricity passes with proportionate quickness. But if potassium
be made the positive metal in one of the pairs, the rapidity of

current increases in proportion to the increased affinity of that
metal for oxygen. For it seems a curious fact, that some elements,
when combining, evolve heat more or less quickly than others ;
but in separating, the heat necessary for decomposition is ab
sorbed equally ; and the greater the quantity of heat an element
generates in combining, the more rapidly it evolves it.      Hence,
as was mentioned before, the rapidity of the   electric current de
pends on the difference of amount of heat evolved at one end and
absorbed at the other of the circuit.   If a very rapid current is
required,  a metal which produces  the greatest amount of heat is
made the positive pole, and a liquid which absorbs the least
quantity of heat is placed round the negative one ; both ends
thus entering into the development of the current.
   Faraday says that the current always sets out from the metal
most acted on ; but this does not always hold good.      It is quite
possible to have a metal easily acted on by an electrolyte which
is a good conductor, and also to have a good negative pole, and
yet no current of electricity, because the decomposition may not
be such as to allow the current to pass.       For instance, copper
placed in nitric acid in a porous cell, and platina in sulphuric
acid around    it,
                 gives no current of electricity, although the cop
per  is quickly acted on, because the decomposition of the water
at the negative end requires more time to be accomplished than
the combination at the positive end.             If
                                                 the position of the
metals be reversed,     strong
                        a      current  passes.        If
                                                     nitric and sul
phuric acid be separated by porous diaphragm, and

copper be placed in each, the copper in the sulphuric acid acts as
the positive metal, although sulphmic acid attacks the metal much
less strongly than the nitric acid. Whenever, therefore, we cal
culate the galvanic effect of    pair, one end of the circuit
                                    a                               of   is

   One of the objects of this paper      to direct the attention of
                                           is
scientific men to the importance of the study of the heat of che
mical combinations.     If the heat produced          by

of all the elements were known, we should have key to almosta
all the phenomena connected with the principles of chemistry.
The reactions of bodies depend on, or are inseparably connected
with, the amount of heat their combinations produce        in every

could    be predicted if the heat of combination of the elements
were known ; for, cateris paribus, the bodies which produce most
heat in chemically uniting always combine to the exclusion of

 by  the experiments of Mr. Joule and myself, that the heat of
combination    is    in  proportion to the affinity of the combining
bodies.     If, therefore,    I say, experiments were instituted to find
the amount of heat evolved             the combination of the elements,
                                       by

    The method which          Ihave described for finding the heat ab
sorbed when    a   fluid     decomposed, viz.

and consequently of its rapidity, and therefore of the heat ab

acts the part of     a   thermometer of chemical action, the needle
varying with the amount of heat absorbed                     by
                                                       the decomposition,
just as the mercury does in the common thermometer for changes
of temperature.      I    endeavoured last year to find the amount of
heat produced            by
                          the chemical combination of oxygen with
several elements    ;  an abstract of the experiments         published in
                                                                        is
the Proceedings of the Royal Society for January 1856.                  The
results of the experiments show, that when oxygen combines with
 several bodies, the quantity of heat produced              not in each in
                                                                   is
 stance the same, but         given out in multiple proportion.
                              is                                      If the
heat of combination be known, we can also precalculate with
 precision the quantity and intensity of any proposed galvanic
arrangement.        We have only to find the difference of the
 amount of heat generated at the positive end                     by
                                                          the combination,
 and that absorbed at the negative end                    by
                                                       decomposition.             I
would just mention, that in this way        prejudged that solution
                                                     I
of iodic acid used instead of nitric acid, would give the same
quantity and intensity as the latter, when substituted for      in           it   a
Grove's pair; and      found
                         I             by
                                 experiment   that the idea was cor
rect.   The decomposition of    iodic  acid  does  not absorb more
heat than that of nitric acid, and therefore allows the current to
pass with equal rapidity     consequently the electromotive force
                                   ;
is the same.    However, as iodine     thrown down, this accumu
                                                is
lates on the platina, and the conducting power of the plate                       is
interfered with.   Still, as  proof of the value of knowledge of
                                   a                                   a

to my knowledge before been taken notice of; and                      I
                                                           think it may
not be unimportant, if only proving the definite nature of an
other principle connected with the constitution of matter.           We
know    that all the  "forces," such  as electricity, heat, &c,  are  de
finitely, and after an invariable manner produced by the changes
 of matter.         I
                  have here endeavoured to show that the time in
 which these changes are brought about is also definite, and inva
 riably and similarly related under similar circumstances. In "Me
 chanics," without taking into account the time in which work is
 done, no estimate can be formed of the moving power.              If we
 are able to add to the result of chemical action the time in which
 it is performed, do we not advance a step in our investigations,
 and assimilate chemical to mechanical work more closely ?
   I   would only further ask, — If the equivalents of all the
 elements produce the same quantity of electricity, as Faraday has
 shown, and very different amounts of heat, can heat and electri
 city be modifications of the same agency? For instance, an
 equivalent of zinc by its oxidizement always evolves an invariable
 amount of heat and an invariable amount of electricity; an
 equivalent of copper acts similarly; but whilst the amount of
 electricity is the same as that from zinc, the quantity of heat is
 only half as much. All other elements, by combining with oxygen,
 likewise develope various amounts of heat, but the same quan
 tity of electricity.     Can therefore these two imponderables be
 either modifications of the same force, or be related as cause
and effect     ?
   The propositions, then,             I
                              have endeavoured to prove in this
paper are, —
   That electromotive force is the same as rapidity of current; —
that with the same positive pole the rapidity is determined by
the amount of heat absorbed at the negative end by decomposi
tion, as the more heat is absorbed the longer it requires for
 absorption.
   And that every compound requires                    a definite and specific    pe
 riod of time for decomposition.

   direct value or comparability.
      But it appears to me, that even if we did possess a convenient
   true actinometer to give the intensity of the sun's rays at any
   given place and moment, that                is,

  power,   there  is still  asecond    instrument      required in meteorology
  to measure the accumulated effect of the sun's rays during any
  given space of time.       In short, the sun's heat should be gauged
  at every meteorological observatory as                 arrives, day after day

      This instrument, which         I   propose to call          sun-gauge,
                                                                   a                  is
  merely   an  adaptation   of  the   invention     familiarly   known  as Wol-

                                 the sun's rays be allowed to fall upon
  the surface of water contained in one of the bulbs of this instru
  ment, the other bulb being sheltered from the sun but freely
  exposed to the air, the amount of water evaporated from the
  former and condensed in the latter bulb will afford                simple and
                                                                        a
 perfect measure of the total amount of heat absorbed                           by
                                                                              the
  surface of water.        For when pure water                contained in any

 exhausted vessel, the tension of the vapour therein can never
 remain above that due to the temperature of the coldest part of
 the vessel, otherwise rapid evaporation and condensation are
 produced until equilibrium           is attained.      When       moist surface
                                                                   a

 part will be carried over in         alatent state into the sheltered part
 by   the evaporation of        a definite amount of water.           The mere
 addition of   a    graduated measuring           tube   to   Wollaston's  cryo
 phorus will thus convert        it into   a heat-gauge.
     The only instrument which        I    have been able to make (without
 the aid to be obtained in London or other towns)                    of simple
                                                                       is   a
 and rough form.         It consists of an oblong glass-bulb, about                   3
inches in length and            1£inch in diameter, into the mouth of
which  a    half-inch glass tube           fused, in such
                                          is                      manner that

part of the tube reaches within the bulb almost to its opposite
end, being bent, however, towards one side.                   The exterior part
of the tube, 14 inches (or more) long,                straight, and graduated
                                                     is
into millimetres, which read from the further end.

                            a                                                  tois

be   introduced in sufficient quantity to fill about two-thirds of the
bulb, and the instrument being then perfectly exhausted of air
by boiling, is completed by hermetically
sealing the extremity of the graduated glass
tube.
    To use the sun-gauge, the whole of the
liquid must first be poured into the bulb,
which can readily be done on account of the
bent position of the interior part of the tube.
It is then inverted and placed in some sup
port where the sun's rays may fall upon the
bulb uninterruptedly throughout the day,
while the tube beneath is completely shel
tered from the sun, but freely exposed to
the air.     This may easily be done as shown
in the figure, where the graduated tube
hangs down into a box open only towards
 the side on which the sun never shines.
     It is evident, that as long as the sun
 shines, or the heat of his rays is at all per
 ceptible, water will evaporate from the bulb
 and condense colourless and pure in the
 graduated tube, by the divisions of which
 its amount may be quickly and easily read
 off. Except so far as an imperfection of the instrument, to be pre
 sently mentioned, may interfere, the results thus given by the
 same instrument will both be exactly proportional to the amounts
 of heat absorbed, and will also enable us to determine and ex
 press the absolute amount       in  a constant and convenient     manner.
 But in constructing      a number of instruments, the proportion of
 the sun's rays absorbed and gauged by the exposed bulb may not
 always be the same ; so that it will be necessary to compare them
 against some standard instrument, and thus determine for each
 a correction factor which will reduce all results to complete
 uniformity.
     Amounts of radiated solar heat may be conveniently expressed
 by the depth (in inches or millimetres) of evaporation from a
 surface of water exposed with perfect freedom to his rays, under
 the condition that all aqueous vapour of a greater tension than
 •199 inch of mercury (the tension of the temperature of 32°)
 shall be immediately conveyed away.          Or the relation of this unit

 incidence, and supposing it wholly absorbed, would suffice to melt one-
  millionth part of a metre in thickness from the surface of a sheet of ice
 horizontally exposed to its action per minute of mean solar time." — Admi

rises above that of vapour at the temperature of the air.     As,
however, the latent heat of vapour diminishes as the sensible

                                          a
commencement of the exposure will indicate less amount of heat
rays than the same distillation towards the end of the day.                               A
definite and invariable horizontal surface of water        all that                  is
should be exposed to the sun's rays, and by an instrument of
more complicated and perfect form this might perhaps be accom
plished. If not, the inaccuracy might be experimentally deter
mined for each instrument, and       tabular correction applied for
                                                   a
each division of the graduated tube.
   Likewise, in order to obtain very accurate and constant results,
great care will be necessary with this instrument, as with the
black-bulb radiating thermometer, that        may not be affected

     N.B. The place of observation is shaded till near 8 a.m. by
elevated ground, hence the absence of indications before that
hour. The days were neither quite cloudless.
    The results of the sun-gauge given at each hour are the quan
tities, in millimetres, of water distilled since the last hour of
observation.
    The sun-gauge was refilled, with a better vacuum, between
these two series of observations.
     It must be borne in mind that the present paper is only in
tended to communicate the idea of an instrument which it would
require the help of the most skilful optical instrument-maker to
carry to perfection, or even to render of utility.
     If  the delicacy of the instrument be very much increased by
enlarging the surfaces of absorption and evaporation and of con
densation to a very great extent, compared with the divisions of
the measuring tube,           I see no reason why the instrument should
not act as a simple and accurate actinometer.
    The amount of distillation during one minute, for instance,
accurately determined, will give the rate or intensity of the sun's
rays, which may be supposed uniform during that period ; just
as the rate of expansion of a large bulb full of liquid in the acti
nometer of Sir        J.  Herschel is determined by watching and mea
suring its expansion in a capillary tube during five seconds of
exposure to the sun's rays.
     The total heating effect of the sun's rays falling on the earth's
surface at the different latitudes and localities of the globe, varies
immensely from several causes, the principal of which are, —
     1st. The duration of the day, and the elevation of the sun.

 therefore very desirable to possess an instrument which will enable
 us to estimate and record, however roughly, the actual amount
 and variation of this chief element in the science of Meteorology.
     It may be observed that the sun-gauge will equally well mea

 direction, if a small quantity of liquid be left in the graduated
 tube.     Or a special instrument of inverted form and action
 might be contrived, and continually exposed to the sky in the

the sun.

 searches    of Pouillet (PoggendorfFs Annalen, vol. xlv. for 1838) on
 the amount of the solar radiant heat falling on our globe.          Pouillet
 gave a more perfect arrangement to Herschel's Heliometer ; and by
 observing the amount and rate of increased temperature which a
 quantity of water contained in a metallic vessel exposed to the direct
 sunlight underwent, and observing also the rate of diminution of
 temperature when the sun's rays were cut off, he determined the co
 efficient of absorption for heat of the atmosphere, and hence calcu
lated the thickness of a crust of ice which on the surface of the earth
 would be melted by the sun's rays in a day, and that which would
on the sun's surface be liquefied by the solar heat. —Ed.]
        XLII.    On the Influence   of Metals upon Radiant Heat.
By H. Knoblauch, Professor of Natural Philosophy in Halle*.
                                      I.
                         to radiant heat, the metals have been hitherto
WITH             respect
           regarded   as adiathermanous bodies, and they have there
fore been employed as screens when it was necessary to cut off
the calorific rays.      With the thickness in which sheet-metal is
found in commerce, this indeed might safely be done; but it
decided nothing as to the real capability of metals to transmit
radiant heat.       This could only be ascertained by operating upon
thin layers.
    To test this question, M. Knoblauch first made use of a gold-
            * Abstracted from                Annalen, vol. ci. 1857.
                               Poggendorff's

                            upon Radiant Heat.                           357
   leaf rolled out as thin as possible and stretched over a frame.
   As no terrestrial source of heat would be sufficiently intense, the
   leaf was placed in the track of the sun's rays, which were sent
  into a darkened room by a Silbermann's heliostat; a sensible
  action on a thermo-electric pile was the consequence.            In order
  to augment the action, a glass lens was placed in the window-
  shutter.     By this means a deflection of the astatic needle of a
  multiplying galvanometer connected with the thermo-electric
  pile was obtained, which amounted to 6 degrees.
      A second experiment was made with a thin layer of mosaic
  gold, which was spread upon a smooth glass plate.            The greater
  thickness   of this layer reduced the deflection to 3 degrees.
      Three gold precipitates, prepared chemically by Prof. Bottger
 of Frankfort, were peculiarly fitted for these experiments*. By
 transmitted light they showed a beautiful green colour, which
  deepened as the thickness of the layer augmented, while the leaf
 made use of in the experiment just recorded transmitted light of
 rather a bluish tint. The thicknesses of the layers were in the
 proportion 1:2:3. When the rays of heat, concentrated in the
 manner described, passed through these precipitates, which lay
 upon watch-glasses, the consequent deflections were, —for the
 thinnest, 33°-64 ; for the middle one, 4°*41 j and for the thick
 est, l°-42.
     The same experiments were made with silver.             Rolled leaves
 of this metal proved, however, too thick ; and those only which
 were chemically prepared showed themselves capable of trans
 mitting the radiant heat. The precipitates were transparent for
 blue light, the intensity of which indicated the thickness through
 which it had passed. Of four precipitates, the thickness of the
 strongest was about double that of the weakest.           The deflections
 produced by the heat passing through these four layers, com
 mencing with the thinnest, were 10°, 8°, 5°, and 1° respectively.
     A similar result was obtained with platinum, which was also
made use of as a thin coating upon the surface of a watch-glass.
This permitted of the passage of the sun's rays to such a degree,
that with a thin layer a deflection of 340-7 was obtained, and
with a thicker one a deflection of 80-5.
     Other metals than the above were either not thin enough, or
not uniform enough to permit of similar experiments.                   The
glass on which the precipitates rested could of course only have
the effect of rendering the action more feeble.
     But it might be asked whether the calorific rays pass really
through the metal as they do through glass, crystals, or other
diathermanous      bodies; or whether they are not permitted to
    [* Faraday's method of preparing gold films might be turned to valuable
account in such experiments as the above. See Phil. Trans. February 1857.]

358           Prof. Knoblauch           on the Influence     of Metals
pass through fine apertures in the leaves.                      Or the idea may
suggest   itself,  that    the   thermo-electric       pile  was   simply affected
by   the heat radiated by the exposed body itself, after it had been
heated by the sun.            At the end of this section a special proof
shall be given that the action observed is not due to either of the
causes referred to.
   There is therefore no doubt that metals, such, for example, as
gold, silver, platinum, when in thin layers, are to be regarded as
diathermanous bodies, which transmit calorific rays ; the quantity
transmitted naturally diminishing as the thickness of the metallic
layer increases.
   It was of interest to ascertain whether the heat which had
passed through the metallic leaves was of the same quality as
the heat before its passage.                To determine this, the heat was
first examined before it had passed through the metal.                            The
rays reflected from the heliostat were allowed to fall directly
upon the thermo-electric pile, and the consequent deflection was
observed.      A diathermanous plate, for example a plate of yellow
glass, was then interposed in the path of the rays, and the po
sition of the needle was read off afresh.                     Supposing the first
deflection to be expressed by 100, the latter, according to the
observation, would be 59; a result which proved that for a
direct quantity of heat equal to 100, a portion of it equal to 59
could pass through the yellow glass.                  In this way the heat was
examined with different glasses : the following Table expresses
the ratio of the incident to the transmitted heat in the respect
ive cases : —
             Yellow glass.      Blue glass.     Red gloss.     Green glass.
               100:59            100:41          100:46          100:20
    The solar rays were next sent through                   a  gold-leaf stretched
over a frame, and afterwards allowed to fall upon the above
glasses in succession : the object, it will be remembered, was to
ascertain the ratio of the heat incident upon each glass to that
 which passed through it: the result is given in the following
Table:—
             Yellow glass.      Blue glass.     Red glass.      Green glass.
               100:20            100:32          100:14          100 : 24
    If these results be compared with the foregoing, remarkable
differences appear.           Before passing through the gold-leaf, the
 heat was capable          of  passing through the yellow glass in the
ratio of 59 : 100 ; while, after crossing the metal, it was only
able to penetrate the glass in the ratio of 20 : 100.                        A similar

                                 upon Radiant Heat.                              359
  diminution of the ratio is observed in the case of the blue and
  red glasses, whereas in the case of the green glass the reverse is
  observed to be the case : the ratio here is augmented from one-
  fifth to nearly one-fourth. The experiments therefore show that
  the radiant heat, after having passed through the gold-leaf, is
  different in quality from what it was before.
      The leaf of mosaic gold already referred to, when stretched
  upon a frame and tested in the same manner, gave a result very
  nearly coincident with the above. A precipitate of gold upon
  the surface of a watch-glass was also examined, and similar
  results were obtained with it.            These experiments prove beyond
  doubt, that calorific rays which have passed through a layer of
  gold, possess the property of passing through diathermanous
  bodies in a totally different degree from those which have not
  passed through the metal.
      The influence of the thickness of the metallic layer was also
  investigated.       Four layers were made use of, which were suc
  cessively placed in the path of the rays, and behind each of them
  the test with the coloured glasses was repeated.                   In the follow
  ing Table the results are recorded ; the second column of which
  shows the deflection produced when the rays, after having passed
  through the layer of gold, and without passing through the glass,
  were allowed to fall upon the pile.              The last four columns show
  the ratios of the quantities of heat which passed through the
  gold alone, to those which passed through both gold and glass,
  in the respective cases : —

                         passing through   glass.    glass.   glass.      glass.
                              gold.
       Thinnest layer...       33-64      100:46    100:30   100 : 32    100:21
       Thicker layer ...       31-28      100:38    100:30   100:25      100:24
       Still thicker ...        4-41      100 : 26  100:32   100:18      100:24
       Thickest layer...         1-42     100:22    100:34   100:14      100:54
      It is here shown, that, as regards the yellow and red glasses,
  the transmissibility of the heat diminished as the thickness of
  the metallic layer increased.               But the thicker the layer, the
  greater is the power of the heat transmitted to penetrate the
  green and blue glasses.             For example : of the heat which passed
, through the thinnest layer, we find that 46 parts out of 100 can
  pass through the yellow ; 21 out of 100 through the green glass.
  Of the heat, however, which has passed through the thickest
  layer, a quantity represented by 24 passes through the yellow
  glass, while 54 passes through the green.                 Hence the longer the
  path which the calorific ray describes through the diathermanous

360          Prof. Knoblauch                 on the Influence      of Metals
gold, the more decided are the changes produced in them by the
metal.
   That the results hitherto recorded were not produced by any
modification of the heat in its passage through the glasses in
which the gold precipitates spread, M. Knoblauch shows both
by reasoning and experiment.     We will give the results of the
latter.  The heat was first permitted to pass through the yellow,
red, and blue glasses, direct to the pile, and the action was
observed.   An uncoated portion of the watch-glass which held
the gold, or a second uncoated watch-glass, was then introduced
in the path of the rays, before they reached the coloured glass.
The ratios of the heat incident upon the latter to that trans
mitted in the respective cases are recorded in the following
Table.—
                             Yellow glass.       Blue glass.       Red glass.          Green   glass.
 Watch-glass absent ..         100 : 59           100 : 41             100:46           100:20
 Watch-glass present.          100:59             100:39               100:46           100:22
   This experiment    shows clearly that the introduction of the
watch-glass had no    sensible influence upon the transmissibility
of the heat through   the coloured glasses.  It however, proved         is,
 by the experiments   of Delaroche and Melloni, that after passing
through  a  transparent body, the heat acquires    power of pass          a
ing more freely through       second body of the same kind even
                                     a                                                     :
this action   isabsent in the experiments of M. Knoblauch, and
for the simple reason, that, before reaching the watch-glass, the
heat had already passed through, and been sifted by,     glass lens               a
of much greater thickness.
   Experiments similar to those made with the gold were made
with silver.  The ratios of the heat incident upon the coloured
glass to that transmitted, were first determined before the silver
layer was introduced, and are stated in the following Table —                                  :
             Yellow glass.        Blue glass.        Red glass.         Green glass.
               100:63              100:38             100:49              100:19
   It was necessary to repeat this experiment in each case, as the
same ratios could only be obtained when precisely the same ex
perimental conditions were adhered to.                            It
                                                  was, however, prac
tically impossible to secure this in experiments conducted on the*
fine days of several successive summers.
    Six different layers of silver, prepared chemically     Professor              by
Bottger,    were  at M.  Knoblauch's    disposal.   They were  placed
in succession in the path of the solar rays. The following Table

    According to this, 42 parts of every 100 which had passed
through the thinnest layer of silver were transmitted by the yel
low glass ; but only 33 of every 100 which had passed through
the thickest layer.              Before passing through the silver, the heat
was far more capable of passing through the yellow glass than
afterwards, for in the former case 63 parts out of every 100 were
transmitted.
    Out of every 100 parts which had passed through the thin
 nest layer of silver, 34 were transmitted by the blue glass;
 but out of every 100 which had passed through the thickest layer,
43 were transmitted.                   Before passing through the silver, 38
 parts out of every 100 were transmitted by the blue glass.
    The experiments therefore show that the quantity of heat
 which passed through the yellow and red glasses diminished as
 the thickness of the layer of silver increased, while under the
 same circumstances, the quantity which passed through the blue
 and green glasses was augmented.                          All the experiments show
 that the properties of the heat —for example, its power of passing
 through the coloured glasses, — is changed by its passage through
the silver, the difference increasing as the thickness of the layer
of silver is increased.              The experiments also show that the heat
 transmitted by the gold is different from that transmitted by the
 silver.
    When the heat was sent through a layer of platinum and ex
amined by the coloured glass, it yielded the results recorded in
the second horizontal line of figures of the following Table.                             For
the sake of comparison, the numbers obtained before the pla
tinum was introduced are given in the first line : —
                Yellow glass.       Blue glass.       Red glass.    Green glass.

                   100:61             100:44           100:46         100:22

3G2            Prof. Knoblauch        on the Influence    of Metals
    In this   case    the numbers iu the two series are hardly to be
distinguished from each other.               Similar results were obtained
with a layer of platinum so thick as to permit less than one-
fourth of the above quantity of heat to pass through it.                  Hence
it follows, that in the case of platinum, the incident and trans
mitted rays do not sensibly differ in their power of passing through
coloured glasses.
    Certain metals, therefore, such as gold and silver, do not in
tercept all kinds of calorific rays in the same proportion : like
coloured bodies in the case of light, they exert an elective absorp
tion on the rays; while others, such as platinum, like colourless
transparent bodies in the case of light, intercept or transmit all
kinds of calorific rays with the same facility.
    If it be desired to regard the deportment of bodies like pla
tinum through an optical analogy, it would be necessary to call
them gray ; for to merit the name of white, they must be capable
of transmitting a greater quantity of heat.                   Such substances
would, according to this, show the same deportment to both
luminous and calorific rays.             M. Knoblauch remarks here, that
he does not know a single diathermanous body which behaves in
the same manner towards heat as a colourless transparent body
towards light.          Even in the case of rock-salt, which Melloni
regarded    as  such   a body, despite its incomparable diathermaneity,
M. Knoblauch has always been able to perceive (when the plate
was thick enough) an elective absorption.
    In order to show that the heat transmitted by metals does
not pass by means of the little holes and fissures in the metallic
leaves, M. Knoblauch submits the following experiments.
    In place of the thin layer of silver, a thicker one, in which
fissures and holes were visible, was made use of ; and the heat
which had passed through such fissures and through the coloured
glasses to the thermo-electric pile, was compared with that which
fell upon the instrument when the silver layer was removed.
Such rays showed no difference in quality whatever, as the fol
lowing numbers prove : the first line gives the ratios of the inci
dent to the transmitted heat when the metallic layer was absent                  ;
the second the same ratios when the silver was present : —
                               Yellow glass. Blue glass. Red glass. Green glass.
                                 100 : 56     100 : 39    100:42      100:21
   Fissured silver interposed.   100 : 57     100:39      100:43      100:22
    This experiment proves that if the heat transmitted in the ex
periments recorded in the preceding pages had been due to its
passage through the fissures and holes of the metal, the quali-

                             upon Radiant Heat.                                363
tative differences which subsequently showed themselves would
not have appeared.
     It is also known, that if to the heat passing through the aper
tures in the silver, that of the silver itself had been added, the
resulting heat would be different in quality from that falling
upon the silver.        But the heat in the above experiments showed
no such difference of quality, and hence no sensible portion of it
can have been derived from the silver.
     But supposing the thin metallic layer to be wanned and con
verted into a source of heat; the heat thus radiating from a
less intense source must have passed through the coloured glasses
in less quantity than the solar rays alone.               Now the experiments
 show the reverse of this to be the case ; for while of the direct rays
 only 20 in 100 pass through the yellow glass, of the rays which
 have passed through the layer of gold 54 out of 100 are trans
 mitted.
      M. Knoblauch next examined the heat which was reflected
 from the anterior surface of the layer of gold ; an experiment
 was also suggested by the fact of his possessing a piece of
 glass (G) which had served to illustrate Goethe's theory of
 colours.       This glass transmitted yellow light, and reflected a
 bluish light.       It was therefore antithetical to the gold, which
 transmitted a bluish light, but reflected yellow.
      The solar rays were permitted to pass through the glass lens
 and to enter the dark room, where they were reflected from the
 dull surface of gold, and afterwards permitted to fall upon the
 thermo-electric pile. We will call the quantity of heat thus mea
 sured by the deflection of the galvanometer 100.                  A yellow glass
  was now placed in the path of the rays, and a quantity of heat
  expressed by the number 70 passed through the glass. When,
  however, the heat passed through the gold, only 14 parts out of
  100 were capable of passing through the yellow glass.                         The
  other glasses were used in the same manner, with the following
 results    : —
                                   Yellow glass. Blue glass.   Red glass. Green glass.
                                     100:70       100:45     I  100:56     100:19
    Heat transmitted through gold.   100:19       100 : 31      100:14     100:26
      The experiments illustrate the extraordinary difference exist
  ing between the heat reflected by gold and the heat transmitted
              •
  by it.
       In the next place, the rays were suffered to fall upon the glass
  already mentioned.           Calling the quantity reflected from the
   glass (G) and falling on the pile, 100 ; when the yellow glass was

364           Prof. Knoblauch            on the Influence              of Metals
interposed, 59 parts out of the 100 passed through it. When
the heat, instead of being reflected by the glass (G), was sent
through    it,
            80 parts out of 100 passed through the interposed
yellow glass.    The other glasses were afterwards tried    the                         :
results are stated in the following Table —                   :
                                                Yellow         Blue         Red       Green

    Here also the deportment of the reflected heat towards the
coloured glasses   very different from that of the transmitted heat.
                        is
   The antithesis existing between the gold and the blue-yellow
glass will also be remarked.      While, in the case of gold, the
reflected rays are more capable of passing through the yellow,
blue, and red glass, and less capable of passing through the green
glass than the transmitted rays in the case of Goethe's glass
                                                ;
the reflected heat was less capable of passing through the yellow,
blue, and red glass, and more capable of passing through the
green than the transmitted heat.
                                              II.
    Twelve years ago M. Knoblauch had treated the question,
whether,     by
              its reflexion from rough metallic surfaces, radiant
heatwas so changed as to be distinguishable from unreflected heat.
Melloni entertained the opinion that metallic surfaces behaved
towards radiant heat as white bodies towards light.     M. Knob
lauch believed that he had confirmed this view     but since then       ;
MM. Provostaye and Desains have made experiments with
metals, from which the authors conclude that different kinds of
heat are unequally reflected from metallic surfaces.    As to the
properties of heat diffusely reflected from different metals, no
thing further     known but now that in the case of three metals
                   is          ;
differences in the heat transmitted                      by
                                         them have been detected,
the examination whether changes occurred in the reflected heat
could be undertaken with greater hope of success.
   The beam reflected from the heliostat was first permitted to
fall direct upon the thermo-electric pile, and the consequent
effect was denoted       100.by The yellow, blue, red, and green
glasses  were then interposed successively in the path of the rays                             :
the relative quantities of heat which passed through the glasses
are given in the following Table —             :
            Yellow glass.       Blue glass.         Red glass.         Green glass.
                 100:66           100:36            100:51               100:18

                                upon Radiant Heat.
   The question now             is,
                          whether the calorific rays which have
been diffusely reflected from metallic surfaces possess the same
power of penetrating the coloured glasses as those which have
not been thus reflected.
  A   rough surface of gold was first made use of. Express
ing the action of the heat reflected from this surface, and falling
direct upon the pile            by
                         100, the proportional quantities which
passed through the coloured glasses are given in the following
Table :—
            Yellow glass.       Blue glass.         Bed glass.        Green glass.
              100:73              100:37              100:55               100:17
   It here unmistakeable that
      is                            more copious passage takes
                                               a
place through the yellow glass than in the case where the heat
was unreflected.    The ratio in the latter case   only 66 100,            is              :
while  in the case now  before us    73   100.it Through the red
                                                   is     :
glass also the transmission has been more copious, the ratio in
creasing from 51 100 to 55 100.
                      :                  :
   When the gold plate was exchanged for rough plate of silver,  a
or for dull surface of platinum, the following ratios were ob
      a
tained —
      :
                    Yellow glass.       Blue glass.           Red glass.        Green glass.
   Silver              100:72             100:38               100:55               100:17
                       100:66             100:38               100:51               100:   18
   Here we observe that the heat reflected from silver shows
the same deportment as that reflected from gold.            The rays
in both cases are more capable of passing through the yellow and
red glasses than the unreflected rays.     The heat reflected from
the platinum surface, on the contrary,       not to be distinguished
                                                          is
in its action from the direct rays.    The small difference which
shows itself in the case of the blue glass, lies within the limits of
the errors of observation.
   Hence the same metals (that                     is,
                                     gold and silver) that alter
the properties of the calorific rays which pass through them,
exert also an influence upon the rays diffusely reflected from
their surfaces, while platinum, in both cases leaves the rays un
changed.
   Other metals were next examined; the results                                 are given in
the following Table —       :

    According to this, the heat reflected from copper and brass is
also more copiously transmitted by the yellow glass ; but the
augmentation is not so great as in the case of gold.                     In the case
of the red glass, the quantities transmitted from gold and copper
are nearly equal ; but with brass no sensible difference is observed
between the reflected and unreflected heat.                     Here also, as in the
former instance, the blue and green glasses show no difference
between the reflected and unreflected rays.
    A similar series of experiments was made with silver, mercury,
and German silver.              Each had a rough surface ; the mercury
was rubbed upon copper, and had a milky appearance.                                 The
following Table contains the results of the experiments : —

    The rays reflected from mercury exhibit, according to this,
quite the same deportment as those reflected from silver ; while
those reflected from German silver are not to be distinguished
from those coming directly from the sun.
    The heat reflected from lead, tin, and alloys of both metals
gave the following values : —
                            Yellow glass.      Blue glass.    Red glass.   Green glass.

    The reflexion from these bodies has, according to this Table,
no influence on the transmissibility of the heat through the
coloured glasses.
    Experiments with rough surfaces of zinc, iron, and black sheet-
iron, also showed that no sensible difference existed between the
heat reflected from them and the direct heat.
    The results of all the observations on reflected heat are

 separately in the foregoing Tables, and to reduce them after
 wards to a common standard.

     The results recorded in this Table are regarded by M. Knob
 lauch as placing beyond doubt the following proposition: —
 that certain metals, as gold, silver, mercury, copper, brass, alter the
 calorific rays (as coloured bodies alter those of light) ; while
 other metals, as platinum, iron, tin, zinc, lead, an alloy of lead andt
 tin (similar to colourless transparent bodies as regards light),
 do not change       the calorific rays by reflexion.
     M. Knoblauch        also shows, in a very convincing manner,       that
 the results obtained could not be due to the heat emitted by the
 metals themselves after they had been warmed by the sun's rays.
     We have seen that reflexion from certain metals can alter the
 quality of the heat; but the heat made use of in the experi
 ments had been actually reflected from the mirror of the helio-
 stat.     It was necessary therefore to examine whether the variety
 of the sun's rays was not altered by this first reflexion.             The
 heliostat made use of was that of Silbermann, and its mirror
 was of highly polished speculum metal.
     M. Knoblauch first examined the influence of a steel mirror
 upon the calorific rays, and found it absolutely nothing ; which,
 indeed, was to be inferred from the deportment of the rough
 iron surface already recorded.             He then set a heliostat of
 August, which possessed a steel mirror, in the place of that of
 Silbermann, and compared the heat reflected from the mirror
 of the latter with that reflected from platinum. He knew from
 the observations already recorded, that platinum produced no
 change whatever in the calorific rays reflected from it.            For the
 sake of making the conditions of the two experiments as much
 alike as possible, the heat reflected from platinum was preferred
 to the direct heat. The following Table gives the ratios of the
 heat incident upon, to that transmitted by the coloured glasses
 in the case of both metals : —

   From this it is plain that the heat is in no way changed by-
its reflexion from the mirror of Silbermanu's heliostaB. :
   In all the observations hitherto recorded, the-sotrrce of heat
was the sun's rays.    M. Knoblauch repeated the same experi

   ¦This Table shows in what different degrees the heat of, thsstoi
and that of a, Locatelli lamp are transmitted through; the necf-
loured glasses ; and it also shows that when the lamp is used,
the differences of transmission by the same glass, when heat re
flected from different metals is made use of, almost vanish. I In
fact, of all the results obtained with the -sun's rays, the onlyoaie
that continues to assert itself here, is the more copious 'trans
mission of the heat diffusely reflected from gold through the
yellow glass.                            adJ to Jbaai uih Bavig oidf/T
   When, instead of the Locatelli lamp, a metal cylinder heated
to 110° C. was made use of as the source of heat, the peculi
arity observed in the case of gold also disappeared, and the heat
reflected from     like that reflected from the other metals, was
                             it,
not to be distinguished from the unreflected rays.
   M. Knoblauch next examined the influence of the state of the
surface on the heat reflected from it.          rouglr surface- of gold           A
was compared with       polished  surface
                                   a       of the same metal, and ,thc

the same manner                    by
                       the coloured glasses.      When, however, dif

    Three surfaces of silver were next made use of. One was
a dull plate of a whitish colour obtained by electrolysis ; another
was obtained by the so-called cold silvering process, and had
more of a gray aspect ; the third was a highly polished daguerre
otype plate, which appeared almost black.                        The experiments
with these three plates gave            the   following    results   :—

     In   this   case the heat reflected from the dull white surface
 passed     most   copiously through the yellow glass ; that from the
 gray    surface    less copiously; while that reflected from the po
 lished plate was transmitted least copiously.                      The latter heat
 was not to be distinguished from the unreflected calorific rays.
  Similar effects are observed in the case of the red glass.
     A similar result was obtained with mercury rubbed upon a
  plate of copper until a dull whitish layer was obtained, when the
 teat reflected from this surface was compared with that reflected
  from the ordinary shining surface of the metal.                       The following

      In   experiments made with dull and polished surfaces of cop
  per,   and   with rough and polished surfaces of brass, there was
  no difference observed.            " It must be confessed," remarks M.

870           Prof. Knoblauch        on the Influence  of Metals
of gold, the perfection of the polish was not to be compared with
that of the silver surface, for in optical respects the former did
not cease to show its red, and the latter its yellow colour ; while
the polished silver and the metallic mercury, colourless in them
selves, gave only the colours of the mirrored objects.               With the
former, therefore,       the  heat  reflected  under  a  definite    angle    was
not purified from the diffuse heat ; in the case of          the   latter   alone
was the pure and simple reflexion present."
    The dependence of the diffuse reflexion on the inclination of
the incident calorific rays to the reflecting surface remains now
to be examined ; and here, in the first place, we have to ascertain
the quantity of heat which reaches the thermo-electric pile under
different angles.        The metal plate to be tested was placed in the
path   of the  rays sent in from the mirror of the heliostat, and an
arrangement was made which permitted the plate to be turned
round a vertical axis, so as to permit the rays to fall upon it at
any required angle.          The surface of the thermo-electric pile was
placed at right angles to a line which made the same angle with
the reflecting surface as the rays which fell upon it from the helio
stat.    This arrangement permitted of an examination of all rays
which fell upon the surface between the limits of 80 and of 2
degrees.
    A uniform dull plate of gold was first examined, and a gradual
augmentation of heat was observed as the rays fell more and
more parallel to the surface.          Thus, for example, when the incli
nation of the surface to the rays was 2°, the quantity of heat
sent to the pile was five times the quantity sent when the inch-
nation was 80°.          With another rough surface of gold an aug
mentation in the ratio of 1 to 3*5 was observed, under the
same circumstances ; with polished gold the augmentation was
only in the ratio of 1 to l-36. The gradual increase is exhi
bited in the following Table, which also renders manifest the
difference between the rough and polished surfaces.

   Fine grooves were afterwards drawn on the metallic plates,
and the effect of these plates when the grooves v, ere transverse,
and when they were parallel to the plane of reflexion, was ex

   According to this, with one plate, the heat reflected from the
plate at an inclination of 2°, was treble the quantity reflected at
an inclination of 80°, when the grooves were transverse to the
plane of reflexion ; and quadruple of the same quantity when
the grooves were parallel to the plane of reflexion.   In the case
of the other plate, at an angle of 2°, the heat was augmented 4*4
times when the grooves were perpendicular to the plane of re
flexion, and augmented eight times when they were parallel to it.
The dependence of the quantity of heat reflected from a finely-
grooved metallic plate on the inclination of the markings to the
plane of reflexion is here very manifest.
    Silver was next submitted to the same examination :' experi
ments with a uniform dull plate and one highly polished, led to
the following results : the quantity reflected at an inclination of
80°   is,as before, expressed    unity —          by        :
     Inclination.                80°.          60°.      40°.   20°.           10°.       2°.

    In this case the increase of the calorific action with the decrease
of the inclination of the rays to the reflecting plate        very con           is
siderable, in the case of the rough surface, but barely indicated
in the case of the polished one.
    With grooved plates, the augmentation, as in the case of gold,
was greater when the grooves were parallel to the plane of reT
flexion than when perpendicular to it.        In the experiments three
silver plates were used      two of which
                                        ;    were   covered with    gal                 a
vanic deposit, and the third silvered by the process of rubbing.

        In all these         cases the qualitative                  peculiarity which distinguishes

  374         On the Influence  of Metals upon Radiant Heat.
  heat diffusely reflected, from the unreflected heat, disappears
  when the incidence is very oblique.         It is thus placed beyond
  doubt, that the properties of the reflected rays are dependent on the
  inclination at which they meet the reflecting surface.
     The principal results of this investigation may be stated to be
  as follows : —
      1. Metals, as gold, silver and platinum, when in thin layers,
  are to be regarded as diathermanous bodies, which permit a por
  tion of the calorific rays to pass through them j which portion
  naturally becomes less as the thickness of the layer increases.
     In thus transmitting the calorific rays, certain metals, as gold
  and silver, exercise an elective absorption, similar to that of co
  loured transparent bodies upon light.       Others, on the contrary,
  like platinum, act in the same manner upon all rays, and are
  therefore to be regarded as analogous to colourless bodies     in the
  case  of light.
     2. In the case of diffuse reflexion, also, certain metals, such
  as   gold, silver, mercury, copper and brass, similar to coloured
  and opaque bodies as regards light, exercise an elective absorp
  tion upon the calorific rays, in consequence of which the pro
  perties of the latter are altered.      Others, on the contrary, for
  example, platinum, iron, tin, zinc, lead, alloy of lead and tin,
  German silver, reflect all kinds of calorific rays in the same pro
  portion, exactly as colourless opaque bodies do with regard to
  light.
     The properties which distinguish calorific rays reflected from
  metals, from unreflected heat, are so far dependent on the source
  of heat, that differences, for example, which exhibit themselves in a
  striking manner when solar heat is made use of, are diminished
  in the case of a Locatelli lamp, and completely disappear when
  the source of heat is a metallic cylinder not heated to redness.
     The surface has the power either of causing the differences to
  appear in their maximum degree, or to disappear totally, accord
  ing as the surface produces a diffuse or a regular reflexion.
     The same is true of the change of the angle of incidence.
  In the case of a rough metallic surface, as the angle of the rays
: with the surface diminishes, the reflexion
                                                 passes gradually from
'
  the diffuse   to the regular, and at the same time the differences
  between the reflected and unreflected heat also gradually become
I
  less, until finally both have exactly the same character.

  moir,    the   expression   k=far-\- —,   is given, instead  of tn- —  —, for the  large
  roots of the transcendental equation y=0. It is remarkable, however, that
  this error of sign, if it be such, does not appear to have had any influence

 although (as has been said) he showed how all the other constants

 been thought necessary or desirable to do so.    In other words, he
 seems to have been content with assigning the values (15)', and
.the formula (15)", as sufficient for the purpose which he had in
 view.   In my own paper, already cited, gave the general term        I

     XLIV.    On    the   Electrical Light.        By H. W. Dove*.
            Fraunhofer first showed that the spectrum of the.
SINCE
   electric    spark was distinguished from that of the light of the
sun by a very bright line in the green, and a somewhat less lumi
nous one in the orange, its prismatic analysis has been com-,
pleted, especially by the investigations of Wheatstone,Masson and
Angstrom f. Wheatstone has shown that the lines are different'
according to the nature of the metals between which the spark
passes; and that when it is produced between two different
metals, the spectrum exhibits combined the lines which are per
ceived when it is produced consecutively between similar balls of
each of the metals.      According to Angstrom, this also applies
to similar balls formed of an alloy of the two metals.      Masson
has ascertained, that, leaving out of consideration the dissimi
larity of the spectrum in the employment of different metals,
determinate lines appear as common to it ; and from this it has
appeared the most natural opinion, that the light of the spark is
mixed, consisting of a direct production of light in the medium,
in which the spark is produced, and glowing particles carried
forward from the balls between which the spark is transmitted.
Fresh proofs in favour of this view have been obtained, especially
by Angstrom, by the prismatic analysis of the sparks evolved in
different gases.
   A composite phsenomenon may be indirectly investigated by
changing the constituents which enter into       or   it,   by
                                                       attempting
to produce these in an isolated condition.      Draper has shown
that the spectrum of glowing platinum wire contains no lines,
                          a
so that
        it
        is     white in the strict sense whilst with regard to the

true electrical light without pheenomena of incandescence, we are
only able to judge of its colour              by
                                      the naked eye.   The lumi
nous phenomena, known under the names of electrical brush,
glow, and interruption of the spark, are so constant and so
feebly luminous as to render an exact prismatic analysis ex
tremely difficult, and in many cases even almost impossible. The
judgement of the colour of      homogeneous luminosity
                                    a                        how      is,
ever, very delusive.   The ordinary gas-flame which     yellow   is         by
day, and even the orange light of an oil-lamp, appear white in
the dark. For this reason we may presuppose that the eye will
only furnish an uncertain judgement as to the colour of the
weaker electrical luminous phaenomena.      Many of these are so
faint, that for their exact perception they require the exclusion,
of every other source of fight and Prevost, as

nosity of    a uranium glass occurs with equal vividness with the
brushes and sparks.        I have found no essential difference between
the luminosity of a Ruhmkorff's apparatus and that of an elec
trical machine, both as regards the sparks and brush in the air,
and the luminosity in the electrical egg.                  .. - •,   >...:¦¦!:
    The spark of an electrical machine often appears interrupted
at one spot by a weaker violet or reddish light.              This interrupted
spot generally     lies  nearest  to the  negative  end  ;   and   by removing
to an appropriate distance a non-insulated conductor placed near
the principal conductor, a stream of sparks may easily be obtained
which appears white at the primary conductor, and coloured at
                                                                             is is,
the conductor standing near it.              This less luminous part
however, very distinctly visible through             red glass, so that
                                                       a                it
 distinct from the light of the brush.
    The preceding experiments, in connexion with the results of
the prismatic investigation of the spark, appear to me to lead to
the following conclusion.
  A    wire becoming red-hot          by
                                       heat     first red, then orange, and
                                                  is
lastly white, so that       it behaves like the combination of light
which   is obtained when        ascreen      drawn away from the spec
                                             is
                      by
trum concealed        it   in such way that the red end first becomes
visible, and to this the violet       is a
                                         finally added.       The increase of
brilliancy from the slightly luminous brush to the bright spark
 behaves quite otherwise.          In this case        it   is
                                                             as  if the screen
 removed first set free the violet end, and then the other colours.
 This distinction of itself renders          improbable that the phseno-
                                             it
 mena of electrical light in the state of less brilliancy can he
 ascribed to     a gradually increasing ignition of solid particles.
 They rather resemble the weakly luminous flame of hydrogen,
 which becomes white            by
                                 solid ignited carbon in the so-called
gas-flames, or       byother solid matters, as in the Drummond light.
 The true electrical light       is produced at great distances in the
 surrounding, isolating, aeriform medium, when the latter                    i3
 attenuated.     With this coloured light belonging to the strongly
refrangible part of the spectrum, phsenomena of ignition may be
combined, by particles torn away from the positive and negative
bodies.     If these particles be only at red heat, the impression
                                                   a
of violet light
  a                   is produced by their mixture with the electric
light.    To  this   class belong the column of light in the electrical
egg, and the basal point of the brush, and lastly, the indented
rpddish sparks of an electrical machine, at distances to which               a
white spark does not pass. If particles at                  awhite heat come
together, the whole        iswhite, as in the sparks of Leyden jars in  ;
opposition to the bright light of incandescence, the less strongly
luminous electric light disappears in the same way as the weak
bluish lower part in       a gas-flame appears black in opposition to

the bright mass of light, whilst with the small brilliancy of a
wax-light the latter betrays its colour even without optical aids
of absorption.    Only prismatic analysis and the action upon
uranium glass indicate the presence of the electric light also.
If  the particles at a white heat do not reach each other, the
spark acquires a spot of interruption, which, however, still shows
red light besides the true electric light, when the particles pre
viously at a white heat have become cooled to redness.          The
basal point of the brush, which retrogrades   in proportion  to  the
larger field in which the electric light becomes visible, is to be
compared with the spot of interruption of the spark ; the par
ticles of the solid body which are here still red-hot may, on
reaching   a greater distance, be completely extinguished, so that
then the electric light alone prevails.  The brush could not be
coloured by a spirit-flame    coloured  yellow with chloride of
sodium held under       asit,then becomes converted into
                                     it                     spark.    a
The phenomena of the exhausted tube with mercury indicate the
modification which the electric light undergoes in media other
than atmospheric air.

beds.         In its     general   aspect   it resembles closely the saussurite of the
associated  euphotides, and has probably often been confounded with
that mineral by previous observers.     Hence the densities of 3-2 and
3#3 assigned by different mineralogists to the saussurites of the Alps,
while Delesse has shown that the true saussurite of the euphotide of
 Mount Genevre, like that of the Vosges, is a felspar.
    The magnesites of this region form great beds ; they are crystal
line, and consist of carbonate of magnesia with some carbonate of
iron, and contain as imbedded minerals in some cases grains of quartz,
in others felspar and talc, and at other times serpentine, but always
holding chrome and nickel, the latter as a greenish carbonate, in the
joints of the rock, or in the form of nickeliferous pyrites.
    These magnesian rocks are not confined to the altered portions of
this formation ; beds of siliceous dolomite holding protocarbonate of
iron are found, interstratified with pure fossiliferous limestones, near
 Quebec. The reaction between silica and the carbonates of lime,
 magnesia, and iron, which takes place at no very elevated tempera
ture, in the presence of water, producing silicates of these bases with
 evolution of carbonic acid, enables us to understand the process
which has given rise to the pyroxenes, serpentines, and talcs of this
 formation, while the argillaceous limestones, which are not wanting,
 contain all the elements of the garnet-rock.

 by a great number of analyses, which                    I

               that the metamorphism of these Silurian strata has
resulted from the chemical reaction, in the presence of water, of the
 elements existing in the original sedimentary deposits.
    " On   Determinants, better called Eliminants."           By Professor
 Francis Newman, M.A.
    1. This paper aimed at recommending the introduction into ele
 mentary treatises of the doctrine of Determinants        which, following
                                                                     ;
 Professor Boole,       called Eliminants.
                             it               It exemplified the great aid
 to the memory which the notation affords.          It undertook to show,
that      only so much of new notation be used, as
         if                                                  needed in ele
                                                                         is
 mentary applications, the subject becomes full as easy as the second
part of algebra. The method of proceeding recommended may be
understood by the following concise statement.
    If n linear eqq. are given, connecting n unknown quantities and                     ;
every eq.     represented by A^+B^ + C^jH
                3 is

r   is   1,   ... n in the several eqq.), then, solving for any one of the
              2,
unknowns, we of course obtain           result of the form mx=a.
                                                   a                   Very
simple considerations then show, that m and a will be integer func
 tions of the coefficients    namely,:       easy to prove, that

true for one number n,         must needs be true also for the number
                                      it
 (m+1); and consequently           generally true.

out of which flow all the rules for the genesis of Eliminants, and the
application of them to solve linear eqq. of any degree.
   In adapting the theory to the proof of elementary propositions, as,
in forming the Product of two Eliminants, the paper urged the uti
lity of the principle, that every Eliminant is a linear function of any
one of its columns, and also, of any one of its rows ; — which prin
ciple may often be so applied as to show by inspection, a priori, that
certain constituents are excluded from this and that function, and
thus enable us to obtain its value by assuming arbitrary values for
such constituents.     It deprecated (at least for elementary uses) the
notations used by Mr. Spottiswoode * and others, not only as invol
ving needless novelty to learners, but because no page can be broad
 enough to afford to write
 (1, 2)(1,       l)'
                (2, 2)(1, 2)'
                      +        (3, 2)(1, 3)' instead of BX+SY+jSZ,
                                               +
and because accents, so related, are hard to see in        full page, and           a
the general aspect of every element      so like that of every other ele
                                                          is
ment, that the fatigue of reading soon becomes confusing and in
tolerable.
   2. But the main topic of the paper was to advocate the use of
Eliminants in Geometry of three dimensions, especially in every
systematic treatise on Surfaces of the Second Degree. Various illus
trations and results were given, which the writer believed to be new                                        ;
on which account, some of them may be briefly noticed here.

gree,  it has always one real value.
   Next, let the second surface be a sphere, and you find at least one
diameter of the first surface perpendicular to its conjugate plane.
Make this diameter the axis of x, and take for the axes of y and z
the two principal diameters of the section in the conjugate plane.
Then D=0, E=0, F=0 ; so that the general eq. is reduced to
A.x2+By* + Cz2+G=0.            Moreover, the system of axes is now rect
angular : hence the axis of y, and that of z, equally with that of x,
are each perpendicular to its conjugate plane, and the eq. for p must
have three real roots, corresponding to these three axes.
   We might similarly investigate " the conditions of contact for two
concentric surfaces ;" which, when one of them is a sphere, gives the

eliminants ought to be introduced into the general treatment of these

Cook,    M.A.
  The explanation of the    movements of the Gyroscope (as well as
its mathematical theory) is founded on the principle enunciated in
the two following verbal formulae.
  I.    When     a   particle is made to move       < »           >    a plane by any
applied force, but in consequence of its connexion with some rigid
body on the same side of the plane, loses some of its momentum in
a direction perpendicular to the plane ; all the momentum so lost is
imparted to the rigid body, which is consequently impelled
  f towards 1 . ,

applied force, but in consequence of its connexion with some rigid
body on the same side of the plane, receives an extra momentum in
a direction perpendicalar to the plane ; all the momentum so gained
is taken from the rigid body, which is consequently impelled

(r),   and to revolve round an axis with a given uniform                        angular ve

    Demidovite occurs upon the mammillated masses of malachite in
layers of at the utmost I or 2 millimetres in thickness ; sometimes
several of these layers are seen alternating with malachite and Ta-
guilite, and other phosphatic minerals. Between the Demidovite and
the malachite there is often a very thin white layer, either composed
of pure silica, or of silica mixed with white carbonate of copper*.
    The external surface, where it has not been covered by malachite,
is tolerably shining, but uneven and full of little clefts in different
directions, scarcely visible by the naked eye.
    It is of a sky-blue colour, sometimes passing a little into greenish.
    Its fracture is dull, or of a waxy lustre.
    It is transparent only at the edges, but becomes more so when
placed in water.        It is so porous that it adheres to the tongue.
    Brittle.
    Hardness nearly the same as that of gypsum.
    When scratched it yields a white powder.
    Its specific gravity is about 2-25.
    Before the blowpipe it becomes black in the oxidizing flame ; in
 the inner flame it fuses readily, and furnishes a black scoria, acqui
 ring a metallic lustre on the surface. In a glass tube closed at one
 end it becomes black and furnishes water, which presents no trace
 of acid if the fragments be clean.
    With borax it fuses readily, and without swelling, in the outer
 flame, furnishing a glass which is at first black, and acquires a bluish-
 green colour in cooling : in the inner flame the globule becomes
 nearly colourless, in consequence of the reduction of the copper.
 Every time that the globule is heated afresh, a greenish flame is seen ;
 this no longer appears when the heat is continued.
    With salt of phosphorus a yellow colour is obtained as long as the
 globule is warm ; after cooling, it has the same colour as with borax,
 but the fragment leaves a skeleton of silica.           The globule cannot
 be decolorized in the inner flame.
     When fused for a long time with boracic acid into which an iron
 wire has been introduced, the wire dilates a little and acquires a
 very pale copper colour ; the iron nevertheless remains malleable.
    With a little soda it fuses and gives a black glass ; if the quantity
 of soda be increased, the copper is reduced, but it requires a large
 amount of soda to cause the scoria to enter the charcoal.           The cop
 per obtained is a little paler than that procured by employing red
 copper.
     In the laboratory which I was able to establish at Taguil, I made
 an analysis of this mineral, from which I saw that it possessed a new
 composition.      I do not, however, regard the analysis as perfectly
 satisfactory with regard to the proportions of the substances of which
 it is composed ; because, as I was only able to collect a very small
  quantity of the mineral in a state of perfect purity, I was obliged to
  operate upon very small quantities.
    After having, by preliminary experiments, ascertained the presence
    * An artificial compound of carbonate of
                                                 copper of  a white colour has
 been investigated by M. H. Struve of St. Petersburgh.

phates of alumina and magnesia, but the latter in very minute pro
portions*.       It must also be remarked, that one- third of the water
 escapes at  a   lower temperature than the other two-thirds.
     Demidovite, like Wolkhonskite, Hisingerite, and several other
 minerals,  is  perfectly amorphous, and          is  no doubt still being pro
 duced. At Taguil, as in the whole of the Ural,                  a geological fact

ON   THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE NATIVE METALLIC SULPHURETS
   TOWARDS MURIATIC ACID UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF GALVA
   NISM.    BY M. VON KOBELL.

pyrites; but when the moistened place is touched with zinc, sul
 phuretted hydrogen gas is evolved, and the pyrites acquires a
 brownish colour.      When iron is employed in place of zinc, no
 action appears to take place ; nevertheless this is remarkably shown
 when fine powder of copper pyrites is mixed with fine powder of
 iron and treated with muriatic acid.       Sulphuretted hydrogen gas is
 evolved in abundance; and if 2 parts of iron be taken to 1 part of
 pyrites, the latter is easily decomposed without the aid of heat, and
 the copper is precipitated, whilst in the absence of iron it is but
 slowly attacked by muriatic acid even when boiled.
     Other sulphurets behave in the same way as copper pyrites, and
 this comportment may therefore be made use of in ascertaining the
 presence of sulphur in them.       For this purpose the author employs
a cylindrical glass, about 2-J- inches     height and
                                         iti          1  inch in diameter,
puts into  it    equal volumes of the specimen and iron powder (of
 each as much as can be taken up on the point of             a knife), and
pours over the mixture dilute muriatic acid to    a   depth of some lines.
 He then closes the glass with suitable cork, which holds strip of
                                     a                           a
paper soaked in acetate of lead and then dried, in such          away that
it  passes across the whole width of the cork, and projects on each
side when the glass       closed. With the following ores the reaction
                           is

becoming yellow, brownish, or gray.

    All these compounds, and of course also pyrrhotine (and sulphuret
of iron and nkkej), alabandine and Berthierite, which evolve sul
phuretted hydrogen, even by themselves, when treated with muriatic
acid, show the above-mentioned coloration of the lead-paper within
one minute.       On the other hand, realgar, orpiment, and molybde
nite give no reaction.       Sulphur itself, however, reacts in the way-
above mentioned.        By this means very similar minerals may be
distinguished at once, for example, Clausthalite and Galenite, for
seleniuret of lead gives no reaction, chloanthite and arsenopyrites, &c.

402         Prof. Faraday on               the   Experimental Relations
supplies.    If perfect, the theory would be able to give a reason
for every physical affection of light ; whilst it does not do so, the
affections are in turn fitted to develope the theory, to extend and
enlarge it if true, or if in error to correct it or replace it by a
better.    Hence my plea for the possible utility of experiments
and considerations such as those I am about to advance.
    Light has a relation to the matter which it meets with in its
                                  by it,
course, and is affected by      being reflected, deflected, transmitted,
refracted, absorbed, &c.         particles very minute in their dimen
sions.    The theory supposes the light to consist of undulations,
which, though they are in one sense continually progressive, are
at the same time, as regards the particles of the aether, moving
to and fro transversely.      The number of progressive alternations
or waves in an inch        considered as known, being from 37,600
                             is
to 59,880, and the number which passes to the eye in               second  a
of time     known also, being from 458 to 727 billions
           is                                                     but the ;
extent of the lateral excursion of the particles of the aether, either
 separately or conjointly,        not known, though both
                                   is                            and the  it
 velocity are  probably   very  small   compared  to  the  extent   of the
 wave and   the  velocity  of  its propagation.     Colour     identified
                                                                      is
 with the number of waves. Whether reflexion, refraction, &c.
 have any relation to the extent of the lateral vibration, or whe
 ther they are dependent in part upon some physical action of the
 medium unknown to and unsuspected                       by
                                                 us, are points which               I
 understand to be as yet undetermined.
    Conceiving  it very possible that some experimental evidence of
 value might result from the introduction into           ray of separate
                                                                  a
 particles having great power of action on light, the particles
 being at the same time very small as compared to the wave
 lengths,  I  sought amongst the metals for such.           Gold seemed
especially fitted for experiments of this nature, because of its
comparative opacity amongst bodies, and yet possession of        real           a
transparency    ;because of its development of colour both in the
reflected and transmitted ray    because of the state of tenuity and
                                            ;
division which      permitted
                    it        with the preservation of its integrity
as a  metallic body because of its supposed simplicity of cha
                         ;
racter ;  and because known phaenomena appeared to indicate
that   amere variation in the size of its particles gave rise to                    a
variety of resultant colours.    Besides, the waves of light are so
large compared to the dimensions of the particles of gold which
in various conditions can be subjected to        ray, that    seemed
                                                              a            it
probable   the particles might  come  into effective relations to the
much smaller vibrations of the aether particles      in which case,
                                                                  ;                 if
reflexion, refraction, absorption, &c. depended upon such rela
tions, there was reason to expect that these functions would
change sensibly by the substitution of different-sized particles of

                  of Gold  and other Metals to Light.                403
this metal for each other.        At one time I hoped that I had
altered one coloured ray into another by means of gold, which
would have been equivalent to a change in the number of undu
lations ; and though I have not confirmed that result as yet, still
those   I have obtained seem to me to present a" useful experimen
tal entrance into certain physical investigations respecting the
nature and action of a ray of light.        I do not pretend that they
are of great value in their present state, but they are very sug
gestive, and they may save much trouble to any experimentalists
inclined to pursue and extend this line of investigation.

                Gold-leaf effect of heat, pressure, fyc.
    Beaten gold-leaf is known in films estimated at the ^'s^tso^1
of an inch in thickness ; they are translucent, transmitting green
light, reflecting yellow, and absorbing a portion. These leaves
consist of an alloy in the proportions of 12 silver and 6 cop
per to 462 of pure gold. 2000 leaves 3|ths of an inch square
are estimated to weigh 384 grains.          Such gold-leaf is no doubt
full of holes, but having, in conjunction with Mr. W. De
la Rue, examined it in the microscope with very high powei-s
(up to 700 linear), we are satisfied that it is truly transparent
where the gold is continuous, and that the light transmitted is
green.     By the use of the balance Mr. De la Rue found that
the leaf employed was on the average ^-^Vo 0^ of an inch thick.
Employing polarized light and an arrangement of sulphate of
lime plates, it was found that other rays than the green could be
transmitted by the gold-leaf. The yellow rays appeared to be
those which were first stopped or thrown back.           Latterly I have
obtained some pure gold-leaf beaten by Marshall, of which 2000
leaves weighed 408 grains, or 0-2 of a grain per leaf; its reflected
colour is orange-yellow, and its transmitted colour a warm green.
Gold alloy containing 25 per cent, of silver produces pale gold-
leaf, which transmits a blue purple light, and extinguishes much
more than the ordinary gold-leaf.
    So a leaf of beaten gold occupies in average thickness no more
than from £th to ^th part of a single wave of light.           By chemi
cal means, the film may be attenuated to such a degree as to
transmit a ray so luminous as to approach to white, and that in
parts which have every appearance of being continuous in the
microscope, when viewed with a power of 700.            For this purpose
it may be laid upon a solution of chlorine, or, better still, of the
cyanide of potassium*.         If a clean plate of glass be breathed
 upon and then brought carefully upon a leaf of gold, the latter
 will adhere to it ; if distilled water be immediately applied at the

 leaves only metal.

 edge of the leaf, it will pass between the glass and gold, and the
 latter will be perfectly stretched ; if the water be then drained
 out, the gold-leaf will be left well extended, smooth, and ad
 hering to the glass.         If,after the water         poured off,
                                                        is                a weak
 solution of cyanide be      introduced    beneath      the  gold,   the   latter
 will gradually become thinner and thinner; but at any moment
 the process may be stopped, the cyanide washed away by water,
 and the attenuated gold film left on the glass.          If towards the end
a   washing be made with alcohol, and then with alcohol containing
a   little yarnish, the gold film will be left cemented to the glass*.
     In this manner the leaf may be obtained so thin, that think      I
 50 or even 100 might be included in           a single progressive undu
 lation of light.      But the character of the effect on light           is  not
 changed, the light transmitted      isgreen,as before; and though that
 green tint    is due to condition of the gold induced
                        a                                       by pressure,   it
 as yet remains unchanged through         all these   varieties   of  thickness
 and of proportion to the progressive or the lateral undulation.
     Gold-leaf, either fine or common, examined in the microscope,
 appears as     a  most irregular thing.        It       everywhere closely
                                                        is
 mottled or striated, according as       part at the middle or the edge
                                          a
 of a    leaf
            is   selected, minute portions which are close to other
 parts    being  four or five times as thick as the latter,       if   the pro
 portion  of  light  which  passes through may       be   accepted    as  an in
 dication.     Yet this irregular plate does not cause any sensible
 distortion of an object seen through         it,
                                               that object being the line
of light reflected from       a fine wire in the focus of         a  moderate
microscope.        Nor  perhaps  was  any  distortion     due  to consecutive
convexities and concavities to be expected          ;  for when the thicker
parts of the leaf were examined, they seemed to be accumulated
plications of the gold, the leaf appearing as           amost irregular and
crumpled object,      with dark  veins running     across   both the thicker
and thinner parts, and from one to the other.                Yet in the best
microscope, and with the highest power, the leaf seemed to be
 continuous, the occurrence of the smallest sensible hole making
that continuity at other parts apparent, and every part possess
ing its proper green colour.        How such        film can act as plate
                                                    a                     a

almost exclusively under their influence.    When one piece of gold-leaf was
placed on the surface of  a   solution of cyanide of potassium, and another,
moistened on both sides, was placed under the surface, both dissolved; but
twelve minutes sufficed for the solution of the first, whilst above twelve
hours were required for the submerged piece.        In weaker solutions, and
with silver also, the same results were obtained    from sixty to
                                                    ;               hundred

fold as much time being required for the disappearance of the submerged
metal as for that which, floating, was in contact both with the air and the
solvent.   An action of this kind has probably much to do with the forma
tion of the films to be described hereafter.

                 of Gold and ot/ier Metals    to Light.             405
on polarized light in the manner it does, is one of the queries
suggested by the phenomena which requires solution.
   When gold-leaf is laid upon glass and its temperature raised
considerably without disturbance, either by the blowpipe or an
ordinary Argand gas-burner, it seems to disappear, i. e. the
lustre passes away, the light transmitted is abundant and nearly
white, and the place appears of a pale brown colour. One would
think that much of the metal was dissipated, but all is there,
and if the heat has been very high (which is not necessary for
the best results), the microscope shows it in minute globular
portions. A comparatively low heat, however, and one unable
to cause separation of the particles, is known to alter the mole
cular condition of gold, and the gold-beater finds important ad
vantage in the annealing effect of a temperature that does not
hurt the skins or leaves between which he beats the metal.
   It might be supposed that the annealed metal, in contracting
from the constrained and attenuated state produced by beating,
drew up, leaving spaces through which white light could pass,
and becoming itself almost insensible through the smallness of
its quantity ; and if gold-leaf unattached to glass be heated care
fully with oil in a tube, it does shrink up considerably even
 before it loses its green colour, which finally happens.        But if
the gold-leaf laid upon glass plates by water only be carefully
dried, then introduced into a bath of oil and raised to a tempe
rature as high as the oil can bear for five or six hours, and then
suffered to cool, the plates, when taken out and washed, first in
camphine and then in alcohol, present specimens of gold which
has lost its green colour, transmits far more light than before,
and reflects less, whilst yet the film remains in form and other
conditions apparently quite unchanged.           Being now examined
in the microscope, it presents exactly the forms and appearance
of the original leaf, except in colour ; the same irregularities ap
pear, the same continuity, and if the destruction of the green
colour has not been complete, it will be seen that it is the
thicker folds and parts of the mottled mass that retain the
original state longest.
   This change does not depend upon the substance in contact
with which the gold is heated*. If the leaf be laid upon mica,
rock-crystal, silver or platinum, the same result occurs ; the
surrounding medium also may change, and be air, oil or carbonic
acid, without causing alteration.      Nor has the gold disappeared ;
a piece of leaf, altered in one part and not in another, was di-

        " Purple oxide of gold."

406         Prof. Faraday   on the  Experimental Relations
vided into four equal parts, and the gold on each converted by
chlorine gas into crystallized chloride of gold : the same amount
was found in each division.
   When the gold-leaf is laid by water on plates of rock-crystal,
and then gradually heated in a muffle not higher than is neces
sary, an excellent result is obtained.      The gold is then of a uni
form pale brown colour by common observation, but when
examined by a lens and an oblique light, all the mottle of the
original leaf appears.     It adheres but very slightly to the rock-
crystal, and yet can bear the application of the pressure now to
be described.
    When gold rendered colourless by annealing is subjected to
pressure, it again becomes of a green colour.         I find a convex
surface of agate or rock-crystal having a radius of from a quar
ter to half an inch very good for this purpose, the metal having
very little tendency to adhere to this substance.        The greening
is necessarily very imperfect,    and if examined  by a  lens  it will be
evident that the thinner parts of the film are rarely reached by
the pressure, it being taken off by the thicker corrugations ; but
when reached they acquire a good green colour, and the effect is
abundantly shown in the thicker parts.          At the same time that
the green colour is thus reproduced, the quantity of light trans
mitted is diminished, and the quantity of light reflected is in
 creased.    When the gold-leaf has been heated on glass in a
muffle, it generally adheres so well as to bear streaking with
 the convex rock-crystal, and then the production of the reflect
 ing surface and the green transmission is very striking.              In
 other forms of gold film,     to  be described  hereafter,  the  green
ing effect of pressure (which is general to gold) is still more
strikingly manifested, and can be produced with the touch of a
card or a finger.     In these cases, and even with gold-leaf, the
 green colour reproduced can- be again taken away by heat to
 appear again by renewed pressure.
    As to the essential cause of this change of colour, more inves
tigation is required to decide what that may be. As already
mentioned, it might be thought that the gold-leaf had run up
into separate particles.     If it were so, the change of colour by
division is not the less remarkable, and the case would fall into
those brought together under the head of gold fluids.            On the
whole,  I  incline to this opinion ; but the appearance in the mi
croscope, the occurrence of thin films of gold acting altogether
like plates, and yet not transmitting a green ray until they are
pressed, and their action on a polarized ray of light, throw doubts
in the way of such a conclusion.
    It may be thought that the beating has conferred a uniform
strained condition upon the gold, a difference in quality in one

                   of Gold and other Metals    to  Light.             407
 direction which annealing takes away ; but when the gold is ex
 amined by polarized light, there is no evidence as yet of such a
 condition, for the green and the colourless gold present like
 results ; and there is a little difficulty in admitting that such an
 irregular corrugated film as gold-leaf appears to be, can possess
 any general compression in one direction only, especially when
it is considered that it is beaten amongst tissues softer than
itself, and made up with it into considerable masses. The green
ing .effect of pressure occurs with the deposited particles of
electric discharges, and here it appears either amongst the larger
particles near the line of the discharge, or amongst the far
finer ones at a considerable distance.            Such results do not
 suggest a dependence upon either the size of the particles or
their quantity, but rather upon the relative dimensions of the
particles in the direction of the ray and transverse to that
direction. One may imagine that spherical or other particles,
which, being disposed in       a plane,  transmit ruby rays or violet
rays, acquire the power, when they are flattened, of transmitting
green rays, and such a thought sends the mind at once from the
wave of light to the direction and extent of the vibrations of the
aether.     For it does not seem likely that pressure can produce
its peculiar result by affecting the relation of the dimension of
the particle to the length-dimension of a progressive undulation
of light, the latter being so very much greater than the former ;
but the relation to the dimension of the direct or lateral vibration
of the particles of the sether may be greatly affected, that being
probably very small and much nearer to, if not even less than,
the size of the particles of gold.
    Silver-leaf, as usually obtained by beating, is so opake,
as perfectly to exclude the light of the sun.         When this is laid
by water on plates of rock-crystal and heated in a muffle, it
begins to change, at a temperature lower than that required for
gold, and becomes very translucent, losing at the same time its
reflective power : it looks very like the film of chloride produced
when a leaf of silver is placed in chlorine gas.         When examined
by   a lens  or an ordinary microscope,    the leaf  seems  to be as con
tinuous as in its original state; the finest hole, or the finest line
drawn by a needle-point, appears only to prove the continuity of
the metallic film up to the very edges of these real apertures.
When pressure is applied to this translucent film, the compressed
metal becomes either opake or of a very dark purple colour, and
resumes its high reflective power.         If a higher heat than that
necessary    for this first change  be  applied, then the leaf, viewed
in the microscope, assumes a mottled appearance, as if a retrac
tion into separate parts had occurred.        At a still higher tempera
ture this effect is increased; but the heat, whether applied in

408          Prof. Faraday on   the Experimental Relations
the muffle or by a blowpipe, which is necessary to fuse the metal
and make it run together in globules, is very much higher than
that which causes the first change of the silver : the latter is, in
fact, below such a red heat as is just visible in the dark.    What
ever the degree of heat applied, the metal remains as metallic
silver during the whole time.       When many silver leaves were laid
loosely one upon another, rolled up into a loose coil, introduced
into a glass tube, and the whole placed in a muffle and heated
carefully for three or four hours to so low a degree that the glass
tube had not been softened or deformed, it was found that the
 silver-leaf had sunk together a little and shaped itself in some
 degree upon the glass, touching by points here and there, but
 not adhering to it.     But it was changed, so that the light of a
 candle could be seen through forty thicknesses : it had not run
 together, though it adhered where one part touched another.
 It did not look like metal, unless one thought of it as divided
 dead metal, and it even appeared too unsubstantial and translu
 cent for that ; but when pressed together, it clung and adhered
 like clean silver, and resumed all its metallic characters.
     When the silver is much heated, there is no doubt that the
 leaf runs up into particles more or less separate. But the ques
 tion still remains as to the first effect of heat, whether it merely
 causes a retraction of the particles, or really changes the optical
 and physical nature of the metal from the beaten or pressed
 state to another from which pressure can return it back again to
 its more splendid condition.        It seems just possible that the
 leaf may consist of an infinity of parts resulting from replications,
 foldings and scales, all laid parallel by the beating which has
 produced them, and that the first action of heat is to cause these
 to open out from each other ; but that supposition leaves many
 of the facts either imperfectly explained or untouched.           The
 Arts do not seem to furnish any process which can instruct us
  as to this condition, for all the operations of polishing, burnish
  ing, &c. applied to gold, silver and other metals, are just as
 much fitted to produce the required state under one view as
 under the other.
     To return to gold : it is clear that that metal, reduced to small
  dimensions    by mere mechanical       means, can appear of two
  colours by transmitted light, whatever the cause of the difference
  may be.     The occurrence of these two states may prepare one's
  mind for the other differences with respect to colour, and the
  action of the metallic particles on light, which have yet to be
  described.
     Many leaves of gold, when examined by a lens and trans
  mitted light, present the appearance of red parts; these parts

                                At first thought the gold was abso
lutely red in these parts, but am inclined to believe that in the
greatest number of cases the tint is subjective, being the result
of the contrast between the white light transmitted through
bruised parts, and the green light of the neighbouring continuous
parts.    Nevertheless, some of these places, when seen in the mi
croscope, appeared to have a red colour of their own, that           to                   is,
transmit     true red light.

 say that gold-leaf may not, in some cases, where the effect of
 pressure in     particular direction has been removed, do the same.
                 a
    Many of the prepared films of gold were so thin as to have
 their reflective power considerably reduced, and that in parts
 which, under the microscope and in other ways, appeared to be
 quite continuous this agrees with the transmission of all the

 thickness      necessary for full reflexion; therefore, that more
               is
 than one particle in depth          concerned in the act, and that
                                         is
 the division of gold into separate particles by processes to be
 described, may bring them within or under the degree necessary
 for ordinary reflexion.
    As particles of pure gold- will be found hereafter to adhere
 by  contact, so the process of beating may be considered as one
 which tends to weld gold together in all directions, and espe
 cially in that transverse to the blow, — point favourable to con
                                                         a

passes, and       plate of annealed glass, either thick or thin, be in

   Deflagrations   of Gold  (and other metals)
                                               —heat — pressure, fyc.
    Gold wire deflagrated by explosions of a Leyden battery pro
 duces a divided condition, very different to that presented by
 gold leaves. Here the metal is separated into particles, and no
 pressure in any direction, either regular or irregular, has been
 exerted upon them in the act of division.       When the deflagra
 tions have been made near surfaces of glass, rock-crystal, topaz,
 fluor-spar, card-board, &c, the particles as they are caught are
 kept separate from each other and in place, and generally those
which remain in the line of the discharge have been heated by
the passage of the electricity.      The deposits consist of particles
of various sizes, those at the outer parts of the result being too
 small to be recognized by the highest powers of the microscope.
Beside making these deflagrations over different substances, as
 described above,   I made them in different atmospheres, namely,
in oxygen and hydrogen, to compare with air ; but the general
effects, the colours produced, and the order of the colours, were
precisely the same in all the cases.        These deposits were in
 soluble in nitric acid and in hydrochloric acid, but in the mixed
acids or in chlorine solution were soluble, exactly in the manner
of gold. There is no reason to doubt that they consisted of me
tallic gold in a state of extreme division.
    Now as to the effects on light, i. e. as to the coloured rays
reflected or transmitted by these deposited particles, and first, of
those in the line of the discharge where the wire had been.      Here
the mica was found abraded much, the glass less, and the rock-
crystal and topaz least.      Where abraded, the gold adhered ; in
all the other parts it could be removed with the slightest touch.
The gold deposited in this central place was metallic and golden
by reflected light, and of a fine ruby colour by transmitted light.
On each side of this line the deposit had a dark colour, but when
particularly examined gave a strong golden metallic reflexion,
and by transmission a fine violet colour, partaking of green and
ruby in different parts, and sometimes passing altogether into
green.    Beyond this, on each side, where the tints became paler
and where the particles appeared to be finer, the transmitted
tint became ruby or violet-ruby, and this tint was especially seen
when the deposit was caught on a card.           As to the reflected
light,  even   at these  faintest parts it is golden and metallic.
This is easily observed by wiping off a sharp line across the
deposit on glass in the very faintest part, and then causing the
sun's rays collected in the focus of a small lens to travel to and
fro across that edge ; the presence of the metallic gold on the
unwiped part is at once evident by the high illumination pro
duced there.      It is evident that all the colours described are

                 of Gold and other Metals      to  Light.           411
produced by one and the same substance, namely gold, the only
apparent difference being the state of division and different
degrees of the application of heat.       The thickest parts of these
deposits are so discontinuous, that they cannot conduct the elec
tricity of a battery of two or three pairs of plates, i. e. of a bat
tery unable to produce a spark among the particles.
   When any of these deposits of divided gold are heated to dull
redness, a remarkable       change occurs.        The portions which
before were violet, blue, or green by transmitted light, now
change to a ruby, still preserving their metallic reflecting power,
and this ruby is in character quite like that which is presented
in the arts by glass tinged by gold. This change is often far
better shown in the more distant and thinner parts of the de
posit, than in those nearest to the line of discharge, for near the
latter place, where the deposit is most abundant, the metal
appears to run up into globules, as with gold-leaf, and so disap
pears as a film.    I believe that the ruby character of the deposit
in the line of discharge, is caused by the same action of heat
produced at the moment by the electricity passing there.              In
the distant parts, the deposit, rubified by after-heat, is not im
bedded or fused into the glass, rock-crystal, topaz, &c, but is
easily removed by a touch of the finger, though in parts of the
glass plate which are made very hot, it will adhere.
    If the agate pressure before spoken of, in respect of gold-leaf,
be applied to ruby parts not too dense, places will easily be
found where this pressure increases the reflective power con
siderably, and where at the same time it converts the trans
mitted ray from ruby to green; making the gold, as            I believe,
then accord in condition with beaten gold-leaf. On the other
hand, if parts of the unheated electric deposit, where they are
purple-gray, and so thin as to be scarcely visible without care,
be in like manner pressed, they will acquire the reflective power,
and then transmit the green ray ; and        I think I am justified by
my experiments     in  stating,  that fine  gold   particles, so loosely
deposited   that they  will wipe  off by  a light touch of the finger,
and possessing one conjoint structure, can in one state transmit
light of a blue-gray colour, or can by heat be made to transmit
light of a ruby colour, or can by pressure from either; $V the
former states be made to transmit light of a green colour; all
these changes being due to modifications of the gold, as gold,
and independent of the presence of the bodies upon which for
the time the gold is supported ; for I ought to have said, if I
have not said so, that these changes happen with all the deposits
upon glass, mica, rock-crystal, and topaz, and whatever the
atmosphere in which they were formed.
    When gold is deflagrated by the voltaic battery near glass (I

412         Prof. Faraday   on the Experimental Relations
have employed sovereigns laid on glass for the terminals), a de
posit of metallic gold in fine particles is produced.       The densest
parts have a dark slate-violet colour passing into violet and ruby-
violet in the outer thinner portions ; a ruby tint is presented
occasionally where the heat of the discharge has acted on the
deposit.    The deposited gold was easily removed by wiping,
except actually at the spot where the discharge had passed.
When these deposits were heated to dull redness they changed
and acquired a ruby tint, which was very fine at the outer and
thinner parts.      The portions nearer the place of discharge pre
sented ruby-violet and then violet tints, suggesting that accu
mulation of that which presented a fine ruby tint would, by
stopping more and more light, transmit a ruby-violet or violet
ray only.     Pressure with the agate surface had a like effect as
before, both with the heated and the unheated portions, i. e. with
the violet and the ruby particles ; but the effect was not alto
gether so good, and the tint of the transmitted ray was rather a
green-violet than a pure green.      Still the difference produced by
the pressure was very remarkable.          The unheated particles at
the surface, away from the glass, presented by reflexion almost
a black; being heated, they became much more golden and
metallic in appearance.
   I  prepared an apparatus by which many of the common metals
could be deflagrated in hydrogen by the Leyden battery, and
being caught upon glass plates could be examined as to re
flexion, transmission, colour, &c. whilst in the hydrogen and in
the metallic, yet divided state.      The following are briefly the
results; which should be considered in connexion with those
obtained by employing polarized light.         Copper : a fine deposit
presenting by     reflexion a purplish-red    metallic  lustre, and by
transmission a green colour, dark in the thicker parts, but always
green ; agate pressure increased the reflexion where it was not
bright, and a little diminished the transmission, rendering the
green deeper, but not changing its character as in the case of
gold.     Tin gave a beautiful bright white reflexion, and by trans
mission various shades of light and dark brown ; agate pressure
diminished the transmission and increased the reflexion in places
before dull or dead ; the effect appeared to be due simply to the
lateral expansion of the separate particles filling up the space.
Iron presented a fine steel-gray, or slate metallic reflexion and a
dark brown transmission; agate pressure gave the same effect
as with tin, but no change of colour.       Lead: a bright white re
flexion, the transmission a dark smoky brown ; agate pressure
appeared to change this brown towards blue. Zinc : the reflexion
bright white and metallic ; the transmission a dark smoky colour
with portions of blue-gray, brown-gray and pale brown ; agate

                  of Gold   and other Metals to       Light.             413
pressure tended to change the blue-gray to brown.    Palladium :
the reflexion fine metallic and dark gray; the transmitted light,
where most abundant, sepia-brown; agate pressure converted
the tint in the thinner places from brown towards blue-gray.
Platinum : the reflexion white, bright and metallic ; the trans
mission brown or warm gray with no other colours ; agate pres
sure increased the reflexion and diminished the transmission as
with tin.    Aluminium : the reflexion metallic and white, very
beautiful; the transmitted light was dark brown, bluish-brown,
and occasionally in the thinner parts orange; agate pressure
caused but little change.
Films of Gold     {and other metals) by Phosphorus,        Hydrogen,   fyc.
                                                                              —
                        effect   of   heat — pressure.
    The reduction of gold from its solution by phosphorus is well
known.      If fifteen or twenty drops of a strong solution of gold,
equal to about 1£ grain of metal, be added to two or three pints
of water, contained in a large capsule or dish, if four or five
minute particles of phosphorus be scattered over the surface, and
the whole be covered and left in quietness for twenty-four or
thirty-six hours, then the surface will be found covered with a
pellicle of gold, thicker at the parts near the pieces of phosphorus,
and possessing there the full metallic golden reflective power of
the metal ; but passing by gradation into parts, further from the
phosphorus, where the film will be scarcely sensible except upon
close inspection.      If plates of glass be introduced into the fluid
 under the pellicle, and raised gradually, the pellicle will be raised
on them ; it may then be deposited on the surface of pure di
 stilled water to wash it ; may be raised again on the glass ; the
 water allowed to drain away, and the whole suffered to dry.          In
 this way the pellicle remains attached to the glass, and is in a
 very convenient condition for preservation and examination.
     If phosphorus be dissolved in two or three times its bulk of
 sulphide of carbon, and a few drops of the fluid be placed on the
 bottom of a dry basin, vapour of the phosphorus will soon rise
 up and bring the atmosphere in the basin to a reducing state.
 If a plate of glass large enough to cover the basin have six or
 eight drops of a strong neutral solution of chloride of gold
 placed on  it,  and this be spread about        by
                                                  glass stirrer, so as to
                                                    a
 form a   flowing layer on the surface, the glass may then be in
 verted and placed over the dish.        So arranged the gold solution
 will keep its place, but will have film of metal reduced on its
                                            a
 under surface.       The plate being taken off after twenty, thirty,
  or forty minutes, and turned with the gold solution upwards,
  may then gradually be depressed in an inclined position into                a
 large basin of pure water, one edge entering first, and the gold

414         Prof. Faraday on    the  Experimental Relations
film will  be left floating.     After sufficient washing it may be
taken up in portions on smaller plates of glass, dried, and kept
for use.    Mr. Warren De la Rue taught me how to make and
deal with these films : they may by attention be obtained very
uniform, of very different degrees of thickness, from almost
perfect transparency      to complete opacity, and by successive
application  of  the  same  collecting glass plate may be superposed
with great facility.
    These films may be examined either on the water or on the
glass.   When thick, their reflective power is as a gold plate,
full and metallic ; as they are thinner they lose reflective power,
and they may be obtained so thin as to present no metallic
appearance, all the coloured rays of light then passing freely
through them.        As to the transmitted light, the thinner films
generally present one kind of colour ; it appears as a feeble gray-
violet, which increases in character as the film becomes thicker
and sometimes approaches a violet ; a greenish-violet also appears;
and the likeness of the gray-violet tint of these films to the stains
produced by a solution of gold on the skin or other organic
reducing substance, or the stain produced on common pottery,
cannot be mistaken.        Superposition of several gray-violet films
does not produce       a green tint, but only a diminution of light
without change of colour. In those specimens made by par
ticles of phosphorus floating on the solution of gold, very fine
green tints occur at the thicker and golden parts of the film.
The colour of the gold here may depend in some degree on the
manner in which these films are formed : the thicker parts are not
produced altogether by the successive addition of reduced gold
from the portion of fluid immediately beneath them.           When a
particle of phosphorus is placed on pure water, it immediately
throws out a film which appears to cover the whole of the sur
face ; in a little while the film thickens around the particle and
is easily distinguished by its high reflective power.       It is this
film which reduces the gold in solution, being itself consumed in
the action ; the result is a continued extension from the phos
phorus outwards, which, after it has covered the solution with a
thin film of gold, continues to cause a compression of the parts
around the phosphorus and an accumulation there, rendering
the gold at a distance of half an inch from the phosphorus so
thick, that it is brilliant by reflexion and nearly opake by trans
mission, whilst near to the phosphorus the forming film is
so thin as to be observed only on careful examination, and is still
travelling outwards and compressing the surrounding parts more
and more.      The phosphorus is very slowly consumed; a par
ticle not weighing T^5dth of a grain will remain for four or five
days on the surface of water before it disappears.

     Though the particles of these films adhere together strongly,
as may be seen by their stiffness on water, still the films cannot
be considered as continuous.          If they were, those made by
vapour     of phosphorus   could not  thicken  during their formation,
neither could they dry on glass     in the short time found sufficient
for that purpose.      Experimentally also, I find that vapours and
gases can pass through them.           Very thin films without folds
did not sensibly conduct the electricity of a single pair of
Grove's plates ; thicker films did conduct ; yet with these proofs
that these films could not be considered as continuous, they
acted as thin plates upon light, producing the concentric rings
of colours round the phosphorus at their first formation, though
their thickness then could scarcely be the y^dth, perhaps not the
j-^5dth of a wave undulation of light.       Platinum, palladium, and
rhodium produced films, showing these concentric rings very well.
      Many of these films of gold, both thick and thin, which
 being of a gray colour originally, were laid on a solution of cya
 nide of potassium to dissolve slowly, changed colour as they dis
 solved and became green ; if change occurred, it was always
 towards green.       On the other hand, when laid on a solution of
 chlorine, the change during solution was towards an amethyst
 or ruby tint.      The films were not acted upon by pure nitric, or
 hydrochloric, or sulphuric acids, or solutions of potassa or brine.
 They dissolved in damp chlorine gas, not changing in colour
 during the solution. I believe them to consist of pure gold.
      When these gold films were heated to dull redness they
 changed.       The reflexion, though not much altered, was a little
 more metallic and golden than before; more light was trans
  mitted after the heating and the colour had altered from green
  ish to violet, or from gray-green to ruby or amethyst ; and now
  two or three film3 superposed often gave a very ruby colour.
  This action is like that of heat on the particles separated by
  electric explosions.     If not overheated, the particles were not
  fused to the glass, but could be easily wiped off.           Whenever
  these heated particles were pressed by the convex agate, they
  changed in character and transmitted green light.             Heat took
   away this character    of the gold, the  heat  of boiling  oil, if con
   tinued, being sufficient ; but on applying pressure       at  the  same
   spot, the power of transmitting green light was restored to the
   particles.    In many cases where the gold adhered sufficiently to
   the glass to bear a light drawing touch from the finger or a card,
   such touch altered the light transmitted from amethystine to
   green ; so small is the pressure required when the particles are
   most favourably disposed.
       Heating injured the conducting power for electricity of these
   films, no doubt by retraction of the particles, though there was

 416         Prof. Faraday   on the  Experimental Relations
 no 3uch evident appearance in these cases, as in the unattached
 gold-leaf of the particles running up into globules.
    A given film, examined very carefully in the microscope by
 transmitted lamp-light, with an aperture of 90° and power of 700
 linear, presented the following appearances.       The unheated part
 was of a gray colour, and by careful observation was seen to be
 slightly granular.    By very close observation this gray part was
 often resolvable into a mixture of green and amethystine striae,
 it being the compound effect of these which in general produces
 the gray sensation in the eye.      When a part of such a film was
 heated, the transmitted colour was changed from gray to purple,
 as before described, and the part thus heated was evidently more
 granular than before.      This difference was confirmed in other
 cases.   That the heated part should thus run up, seems to show
 that many of the particles must have been touching though they
 did not form a continuous film ; and on the other hand, the dif
 ference between the effect here and with unattached gold-leaf,
 shows that the degree of continuity as a film must be very small.
 When these heated films were greened by agate pressure, or the
drawing pressure of a card, the green parts remain granulated,
apparently in the same degree as when purple. The green was not
subjective or an effect of interference, but a positive colour belong]
ing to the gold in that condition. Every touch of the agate was
beautifully distinct as a written mark. The parts thus greened
and the purple parts appeared to transmit about the same amount
of light. Though the film appeared granulated, no impression was
made upon the mind that the individual particles of which the
                                                                      *
film consisted were in any degree rendered sensible to the eye.
    The unheated gold films when pressed by agate often indicated
an improved reflective power, and the light transmitted was also
modified ; generally it was less, and occasionally tended towards
a green tint ; but the effect of pressure was by no means so evi
dent as in particles which had been heated.
    Films of some other metals were reduced by phosphorus in
like manner, the results in all these cases being of course much
affected by the strength of the solution and the time of action ;
they are briefly as follows.     Palladium : a weak solution of the
chloride gave fine films, apparently very continuous and stiff;
the reflexion was strong and metallic, of a dark gray colour ; the
transmission presented every shade of Indian ink.            Platinum
chloride gave traces of a film excessively thin, and very slow in
formation. Rhodium chloride in three or four hours gave a
beautiful film of metal in concentric rings, varying in reflecting
and transmitting power over light and also in colour; those
which reflected well, transmitted little light; and those which
transmitted, reflected little light ; one might have thought there

                    of Gold  and other Metals to Light.                417
was no metal in some of the rings between other rings that re
flected brilliantly, but the metal was there of transmitting thick
ness : the transmitting colour of rhodium varied from brown to
blue.      Silver : a solution of the nitrate gave films showing the
concentric rings ; the light transmitted by the thinner parts was
of a warm brown, or sepia tint ; the film becomes very loose and
mossy in the thicker parts and is wanting in adherence ; pressure
brings out the full metallic lustre in every part, and in the thin
places converts the colour from brown to blue, being in that
respect like the result with pale gold-leaf, in which the silver
present dominates over the colour of the gold.             I do not think
there   is phosphorus combined with this silver ;      I did not find any,
and considering the surface action on metals which float as films
between air and water, it seems improbable that it should be there.
   , Hydrogen was employed         to reduce some of the metals, their
solutions being placed in an atmosphere of the gas. The action
differed considerably       from that of phosphorus, as might be
expected.       Gold   produced a very thin film, too thin to be
washed ; it had a faint metallic reflexion, and transmitted a
 slate-blue colour like the former films.        Platinum chloride was
 acted on at once ; minute spots appeared here and there on the
 surface; these enlarged, became rough and corrugated at the
 middle, though brilliant at the edges, and at last formed an
 irregular coat over the fluid ; at the part where the film was flat
 and brilliant, it resembled that produced by the electric explo
 sion, and by transmission gave a dark gray colour.                Iridium
 required much time, and formed a crust from centres like the
 platinum.       Palladium gave an instant action, but most of the
 reduced metal sunk in a finely divided state ; a film may be
 obtained, but it has very little adhesion.         Rhodium is reduced,
 but the film consists of floating particles, having so little adhe
 sion that it cannot be gathered up.          Silver is reduced, but the
 film is very thin and has no tenacity.
     A copper film of very beautiful character may be obtained as
 follows in all varieties of thickness.       Let a little oxide of copper
 be dissolved in olive-oil to form a bath, and having immersed
  some plates of glass, for which purpose microscope plates 3x1
 inches are very convenient, let the whole be heated up to the
  decomposing temperature of the oil ; being left to cool, and the
 plates then drained and washed successively in campbine and
  alcohol, they will be found covered with a film of copper, having
  the proper metallic lustre and colour by reflexion ; and by trans
  mission, presenting a green colour, which, though generally
  inclining to olive, is in the thinner films often more beautiful
  than the green presented by pressed gold.

XL VIII.    On the Colour  of Salts in Solution, each constituent of
    which is coloured.   By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.R.S. fyc*
                            [With      a   Plate.]
           the general rule, that a particular base or acid has the
FROM same effect on the rays of light, with whatever it may be com
bined in aqueous solution, it may be inferred that when two bodies
combine, each of which has a different influence on the rays of light,
a solution of the salt itself will transmit only those rays which are
not absorbed by either, or in other words, those which are trans
mitted by both. Thus if a red acid and a blue base combine,
the resulting salt will certainly not be purple, but it may present
the colour of some ray intermediate between red and blue — per
haps green.
*
   This, indeed, was laid down by me as a general rule in a paper
read before the Chemical Society, " On the Use of the Prism in
Qualitative Analysisf ;" but only one instance was given, namely
chromate of copper.     Since then           I
                                       have examined several salts
of the character above described, and many haloid salts, which
have led to some unexpected, and             I
                                       think suggestive results.
    The method employed was that described in the paper already
referred to.    It is briefly as follows :—The solution to be ex
amined is placed in a hollow wedge of glass, which is interposed
between the eye of the spectator and a narrow slit in the window-
shutter, in such a manner that the thin line of light is seen
traversing the different thicknesses of liquid.    This line of light
is then analysed by placing a good prism between the hollow
wedge and the eye.       In this way it is seen at once what rays
are absorbed by increasing thicknesses of the solution.          The
diagrams in Plate II. give the appearances thus presented ; the
lowest portion representing the prismatic spectrum as seen
through the thinnest possible stratum of liquid, the higher por
tions showing the gradual absorption of different rays.           The
diagrams are not coloured, but the fixed lines will indicate with
far greater accuracy than colour would, the different parts of the
spectrum transmitted.      The least refracted, that      is,
                                                        the red ray,
is  always to the right hand     then follow of course the orange,
                                  ;
yellow, green and blue, while the violet ray         on the extreme
                                                     is

                                Chromates.
    Chromic acid in solution, and its combinations with colourless
bases, such as potash, cut off instantly the more refrangible half
of the spectrum, admitting only the blue rays near F for a short
distance; but they transmit the less refrangible half perfectly.
See fig. 1. Plate   II.   The red bi-salts, as those of potash or baryta,
absorb the green in the neighbourhoodof F likewise, and a little red.
    Chromates were prepared by saturating the acid with the hy-
drated oxide or carbonate of the base.
    Chromate of Copper is a green salt.          The spectrum presented
by it is represented in fig. 5, where evidently the absorption of
the red ray is due to the base, that of the blue and violet to the
acid.     Compare figs. 1 and 9.
    Chromate of Nickel is of a yellowish-green, and presents nearly
the same spectrum as the copper salt, as might be anticipated on
comparing figs. 1 and 10.
    Chromate of Ferric Oxide is orange passing into red as the
depth increases.        It transmits only the red, orange, and yellow
rays, which a comparison of figs. 1 and 4 will show to be trans
mitted in common by both constituents.
    Chromate of Uranium is yellow, like any other salt of that base ;
but its prismatic appearance is totally different, the chromic acid
having cut off all the remarkable luminous bands beyond F.
Compare figs. 1 and 2.
    Chromate of Chromium is of a reddish-brown colour.                   The
rays transmitted by it are represented in fig. 7, from which it
will be seen that the whole of the blue or green maximum of an
ordinary chromium salt (see fig. 6) is cut off by the acid ; but
an absorption of light between D and E does not occur to such
an extent as might be expected from the presence of chromic
oxide.      From the chemical reactions of this body, however,               I
have some doubt about its right to be considered a salt.
                              Permanganates.
    Permanganate of potash gives the very characteristic          spectrum
 represented in fig. 3.
    Permanganate of Uranium gives a purple solution.               Its pris-
liquid by diagrams similar to my own. These experiments are an import
 ant step in the history of photo-chemical research, and would have been
 noticed by me in my previous paper had I been aware of their existence.
 M. Miiller's mode of representing the optical effects produced by the trans
 mission of light through coloured bodies is an improvement on the original
 attempt of Sir John Herschel, and should give precisely the same figures
 as my method ; yet he arrives only, after a series of observations in each
 case, at the same result, which I, by using the hollow wedge, render appa
 rent to the eye at once.     His observations agree closely with mine ; but
 they are very few in number, and have not led him to any of the generali
 zations deduced in my previous or my present paper.                         .'

420        Dr. Gladstone  on the Colour   of Salts in Solution,
watic spectrum shows the alternate bands of light and darkness
due to the permanganic acid; but I did not recognize those due
to uranium in the blue space. This, however, is not to be won*
dered at, since the permanganates admit very little blue light,
and the uranium bands never show themselves till the light has
traversed a considerable amount of salt.      See figs. 2 and 3.
                          Carbazotates.
   Carbazotic acid gives a prismatic spectrum almost identical
with that of chromic acid, but the line of distinction between
the transmitted and the absorbed portions is about midway be
tween b and F.
   Carbazotate of Copper is a yellow salt, but its spectrum differs
from that of carbazotic acid by the gradual absorption of the
red ray — the universal effect of copper in solution.
                                                                  t
                            Haloid Salts.
   Chlorine, bromine, and iodine are, as all know, highly-coloured
bodies; and their solutions in water are also coloured.       Yet the
acids which result from their combinations with hydrogen are
colourless ; and their compounds with most metals, including all
those of the alkalies and earths, are colourless likewise, whether
in the solid or the dissolved condition. Yet, as will be seen
from the following observations, the peculiar effect exerted on
light by the dissolved halogen itself appears also in its compounds
with gold, platinum, and palladium : it appears, too, in its coiut
pounds with copper, nickel, and analogous metals ; but in these
cases only when the solution is very strong, the chromatic effect
of the halogen wholly disappearing as water is added.
                             Bromides.
   Bromine-water is red, and gives the prismatic appearance of
fig. 13.   The light transmitted near F is very dull.
    Terbromide of Gold is intensely red in solution, and gives a
spectrum identical with that of bromine.      On comparing fig. 15,,
it will be seen that a compound of gold with a colourless acid
transmits all the rays transmissible by bromine-water. The gold
salt figured is the nitrate.
   Bibromide of Platinum is intensely red, and likewise gives a
spectrum identical with that of bromine.          Fig. 16 will show
that the remark made above in reference to the gold salt, applies
here likewise.
   Bromide of Palladium and Potassium also gives the ordinary
bromine spectrum.
   Bromide of Copper gives a .saturated solution of a deep green
colour j it transmits the spectrum represented in fig. 17, which

                  each constituent of which is coloured.             421
is precisely simi Jar to that of bromine, except that the red ray is
gradually cut off/ as with other copper salts.         On diluting this
solution a complete change of colour ensues ; it acquires the blue
colour and the prismatic appearance of a compound of oxide of
copper with a colourless acid, as represented in fig. 9.
     Oocybromide of Iron is intensely red.      It gives the same pris
matic spectrum as bromine-water does.
 !,. , t  -,  ...  ' .         Chlorides.     . .
     Chlorine gas absorbs the more refrangible rays ; chlorine-water,
though yellow, cannot be obtained strong enough, even at a tem
perature of nearly 0° C, to show any very decided effect on the
spectrum ; nothing, in fact, beyond a diminution in the inten
sity of the violet.     Yet in some of its compounds its absorbent
power is well marked.
     Terchloride of Gold gives a yellow solution, and absorbs more
blue than the yellowish-green nitrate does. Compare figs. 19
and 15.        The acid hydrochlorate of this salt is indistinguishable
from it by the prism, though to the unaided eye it appears of a
Somewhat purer yellow.
     Bichloride of Platinum transmits scarcely any rays more refran
gible than b, unless the stratum be very thin, when a little blue
and violet pass. See fig. 20.          The sulphate, fig. 16, admits
more rays, especially in the neighbourhood of F.
     Bichloride of Palladium is red : it transmits the red and orange
rays freely, the yellow and green but partially, and the blue only
where the stratum is very thin.        See fig. 23.
     Chloride of Copper in saturated aqueous solution is green : it
shows the absorption of the red ray due to the metal ; but the
rays more refrangible than b are likewise absorbed.          See fig. 21.
If water be added to this solution, it suffers the same change as
the green bromide does, becoming blue, and admitting all the
more refrangible rays, like any ordinary salt of copper.
     Sesquichloride of Iron gives a solution of a reddish-orange
colour when concentrated, and the prismatic appearance of fig. 8.
If water be added, it becomes more yellow in colour, and admits
the same rays as the nitrate does. See fig. 4.         Of course in this
and similar cases it will be understood that the light is made to
pass through the same amount of salt, whether it be diffused
through much or little water ; a circumstance that in ordinary
cases makes no difference in the absorption or transmission of rays.
      Chloride of Nickel, when dissolved in very little water, is of a
yellowish-green.       It then absorbs, not only the red ray, as nickel
salts always do, but nearly all the light beyond F besides. When
more water is added it becomes of a bluish-green, and shows the
absorption due to the metal alone.        See figs. 11 and 10.

422        Dr. Gladstone    on the Colour  of Salts in Solution.
    Chloride   of Cobalt also varies in colour according to the state
of dilution.     The addition of water increases the transmissibility
of both the yellow and the violet rays.        See fig. 12.
                                 Iodides.
    Iodine-water is too weak to show much absorption when placed
in my hollow wedge, but an alcoholic solution of iodine gives the
spectrum represented in fig. 14.
    Iodide of Gold and Potassium gives a prismatic appearance
resembling that of iodine.        The remark made in respect to the
terbromide of gold applies in this case also.
    Iodide of Platinum and Potassium is of an intense red, and
presents much the same prismatic appearance as the gold-salt ;
but while the light near F is wholly absorbed, it transmits some
blue and more violet, which certainly iodine itself does not. See
fig. 22.
    Iodide of Palladium and Potassium is also intensely red, and
resembles the corresponding platinum salt, except that the violet
is not transmitted so freely as the blue.
    Sesqui-iodide of Iron is of a deep red colour, and gives a spec
trum resembling that of iodine.
    Iodide of Nickel, when dissolved in a little water, is of a dark
 green, and affords a spectrum closely resembling that of iodine,
 except that the red ray is gradually absorbed by the metal. See
fig. 18. When water is added to this, the same amount of salt
 transmits more and more blue, and assumes the appearance of
 fig. 10, a compound of nickel with a colourless acid.
     Iodide of Cobalt, in saturated solution, is of a dark green, pass
ing into a very deep red as the stratum increases.            On dilution
 it becomes pinker.
                                Double Salts.
     When the two bases in        a double   salt are both coloured,      a
 similar result is obtained.
      Double Chloride  of Copper and Platinum is    a definite salt, form
 ing green crystals.      A  saturated solution  of these gives the spec
 trum represented in fig. 24 ; but on addition of water, the same
 amount of salt transmits a somewhat broader band of green, and
 more blue, giving then the appearance of fig. 20, with the red
 ray gradually absorbed.        This remarkable compound therefore
 shows, when in strong aqueous solution, the absorption due to
 each of its three constituents, — copper, platinum, and chlorine,
 see figs. 20 and 21 ; though, on dilution, the absorption due to
 chlorine is somewhat modified, as in the case of the uncombined
 copper-salt.

retains its specific absorbent power when in combination.            Two
of tbe above-described cases, however, are slightly anomalous — ¦
the chromate of chromium, and the double iodide of platinum
and potassium; and these are not the only, nor indeed the
greatest exceptions, for the ferric ferrocyanide dissolved in oxalic
acid transmits blue rays in great abundance, which are absorbed
both by ordinary ferrocyanides and ferric salts.             It must be
borne in mind that the statement,
                                          " all the compounds of a par
ticular base or acid, when dissolved in water, have the same effect
on the rays of light," is not universally true, even when a coloured
base is combined with a colourless acid; and hence we might
anticipate, what actual observation has shown to be the case,
that variations would sometimes occur when both the acid and
base are coloured.       It may be therefore laid down as a general,
though not an invariable law, that when an acid and a base com
bine, each of which has a different influence on the rays of light,
a solution of the resulting salt will transmit only those rays which
are not absorbed by either, or in other words, which are transmitted
by both.
XLIX.      On  the  Effect of Heat   on the Colour   of Salts in Solution.
             By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.R.S. %c*
                               [With  a Plate.]
         a general rule, the solution of a salt has the same power
AS       of absorbing or transmitting the rays of light at all tem
peratures.      I am not acquainted with any instance of a dissolved
colourless salt which assumes a colour when the solution is either
heated or cooled ; nor does the converse seem ever to occur, —
a salt coloured at the ordinary temperature, which loses that
colour when heat is applied.         Nevertheless it is not rare to find
coloured salts, which,     when   dissolved    in water, vary in shade or
in tint according to the temperature.
    In some instances, heating the solution seems merely to inten
sify the colour. This is the case with the following red, orange,
yellow, and green salts : —
                   Meconate of iron —red.
                   Terbromide of gold — red.
                   Red nitrate of cerium.
                   Bichromate of potash — orange.
                   Ferrocyanide of potassium — yellow.
                   Molybdous chloride — green.
   More frequently a change takes place in the character as well
as in the intensity of the colour when the solution is heated.
The following cases have been observed.
                      * Communicated    by the Author.

424             Dr. Gladstone  on the  Effect of Heat
    Bichloride of platinum, while it becomes more intense in colour,
assumes also a redder tint.
    Protochloride of platinum, held in solution by hydrochloric
acid, changes also in the same way.
    Bichloride of palladium acts precisely as the platinum salt
 does under the influence of heat.
    Ferridcyanide of potassium gives a greenish solution, which,
when heated, alters in colour, and if not too dilute, assumes a
 distinctly red appearance.
    Polysulphide of potassium passes from yellow to a most in
tense red.
    Sesquichloride of iron passes from orange        to a deep and
almost pure red.
    Chloride of nickel passes from a bluish to a yellowish green.
    Iodide of nickel, when dissolved in a little water, gives a clear
 green solution, which, on the application of heat, becomes of a
 nondescript shade, that appears distinctly red by gas-light.
    Chloride of copper gives a green saturated solution, which on
 the addition of more water becomes blue.       If this blue solution
 be heated (unless too dilute), the green colour is restored.      On
 cooling, it again becomc^blue.
    Bromide of copper behaves in every respect like the chloride.
    Sulphocyanide of cobalt in a minimum of water, gives a mag
 nificent bluish purple colour, but on dilution it changes to the
 ordinary pink tint of cobalt salts in solution. If this be heated,
provided it is not too dilute, it will reassume the purple hue.
    Chloride of cobalt dissolves in water always of a pink, and in
absolute alcohol always of a blue colour, while in mixtures of al
 cohol and water it will assume an immediate tint.      By arranging
properly the proportions of the two solvents, a liquid may be
obtained which will show all the changes of an aqueous solution of
the sulphocyanide, passing from pink through purple to blue when
it is heated, and conversely, from blue to pink when it is cooled.
    In all these cases it is to be understood that the change of
colour lasts only as long as the heat continues.      No permanent
chemical change is effected ; and the original colour of the solu
tion returns in every instance as it cools.
    A glance at the above observations will suffice to show that
where the colour is not materially altered in character, it in
variably becomes more intense when heated, that is to say,
fewer rays are transmitted ; and when the light is analysed by a
prism, it is found that not in these only, but in every one of the
instances, rays are absorbed by the hot solution which were
transmitted by the same solution when cold.
    Yet a distinction must be made between two classes of action,
both of which influence the above observations,        and influence

                 on the Colour  of Salts in Solution.             425
them in the same direction.        In the last seven instances it is
more than probable that a temporary chemical change is effected
                                              I
in the liquid. In the preceding paper, have shown that the
chloride and bromide of copper, the chloride and iodide of nickel,
the sesquichloride of iron, and one or two other analogous salts,
give a saturated aqueous solution of a different colour to what is
presented by the same solution when more water is added ; and
that this change is due to the fact, that in the saturated solution
both the halogen and the metal exert their own absorbent power
on the rays during their passage through the liquid, while in the
dilute solution the metal alone influences the transmission of light.
That this phenomenon results from some difference of arrange
ment among the elements of the salt and water, scarcely admits
of a doubt; yet what that difference of arrangement may be is
not so easily determined.      This chemical change it is that is
affected by temperature, an increase of heat having the opposite
effect to an addition of water, and a diminution of heat having the
same effect as dilution.    Thus the light transmitted by a dilute
solution of chloride of copper at the ordinary temperature, when
analysed by a prism, shows the spectrum represented in Plate II.
fig. 9, but on heating the solution, an absorption due to chlorine
manifests itself, and the coloured band is reduced to the dimen
sions of fig. 21 : and similarly, the bromide of copper, if dilute and
cold, presents the ordinary prismatic appearance of copper salts,
fig. 9 ; but if the same liquid be heated, it assumes the green
colour and the modified spectrum of the saturated solution,
fig. 17, in which the bromine exerts its absorbent power.           In
each case the influence of the halogen disappears as soon as the
heat is withdrawn ; and that this is not confined to the range of
temperature above what we designate as ordinary, was proved by
exposing a green solution of chloride of copper to a freezing mix
ture, when it assumed a distinctly bluish tint.
    The case of the cobalt salts is evidently analogous : the dilute
 sulphocyanide of cobalt in water, or the chloride in aqueous al
 cohol, gives a prismatic appearance similar to, but not identical
 with, that represented in fig. 12; but when heated, additional
 dark spaces show themselves ; the more refrangible red and less
refrangible orange rays are wholly absorbed, and the more re
 frangible portion of the orange is allowed to penetrate but to a
 short distance, while a perfectly black line shows itself coincident
 with D, but somewhat broader.          In fact the hot cobalt salt
 gives precisely the same prismatic appearance as that given by
 smalt-blue glass, or by an alcoholic solution of cobalt, as figured
 in the plate annexed to my paper " On the Use of the Prism in
 Qualitative Analysis," in the Quarterly Journal of the Chemical
 Society, April 1857,

426        On   the      Effect of Heat on   the Colour    of Salts in Solution,
    No chemical change, however, appears to         be concerned in the
alteration of colour produced by heat in the other cases men
tioned above.       The elevation of temperature seems merely to
heighten    the  absorbent    power of the dissolved salt, so that the
light absorbed by a certain quantity of the heated solution is the
same as would have been absorbed by a larger quantity of the
same solution, if cold. This will fully account for the changes,
not merely in such salts as meconate of iron, where an increased
intensity of colour is all that is observed, but for those changes
which involve the character as well as the depth of the colour.
These latter substances are in fact more or less dichromatic,
that      is,
          they present different colours according to the quantity
of salt which the light has traversed before            reaches the eye;

and the reason of this will be apparent on glancing at the spec
trum of bichloride of platinum represented in fig. 20.               It will
be there seen that        thin stratum of the salt transmits all the rays

solution,       is
               solely  to  produce   the same  amount   of absorption as
would be produced at the ordinary temperature by                    thicker    a
stratum, or      stronger solution.

                                   Sir David Brewster, that the absorp

gas ;  or of the observations of Schcenbein and others, that several
solid substances, such as oxide of zinc, or gallate of iron, absorb,
when heated, rays that they transmit or reflect when cold.              The
above observations on dissolved salts give, therefore, results
which are perfectly in harmony with the little that was known
before about the effect of heat on the chromatic phaenomena
presented        by      other pure chemical substances.

L. A    Demonstration     of Sir W. R. Hamilton's    Theorem of the
   Isochronism of the      Circular Hodograph.     By Arthur Cat-

      tral force,  and let h denote, as usual, the double of the area
described in a unit of time ; let P be any point of the orbit, then
measuring off on the perpendicular let fall from the centre of
force 0 on the tangent at P to the orbit, a distance 0 Q equal
or proportional to h into the reciprocal of the perpendicular on
the tangent, the locus of Q is the hodograph, and the points
P, Q are corresponding points of the orbit and hodograph.
   It is easy to see that the hodograph is the polar reciprocal of
the orbit with respect to a circle having 0 for its centre, and
having its radius equal or proportional to v'A. And it follows
at once that Q is the pole with respect to this circle of the tan
gent at P to the orbit.
   In the particular case where the force varies inversely as the
square of the distance, the hodograph is a circle.        And if we
consider two elliptic orbits described about the same centre,
under the action of the same central force, and such that the
major axes are equal, then (as will be presently seen) the com
mon chord or radical axis of the two hodographs passes through
the centre of force.
   Imagine an orthotomic circle of the two hodographs (the
centre of this circle is of course on the common chord or radical
axis of the two hodographs), and consider the arcs intercepted
on the two hodographs respectively by the orthotomic circle;
then the theorem of the isochronism of the circular hodograph
is as follows, viz. the times of hodographic description of the
intercepted    arcs are equal ; in other words, the times of de
scription   in  the orbits, of the arcs which correspond to the
intercepted arcs of the hodographs, are equal.       It was remarked
by Sir W. R. Hamilton, that the theorem is in fact equivalent
to Lambert's theorem, that the time depends only on the chord
of the described arc and the sum of the two radius vectors.      And
this remark suggests a mode of investigation of the theorem.
Consider the intercepted arc of one of the hodographs : the tan
gents to the hodograph at the extremities of this arc are radii
of the orthotomic circle ; i. e. the corresponding arc of the orbit
is the arc cut off by the polar (in respect to the directrix circle
by which the hodograph is determined) of the centre of the
orthotomic circle ; the portion of this polar intercepted by the
orbit is the elliptic chord, and this elliptic chord and the sum of
the radius vectors at the two extremities of the elliptic chord,

LI.    Experimental and Theoretical Researches on the Figures of
    Equilibrium of a Liquid Mass withdrawn from the Action of
    Gravity. — Third Series.      By J. Plateau.
                           [Concluded from p. 22.]
§ 15.    TN     order to terminate that which relates to a note pro-
         A    duced at a distance and different from unison, we have
still to account for the facts stated in No. 10 of paragraph 3.
    We proceed to show from a theoretical point of view, that
these facts, with the exception of the last, depend upon a more
general principle, which may be thus enunciated : if the vibra
tions of the instrument are sufficiently energetic with respect to
those occasioned by the shock of the detached masses, and if at
the same time the interval between the two notes is not too
great, the note of the jet may be brought into unison with that
of the instrument. We may remark that these are the circum
stances cited in No. 10 of paragraph 3 ; for when the jet falls
upon a body which can only render a determinate note, such as
a diapason, and if we suppose for a moment, that the former
suffers no modification with respect to the number of detached
masses, then the vibrations due to the shock of these masses will
in general have a period different from that of the vibrations of the
body impinged upon, and hence the former can only be thus pro
 duced : every time a mass reaches the body, air is expelled from
between the two, and then returns in order to be expelled anew
 on the arrival of the following mass, and so on.       Now the sono
 rous waves thus produced are necessarily very feeble when com
 pared with those resulting from the vibrations of the body which
 receives the shocks ; besides this, the interval between the two
 tones can be diminished at pleasure by causing either the charge
 or the diameter of the orifice to vary.
     As the vibrations of the instrument — or, in the case under con
 sideration, those of the body receiving the shock — which are
 transmitted by the air to the vessel and to the liquid have not
 the same period as the passages of the contractions and expan
 sions due to the forces of figure, there is, as we have explained
  (§ 12), a varying conflict between the two kinds of action; but if the
 interval between the two notes is not too great, it is conceivable
 that the transformation of the jet — a phaenomenon susceptible of
 being influenced by extraneous causes* — may, under the action
  of vibrations, so lengthen or shorten the nascent contractions
  and expansions that the time of passage of each of the latter
  shall be precisely equal to the period of a vibration, and the
  two kinds of actions constantly in agreement      :  this point being
  attained, the note of the jet must necessarily    be  in unison with
                            * Second Series,

vibrations, and afterwards the transformation, thus modified from
its origin, ought to complete itself according to' the new manner.
   But this condition of the jet          is forced one, because the
                                               a
natural mode of transformation altered. Consequently, if from
                                    is
any cause the regular succession or transmission of the vibrations
becomes disturbed, the forces of figure ought immediately to pre
ponderate again, and the contractions and expansions to reassume
the length which corresponds to the free action of these ^-irjrt&s.

puts itself in unison with that of the body receiving the shock,
in conformity with the principle advanced at the commencement
of this paragraph.   Nevertheless, as may be concluded from the
enunciation in the No. in question, Savart docs not express
himself on this point in precise terms    he says merely that the
                                               ;
note of the body receiving the shock modifies that of the jet,
whose pitch    itchanges; but other experiments which wc shall
soon have to discuss permit us to attribute to these words the
meaning we have above given them.
  §  16. Lastly, No. 10 of paragraph        also informs us, that

us endeavour to explain these facts also.
   Let us suppose that the note natural to the jet has some        a
what lower pitch than that of the body receiving the sbock.    In
the case of exact unison, the number of impulses proceeding from
        II

number of vibrations made by the body in the same time ; hence
 the interval between two successive impulses would be equal to
 the duration of two of these vibrations : therefore, under the
 above supposition, the interval between two impulses will sur
pass by a little the duration of two vibrations, and if the reac
tion of these vibrations upon the nascent contractions and expan
sions is not sufficiently powerful to modify their length, and thus
occasiqu unison, the small excess in the duration of the intervals
in question will maintain itself. This being the case, let us set
out from the first impulse. This will cause the body to perform
a descending vibration, which will be followed by an ascending
one ; the second impulse will take place shortly after the com
mencement of a new descending vibration; the third will act
during the third descending vibration, but at a more ad
vanced phase of the same ; the fourth impulse will arrive at a
still somewhat more advanced phase of the fourth descending
vibration ; and so on until at length an impulse virtually coin
cides with the end of such a vibration.       Under the influence of
these repeated impulses, the amplitude of the vibrations of the
body will necessarily increase until the arrival of the impulse last
considered.    But again, in consequence of the small excess in
the interval between two impulses, the latter will next take place
during ascending vibrations, and at more and more advanced
phases of the same ; so that after a number of impulses equal to
that of the preceding, the body will again receive a shock at the
termination of a vibration.      Now this second group of impulses
will evidently destroy whatever the first has produced ; in other
words, it will gradually diminish the amplitude of the vibrations,
and conclude by annulling the same.       A third group of impulses
will revive these vibrations,  a  fourth will annul them again, and
so on indefinitely.    The note of the body which receives the shock
ought therefore to be alternately more and less intense ; on the
other hand, on account of the relative velocities of the body and
the detached masses, the note of the jet will be less intense when
the masses reach the body during its descending, than when they
strike it during its ascending vibrations ; hence it is seen that
the note of the jet is least when that of the body is most
intense, and vice versd.    This granted, if the vibrations of the
body acquire in their greatest amplitudes sufficient energy,
and if at the same time the relative velocity of the impulses
bacomes sufficiently small, the note of the jet may be entirely
disguised during the moments when that of the body is most
intense, and in its turn may reappear and again predominate
during the intermediate periods j consequently both notes will
be heard periodically.
    But if the body is only capable of performing vibrations of

434           M. J. Plateau  on Jets of Liquid under    the
small amplitude, and if it is held at a great distance from the
orifice, it may occur that the relative velocity of the impulses
always continues to be considerable ; so that the intensity of the
jet's note is sensibly uniform, whilst that of the body's, even
when greatest, is not able to overpower it.          The former will
 then always be perceptible, and consequently during the most
intense periods of the latter, both notes will be heard at the
 same time.     Without doubt it is thus that we must interpret
the words or even simultaneously, which are taken literally from
 Savart.
    § 17. Let us reconsider the case where a note in unison with
that of the jet is produced by an instrument.            If the latter,
instead of acting at a distance, is placed in contact with the
 sides of the vessel from which the jet issues, it is evident that
 the vibrations communicated to these sides and propagated in
 the liquid will be much more energetic, and consequently that
 the modifications of the jet will be much more developed ; more
 over, it is manifest that the small irregularities of which we have
 spoken in paragraph 10 may then be entirely effaced.         The con
 tents of No. 11 of paragraph 3, therefore, require no further
explanation.
     § 18. According to No. 12 of paragraph 3, another system of
 shorter and thinner ventral segments and nodes is now observ
 able in the axis of the jet from the lower extremity of the conti
 nuous part downwards, which system, as Savart remarks, is due
 to the spherules that accompany the masses.
    An apparent difficulty here presents itself. When the jet is
 protected from all vibratory action, its troubled part is free from
 ventral segments and nodes; it would appear, therefore, that
 under the sole action of the forces of figure, the masses arrive at
 the spherical form without executing sensible oscillations, and
 that oscillations of form take place solely in the cases where the
 forces of figure are activated by vibrations.    Now the production
 of the spherules cannot in any manner be influenced by the vibra
 tions ; for the latter only act directly at the contracted section,
 their effect below this section being limited to acquired velocities
  (§§ 6 and 8) which accelerate the development of the expansions
 and contractions, and the subsequent conversion of each of the
 latter into a thread.    The transformation of this thread, whence
 result the spherules, is effected solely by the forces of figure
 which are generated therein, as in every other sufficiently elon
 gated cylinder of liquid) nevertheless these spherules execute
 oscillations of form, as is proved by the appearance of ventral
 segments and nodes presented by their passage before the eye.
     In order to elucidate this point, let us attentively examine the
 circumstances relative to these spherules and to the large masses.

                    influence of Vibratory Motions*             485
The thread, we must remember*, generally divides itself inte
three parts, of which the extreme ones proceed to reunite them
selves respectively with the two large masses between which the
thread extended itself, whilst the intermediate part at the same
time contracts symmetrically above and below by expanding itself
horizontally, so as to form the spherule under consideration.     In
virtue of this simultaneity and symmetry of action, the small
portion of liquid in question attains the spherical form towards
which it tends ; but attaining this form with an acquired velo
city, it necessarily goes past the same in such a manner that its
vertical diameter becomes less, and its horizontal diameter greater, .
than that of the sphere of the same volume ; hence the oscilla
tions of form in the spherules and the consequent ventral seg
ments and nodes.                                                   :
   But the transformation of the large mass, suspended at the
end of the thread and becoming detached by the rupture of the
same, does not take place in exactly the same manner; in fact,
an instant before this separation the mass in question was already
set free at its lower part by the rupture of the thread between it
and the preceding mass; here, therefore, the ruptures below and
above the mass, and consequently the two contractions which
tend to flatten the same in a vertical direction, are not simul
taneous.    Moreover, as each of these contractions must be fol
lowed by an elongation, neither do the latter take place simulta
neously ; and the same remarks apply of course to the subsequent
contractions and elongations.        Hence each contraction of the
bottom of the mass will take place wholly or partially during an
elongation of the top, and vice versa ; but the first tend to in
crease, the second to diminish the horizontal diameter of the
mass, so that their effects upon this diameter will more or less
destroy   one another ; and if there is no vibratory influence,
which, by the increased velocity which it imparts to the trans
formation, carries the diameter in question beyond that of the
sphere, and thus determines an excess of pressure at the equator
of the mass, this diameter ought to vary but little, and conse
quently a system of ventral segments and nodes will not be ob
servable in the troubled part of the jet. We see then, that, even
under the sole action of the forces of figure, the masses which
detach themselves at the extremity of the continuous part are
necessarily the seat of oscillations of form ; these oscillations,
however, can only be well developed in a vertical direction. We
committed a slight error, therefore, when in paragraph 69 of
the Second Series we asserted that, after becoming detached,
 the masses immediately formed themselves into spheres.

  loped expansion and contraction              for;         evident, that, on
                                                             it   is
  passing from one side of the limit of stability to the other, there
is    no sudden transition from instability to an absolute stability.
  On leaving this limit the stability must at first be very feeble,
  since  it
         )
              sets out from zero; consequently            at    little distance
                                                                          a
  within this limit        deformation, artificially imparted to the cy
                             a
  linder, cannot, unless the same be small, become spontaneously
  effaced.   :   if,
                  on the contrary,           considerable,
                                            it    is              will progress
                                                                              it
  spontaneously,      and will  bring  about     the   disunion   of the mass.
  The demonstration just recalled, therefore,           cannot  be  appealed to
  when the nascent contractions and expansions of the jet of liquid
  are formed         energetic vibrations.
                       by                        In this case,      the sum    if                     of
  the lengths of one of these expansions and of one of these con
 tractions, or what         the same,
                                 is         the length of
                                             if                   division    a                  is   a
 little less than the limit of stability, the transformation may
 commence in this abnormal manner                 and the more intense the
                                                       ;
 vibrations, the more the corresponding note for which the possi
 bility of the phsenomenon exists will be elevated above the prin
 cipal note.
      If the foreign note has lower pitch than the principal one,
                                        a
 and thus tends to give to the nascent divisions length necessa        a
 rily greater than the limit of stability,           will encounter no such
                                                            it
 resistance as that just signalized within this limit, so that the
 possibility of the phenomenon will be much more extended                       in           ;
 fact,   we find  from   Savart's   experiments,     that  the  same     extends
 over an interval of more than an octave.
  • There       also another reason why the phsenomenon should be
                 is
 less limited below than above the principal note              in one and the
                                                                          :
 same sonorous instrument the amplitude of the vibrations gene
rally increases with the gravity of the note               now.   ;      evident  it    is
that the greater the amplitude of the transmitted vibrations, the
greater the excess of liquid which each descending vibration
tends to push into the jet in order to form               nascent expansion,
                                                                 a
and the greatey also the withdrawal of liquid which each ascend

                     influence  of Vibratory Motions,                      489
  ing vibration tends to produce in order to form a nascent con-
  traction. If, therefore, as the note of the instrument deviates from
  the principal one, either below or above, the length of the nas
  cent divisions which the vibrations tend to form becomes greater
  or less than that of the nascent division which the forces of figure
 tend, on their part, to produce ; and if an increasing conflict with
 the latter forces thence arises, on the other hand, below the prin
 cipal note, the vibrations act more and more energetically in
 order to cause the new mode of transformation to prevail, and
 this increased action must compensate more or less for the in
 creased conflict.
     We may here remark, that in the case of a note whose pitch
 is very low in comparison to that of the principal note, the new
 mode of transformation does not establish itself in the same
 manner as when the interval between the two notes is not great.
 In the latter case, indeed, in consequence of the small difference
 of length between the two kinds of nascent divisions, it is very
 probable that the action of the forces of figure becomes modified
 merely, and, as remarked in paragraph 15, lengthen or shorten,
 their nascent divisions so as to make them coincide with those
 which correspond to the vibrations ; but when the note of the
 instrument has a pitch so low that the length of the latter divi
 sions considerably surpasses that of the others, when, for example,
 the note of the instrument is an octave below the note of the jet,
 and the vibrations are sufficiently intense to impose their mode
 of transformation upon the jet, we must admit that the action
of the forces of figure is completely destroyed, so that there is no
longer a modification of the first mode which adapts itself to the
second, but an absolute substitution of the second for the first.
     § 23. Experiment fully confirms what has been above said
with respect to the variations of stability within, and in the
neighbourhood of the limit, in a cylinder of liquid adhering to
solid bases. A cylinder of oil was formed, and immersed hori
zontally in an alcoholic mixture, after being placed between two
discs* 31 millims. in diameter and 87 millims. apart; in this
cylinder, therefore, the ratio of the length to the diameter was
equal to 2-8, so that the figure was quite stable : this ratio, it
will be seen, deviates from the limit still more than the one
which, in the preceding paragraph, we found to belong to the
nascent divisions of a jet of water, which, by the action of a so
norous instrument, is brought to yield a note a fifth above its
principal one. In order to alter artificially the cylindrical form
of the mass, the tip of the small syringe was slowly moved several
times above the figure, each time starting from one of the discs
    * These discs were retained in position by a system similar to that repre
sented in fig. 27 of the Second Series.

  imparted to this mass by the preceding contraction will have been
  absolutely compensated by that of the quantities of motion in an
  opposite direction, imparted to it by the contraction which fol
  lows, and hence that this same mass will leave the continuous
  part with the velocity which corresponds exactly to the general
  motion of translation. But it is also clear, that the compensation
  would no longer be complete if at their origin the two contrac
  tions differed from each other ;       if,
                                      for example, they were unequal
  in length. Since when the divisions, and hence also the con
  tractions, are longer the time of transformation          shorter*,
                                                               is              it
  follows that the longer of the two contractions in question will
  develope itself more rapidly than the other        and as, in conse
                                                         ;
  quence of its greater length,        encloses more liquid,
                                         it                          willit
  transfer to the expansion more particles of liquid with greater
  velocities, and consequently      greater quantity of motion.
                                     a                                If
  this same contraction, therefore, follows the expansion, the latter
  will leave the continuous part as detached mass with an excess
                                          a
  of velocity but
            ;        ifthe contraction in question        that in front,
                                                              is
 the mass will depart from the continuous portion with            defect a
 of velocity.    Thus small differences in the lengths of the nascent
 contractions will occasion small inequalities in the velocities of
 the successively detached- masses     on this account the masses will
                                         ;
 necessarily describe parabola? of unequal amplitudes, and hence
 they will become dispersed in       vertical plane so as to form
                                     a                                         a
 sheaf.
     This explanation assumes that the disturbing causes produce
 no irregularities in the contractions in directions perpendicular
 to the axis of the jet and, in fact, from the experiment of para
                          ;
 graph 23, we must conclude that the contractions and expan
 sions tend, with great force, to symmetrize themselves with respect
to the axis, and hence that irregularities in directions normal to
the axis cannot long exist.
     According to this explanation, too,        evident that there are
                                               it   is
two extreme limits for which the dispersion         zero, viz. when the
                                                         is
jet descends and ascends vertically, for in these two cases all the
detached masses describe one and the same rectilineal trajectory              fj

       a                                       it true, becomes dispersed

if then   we pass from the first to the second limit, by causing the
direction according to which the jet issues to vary by degrees,
the sheaf will not begin to manifest itself distinctly until a cer
tain angle between this direction and the descending vertical line
is attained, and it will cease to be very apparent beyond another
determinate angle.        Further, as long as the jet issues in ob
liquely descending directions, and even in a horizontal direction,
it is evident that at the extremity of the continuous portion —
which portion is generally tolerably long — its direction will be
already too near the vertical for the sheaf to manifest itself di
 stinctly, so that the first direction at which the sheaf will com
mence to be visible will be an obliquely ascending one. All these
 conclusions agree with the facts of the No. under discussion.
     As will be seen, we admit that the inequalities between the
nascent contractions do not depend upon the direction according
 to which the jet issues ; and, in fact, there is no plausible reason
 for attributing these inequalities to the ascending obliquity of
 the jet.   In treating of vertically descending jets, these inequal
 ities were not mentioned, because in such cases they cannot
 occasion any phenomena of a peculiar kind ; their only effect,
 then, is to augment a little in the axis of the jet the inexacti
 tude of the superposition of the individual systems of ventral
 segments and nodes, and thus they merely constitute an influ
 ence to be added to those mentioned in paragraph 10.             The
nature of the disturbances which produce the inequalities in
 question, it would no doubt be rather difficult to discover ; but
whatever it may be, the dispersion of the discontinuous part in
jets issuing at a suitable angle reveals to us the presence of these
causes.
     § 26. A jet being allowed to issue under an angle such as to
 cause the sheaf to be well formed, let us now conceive it to be
 submitted to the influence of a sonorous instrument. The note
 which will most shorten the continuous part will again evidently
be that whose vibrations succeed each other at the same intervals
as the passages at the contracted section of the expansions and
contractions due to the forces of figure (§§ 5 and 12).           But
these vibrations being perfectly regular and isochronous, will, if
sufficiently intense, prevent the disturbing causes from modifying
the nascent contractions ; in other words, when activating the
transformation they will impart to the same their own regularity,
 so that the nascent contractions will have the same length, and
thus all the detached masses will describe precisely the same tra
jectory (§ 25) : under the influence of the note, therefore, the
 sheaf ought to disappear, and the whole ought to reduce itself
to   a single jet presenting   a perfectly regular system of ventral
 segments and' nodes.

446           M. J. Plateau   on Jets of Liquid   under the
the vibrations, must be shortened.       We may assume, therefore,
that the favoured contractions, although from their origin more
attenuated than those in conflict, contain, nevertheless, more
liquid than the latter because of their greater length ; and since,
being at once longer, and activated by the vibrations, they arrive
more rapidly at their rupture, it is evident that they will transfer
to the expansions more matter with greater velocity, and hence
•also a greater quantity of motion.        All the expansions there
fore will be in the condition analysed in paragraph 25, and con
sequently some of the detached masses on leaving the continuous
part will have a small excess, and others a small defect of velo
city. But here, inasmuch as the vibrations impart their regu
larity to the phsenomena, they render all the favoured contrac
tions identical at their origin, and similarly all the contractions
in conflict identical amongst themselves ; so that all the masses
formed from the expansions which, during the course of the con
tinuous part, had a favoured contraction in the rear, will leave
that part with the same excess of velocity, and hence describe
the same trajectory ; and all the detached masses which result
from the expansions which were preceded by the favoured con
 tractions, when traversing the continuous part, will leave the
latter with the same defect of velocity, and consequently describe
 another unique trajectory different from the former.       Under the
influence of the octave below the principal note, therefore, the
 sheaf should be replaced by two separate jets.
    Nevertheless, it would not be impossible for the note under
 consideration to cause the sheaf to disappear ; in fact, this note
 having already a very low pitch — at least with respect to the jet
 upon which    I operated — its vibrations have a large amplitude,
 and they may act (§ 22) with sufficient energy to prevent the
 formation of the contractions in conflict, and thus leave only
 those divisions in the jet which they themselves tend to produce,
 in which case all the detached masses would necessarily have the
 same normal velocity.
     Let us examine, in the second place, the influence of the fifth
 below the preceding note, or in other words, of the second fifth
 below the principal note.        The vibrations of this note being
 three times less rapid than those of the principal note, we easily
 conclude that each of the divisions which they themselves tend
 to determine in the jet comprise exactly three of the divisions
 due to the forces of figure.      It is clear, too, that of the three
 expansions contained in this group of divisions, the last has
 behind it a favoured contraction, and before it a contraction in
 conflict ; that the first, on the contrary, is preceded by a favoured
 contraction and followed by one in conflict ; and lastly, that the
 intermediate one is situated between two contractions in conflict

                    influence   of Vibratory Motions.
which are identical with each other at their respective origins
According to this, the quantities of motion will necessarily dis
tribute themselves amongst the detached masses proceeding from
these three divisions in such a manner that the last, the firs^
and the intermediate one will leave the continuous part with
velocities respectively superior, inferior, and equal to the normal
velocity ; and as, in consequence of the perfect regularity of the
vibrations, exactly the same things will take place in each of the
groups of three divisions, there can only be three different velo
cities in the discontinuous part.       Hence if the action of the
vibrations does not entirely efface that which, before their influ*
ence, the forces of figure exercised freely, the sheaf will resolve
itself into three distinct jets ; and      if,
                                         on the contrary, the action
of forces of figure   iscompletely subordinated — which ought to
occur more easily here than in the case of the octave below the
principal note, in consequence of the still greater amplitude of the
vibrations — there will, as we have shown above, be but one jet.
    As to the separation into two jets, which, according to the
experiments, also occurs under the influence of the note under
consideration, it  may be thus accounted for. When the action
of the vibrations preponderates, and thus only the divisions which

have a   great length, since each occupies the place of three of the
divisions which the forces of figure would originate but we      ;
know* that every liquid figure, one dimension of which          con  is
siderable with respect to the two others, tends to divide itself
into detached masses we may assume, therefore, that new forces

of figure develope themselves in the divisions in question, pro
vided the acquired transversal velocities are not sufficiently great
to oppose the same, and that these new forces divide each of the
 divisions into two new ones          by

evidently in conflict, the reasoning employed with respect to the
octave below the principal note shows that two jets ought to be
obtained.
   We may here remark, that the abnormal forces of figure just
considered cannot form more than one contraction in each large
division for

of the sonorous instrument but for this to be possible,

       Let us proceed, in the third place, to the second octave below

                                                                  would be

  that each    of the two expansions comprised between! these three
  contractions would receive at its two sides unequal quantities of
  motion; and finally, that the differences; would he- greater for
 the extreme expansions, each of which would be situated .between
a    favoured and opposed contraction.        But, on the, one hand, the

 that their action ought always to efface that of the forces of
 figure and, on the other hand, the divisions thus formed being
          ;
 very long,    it   isalso evident from what has been above said, that
 new forces of figure must arise to cause their subdivision. Again,
 in consequence of the resistance, also above indicated, this sub
 division can at most give three parts, which, in consequence of
 the distribution of the conflicts and concurrences, and the re
 gularity imparted          the vibrations, will convert the sheaf into
                           by
 three jets only.
     We have still to consider, in the fourth place, the action of
the notes included between the octave below the principal note
 and the fifth below the former, as well as those between this fifth
 and the second octave below the principal note.          For these. notes
there     is no longer any simple relation between the divisions
which would result respectively from the vibrations alone and
from the forces of figure alone but      ;     will without difficulty be

of the vibrations does not entirely efface that of the forces of
figure, the divisions due to these forces will be lengthened or
shortened      alittle so as to permit the absolute concurrence of the
two kinds of action at the limits which separate the successive
systems of three of these divisions, and hence also the re-esta

450           M. Jv Plateau   on Jets   of Liquid under     the
tions, unsymmetrically distributed inequalities of length.            But,
everything    else being  the same,    inasmuch     as  the  action of the
vibrations upon the jet diminishes        with  their  amplitude,   we can
conceive that above the octave below the principal note this action
was probably simply insufficient ; and that if it had been possible,
by a more immediate transmission, or by a better disposition of
the system of the orifice, to augment the amplitude of the commu
nicated vibrations, the three notes above signalized would pro
bably have no longer been inactive with respect to the sheaf.
This will be evident if we notice that the vibrations act upon jets
issuing obliquely in the same manner as upon those descending
vertically, and if we remember that in Savart's experiments,
mentioned in No. 14 of paragraph 3, and explained in the para
graphs 21 and 22, — which experiments were arranged so as to
give a great intensity to the communicated vibrations — the mode
of transformation imparted by the vibrations completely replaced
that of the forces of figure in cases even where the notes extended
to a fifth above the principal note.
    I have mentioned the possible influence of a change in the
nature of the orifice, because that employed in my experiments
was made in a very thin plate*, and hence this plate perhaps
vibrated with difficulty in unison with those notes which had
not a low pitch.
    § 30. To complete our theoretical examination of the influ
ence of vibrations upon jets of liquid, we have now merely to
show the connexion between theory and experiment with refer
ence to the facts of No. 17 in paragraph 3.
    Since the principal note is also that for which the period of a
vibration is equal to that of the passage of a contraction or an
expansion at the contracted section (§§ 5, 12, and 26), and
since, according to experiment, the number of vibrations corre
sponding to this note diminishes as the direction according to
which the jet issues deviates more from the descending vertical,
the number of nascent contractions and expansions, and hence
the number of nascent divisions, passing the contracted section
in a given time must also diminish.             But as the velocity of
efflux is sensibly independent     of the  direction   according to which
it takes place, the number of divisions generated in a given time
cannot diminish notably except by an augmentation in the length
of these nascent divisions ; thus under the same charge and with
the same orifice the nascent divisions become elongated as the
direction of efflux deviates more from the descending vertical.
This result may be immediately deduced from the hypothesis in
paragraph 2 ; for whilst, on the one hand, a jet descending ver
tically tends to become thinner in consequence of the accelera-
          * It was only about half a millimetre in thickness.

                     influence  of Vibratory Motions.                   461
tion due to gravity, on the other hand, a vertically ascending jet
tends to become thicker in consequence of the retardation due
to the same cause ; and since, according to the hypothesis in
question, and the therein assumed dependence between the divi
sions, the thinning of the vertically descending jet determines a
diminution in the length of the nascent divisions, the thickening
of the vertically ascending jet ought, for the same reason, to de
termine an increase in the length of the nascent divisions ;
whence it follows, that as the direction of efflux passes gradually
from the first to the second of these cases, the nascent divisions
will become elongated by degrees.
    As may be seen from the No. under discussion,                  between
the descending vertical and the horizontal direction of the jet
the depression of its principal note is inconsiderable, but becomes
greater between the latter and the vertically ascending direction,
which necessitates the same relations between the elongations of
the nascent divisions.        This fact flows also from the hypothesis
of paragraph 2 ; for the vertically ascending jet, in consequence
of the gradual destruction of the velocity of the liquid, has a
greater tendency to become thick (especially at its upper extre
mity), than has the vertically descending jet to become thin at
an equal distance from the contracted section ; hence, in virtue
of the same mutual dependence of the divisions, when the jet,
issuing first in a horizontal direction, is made to approach the
ascending vertical, the successive increments in the length of the
nascent divisions ought to be much greater than when the jet,
starting from the vertically descending, gradually approaches the
horizontal direction.
    Observed facts being thus connected in a necessary manner
with the hypothesis of paragraph 2, serve reciprocally to confirm
 the latter; and it was to these facts that we alluded when, in
 paragraph 2, we intimated that the hypothesis in question was
 supported by experimental results.
     § 31. In concluding the Second Series, we announced that in
 the present one, after having completed that which relates to jets
 of liquid, we should treat of the other figures of equilibrium
 besides the sphere and the cylinder; but, in order to avoid ex
 tending our memoir too much, we have resolved to reserve this
 subject for future series*.

THEcovered       by the late Mr. Nicol, in many1 of the interesting
experiments    of  physical optics, are familiar to most who have
tried experiments on the polarization of light.      The theory of
the mode of action of this rhomb by one of the doubly refracted
rays undergoing total reflexion, had not however been published,
that   Iam aware of, before it appeared in my experimental trea-.
tise on Physical Optics, published in the autumn of last yWri
although    I had given that explanation to my friends for many
years past.     The explanation is as follows : — A ray of light en
tering  a face of calcareous crystal becomes separated Into two
rays polarized in planes at right angles to each other; and m
Nicol's rhomb one of these falls so obliquely upon a common
surface of the crystal and a' cement of Canada balsam as to be
totally reflected and thrown aside, whilst the other traverses the
film of cement, passes through the spar beyond           and /finallt     it,
emerges    from   the rhomb as      ray polarized in one! plane.

the Canada balsam, we have the law of SneUius if i is the angle
of emergence, t' the angle of incidence within the medium,

larger for blue, but less than this for red light.

therefore propose that the second prism shall be of glass, which
is much easier to work than calc-spar, and the best quality of
ealc-spar has sometimes been very scarce.
   In my descriptive and experimental treatise on Physical Optics,
p. 31,   have described another form of rhomb which
          I                                              had tried           I
many years ago,   with air in place of Canada balsam between   the
prisms, and those of much smaller angles than Nicol's rhomb, so
that   much broader beam of polarized light could be obtained.

I now propose that the prism nearest the eye shall be of glass,

furnish conveniently1 a broad beam of polarized light.            From
the nature of the double refraction, the angular separation of
the ordinary and extraordinary rays diminishes as they approach
 the optic axis^ and they coincide when in that direction ; and
 hence the incident and emergent beams, when both the prisms
 are of calc-spar and similar, subtend angles of only about 8° to 9°.
     When one, of the prisms is of glass, we have other properties
 to consider, and have different results as the glass or spar is turned
 towards the eye, when the rhomb is used as an analyser.          When
 the spar is cut along the optic axis, and the light is incident
 nearly perpendicular to the face so produced, the two rays coin

 the one for common plate glass ; a beam passing into a compound

  portion of two-thirds to the king and one-third to the Earl of
 Chester.     Upon the Conqueror's accession, the earldom was
 given to Hugh Lupus, his nephew ; but the property attached
 to it had diminished in value ; for it is recorded that the salt
 works at Middlewich and Nantwich, which under the Saxon rule
 had produced a rental of £16 per annum, had fallen into com
 plete disuse ; and that those at Nantwich, from which an annual
 income of £20 had been derived, were almost as much neglected,
 for out of eight salt-works which had formerly flourished at this
 latter place, one only was at that time in operation.         This period
 of depression was not, however, of long duration, for shortly
 afterwards a partial recovery had taken place, since the Nantwich
 salt-works are spoken of as being let to farm by the Crown at
 £10, the Middlewich at 25 shillings, and the Northwich at 35
 shillings per annum*.        It is thought probable that at this period
 the chief export of Cheshire salt was to Wales, for the Welsh
 gave to Nantwich the name of Hellath Wen, or the white salt-
 pit ; much export trade could not have been carried on, for very
 long after this date, the salt manufacture of Cheshire did not
 exceed the consumption of the county itself, and a few of its im
 mediately adjoining neighboursf.
    It is curious to observe how the importance of places decreases
 in course of time through the effect of influences, at first appa
 rently but slightly adverse, becoming under somewhat altered
 circumstances highly detrimental.           Nantwich throughout the
 whole of its early history held the first rank among the salt-
 producing towns; — there were situated the brine-pits which
 Henry III. stopped up in order to distress the Welsh by cutting
 off their supply of that necessary article of food ; and when this
 embargo upon the commercial activity of the town was with
 drawn, we find it far surpassing its former self in the energy of
 its undertakings.       This increasing prosperity and wealth con
 tinued until it reached a culminating point, from which it has
 ever since gradually but irretrievably descended.            It seems to
have attained its summit in the time of Henry VIII., for
 Leland states that at that time Nantwich contained 300 salt
works : their reduction then began, and in the early part of the
reign of Queen Elizabeth their number had decreased to 216,
whilst in 1624 they had dwindled nearly to 150.              The cause of
this declension was want of water-carriage, Nantwich being un
fortunately situated beyond that point of the Weaver up to which
it was navigable; a more advantageous locality was therefore
sought for; the banks of the river were examined, and other
springs found in more favoured situations, possessing moreover,

in addition to superiority of position, the no less important ad
vantage of greater concentration.          From the date of that dis
covery the salt manufacture          in Nantwich steadily declined,
although the inhabitants still repaired annually on Ascension
day to the "Old Biat," their most ancient salt-pit, and adorning
it with flowers, ribands, and green boughs, they danced round
it to their rustic music, and sung a hymn of thanksgiving for
the blessing of the brine.        This old custom was discontinued
about the middle of the last century, for the blessing which they
celebrated was fast leaving them.         In 1810* one salt-work only
existed in the town, and that is now, I am told, done entirely
away with and the pit closed.          But while Nantwich has been
thus descending in the scale, Middlewich and Northwich have
been increasing in importance; and along the lines of water
communication, the rivers "Weaver and the Grand Trunk Canal
which runs parallel with the river Wheelock, other places have
sprung up from time to time.            Of these the most important
appear to be, — Winsford on the Weaver considerably below Nant
wich, Marston and Winnington on the same stream in the im
mediate neighbourhood of Northwich, and Anderton somewhat
nearer the river's mouth ; whilst on the Wheelock, in the vicinity
of Sandbach, several works of great consequence have been esta
blished. A few statistics will show the immense increase which
this branch of manufacture has undergone within a comparatively
short period.     Within the ten years from 1800 to 1810 the
amount of salt produced in Northwich is said to have doubled,
and the annual average of white or manufactured salt sent down
the Weaver from Winsford and Northwich during that period was
                f
139,317 tons J this appears to have been the entire amount
shipped on the Weaver, and is therefore comparable with the
                                 J
total quantity of white salt (as distinguished from rock-salt)
which was carried down that river in the year 1832, which
amounted to 383,669 tons, and which by the year ending
April 5, 1856, had increased to 709,514 tons. With this, other
accounts agree ; for Lyson states that in 1805-1806 the total
annual produce of the Cheshire brine-pits, those of Nantwich and
Frodsham excepted, was 16,590 tons ; whilst at the present time,
 single manufacturers, such as Mr. Blackwell of Wheelock, and
 Messrs. Kay of Winsford, produce respectively 70,000 tons, and
from 50,000 to 60,000 tons of salt per annum.
    The salt which is now produced in Cheshire is made, under     I
stand, exclusively from natural brine-springs ; but it has formerly
at various times been obtained by dissolving rock-salt in water

and evaporating the dear solution.        The principal varieties ma
nufactured are three : the salt of coarsest grain, or bav-salt; that
of the finest grain, to which the naTue of table-salt is applied;
and an intermediate variety, which is called common salt.' The
latter is made in the largest quantity, and forms the principal
part of the vast export of Cheshire.       More than three-fourths of
the total amount of salt produced is used for foreign consump
tion ; and of the remaining fourth, a considerable portion is em
ployed in the supply of the British fisheries.        It has, however,
only attained its reputation afrer a somewhat severe struggle
with foreign competitors; for in the year 1810, Mr. Henry*
found it necessary to set forth an apology for British salt as
an agent in curing provisions in no way inferior to that pre
pared from sea-water by evaporation on the shores of the Medi
terranean, and to deprecate the folly of Great Britain in expend
ing large sums of money in the purchase of an article, which
she possessed the means, beyond almost any other country in
Europe, of drawing from her own internal resources.               Fortu
nately these remonstrances were not addressed in vain, and this
country soon ceased to neglect her native produce, and to import
that from abroad which she had in such abundance and of such
excellent quality at home.
    The great means, however, of extending the salt trade in this
country, has been the gradual improvement in the mode of raising
and evaporating the brine.       Originally, in the early days ef the
manufacture, the method of obtaining salt from the brine by
evaporation was unknown ; and its preparation consisted only in
pouring the brine upon burning branches of oak and hazel, from
the ashes of which the deposited salt was afterwards collected.
At length, however, the plan of evaporation was devised ; but for
a long time wood was the only fuel, of which such immense quan
tities were consumed at the salt-works in Droitwich in the time
of Camden, that he represents Feckenham Forest and the neigh
bouring woods as becoming perceptibly thinner and thinner day
by day.     This havoc seems to have been continued notwith
standing until the middle of the seventeenth century, when the
gradual introduction of coal superseded the more primitive kind
of fuel f- In the methods adopted in raising the brine, great alter
ation also has taken place in the lapse of time ; at Northwich, in
Camden's time, a pit existed which furnished an abundant supply,
but the way in which it was brought to the surface was crude in
the extreme : the pit was provided with stairs, by means of which
men descended with leathern buckets; these they filled with the
water, and then ascending emptied their contents into troughs,

which served as reservoirs for the wich-houses*.            From manual
labour they passed      to the  employment   of horses  for this purpose ;
water-power and windmills were subsequently used ; but all have
been superseded of late years by the superior efficiency of the
steam-engine.       The methods of evaporation have also undergone
vast extension    and  improvement.       In early times this process was
conducted in small leaden vessels, six of which they had in every
house in Nantwich, and the salt was removed by women with little
wooden rakes, placed in baskets, and drained f.          These six leaden
pans were afterwards exchanged for four iron ones, about 6
inches in depth and of a surface of about a square yard, capable
of holding the same contents as the original leaden vessels. The
limited extent of the operations thus conducted diminishes our
wonder at the great proportion of wich-houses existing at these
places during the middle ages, and so far surpassing the number
in operation at the present day. Even so recently as a century
ago, the largest pans at Northwich were only 20 feet long by 9
or 10 broad ; whilst those employed forty years since had a super
ficies of 600, 800 and 1000 feet, with a depth of from 16 to 18
inches.      The area of the pans has now, I suppose, almost reached
                            I
its limit ; some which saw at Mr. Blackwell's works at Wheelock
having a length of 70 feet and a width of 23 feet, making
 1610 feet of surface.        The heat is generally applied directly by
 the flue of from one to three furnaces, placed at one extremity
 of the pan, but in the works of Messrs. Kay of Winsford,                 I
 found part of the evaporation conducted upon a different prin
 ciple : a small iron pan, heated by a furnace in the ordinary way,
 is made to communicate by a narrow channel, with a brick- or
 clay-lined basin ; this again is in connexion with others of the
 same description disposed around a centre, and lastly, one is
  arrived at immediately adjoining the first-mentioned iron pan ;
 the brine is here by a very simple kind of pump transferred to
 the heated iron vessel, by which means the level of the liquid in
  the brick basins is kept constantly below that in the original
  starting-place, and thus a continual circulation of the brine is
  maintained.
      In the preparation of salt from brine, various substances have
 been at different times added from the idea of improving the qua
  lity, of the product. Untd recent times it was thought, that during
  the evaporation of an aqueous solution of chloride of sodium, hy
  drochloric acid was expelled, and soda formed: this doubtless arose
  from, the decomposition of the chloride of magnesium contained
  in the brine with which the experiments were made, — an evolu
  tion of acid vapours having been probably observed during the

incipient drying of the salt.   In order to counteract this supposed
evil, acids were added,  and it  was imagined that the excellence of
the Dutch salt was due to a skilful admixture of whey which the
manufacturers were alleged to make with their brine during the
evaporation, which prevented the injurious effects of the free alkali.
Another very favourite class of adjuncts has always consisted of
substances which contain constituents possessed of the property
of coagulating upon the application of heat, which clarify a liquid
by entangling all suspended particles of solid matter in the meshes
of their coagulum, and carry them with it as it rises to the sur
face.    Those substances which contain albuminous or gelatinous
matters are peculiarly adapted for this purpose, and are constantly
used in a variety of manufactures for the attainment of this end.
Blood, white of egg, glue and cows' or calves' feet have long been
used in this way in salt-making.      In 1670 the Nantwich salt-
makers are described as mixing twenty gallons of brine with two
quarts of blood, and adding about two quarts of this clarifying
liquid to a pan which held 360 quarts of brine.        In 1810 this
process  was still adopted   in some of  the Cheshire  works, but I
am not aware that it is ever used at the present day.     At Droit-
wich the use of white of egg seems to have prevailed.       Various
vegetable infusions, still containing albumen, as linseed mucilage
and ale, were, in the early days of the manufacture, in great re
                 I
pute, but have, believe, now fallen almost entirely into disuse.
   In order to prevent that most unpleasant circumstance attend
ant upon the evaporation of all concentrated saline solutions, — the
formation of a pellicle upon the surface of the liquid, which gra
dually becomes a thick layer of salt, and seriously impedes eva
poration — another class of bodies are mixed with the brine ; these
are oils or butter, which, spreading over the whole area, by a
peculiar molecular action prevent the formation of any pellicle,
or " setting over
                  " of the pan, as the workmen term        it,
                                                            and pre
serve that open surface which    ismost favourable to evaporation.
The action of finely-powdered resin in effecting this      is perfectly
magical,   the introduction of  a very  few  grains  being  quite suffi
cient instantly to clear the surface      of the  largest pan, and to
prevent any recurrence of the formation of the pellicle.           This
substance was also formerly thought to perform another function,
viz. the production of  a salt of finer grain;   wheat-flour was also
believed to exert the same action, whilst alum was added in order
to facilitate the formation of larger crystals   ;  butI   believeit   is
now found that the regulation of the degree of heat employed in
the evaporation will influence the size of the crystals with the
utmost nicety, and that attention to that circumstance alone           is
sufficient to produce all the varieties which are found in the
market.      In Holland's 'General View of the Agriculture of

  every one.     The existence of this substance appears to have first
  evidenced itself   by  the saline springs which at various places rose
  to the surface ;   and the majority of these spontaneous appear
  ances seem to have occurred in the immediate vicinity of the
  course of the river Weaver, and of the lesser stream, the
  Wheelock.      The former of these rises in the south-west portion
  of the county, and after running south for some miles, turns at
  Audlem to the north, passes Nantwich, and after some distance,
-
  Winsford ;    receives the Wheelock about Northwich, and passing
  Marston and Anderton, proceeds to the Mersey. The Wheelock
  rises in the south-east part of Cheshire, and passing the vil

                                               by
  with the Weaver. Along the banks of these streams continual           a

  in shafts allowing the admission of freshwater springs, and                     a
  slight distance from the convenience of water-carriage are reasons
  quite sufficient for the transfer of the manufacture from one
  place to another.       Causes such as these probably led to the

Mr. Johnson 1'lctcher ; the places selected in this instance were
Andcrton and Murston; proceeding in the south-easterly direc
tion, a specimen was chosen from the active department of .WjuSf
ford, in the central district, and Messrs. Kay and Son furnished
me with the brine, which they employed; whilst in the. extreme
south-east, Mr. Bluckwcll provided me with saj^esJFrgm the

   The depth at which the brine is found, and the, level to which
 it rises, vary very much at different plaees.         It appears that it
 is generally necessary to sink from thirty to fifty yards, in
 some eases run to a depth of eighty yards, before the spring is
 arrived at; the water then rites in the shaft to within from
 twenty to ten yards of the top, sometimes even to the surface.
 The general level of the brine in the pits             is,
                                                       however, far below

 the different seasons of the year; with this view analyses were
made in every instance of separate specimens taken respectively
in January and August, and, as              I  had already found in the
 case alluded to, no difference worthy of note existed between
them.

nation of these brines, are precisely those described in the former

 bubbles*   of chlorine;   this element was therefore determined by
 the method recommended by Fehling*, which depends upbn the
"fact, that if a solution of chloride of Sodium containing a small
 amount of bromide be insufficiently precipitated by nitrate of
 silver, the precipitate nevertheless contains all the bromine pre
 sent; the bromine in the mixed precipitate of chloride and bro
 mide of' silver is then determined by the passage of chlorine over
 the fused mass in the usual way.             The results yielded by this
¦process,  which   were   carefully  and   frequently   repeated upon very
 different quantities of brine, agreed among themselves in the
 closest manner.        The existence of iodine was proved in all the
 waters, but the quantity present was minute in the extreme.               In
 one case also an indication of fluorine was obtained by the appa
 rently etching action exerted upon a watch-glass in the applica
 tion of the test now usually employed : these markings, however,
 on the parts uncovered by wax, although quite obvious when
 the newly-cleaned glass was breathed upon, were perfectly im
 perceptible when the same watch-glass was taken up a day or
'two later and re-wiped for the purpose of fresh examination f.
 Since that experiment, M. Nickles' observations               J  on the fal
 lacies incidental to this method of testing have appeared ; and
 this doubtless was a case such as he describes, in which the
 vapour of any acid, or even of water, may exert such an action
  (not chemical,   I  presume, but physical), and fix upon glass any
 design   at first traced upon the layer of wax. The search for the
 remaining substances above mentioned was unsuccessful, and
 they were therefore presumed to be absent.
     I will now proceed to state the results which the analysis of
 these brines has afforded me, premising them simply by naming
 the sources from which they were derived.              I. Anderton brine,

    Towards the latter part of the autumn of last year, a consider
 able panic was created by a sudden outcry being raised that the
 supply of brine was rapidly diminishing over the whole of
Cheshire. I made at the time many inquiries as to the truth of
this statement, which had found its way into the public journals,
and it proved, as is usual in such cases, that the account, although
based upon truth, was very much exaggerated.                        A diminution
in the supply of brine is a phenomenon of no unfrequent occur
rence, and is in fact of two kinds — periodical and occasional.
A periodical sinking of the water in the brine-shaft is found to
occur in the summer season, the brine rising with the approach
of winter, and attaining its highest level about December or
January : these alternations have generally been very regular, but
during the year 1856 a total departure from the usual variations
took place, which, ending in a rapid sinking of the brine during

    Mr. A. B. Northcote        ore the  Brine-springs of Cheshire.        471
the months of November and December, originated the fears
which were entertained of a general failure being at hand.                   I
have been enabled to obtain a statement of the fluctuations in
the level of the brine in a pit at Anderton, during the two nor
mal years 1854-55, and the abnormal year 1856, by which the
matter is clearly exemplified.           The shaft upon which the ob
servations were made, was between 70 and 80 yards deep, and
the numbers given express the height in yards to which the
brine rose.

   By this account it is seen that in ordinary years the average
depth of brine in the shaft is thirty yards in the depth of winter,
whilst in the midst of summer five yards may be taken as the
mean; and the origin of the alarm in 1856 was evidently the
observation of a diminution setting in at a period at which an in
crease had usually happened hitherto. The fact, however, appears
to have been disregarded, that in the warmer period of the year
the supply of brine had been far more abundant than was gene
rally the case, nor am       I   aware that any attempt was made to
explain   this part    of the    phenomenon.            The sudden decrease
was attributed by those on        the  spot    best   able to form an opinion,
to one of those dislocations of strata which frequently on a
smaller scale cause the occasional failures in the supply of brine :
a sudden subsidence of land in one part of the Northwich district,
to the depth of a three-storied building, is described as having
occurred simultaneously with this sinking of the brine, and it was
believed that in some of the deserted mines which honeycomb the
rock-salt strata of that region, the pillars of salt, which are always
left to support the roof, had been removed by the action of water>
and the immense weight of the superincumbent mass had then
caused the excavation to collapse.             By an extensive disarrange
ment of this nature, either some new channel of escape might have
been opened for the brine, or at least the communication between
some of the streams or reservoirs might have been closed or

have happened in earlier times ; and two instances are mentioned
by Holland, in one of which, near Bickley, and also in the neigh
bourhood of Combermere Abbey, the ground suddenly «ank to a
depth of many feet, and the brine not being removed with the
same rapidity as in the present day, forced its way to the surface
upon its old subterranean channel or reservoir being filled up,
and formed a pool of considerable size in the depression caused
by the collapse of the strata.                               ,,...,,¦,.                                :¦,

            On an Element of Strength in Beams subjected to Trans

By William Henry Barlow, Esq., F.R.S.
   In his former paper on this subject the author pointed out the
existence of an element of strength in beams when subjected to trans
verse strain, — the resistance of flexure— which had been omitted in
the generally received theory      and the object of the present experi

                     is

   The forms of beam employed in the experiments formerly de

namely, square bars broken on their sides, square bars broken on.

   By using results obtained by Prof. Hodgkinson on the breaking
weight of inch bars of ten different descriptions of iron, where the
tensile strength was ascertained by direct experiment, it would ap
pear that the ratio between the resistance of tension and the resist
ance of flexure varies in different qualities of metal, an inference
which seems to be confirmed by other experiments on rectangular
bars given in the Report of the Commissioners on the application of
iron to railway structures.     The mean result, however, accords
nearly with that of the author's experiments, and gives the ratio of
/to     as
      (f>   to "853.
                1      Hence, according to these data, the resistance
to flexure, computed as     force evenly distributed over the section,
                               a
is almost nine-tenths of the tensile resistance.

resulting from the several experiments, gives the tensile strength of
the metal as derived from each form of section, and the results,
though not perfectly regular, are found to be within the limits of
the variation exhibited by the metal as shown by the experiments
on direct tension in the former paper.       Classified and condensed,

    Having thus found that his formulae, when applied to his own
 experiments, gave consistent and satisfactory results, the author next
tested them by other known experiments, and especially refers to
those by Major Wade on the transverse strength of square and round
 bars of cast iron of different qualities, related in the " Reports on
the Strength and other Properties of Metals for Cannon," presented
to the United States Government by the Officers of the Ordnance
 Department.      The unit of strength, as computed by Major Wade
from these experiments, came out uniformly much higher in the
round than in the square bars of the same kind of iron, whence he
was led to doubt the correctness of the formula employed        but the

sistance of flexure, the discrepancy referred to disappears,   and the
tensile resistance, whether obtained for the round or the square bars,
agrees very nearly with that derived from the experiments on direct
tension under like circumstances.
   As to the ratio between the resistance of flexure and the tensile
resistance,     it remarked that, were the metal homogeneous, the
                     is
former resistance would probably be precisely equal to the latter, in
stead of bearing the ratio of nine-tenths, as found by experiment but     ;
the ratio evidently varies in different qualities of metal and accord

   Mr. W. H. Barlow       on an Element of Strength in Beams.          475
ingly from Major Wade's experiments, it appears that with the same
metal subjected to different modes of casting, an increase of trans
verse strength may accompany a decrease in the tensile resistance.
    Respecting the limit of action of the resistance of flexure, the
author observes, that in all the simple solid sections, the points of
action are evidently the centres of gravity of the half-section ; while
in the compound sections it is necessary to compute the centre rib and
flanges as for two separate beams in which the resistance of flexure
is different, and has its point of action at the centre of gravity of the
separate portions.     It would appear that the elastic reaction deve-
lopes this resistance to the full extent when the section is such that
a straight line may be drawn from every point at the outer portion
to every point at the neutral axis within the section ; but that if
the form of section is such that straight lines drawn from the outer
fibres or particles to the neutral axis fall without the section, then it
must be treated as two separate beams, each having that amount of
resistance of flexure due to the depth of the metal contained in it.
    The last section of the paper is devoted to the consideration of
the resistance of flexure in wrought iron ; and experiments are first
given to determine the position of the neutral axis, from which it is
found to be at the centre of gravity of the section, as in cast iron ;
 so that the action is the same in both materials, except as to the
amount of the extensions and compressions with a given strain ; and
the formulae given for cast iron will also apply to wrought iron.        As
           iron                   and  not    fracture, the  relative value
    f
wrought         yields by bending          by
of and <p are not so easily ascertained ; moreover the ultimate com
pressive strain which wrought iron can sustain is little more than
half its ultimate tensile strength ; nevertheless the force required to
overcome the elasticity of the material is nearly the same, whether
applied as a compressive or tensile strain ; the difference being, that
the force which overcomes elasticity when applied as a compressive
 strain leads to the destruction or distortion of the material, while,
in the case of the tensile strain, the elasticity may be overcome long
 before the material yields by absolute rupture.
    A statement is given of the results of experiments made by Pro
 fessor Barlow, in 1837, to show the weights which overcome the
 elasticity of the metal when applied transversely as compared with
 the weight necessary to produce the same result when applied by
 direct tension, and from these it is concluded that the resistance of
 flexure in wrought iron, considered as a force acting evenly over the
 surface, is nearly equal to one-half of the tensile resistance.
     In an Appendix to this paper, by Professor Barlow (read at the
 following meeting), the preceding principles are applied to beams
 and rafters of non-symmetrical section.
    With this view, the case of the double-flanged girder with un
 equal flanges is selected and discussed, and formulae deduced, which
 are then tested by comparison with the results of experiments by
  Prof. Hodgkinson, published in the 'Manchester Memoirs ;' a selec
 tion being made of those in which the girders differed most from
 each other in section, dimensions, and bearing-distance.         The chief

bonate of lithia, and obtained as the mean result of four experi
ments with this substance, agreeing well together, the number 14;,99
— a number which accords very closely with the formula Sit).
These different numbers, obtained with silica, led the author <d In
quire whether any other body acting as an acid produces similar re^
suits with the fused carbonates of potash and soda.              With this view,
experiments were made with dry sulphate of magnesia, as a substfc'

qf silicic acid could be found in other volatile acids than the carbonic,
the author relates some experiments made with the hydrates of

render it much more difficult to obtain accordant numbers with
these bodies than with the carbonates.                      ,:'
;    Six experiments made with hydrate of potash gave as mean result
the same number as that obtained with the carbonate, viz. 30'8.
But .with hydrate of soda the mean of three experiments gave the
number 17*2 as the equivalent of silicic acid, — result approachinga
that previously obtained with carbonate of lithia.
     A silicate of soda was formed by fusing together silica and carbo
nate of soda, in proportions indicated by the previous experiments —
t. e. 23 silicH to 54 carbonate of soda == 31 soda.             The fused mass
was crystallized.       It was dissolved in water, and the solution evapo
 rated in. vacuo yielded          acrystallized salt, which contained about
5;
     peri cent* of  carbonate   of   soda; when this, calculated as the or
 dinary 10-hydrated       salt, was    subtracted, the silicate, agreed nearly
with: the, formula NaO.Si02+7HO.                    A crystallized salt of like
composition       was  obtained    when    hydrated   silica  was dissolved in              a
solution of caustic soda, the silica and soda being in the same
proportions, i,.e,< 31 :i23. In these experiments                appears, there

     After guarding himself from drawing any decided inference from
the experiments recorded, the author concludes by observing that at
 present he can see no alternative but to admit of more than one
 equivalent for silicic acid (that         to say of more than one acid), the

     "On the Magnetic Induction of Crystals." By Professor Juliua
Pliicker of Bonn, For. Memb. R.S., lion. M.R.I. &c.
   ¦The author, commences by referring to his discovery of the peculiar
action of magnets, on crystalline bodies, and to the researches to

478                           Royal Society   :   —
 which he was thereby led. With reference to the form in which he
 enunciated the law regulating the action of a magnet on a nniaxal
 crystal — that the optic axis is attracted or repelled by the poles of
 the magnet — he disclaims any intention of assigning a physical cause
 to the phenomenon, or doing anything more than expressing the
 results of observation, which are as if such a force existed. In the
 case of crystals of a more complicated character, he was led, in the
 first instance, to assume the existence of two magnetic axes, possessing
 a similar character as to attraction and repulsion with the one axis of
 optically uniaxal crystals. But finding that the proposed law did
 not hold when the crystal was examined in all directions, and not
 solely along peculiar axes, he abandoned, nearly two years ago, a
hypothesis respecting which serious doubts had arisen long before.
 For the hypothesis of one or two axes acted upon by the magnet,
he substituted another similar hypothesis.          In the case of uniaxal
crystals he now conceived an ellipsoid of revolution, consisting of
 an amorphous paramagnetic or diamagnetic substance, and having
 within the crystal its principal axis coincident with the principal
 crystallographic axis.       It is easy to verify that both crystal and
 ellipsoid, the poles of the magnet not being too near each other,
will be directed between them in exactly the same way. In the
generalization, an ellipsoid with three unequal axes, having a deter
minate direction in the crystal, must be substituted for the ellipsoid
of revolution.      In this hypothesis too, two "magnetic axes" are
met with, that   is,  according to the new definition, directions which
possess, in common with the single crystallographic axis of uniaxal
 crystals, the property that       the crystal be suspended so that either
                                  if
of these axes   is   vertical, and the body   is  at liberty to turn freely
round it, no extraordinary magnetic action          exhibited, but the cry
                                                   is
 stal behaves like an amorphous substance.
     According to observation, crystal under favourable circumstances
                                   a
is   directed in the same way as the smallest of its fragments. Hence,
 according to the new hypothesis, each of its particles may be regarded
as acted on like an amorphous ellipsoid. But such an amorphous mole
cular ellipsoid, when influenced by magnetic pole at finite distance,
                                       a                     a
will be directed like an ellipsoid of finite dimensions under the in
fluence of an infinitely distant pole.    Here Poisson's theory presented
itself for the verification of the hypothetical conclusions and their
consequences, to which the author had been led by considerations of      a
different kind. This verification had the most complete success. But
before proceeding to   it,   it was found necessary to confirm Poisson's
theory itself (or rather the results following from it), with respect to
an ellipsoid of finite dimensions influenced            by
                                                       an infinitely distant
pole. . By meaus of beautiful theorem lately published by Professor
                       a
Beer, by which the results relating to the influenced ellipsoid are
simply and elegantly expressed by means of an auxiliary ellipsoid,
the author was enabled to deduce immediately the analytical expres
sions. These were afterwards compared with experiment,           by   obser
vations made on two carefully worked ellipsoids of soft iron, executed
by   M. Fessel of Cologne.

     Prof. Pliicker on the Magnetic Induction of Crystals.           479
   The results thus obtained from theory, and verified by experiment,
with reference to an amorphous ellipsoid, were compared with the
results obtained from the observation of crystals, and manifested a
complete agreement.      According to this theory, the magnetic induc
tion within a crystal  is,like the elasticity of the lumimferous ether,
determined by means of an auxiliary ellipsoid.        As there are three
rectangular axes of optical elasticity, so there are three principal
axes of magnetic induction, characterized by the property that      if   a
crystal be suspended along any one of them, the two others set, one
axially, and the other equatorially.     As there are two optic axes,
situated in the plane of the axes of greatest and least elasticity, so
there are two magnetic axes, characterized by the property already
mentioned.
    Among crystals, the author selected for special examination red
ferrocyanide of iron, sulphate of zinc, and formiate of copper. The
firstis   paramagnetic, the second diamagnetic, and in both cases the
principal axes of magnetic induction are determined      by  the planes of
crystalline symmetry.      The setting of elongated prisms, as well as
of long cylinders and short cylinders or circular plates, cut in various
selected directions from the crystals,    described in detail.
                                         is                       The use
of both cylinders and circular plates, cut with their axes in the
same direction, obviated any objection which might be raised attri
buting the setting to the external form, since, so far as was due to
mere form,    a cylinder and circular plate would set with their axes
                             a
in rectangular directions.
    Formiate of copper differs from the former crystals in having but
one plane of crystalline symmetry, and accordingly in having but one
principal axis of magnetic induction determined by the crystalline
form.     The existence of three principal magnetic axes, having the
property already mentioned, was demonstrated experimentally, and
the directions of those two which were not determined by the cry
stalline form, were ascertained by experiment.       In this crystal the
axes of greatest and least induction, and consequently the magnetic
axes, lie in the plane of symmetry   ; and the existence of two mag
netic axes was demonstrated, and their positions were determined.
    In conclusion, the author gives list of crystals, classified according
                                   a
to their paramagnetic or diamagnetic characters, and the order of
magnitude of the magnetic inductions in the direction of their prin
cipal axes.    He also remarks that some crystals, of which instances
are given, though belonging according to their form to the biaxal
class, have two of their principal magnetic inductions so nearly
equal that they cannot be distinguished from magnetically uniaxal
 crystals while others, though not belonging to the tesseral system,
          ;
 have all their principal inductions so nearly equal that they cannot
 be distinguished from amorphous substances.

     ON A NEW STEREOSCOPIC PH/ENOMENON.                 BY M. A. CIMA.
 I TAKE       a drawing of a head seen in front, of 3 or 4 centimetres in
        height ; it may he lithographed, or engraved, or drawn with a
pencil.     I cut this drawing in the direction of the vertical axis of the
 nose, and arrange these two parts of the drawing in the same vertical
 plane, before the eyes, at a less distance than that of distinct vision.
 I remove or bring together the two parts of the drawing until the
 two images which result from their duplication, combine so as to
form the entire face.        The image of this face thus obtained pre
sents the appearance of a solid object, or of a modelled figure in
which the nose, the cheek-bones, the chin, and the eyebrows are
detached, as in an object in relief.           This sensation of relief in
creases in proportion to the length of time during which the two
images are viewed ; to obtain the maximum of effect, the two half-
faces must be held at a suitable distance, which varies according to
the observer. A similar, but much less perfect effect is obtained by
looking at the drawing of the entire face, either with one or both eyes,
at a distance much less than that of distinct vision.
    I think that the explanation of these phaenomena must be founded
upon the two following facts, which led me to make the observation
which is the subject of this note. The eye sees of a gray colour a
series of very small alternate black and white spaces, very close to
each other, and seen at a distance less than that of distinct vision.
In looking at a single face divided into small squares alternately
black and white, at a distance less than that of distinct vision, the
white squares appear larger, the lines of contact between the white
and black squares become of a gray colour, which extends gradually,
and the black squares appear larger ; at the same time the white
squares appear to be raised at the centre and the black squares to be
hollowed.       This double property of our eye, which is due to
ocular irradiation, furnishes us with a sufficient explanation of this
new stereoscopic appearance. — Comptes Rendus, October 26, 1857,

          LVI.    Observations upon the Structure   of Glaciers.
                   By John Ball, M.R.I.A., F.L.S.*
             a few of those who have paid attention to the interesting
 NOT      questions connected with the movement and structure of
 glaciers, have long felt that, in spite of the efforts of many able
 men who had observed the phenomena on the spot, and of the
progress made towards understanding their physical theory, for
which we are chiefly indebted to Professor J. Forbes, much still
remained both of fact and theory that called for further investi
 gation on the part of men who should combine habits of careful
observation with a mastery over the principles of physical science.
    The paper read last January before the Royal Society, by Pro
fessors Tyndall and Huxley, followed by a lecture delivered at
the Royal Institution by the first-named gentleman, has been
welcomed by such persons as a material advance towards the
completion of our knowledge on these subjects.
    The theory of glacier motion may, indeed, be now considered
complete.        Professor Forbes had proved that glaciers in their
gradual descent move after the manner of viscous fluids ; Prof.
Tyndall ha3 now brought to light that property of ice by which
rigid masses of glacier are enabled to conform themselves to the
laws that regulate the motion of imperfect fluids.
    The question remains, whether the able and ingenious authors
of the paper read before the Royal Society have been equally
successful in explaining the physical causes of the singular and
complicated structure which careful examination detects in all
known glaciers ; and with a view to satisfy some doubts on this
subject,   I  endeavoured, during a recent visit to the Swiss Alps,
to observe with attention such peculiarities in the structure and
arrangement of those glaciers which       I was able to visit, as might
help to test the sufficiency of the new theory.

    Although circumstances did not permit me to undertake any
continuous series of observations, accompanied by accurate
measurements, it has seemed to me that some notes made at
the time, and of the accuracy of which, as far as they go,             I
feel confident, may deserve the notice of those who are interested
in the subject.          I
                     If have ventured to draw some conclusions
from facts, or to point out what appear to be objections to the
deductions of other more competent physical observers,            I  am
well aware that it becomes me to do so with great hesitation.
That hesitation is somewhat lessened by the expectation that
the subject is about to receive further illustration from the con
tinued labours of Professor Tyndall, and to no more able and
candid judge could any facts or arguments seeming to tell
against his own conclusions be proposed.
     The chief, but not the only peculiarities of glacier struc
ture that have attracted the attention of observers, are the fol
lowing : —
        1. Stratification of the Neve.
       2. Veined structure of the middle and lower region.
        3. Dirt-bands of Professor Forbes.
       4. Dirt-bands of M. Agassiz*.
        5. Crevasses.
        6. Capillary fissures in the compact ice.
        7. Air-bubbles included in the ice.
     These are all so familiar to those who have either observed for
 themselves, or who have studied with care the writings of Forbes,
 Agassiz, and other glacier authorities, that it would be super
 fluous to describe them, and      I  shall merely offer such remarks
 in regard to each of them as have some bearing on the theory
 of glacier structure.
     1. The stratification of the neve, its arrangement       in parallel
 layers of more and less crystalline snow, the diminished thickness
 of the layers in the lower part of exposed sections, accompanied
 by a consolidation of the substance of the neve into ice, more
 or less filled with air-bubbles, are facts familiar to those who
 have dwelt much in the upper regions of the ice-world, where
 in concave hollows, or still more often, on slightly convex
 plateaux, the vast accumulations are formed which give birth to
                                       ' •
 the greater glaciers.
     On one point, many of those who have described the forma
 tion of these beds seem to be certainly in error.
     Each of the horizontal beds seen in an exposed vertical sec
  tion of the neve is supposed to correspond with the whole annual
 fall of snow at the spot where the bed was formed.             But this
  inference rests either on a great exaggeration of the effects of
            * Recently named Dirt- Streaks by Professor Huxley.

evaporation and melting in diminishing the mass of snow, or
on an under-estimate of the amount that annually falls in the
upper regions.
    Comparing the observations made at the Great St. Bernard,
and those of M. Dolfuss at his Pavilion on the Aar Glacier, we
cannot estimate the average annual fall of snow, in the region of
the Swiss Alps from 8000 to 10,000 feet above the sea, at less
than 60 English feet. From the experiments of Agassiz on the
relative density of snow, water, and different varieties of glacier
ice, it appears that this thickness of snow would be equivalent
to a bed of neve ice rather more than 8 feet in thickness.
But in the lower part of the sections of neve, where the snow is
converted into nevS ice, the thickness of the distinct beds is
seldom more than 6 or 8 inches, and often much less.
    If each layer corresponds to the produce of one year's fall of
snow, we should have to believe that the effect of melting and
evaporation is to reduce the annual deposits of snow to one-
twelfth or a still smaller proportion of their original bulk.    This
 estimate, I feel persuaded, would be a very great mistake if
 applied to the region where the great accumulations take place,
 10,000 feet, and more, above the sea.      It is my strong impres
 sion, derived from frequent observations in the upper regions of
 the Alps, that the visible beds of neve represent each considerable
 fall of snow that has taken place, without any absolute hrnit
 between those of one year and another.          Where a slight fall
 has occurred, or where a more considerable one has been followed
 by a sufficient interval of hot weather, it leaves no trace among
 the strata of the nive, save that the water which it produced has
 helped by percolation to consolidate the icy seams in the beds
 immediately below it. Again, when one fall of snow follows
 another with but a short interval, and before a strong crust of
 granular ice has formed over the first, the two become so nearly
 confounded together in the stratification that subsequently ensues
 as not to be distinguishable to the eye at a short distance.     But
 it happens many times in each year, that after a heavy fall of
 snow dry and clear weather succeeds.      I  see no reason to doubt,
 that in winter as well as in summer, the joint effect of the sun and
 air is to produce a crust of granular ice, whereon the wind often'
 deposits dust and other light bodies.      At the next fall of snow,
 the main source of waste, evaporation from the surface, is put
 a stop to, and the future diminution in the thickness of the new
 stratum is owing to the gradual consolidation which arises from'
 internal melting, from the percolation of water coming from
 above, and the pressure of the fresh strata of snow which con
 tinually accumulate overhead.
    This explanation accounts for the great irregularity in the
                                2 Ia

     It seems to me clear that in this case the two transverse

  gether late in the autumn, when the increasing cold was suffi
  cient to freeze the enclosed water before the junction I of the
  opposite walls had been quite completed.                 Such crevassejs must
  at one time have been of considerable width, or else the, planes

  writers, I. have been a little particular in describing it. Lines
  indicating closed crevasses are common enough, and can some
  times be traced far on the surface of the glacier ¦„ perhaps., if
  attention be given to the point, it will be found that they pften
  correspond to a shifting of the planes of the veined structure.
      2. The veined structure of the middle and lower, part of the
  great glaciers, and, more or less, of all glaciers in which the

486          Mr.   J.    Ball on   the   Structure of Glaciers.
ice is well consolidated, has hitherto been the point as to which
science seemed most at fault in endeavouring       to explain the
phenomena of the ice-world.
   As one of those who had never been able to accept the con
jectural explanation given by Professor Forbes, who was the
first to make known the true character of this phsenomenon,
 and to perceive its importance,          I
                                   could not fail to be much in
terested in the new hypothesis, which supplies a simple, and
 apparently an adequate explanation of the known facts.      But
 the result of some consideration and recent observation has not
 removed all the difficulties which seem to me to stand in the
 way of an unqualified acceptance of this new theory, and with
very sincere diffidence     I
                            venture to state them.
                                   I
    In the first place, then, would observe that while Professor
Tyndall has abundantly proved the extensive influence of great
          in modifying the internal arrangement of various bodies,
  e has not shown any instance in which the resulting structure
Eressure
at all resembles that which we find in glacier ice. In every case
of lamination and consequent cleavage, attributable to pressure,
the result seems to be due, either to a rearrangement of the rigid
particles contained in the mass by which their flatter surfaces
are disposed in planes perpendicular to the direction of pressure,
or else to the compression of minute and comparatively           soft
nodules or accretions*, which alter their form under the force
to which they are exposed, and each particle, from a rounded or
irregular form, assumes that of a lamina or plate with its faces
perpendicular to the direction of pressure. In either case the phae-
nomenon of cleavage is the direct result of the arrangement        of
the particles of the mass in layers with flattened faces approxi
 mately disposed in the same plane.       Now, whether we examine
 the bands of compact blue ice, or the intermediate        layers of
 white opake ice, we find no trace of lamination, or anything
 approaching to    it,in the internal structure of the mass.
     At times, indeed,    I have found, as Professor Forbes first
 noticed,a    distinct tendency to cleavage along the surface of
junction between the veins of blue and white ice, but on either
 side, both the one vein and the other have always appeared to
 me absolutely devoid of any tendency to split in the direction of
 the veined structure, nor does close examination show traces of
 molecular arrangement which could produce such            tendency.
 The cleavage planes above described seem to be                by a
                                                           no means
 invariably present, and the phenomenon has to me the air of
 being superinduced        by
                           pressure upon the already existing veined
 structure, rather than its essential concomitant.
                                  true of wax as well as the other substances
  *I   apprehend that this   is
cited by Professor Tyndall.

               Mr. J. Ball on the Structure  of Glaciers.         487
    Again, if the veined structure be produced by pressure alone,
 how does it happen that the part of the mass which must be
most amenable to the action of external force,     I  mean the white
ice filled with air-bubbles, does not show in the form of the
cavities which pervade its whole substance, a record of the
process by which it is assumed that the internal condition of the
ice has been so profoundly modified ? But as Agassiz has pointed
           I
out, and have frequently verified his observations on this point,
though the air-cavities often show traces of compression reducing
them to the form of flattened lenses, the directions in which they
are flattened are most various, and show no constant relation to
the planes of the veined structure. Here then we have direct
evidence that separate portions of the ice have been acted on by
pressure sufficient in amount to modify their internal arrange
ment, but that these pressures have not acted in the same, or
nearly the same direction. But surely this is not consistent
with the supposed action of force on a great scale upon an
enormous mass of ice — able to destroy first the primitive struc
ture, and then to impress upon it a new and different one. Such
a force must have entered into composition with any local pres
 sures which can be supposed to have existed in the interior of
the mass, and the resultants would have approximated closely to
the general direction of its action.
    A further difficulty which L think deserves some attention is
this, that the pressure hypothesis gives no explanation whatever
of the irregularity in the appearance and the thickness of the
veins.    Even if we are to admit that such pressure as exists in
glaciers is competent to impress upon masses of neve, sometimes
many square miles in extent, a veined structure consisting of
alternate bands of nearly compact ice and ice filled with air-
bubbles — a conclusion, let me say, which is not absolutely in
consistent with what we know of the action of pressure on seem
ingly homogeneous masses of matter, but which has not yet
been shown to be possible, either by experiment or by any close
accordance with observed facts, — is there anything that would
lead us to expect that the veins should be otherwise than mode
rately uniform in structure?       Every one, however, who has
looked carefully at the veined structure knows that this is not
the fact : some of the blue veins are very thin and faintly marked,
others on the contrary much thicker, more compact, and there
fore more transparent than those on either side of them.          But
there is a further fact to which   I wish to call particular atten
tion, viz. the recurrence at regular intervals of these thicker and
more transparent blue veins.     I do not feel justified in asserting
that this is constantly to be seen, but    I have reason to think it
very frequent.     My attention was first called to it on a small

     Inext proceed to ask whether, supposing i-it possible* that
pressure alone can produce in beds of neve alternate layers of
denser and of less compact ice perpendicular to the direction of

 490            Mr.   J. Ball on   the Structure  of Glaciers.
 steadily forward along the main valley, seems to me to prove
 conclusively that the chief pressure acting upon it in the plane
 of the horizon, must be in the direction of its motion, and that
 surfaces formed perpendicular to the lines of maximum pressure
 should intersect the glacier in flattened curves, slightly convex
 towards its lower extremity.           The fact, however, is otherwise.
 The upper portion of what           I  may call the long reach of the
 glacier,  was  covered  with  snow    when  I traversed it ; but opposite
 to the Marjelen See,      and  for   three or four miles up the stream,
 I found the veined structure quite well developed in the central
 region of the glacier, arranged as usual in vertical planes parallel
 to the direction of motion. If it be said that this structure was
 originally produced by the mutual pressure of the three main
 ice currents which unite in the upper basin already referred
 to,  I would reply, that the point of junction is fully eight miles
 from the Marjelen See ; that it is probably a considerable over
 estimate if we allow 200 feet as the average annual advance
of that part of the glacier ; and, consequently, that the veined
 structure at the lower station must, according to this latter
 hypothesis, have been produced more than 200 years before we
observe it.      For the greater part of that time we have proof
that the ice has been subject to little or no lateral pressure, but
constantly to a force acting in the direction of motion, and to
the vertical pressure of the upper on the lower parts of the mass.
At the most moderate estimate of the superficial waste along the
intermediate portion of the glacier, we must suppose that a thick
ness of 400 or 500 feet of overlying ice has been removed during
the long interval in question.          But if the long-continued action
of pressure in new directions is incompetent to alter the struc
ture impressed upon the ice 200 years before, what becomes of
the assumed obliteration of the original stratification of the neve
through the agency of pressure ; and how are we to believe that
an effect so universal as this must be, if indeed that original
stratification is everywhere effaced, should not be repeated in a
field where the same causes must have been in operation with
remarkable     uniformity for    a  period unusually protracted ?
    Even in those glaciers where it is conceded that lateral com
pression has probably been at work to a great extent, such as
the Mer de Glace of Chamouni, there are many parts of the
glacier where it appears to me that the hypothesis of Pro
fessor Tyndall would require that the veined structure should
be developed at right angles to the motion of fhe centre of the
glacier* ; but I do not venture to urge that view against the
   * Professor Tyndall's mud experiments illustrate this, by the flattening
of the circular rings impressed on the centre of a stream moving over a bed
of irregular slope.

                  Mr.  J. Ball on   the Structure   of Glaciers.           491
possible reply, that, although there are portions of the glacier
where the frontal resistance must greatly predominate over the
lateral pressure, this new force does not operate long enough to
modify sensibly the structure already impressed upon the ice*.
Even with this qualification it is hard to reconcile the new theory
with such facts as are presented on the lower part of the glacier
of La Brenva. Professor Forbes has well described the way in
 which this great glacier, descending through a steep gorge on
 the southern side of Mont Blanc into the Allee Blanche, a
 valley running nearly at right angles to its original course,
 encounters first an enormous moraine, which it has itself piled
 up below, then abuts against the rocks on the opposite side of
 the main valley, bridging over the torrent of the Doire, and is
 thus gradually bent round; until the lower part of its course
 follows the direction of that valley.           Now if it were possible to
 examine the conditions of internal pressure and tension across
 the glacier opposite to the point where it abuts against the south
 side of the Allee Blanche, and where the process of flexure is
 chiefly accomplished, it cannot be doubted that these conditions
 would be found to be far other than symmetrical as Regards                 the
 centre of the glacier.          On the south side, we must admit           the
 existence of powerful        lateral  pressure from the resistance of      the
 rocks to the onward movement of the glacier t, while on                    the
      * This view of the
                             permanence, within certain limits, of the veined
  structure, which    I  assume to be an essential portion of Mr. Tyndall's
  theory, is, of course, at variance with the belief expressed by Professor
  Forbes, that that structure is destroyed in ice-cataracts, where the surface
  is completely cut up by deep crevasses, and redeveloped within a short di
  stance, where the glacier resumes its normal mode of progress, and of which
  he gave one instance in the Mer de Glace, opposite to the promontory of
  Trelaporte.     I have already stated reasons for doubting this conclusion ;
  Jtnd   I  may here add, that considering the great difficulty of obtaining
  actual access to the most crevassed parts of the ice, observations on its
  condition are to be received with great caution. .Where glacier ice presents
  a moderate slope, the action of running water in warm weather acts
   so as to scour away the disintegrated portions of the surface, and to
   bring to light the real structure of the interior ; but where the form of the
   ice is such that the water melting from the surface runs off at once without
   forming rills, as ij the case on the steep faces of ice pinnacles, and on the
   upper edges of crevasses, the whole surface' is weathered into a crust of
   disintegrated fragments of ice, and no sign of internal structure is visible
   to the eye. This is even true, in some states of the weather, on parts of the
   glacier where the veined structure is generally visible, and affords ground
   for doubting some alleged instances of its non-appearance.
      f  " Intense pressure" Professor Forbes calls it in his Twelfth Letter on
   Glaciers.    I may remark that this most interesting glacier has subsided at
   the present time (September 1857) nearly to the dimensions described and
   figured by Professor Forbes in 1842, while in September 1853 it had pretty
   nearly those which he found in 184G.         On both occasions, however, it
    seemed to me that his sketches somewhat underrated the length of the

first spoken of, no objection could be made to it ; but if I am
not under a grievous misconception in believing that the blue
veins may usually be traced for a distance of many yards, and
almost constantly for several feet, I may be permitted to appeal

    3. Dirt- Bands of Professor Forbes. — The appearance first de
scribed by Professor Forbes under this name has been confounded
by subsequent writers with a totally different phenomenon to
which I shall presently refer, and this makes it necessary to
distinguish it by his name.         It is generally to be recognized
only from a distance, when a large extent of glacier is seen
under such conditions of light and shade as enable the eye to
seize slight variations of hue; but when once seen it is impossible
not to come to the conclusion that it is an indication of the
working of some mechanical law, which has operated over the
whole mass of the glacier.
    Professor Tyndall has illustrated, by ingenious experiments,
the conclusion drawn in the paper so often cited, which refers
the production of these broad bands, or zones, of ice alternately
white or discoloured, to the effect of steep falls or ice-cataracts
separating into distinct portions the dirt which had before been
evenly distributed over the surface.           The form subsequently
assumed is easily shown by him to be a consequence of the law
of glacier motion.       Though    I  believe that the effect of iee-
cataracts in breaking up the surface of the glacier has been
somewhat overrated*,       I  am inclined to think that the appear
ances produced in Professor Tyndall's models are really traceable
on some glaciers, but that they are different, both in form and
origin, from those described by Professor Forbes. The latter
were most accurately described in the third and fifth of his pub
lished letters.     They traverse the whole breadth of a glacier
stream, and are arranged at tolerably uniform intervals of several
hundred feet, the breadth of the dirt-bands and of the intervening
whiter spaces being approximately equal.               I  am not aware
whether accurate measures have verified Professor Forbes's sur
mise, that they correspond to slight undulations in the surface of
the glacier, a fact which, if well established, would go far to
prove his conclusion, which has always seemed to me probable,
that they are the indications of an undulation in the flow of the
glacier, depending on the different rates of progress in summer
and winter.     Fresh snow interfered with my observations on two
or three occasions during the last season, but        I  have an impres
sion that during former visits to the Alps        I have noticed an ar-

narrower than the " dirt-bands," and not regularly disposed
across the whole width of the glacier.           These probably corre
sponded with the phenomena observed on the Rhone Glacier and
that of Grindelwald by Messrs. Tyndall and Huxley, and subse
quently explained in their paper in the Philosophical Transactions.
   4. Dirt-Bands of M. Agassiz. — The language of M. Agassiz
and his friends, in treating of the appearances which they sup
posed identical with the dirt-bands of Professor Forbes, is not
always so clear and consistent as to enable the readers of the
'
  Systeme Glaciaire' to recognize with certainty the phenomena
which they describe.         This is evidently due to the want of ac
curate principles of physical science on the part of the author
and his fellow-labourers.         But, as a record of observations, it
seems to me that their work contains much information that
cannot properly be neglected, and amongst other facts, the
system of dirt-lines, which Agassiz regards as evidence of
the stratification of the glacier, deserves, I think, further care
ful examination and discussion.            I have frequently remarked
the recurrence at pretty uniform intervals of broader and more
strongly marked blue bands in the veined structure, sometimes
accompanied by the appearance of a thin stratum of dirt-frag
ments which may be traced along the walls of intersecting cre
vasses, and into the substance of the glacier.            These are the
lines which M. Agassiz has identified with the dirt-bands ; and
               I
to these, if am not mistaken, most of the statements in his
writings apply.       But at times it would appear as if the observa
tions recorded had reference to two completely distinct phaeno-
mena, of less general occurrence.          One of these is the existence
of lines indicating closed crevasses, of which the lips often retain
for a considerable time enough of dirt to mark their presence on
the glacier.     When seen from a moderate height above the gla
cier, where   their  direction can be compared with that of existing
crevasses, these are easily recognized, but on its surface they
may readily be confounded with the class of dirt-lines now under
consideration.      The other phaenomenon, which has, as       I believe,
been a source of confusion, is peculiar to the upper region of
great glaciers.      The annual fall of snow, and the corresponding
destruction of it by heat and evaporation, are, as is well known,
very variable in amount.          New beds of neve, and even small
glaciers, are sometimes formed on the lower mountains, and dis
appear again in subsequent seasons.           The same thing happens
on the surface of great glaciers.         After a layer of dirt has been
deposited on a part of the glacier which has been exposed for
one, or perhaps for several successive seasons, it may easily
become covered over by beds of neve, which may finally, if they

stmc^ure which, is found to be an almost universal characteristic
of glaciers.
    In favour of this view it may be urged that we have, in the
first place, the positive fact that the neve is a mass made up of
beds alternately more and less compact and crystalline, — that,
so far as we are able to trace them downwards, these beds con- •
tinually dimiuish in thickness,^-and finally, that the glacier ice
formed out of these beds has a proper structure, which (differs,:
only in degree from that of the neve.            The irregularity in the, | ;
thickness and appearance of the veins, , and the, recurrence at
regular intervals of larger and more strongly-marked hands, are
facts exactly in accordance with this explanation of the origin
of the veined structure. At first sight it seems, however, im
possible to reconcile , it with the position which is generally
assumed by the surfaces of the veined structure, but perhaps a              ;
little consideration may lessen, though I dp not pretend to say
that it will completely remove the difficulty. All great glaciers
are made up from the confluence of separate ice-streams.                We
suppose each of these to consist         in  its   origin of  beds  of neve
               into  glacier  ice, the strata of which must gradually
transformed
have conformed their slope to the form of the channel down
whfjeh £^ey have moved.         Hence at the point of junction of two
 glaciers, we have brought side by side two great masses of ice
made up of concave shells lying one within the other.                In the
 gradual advance of the glacier, two, or it may be several, such
 masses are pressed together within a channel much narrower
 than the aggregate of those which they separately occupied.
 Those who have followed Professor Tyndall's experiments, will
 readily understand that under such conditions concave shells of
 ice would be gradually brought to the shape of deep troughs,
 of which the transverse section would have the form of an
 elongated letter U.       It is obvious that the appearance pre
 sented by a   horizontal    section through a mass made up of such
 surfaces would be that of lines parallel to its length.              But a
 horizontal section does not correctly represent the condition of
  things seen in descending over the surface of a glacier.             Each
 successive portion of the glacier      has  undergone     in  an increased
  degree 'the process of ablation, by which it is estimated that a
 thickness of from 10 to 12 feet is in many cases annually re
 moved from the surface of the glacier.              We should therefore
  obtain a nearer approximation to the            truth  by supposing an
  elongated solid, composed of deep trough-shaped surfaces lying
  one within the other, to be cut through by a plane inclined at
  a small angle to its longer axis, so as to reduce its thickness at
  the lower end to a mere tongue.        The likeness to a glacier would
 be further increased if the edges were rounded off so as to

make the upper surface somewhat convex.            Any one who has a
difficulty in following the description may easily construct a
miniature model, by doubling together fifteen or twenty thick
nesses of leather or strong paper, and then cutting through the
fold in a direction slightly inclined to it. On paring the edges
of the new section with a sharp knife, it will be found that the
arrangement of the lines exposed on the upper face of the mo
del, and the inclination to its surface of the laminae of leather or
paper, very closely correspond to the ordinary disposition of the
veined structure in glaciers that have flowed through a narrow
valley.  If   it be objected that, as the hypothesis supposes that
several separate streams, each with its own system of veined
structure, were pressed together to make up the main glacier,
the terminal section presented by the front of the glacier should
present an equal number of systems of shell- or spoon-shaped
structure, the answer may be found in observations detailed by
M. Agassiz, and represented on his map of the Lower Aar gla
cier, which have the advantage of being supported by a great
degree of anterior probability.        Each separate ice-stream that
goes   to  make   up  the  glacier   can subsist only so long as the
supply of ice from its source meets the waste that arises during
the process of ablation.       It is not likely that any two of the
streams that supply the glacier are exactly alike in this respect :
one will bring with it a more abundant supply than the other,
and survive the longest.        Hence that one will by itself consti
tute the extreme front of the glacier, its structural surfaces will
alone be perceived, and little if any trace of the other affluents
will there be visible.
   By analogous considerations the position of the veined struc
ture may in most cases be explained; but there is one point
which it has always seemed to me difficult to reconcile with the
                              I
stratification theory, — allude to the increased dip inwards of
the constituent veins, which is constantly observed in ascending
the frontal portion of glaciers.       This disposition is common to
the great glaciers which have flowed through long channels, and

must occasionally remain.
   The cleavage of the veined structure is accounted for by the
effect of great pressure transverse to the already existing surfaces,
probably accompanied by the partial flattening of the air-bubbles
in a portion of the mass.
           I
   So far, venture to think that the stratification theory, though
not free from difficulties of its own, may well compare with its
rivals. There    is,
                   however,    class of glaciers which differ widely
                                    a
from all others in the mode of their formation, and whose struc
ture has been regarded as incompatible with that theory.                             I
allude to the "glaciers remanies" which are formed at the base
of lofty precipices when the latter are surmounted                          by
                                                                        steep
slopes of snow or ice, which from time to time descend in dust
like showers, forming avalanches, such as are watched                     by
                                                                     tourists
from their habitual haunts on the Wengern Alp and the Great

                                                                is   a
class, called the Lower Glacier of Schwarzwald, which has already
attracted the attention of M. Desor and of M. Charles Martins.
Being sufficiently easy of access, this glacier offers one of the
 most favourable opportunities for studying the structure of such
 glaciers, and I   thought myself fortunate in being able to visit                    it
 on the 13th of August last.            The form of the glacier       that of
                                                                           is
a   segment   ofa   cone, whose apex, abutting against         the  rocks,            is
 formed   by  the snow or fragments of ice that descend about 4000
 feet from a   steep slope below the peak of the Wetterhorn.             The
 glacier preserves    on   all  sides    a tolerably regular slope of  about
 30° with the horizon*, but where               abuts upon the nearly level
                                                  it
 bottom of the valley, the front              in some places cut away into
                                             is
 steep  faces from  20  to  40  feet  in  height.    On examining this part
 of the glacier, it  was found      to   be  formed for the most part of               a
 uniform mass of white ice, everywhere filled with air-bubbles,
 and without any appearance of veined structure.                The bubbles
 showed very slight and occasional traces of compression in any
 direction, in this respect differing from all ordinary glacier ice.
 Nevertheless, when masses of the ice were forcibly struck with                        a
 heavy iron-pointed stick,          it became evident that there was                   a
  distinct tendency to cleavage in parallel planes. On further exami
 nation the veined structure was found here and there imperfectly
  developed, and in    a few instances single bands of blue ice,          or     1     2
 inches thick and several      feet  in  length, perfectly clear and  without
 air-bubbles, were seen in positions conformable to the direction
  of the cleavage planes. Along the steep terminal slopes nearly

horizontal lines of gravel were 6ecn at intervals, and, as faf
as' I,was able to got access to them, I was led to the belief that
these corresponded to the outcrop of surfaces extending into
the interior 6f the glacier, and strictly conformable to the direc-.
tion of cleavage.      I  was not able to cut far into the ice, but it
appeared to me that the lines of gravel were merely superficial,
and caused by the slight projection of the edges of surfaces of
somewhat harder ice retaining minute fragments in their descent
over the face of the glacier.           Subsequent observations made
higher up led me to doubt the complete accuracy of this conclu
sion. The direction of the strike of the cleavage planes, marked
as it was   to(the eye      bythe lines of gravel, and      by
                                                           the occasional
blue veins, varied     a   good deal, partly from lateral contortion,
owing, as  it    appeared, to inequalities in the rocky bed of the
glacier,  and   partly to   a  variation in the dip, which was nearly
horizontal, but sometimes inclining outwards at small angle, a
just as we find   it  in ordinary glaciers.
    On ascending the glacier, the lower part of the surface was
found to consist of the same white ice that has been already de
 scribed, without any trace of veined structure, but having, at
intervals  of   from 10 to 15 feet, transverse dirt-lines, evidently.(
 marking   the   same structure as the gravel-lines on the terminal
 slopes.   Crevasses were pretty numerous,            disposed in lines
radiating from the apex of the cone, and often               or
                                                             6     feet, in

 width.    On the walls of these crevasses the dirt-lines were well
 marked, and had all the appearance of being produced                 thin  by
layers of dust penetrating the ice, but instead of being hori
 zontal or dipping outwards they invariably dipped inwards, to
 wards the centre of the glacier, at an angle which increased
 from below until about the middle of the glacier, where,           varied
                                                                         it
 from 30° to 40°.       In no instance was able to detect traces of

 veined structure in the walls of the crevasses.
     Above its middle region the glacier was covered with the
 remains of iboulements, which had taken place during the past
 winter and spring. The surface was irregular, but not so much
 So as
     I    have seen    it  in places where frequent falls of the con
 solidated nev6   take   place. Very few fragments of ice were seen,
 and it  seemed to me that the greater part of the mass must baye
 fallen from the upper region in the state of snow very loosely
 agglomerated.       The very fact that this glacier can be traversed
 in summer without danger,        isa  proof that it   not chiefly

explorers like to remain longer than they can avoid within their
reach.      A genuine example of this kind is seen on a terrace of
the Wetterhorn, further removed from the Scheidcck than that
which     I visited, and much higher above the valley leading to
Kosenlani.         Circumstance^ did not allow me to attempt to ex
amine it. The ascent would be rather difficult, and the passage!
of the glacier, if at all practicable, would involve some risk, un
less made in the early morning, before the ice commonly begins
to descend from the upper plateaux.
     The upper part of the Schwarzwald glacier has but few cre-^
vasscs, and it is therefore difficult to trace the dirt-lines which'
are there covered with the fresh snow fallen from above.                     I
was, however, able to convince myself that the inward dip attains
its maximum about the middle of the glacier, and gradually:
diminishes in the upper part, not exceeding 10° at the highest
point where I was able to measure it.
     1 should add, that I had direct proof of the motion of the ice
in this glacier, though this is probably slight. At the bottom,
 opposite to the centre of the terminal face, a miniature moraine,
 about 30 feet long and 3 high, had been quite freshly thrown
 up by the advance of the ice during the early part of the sum-'
 filer, but owing to its rapid waste during a warm season the ice
 had again receded 3 or 4 feet.
     I leave it to more competent authorities to decide on the sig
 nificance of the facts above stated.          To myself, it appears that
 they are not completely reconcileable with any of the hypotheses
 that have been framed to explain glacier structure. If the whole
 phamomenon were one of cleavage in planes dipping inwards at
 the middle of the glacier, and horizontally or outwards at the
 bottom, it might with much plausibility be ascribed to pressure.
 But if the clear blue veins occasionally           present are to be re
 ferred to the same cause, how is it that the air-bubbles in the
 white ice show no trace of its action ? But still more difficult it
 is to understand how any amount of pressure could cause the
 production at regular intervals of those surfaces whose presence
 is revealed by the dirt-lines, whether these are due to the pre
 sence of dirt * in the mass of the ice or not.
     The advocates of the stratification theory may maintain that
     * The determination of this point would require a sharp cutting instru
 ment, which     I  had not with me, and careful examination of the ice with a
 powerful lens. It must be recollected that an exceedingly thin film of dust,
 dispersed over a surface enclosed in a mass of ice, might be scarcely per
 ceptible, but that the melting of a thickness of several feet of the same ice,
 leaving much of the enclosed dust upon the face of the glacier, would render
 its presence plainly visible to the eye.

502           Mr.  J.  Ball on  the Structure of Glaciers.
the condition of the greater part of the materials of this glacier
is such as to make the formation of regularly stratified beds
quite possible, and it may even be admitted that the interval
 between the dirt-lines would probably correspond with the annual
 deposit, but as each bed so formed would have the shape of a
hollow cone with its apex turned upwards, it seems all but im
possible that its upper surface can correspond with that traced
 by a dirt-line in the middle of the glacier, whose form must be
that of an inverted cone or deeply concave curved surface.
    It is not for me to pronounce whether the facts and laws of
physical science yet known are adequate to solve these difficulties,
but   I may be allowed to express the conviction, that in a complete
theory of glacier structure, some further account than has yet
been taken will be made of the process by which the materials of
 the glacier are originally deposited and consolidated.        I am not
less sure that the potent influence of pressure in modifying in
ternal structure, which has been so fully developed by Professor
 Tyndall, will be recognized hereafter as one of the physical
principles that will help to explain the intricate phenomena of
glacier structure.
  „ P.S. Nearly the whole of the foregoing pages were written
before   I had an opportunity of reading the interesting paper by
Professor Huxley, contained in the October Number of this
Journal.     I will venture to make a few remarks on the con
clusions which Mr. Huxley has drawn from his recent obser
vations.
    Absence  of capillary fissures in  the deep ice. — Mr.  Huxley has
fully proved   the  incorrectness   of the  common    opinion, founded
mainly on the statements and observations of Agassiz, which
supposed the whole mass of the ice to be penetrated by capillary
fissures through which water could percolate ; but            I  do not
think that his experiments enable us to conclude that there are
no such fissures in the interior of the glacier.     If we are to adopt
that conclusion, we must then cease to believe with Professor
Tyndall, that glacier ice is enabled to advance in conformity
with the law of viscous motion, by fracture and revelation,         For
in the midst of new observations we must not lose sight of the
main facts already well established, and we owe to Professor
Forbes the certainty that the glacier advances by the gradual dif
ferential motion of contiguous portions of the mass, and not by
the separate advance of large masses which are divided by cre
vasses or open cracks.       I may observe, that all the conclusions
of Professor Forbes on this head were confirmed by observations
made by me in 1845 on the Gorner and Findelen glaciers near
Zermatt, which have remained unpublished, because           I conceived

                Mr.    J.  Ball on   the Structure of Glaciers.         508
that the proofs given by Professor Forbes were already sufficient
and complete.
    I cannot, indeed, conceive any explanation of the facts known
as to glacier movement which can consist with the entire absence
of minute cracks (whether capillary or not) penetrating that part
of the ice which is in course of gradual motion.                   True it is
that under pressure these cracks will be closed up again, and
therefore those parts of the ice not actually undergoing the pro
cess which causes the motion may well be free from fissures.
Pending further observations, which              I trust Mr. Huxley may
be induced to make,          I shall venture to adhere to the belief that
the irregular network of fissures which pervades the surface of
the ice when exposed to air and warmth, represents a structure
already existing in the ice before it came to the surface; and
that former fissures, though possibly closed so as to show no
trace under the microscope, may yet be surfaces of easy melting,
which on the first application of heat are recalled into existence.
    Air-bubbles in the ice. — In common, as          I suppose, with many
readers of Mr. Huxley's very interesting observations, the absence
of more precise details as to the circumstances under which they
were made is to me a matter of regret.              It is allowable to sup
pose that his visits to the glaciers were generally made in the
middle of the day, and during fine weather, and in that case                I
feel some doubt whether the ice within 8 or 10 inches of the
surface is in the same conditions of temperature as that of the
interior of the glacier.          I   would submit that the hour of the
day,   the  state   of   the   weather,   and of the thermometer, at the
time and previous to the observations, and also a statement of
the precautions taken to prevent the pieces of ice taken out from
undergoing changes by exposure to sun and air, would be a
valuable addition to the interesting particulars for which we are
indebted to Mr. Huxley.             Such details seem necessary for satis
factory proof of Mr. Huxley's conclusion, that the entire ice of
the glacier is pervaded by cells containing both water and air, a
fact which seems, however, no way inconsistent with rational
views of the conditions of temperature in the interior of glaciers.
                        I
    Dirt-streaks. — believe that there is no material inconsistency
between what      I  have said as to the dirt-bands of M. Agassiz, and
Mr. Huxley's observations on the same phenomenon, for which
I  gladly adopt the name
                                 " dirt-streaks."   I  would observe, how

Alps/ to which Mr. Huxley refers his readers, is far less accurate

glacier cannot possibly represent the same thing in the fore
ground, sixty or eighty yards from the eye, and in the middle

    is taken. It is true that something of the structure observed by
    Mr. Huxley may be traced for some distance along the side 'of
    the glacier above the great moraine ; but neither orith&Breiiva,

     of continuous lines or streaks distinctly visible at a distance/ and
     over a wide breadth of glacier, as represented in this illustration.
        One word more as to the so-called lenticular structure. When
     Mr. Huxley speaks of veins of ice 9 or 10 inches in thickness
     and apparently lenticular, which I suppose means that the exposed
     section thins out on either side,              I
                                           venture to question whether
     such veins form any part of the real veined structure, and whether
     they are hot instances of what is by no meanB rare,— ithe filling-
     up of small crevasses with ice generally differing m .colour and
     appearance from the surrounding mass.          I do not recollect* to
     have attended to the length of the veins, or the exposed sections
     of them on the glacier of the Brenva, but I can only say that if
     9 feet be the greatest length that can there be traced/ the struc
     ture of that glacier must differ from all those of the same class
           I
     that have ever been able to examine.

      In 1843, Dr. Draper observed that when mixtarejBficWoriiie     a

 jjfhis isj, in fact, the explanation given by Dr, Draper. He supposes

 1,statenicn,ts.y. We; found, that to whatever- kind or amount
 ?.o£;Ughl|,tfeQrgaa.,ihadi been subjected, it rapidly returned to its
 j inactive condition on exclusion of light ; that on standing in the
 .dark fop about hajjf an hour, the gas did not possess any proper-
 >,iies di&rent; from tho^e which it possessed before it had been
     exposed to light.        Hence Dr. Draper's position, as regards a
     permanent allotropic condition of either gas, becomes untenable.
   ^Efaat Dr. Draper ftmved at these conclusions by help of the ex
     periments mentioned in his former papers, in your Journal, will
     not surprise us when we become acqiiainted with the difficulty
     of obtaining by any means accurate results in this subject, and
     th6 impossibility of > so '-doing by methods so imperfect as those
 ,.,^hi?h Dr-, Draper employed.
         We have shown, in our second paper read before the Royal
'! i §o«iety> ;that the presence of a trace of foreign gas, not exceeding
'•.^jj!dth^)f! thfeitotal volume, is sufficient to alter in the most
 ; niarkedf degree the photo-chemical sensibility of the mixture.

 • similar mixture not previously exposed.            The limits of error in

 cally, separately through long tubes which could be exposed to
 the direct solar rays ; and on observing the photo-chemical pro
 perties of the mixed chlorine and hydrogen (by gas-light), first,
 when the separated gases had been strongly insolated, and
 secondly, when they had been carefully protected from light, we
 found that in the one case the combination did not take place
 more rapidly than it did in the second ; conclusively proving
 that the previous insolation of the separated gases, and hence
 any allotropic modification of either gas, cannot account for this
 slow action on the first exposure to light:      Dr. Draper's objec
 tion, that we did not expose the gases for a sufficient time to
 solar action, is not valid, inasmuch as the direct solar light to
 which they were separately exposed was several thousand times
 as intense as the small gas-flame which in four minutes effected
 the maximum action.
    The phaenomenon in question depends upon a totally different
 cause.    It belongs to a most important, but hitherto disregarded
 phase of general chemical action.       In all chemical combinations
 and decompositions a certain time must elapse before the full
 action is set up.    In no case does chemical action commence
 instantly on bringing the bodies under the requisite conditions ;
and in many instances the length of time which elapses before
the full action occurs is very considerable, so that the progres
sive phases of the combination can be distinctly traced.
    The phenomenon which we have considered is a striking ex
ample of this general condition of chemical action, of this increase
of the chemical activity with the time under which the forces
act.    This general mode of action has been named by us Che
mical Induction. We have shown in our paper on Photo-chemical
Induction, that precisely similar relations are observable in the
photographic phaenomena, and also in pure chemical actions ; our
investigations form, in fact, starting-points for the consideration
                                                         I
of time as affecting chemical action, a subject which am at pre
sent engaged in following out.
    It is almost superfluous for me to mention, regarding Dr.
Draper's experiment on the solar decomposition of chloride of
silver, that before one can believe that the black substance inso
luble in nitric acid is either a modification of the metal or " a
something which is not silver," we must know that it is not a
subchloride, particularly as Wohler states that suboxide of silver
receives a metallic lustre on burnishing.

LVIII.       Methods in     the   Integral Calculus.             By   the   Rev.   Robert
      Carmichael, A.M., Fellow of Trinity                        College, Dublin*.
1.    AN                                 of the reciprocal aid which
                  interesting exemplification
     ^1   geometry and analysis lend to each other is afforded by
the fact, that there is a large class of differential equations whose
integration may be much facilitated by the employment of geo
metrical considerations, more especially those associated with the
transformation to polar coordinates.        It is obvious, too, that
where differential equations admit of geometrical interpretations,
such interpretations are more likely to be suggested in this way
than where their integration is conducted by methods purely
analytical.
     Thus,   as a simple example,         if it     be proposed to integrate the
equation
                           xdx ¦i-ydy=m(ydw— xdy) ,
by transformation to polar coordinates we get at once
                         rdr=rnr3d0, or dr=mrd0;
whence, instantly, the curve denoted                     by the given        equation is
the logarithmic spiral
                                     r=Ceme,
or, in rectangular coordinates,
                            (*«+y*)*:=Cemt'n",(9.
   The immediate geometrical interpretation of the given equa
tion is easily seen by dividing both sides of its transformed type
by ds.       In   fact, then, we get
                                   dr_ rW '
                                   ds~~        ds
and, if Q be the intercept between the point on the curve and the
foot of the perpendicular from the origin on the tangent (P), this
equation is at once equivalent            to
                                     Q = 7»P;
or the given differential equation represents, as is known, the
plane curve for which the perpendicular from the origin on the
tangent is in a constant proportion to the intercept between the
corresponding point of contact and the foot of the perpendicular.
The curve which satisfies this condition                   is,
                                             as we have seen, the
logarithmic spiral.
   Thus the immediate geometrical interpretation of the given
equation, as well as the more remote, are with equal facility ob-

(scdx   + ydy 4-zdz)9=m*{(ydy—zdy)2+(zdx--<xdz)'2ji-(%dy—ydx)*},
and at the same time to determine its geometrical interpretations,
both immediate and remote, the same method can be employed,-
with advantage.      The equation, "obviously represefits & 'curve of

Thus the variables are separated, and the equation is reduced to
an integrable form.
   6.  If the  equation to be integrated were
                    y(t/dx—xdy) = (x +    yf. e . * dx,

   7. There are some cases in which the solution of partial dif
ferential equations may be facilitated by transformation to polar
coordinates.     In these cases the partial differential equations
reduce   themselves   to complete differential equations in a single
variable.    Thus the equation
is reduced at once to the form
            dz

which is easily integrated, and 0 replaced by x and y.

Multiply the first equation by x, the second by y, and the third
by s ; add ; and we obtain

                        u= (axyz + bxzx + cxxy) + u0,
where u0 denotes an arbitrary homogeneous function in x, y,                 t
of the order zero.
    It is to be observed, however, that w0 cannot contain any inverse
powers of x, y, z.         For instance, u0 cannot be of the form
                                       euK+/3y
                                       yx + By'
as in that case u would not satisfy the separate partial differential
equations.
    Thus the ultimate form of the required solution is
                         u=±{a1yz + blzx + clxy) + k,
where k is an arbitrary constant.

 phosphorus in sulphide of carbon added, and . the wbo}e well ¦

 red, and being left for six or twelve hours, forms the ruby fluid

 added, for the reduced gold then tends to clot about the portions
 which sink to the bottom.       . \-

    Though the sulphide of carbon is present in such processes ,
 and very useful in giving division to the phosphorus, still it is
 not essential.     A piece of clean phosphorus in a bottle of the
 gold solution gradually produces the ruby fluid at the bottom,
 but the action is very slow.       If the phosphorus be attached to
 the side of the bottle, but always beneath the surface of the
 solution, the streams of ruby fluid may be seen moving both
 upwards and downwards against the side of the glass, and form
 ing films in the vicinity of the phosphorus perfect in their golden
 reflexion, and yet transmitting light of ruby, violet, and other
 tints, thus giving, first a proof that the particles are gold, and
then connecting the present condition of the gold with that of
the films already described.      On the other hand, the phosphorus
may     be  excluded   and  the sulphide of carbon employed alone ;
for when it and the solution of gold are shaken together, the-
gold is reduced and the ruby fluid formed ; but it soon changes
to purple or violet.
    A. quick and ready mode of producing the ruby fluid, is to
put a quart of the weak solution of gold (containing about 06
of a grain of metal) into a clean bottle, to add a little solution
of phosphorus in aether, and then to shake it well for a few mo
ments: a beautiful ruby or amethystine fluid is immediately
produced, which will increase in depth of tint by a little time. >
Generally, however, the preparations made with phosphorus dis
solved in sulphide of carbon, are more ruby than those where
aether is the phosphorus        solvent.     The process of reduction
appears to consist in a transfer of the chlorine from the gold to I
the, phosphorus, and the formation of phosphoric or phosphorus

    The fluids produced may easily be tested for any gold yet
remaining unreduced, by trial of a portion with solution of proto-
chloride of tin.     If any be found, it is easily reduced by the
addition of a little more of the phosphorus in solution. After
all the gold is separated as solid particles, the fluid may be con
sidered in its perfected state.        Occasionally it may smell of
phosphorus in excess, even after it has been poured off from the
deposited particles of it and the sulphide.      In that case it is easy
to deprive it of this excess by agitation in a bottle with air.
When kept in closed vessels mouldiness often occurs.             If this
be in groups, it is collected with facility at the end of a splinter
of wood and removed, or the whole fluid may be poured through
a wet plug of cotton in the neck of a funnel, the reduced gold
passing freely.    All the vessels used in these operations must be
very   clean;  though     of glass they should not be supposed in
 proper  condition  after  wiping, but should be soaked in water, and
 after that rinsed with distilled water.      A glass supposed to be
clean, and even a new bottle, is quite able to change the cha
 racter of a given gold fluid.
    Fluids thus prepared may differ much in appearance.           Those
 from the basins, or from the stronger solutions of gold, are often
 evidently turbid, looking brown or violet in different lights.
 Those prepared with weaker solutions and in bottles, are fre
 quently more amethystine or ruby in colour and apparently clear.
 The latter, when in their finest state, often remain unchanged
 for many months, and have all the appearance of solutions.
 But they never are such, containing in fact no dissolved, but
 only diffused gold. The particles are easily rendered evident, by
 gathering the rays of the sun (or a lamp) into a cone by a lens,
 and sending the part of the cone near the focus into the fluid ;
 the cone becomes visible, and though the illuminated particles
 cannot be distinguished because of their minuteness, yet the
 light they reflect is golden in character, and seen to be abun
 dant in proportion to the quantity of solid gold present.          Por
 tions of fluid so dilute as to show no trace of gold, by colour or
  appearance, can have the presence of the diffused solid particles
  rendered evident by the sun in this way. When the preparation
 is deep in tint, then common observation by reflected light shows
  the suspended particles, for they produce a turbidness and degree
  of opacity which is sufficiently evident.        Such a preparation
  contained in a pint bottle will seem of a dull pale-brown colour,
  and nearly opake by reflexion, and yet by transmission appear to
  be a fine ruby, either clear or only slightly opalescent.

pension only, is also shown by the deposit which occurs when
they are left at rest.    If the gold be comparatively abundant, a
part will soon settle, i. e. in twenty-four or forty-eight hours ;
but if the preparation be left for six or eight months, a part will
still remain suspended.       Even in these portions, however, the
diffused state of the gold is evident ; for where, as in some cases,
the top to the depth of half an inch or more has become clear,
it is seen that the ruby portion below is as a cloud sinking from it ;
and in the part which has apparently been cleared from colour
by the settling of the particles, the lens and cone of light still
show the few, or rather the fine diffused particles yet in suspen
sion, though the protochloride of tin can show no gold in solu
tion.     The mould or mucus before spoken of, often collects the
larger, heavier particles, and becomes of a dark blue colour; it
may then be taken out by a splinter of wood, and being shaken
in water, disengages the particles, which issue from it in clouds
like the sporules from a ripe puff-ball.
    A gradual change goes on amongst the particles diffused
through these fluids, especially in the cases where the gold is com
paratively abundant.       It appears to consist of an aggregation.
Fluids, at first clear or almost clear to ordinary observation,
become turbid ; being left to stand for a few days, a deposit falls.
If   the supernatant fluid be separated and left to stand, another
deposit may be obtained.        This process may be repeated, and
whilst the deposition goes on, the particles in the fluid still seem
to aggregate ; it is only when the fluid is deprived of much gold
that the process appears to stop. Even after the fluid has
attained a fine marked ruby tint, if allowed to stand for months
in a place of equable temperature, the colouring particles will
appear in floating clouds, and probably the aggregation is then
still going on. That the particles of gold when they touch
each other do in many cases adhere together with facility, is
shown in many experiments.          In order to test this matter me
chanically,    I gave much agitation to a dense ruby fluid, but did
not find it cause any sensible change in the character.        When
gold particles of a much larger size were agitated in water, they
did cohere together, and the fluid, which required a certain time
for settling at the beginning of the experiment, settled in a much
shorter time at the termination.
    If  these fluids be examined generally their appearances differ,
not merely under different circumstances, but also under the same
circumstances, though they always consist of a colourless liquid
and diffused particles of gold.       A certain fluid in a bottle or
glass, looked at from the front, i. e. the illuminated side by
general daylight, may appear hazy and amethystine, whilst in
bright sunlight it will appear light brown and almost opake.

From behind, the same fluid may appear of a pure blue in both
lights, whilst from the side it may appear amethystine or ruby.
These differences result from the mixture of reflected and trans
mitted lights, both derived from the particles, the former appear
ing in greatest abundance from the front or side, and the latter
from behind.        The former is seen by common observation in a
purer    state if a  black background be placed behind the fluid ;
when a white background is there, much of the transmitted
light from that source comes to the eye, and the appearance is
greatly altered.       A mode of observing the former by a strong
ray of light and a lens has been already described ; but even in
that case some effects of transmitted light are observed if the
focus is thrown deep into the fluid; and it is only the particles
 near the surface, whether illuminated by the base or the apex
of the cone, which give the nearly pure effect of reflexion.                     In
order to observe the transmitted ray in an unmingled state, a
glass tube closed at one end was surrounded with a tube of black
paper longer than itself, and with the black surface inwards.

stand for a week, a second deposit will be produced ; if the fluid
be again removed and allowed to stand for some months, another
deposit will be obtained, and the fluid will probably be of a
bright ruby; if it be now allowed to stand ^for several months, it
will still yield a deposit, looking however more like a ruby fluid

The second and the third had the same character, perhaps the
fourth,   if  the subdivision into portions had been numerous                   ;

white of paper and others followed progressing to the finest,
                    ;
which transmitted    rich ruby tint.

                                             It    is
these deposits were mixtures of particles having different cha
racters, and this   perhaps the reason that in some cases; when,
                        is
the fluids were contained in round-bottomed flasks, the Ifens-like

618        Prof. Faraday on   the   Experimental Relations
 deposit was ruby at the edges, though deep violet in the middle,
 the former having settled last; but as a pure blue deposit could
 be obtained, and also one transmitting a pure ruby ray, and as
 a comparatively pure intermediate preparation transmitting a
 ruby violet, or amethystine ray, was obtained, it is probable that
 all gradations from blue to ruby exist; for the production of
       I
 which can see no reason to imagine any other variation than the
 existence of particles of intermediate sizes or proportions.
    When light other than white was passed through the fluids,
then of course other tints were produced, yet some of these were
 unexpected.     A fluid of a pure blue colour, whilst in the dark
 tube, would in an open glass and by reflected light appear of a
strong ruby-violet tint.     Dropping some of the wet deposit into
pure water, the striae which it formed would in one part he ruby
 in colour and in another violet : these effects were referable to
the light reflected from the solid particles back through the
fluid to the eye, but it seemed redder than any which light
reflected from gold was likely to produce.         However, upon re
 garding the surface of dull gold-leaf, or the thick wet deposit of
gold, or the hand, it was found that the red rays easily passed
 through the blue fluid and formed a ruby-violet tint.        Prevost
 showed in old times, how much the red and warm rays are re
flected by gold, in preference to the others contained in white light.
    The supernatant fluid in specimens that had stood long and
 deposited, was always ruby ; yet because it showed no dissolved
 gold, because it showed the illuminated cone by the lens, and
because by standing ruby clouds settled in         it,
                                                     there was every
reason to believe that the gold was there in separated particles,
 and that such specimens afforded cases of extreme division, which
 by  long standing would form deposits of the finest kind.    .
    Those fluids which on standing gave abundance of deposits,
transmitting blue light, consisted in the first instance of particles
transmitting  a   ruby light, and in these cases   itwould seem that
the particles at their first separation were always competent to
transmit this ruby light and
                          ;         ifthe preparation were not too
rich in gold the ruby condition appeared to be retained, the
division being then most extreme.        But purple or amethystine
fluids could be procured, which, containing no colouring parti
 cles other than suspended gold, still retained them in suspension
for many months together, so that they must have been as light
or as finely divided as those in the ruby fluids. When the phos
phorous aether was employed for the reduction of the gold, such
fluids occurred; also when the solution of the phosphorus in
sulphide of carbon was used, provided the solution of gold had
a  very little chloride of sodium contained   in it. They appear to
show that the mere degree of division    isnot the only circumstance

  which determines the aptitude to transmit in preference this or
  that ray of light.
      Considering the fluids as owing their properties to diffused
  particles, it may be observed, that many of them which in small
  quantities in the dark tube transmit an amethystine light, send
  forward a ruby light when the quantity is increased ; and this
  appears to be the general progression.             I hare not found any
  which by increase in quantity tended to transmit the blue rays
  in preference to the red.
      Elevation of temperature had an effect upon these fluids which
  is advantageous in their preparation.        On boiling an apparently
  clear ruby fluid for some time, its colour passed a little towards
  amethystine, and on boiling a like amethystine fluid, its tint
  passed towards blue.       The separation of the gold particles was
  also facilitated, for now they would settle in three or four days
  from a fluid which, prior to this operation, would not have depo
  sited them in an equal degree for weeks.                In the case of the
  ruby fluids the colour often became more rosy and luminous, and
  by reflected light the fluid seemed to have become more turbid,
  as if the particles had gained in reflective power ; in fact, the
  boiling often appeared to confer a sort of permanency on the
   particles in their new state.    When settled, they formed collec
  tions looking like little lenses of a deep ruby or violet colour,
  at the bottom of the flasks containing the fluid ; when all was
  shaken up, the original fluid was reproduced, and then, by rest,
  the gold re-settled.      This effect could be obtained repeatedly.
  The particles could fall together within a certain limit, but many
  weeks did not bring them nearer or into contact ; for they re
  mained free to be diffused by agitation. The space they oc
  cupied in this lens-like form must have been a hundredfold, or
  even a thousandfold, more than that which they would have
  filled as solid gold.      Whether the particles be considered as
  mutually repulsive, or else as molecules of gold with associated
  envelopes of water, they evidently differ in their physical con
   dition, for the time, from those particles which by the applica
  tion of salt or other substances are rendered mutually adhesive,
   and so fall and clot together.

      In preparing some of these fluids, made the solution of gold
- hot and boiling before adding the solution of phosphorus.                 The
   phenomena       were the  same  in  kind    as   before:     but  when    the
  phosphorus was dissolved in sulphide of carbon, the gold soon
  fell as a dark flocculent deposit ; when it was dissolved in aether,
- a more permanent turbid ruby fluid was obtained, which, if it
   does not go on changing in aggregation, may give a good ruby
   deposit.

      The particles in these fluids are remarkable for a set of phy

520          Prof. Faraday on    the  Experimental Relations
sical alterations occasioned by bodies in small quantities, which
do not act chemically on the gold, or change its intrinsic nature ;
for through all of them it seems to remain gold in a tine state of
division. They occur most readily where the particles are finest,
i. e. in the ruby fluids, and so readily that it is difficult to avoid
them ; they are often occasioned by the contact of vessels which
are supposed to be perfectly clean.        An idea of their nature may
be obtained in the following manner.          Place a layer of ruby fluid
in a clean white plate, dip the tip of a glass rod in a solution of
 common salt and touch the ruby fluid ; in a few moments the
 fluid will become blue or violet-blue, and sometimes almost co
 lourless: by mingling up the neighbouring parts of the fluid, it
 will be seen how large a portion of it can be affected by a small
 quantity of the salt.      By leaving the whole quiet, it will be found
 that  the  changed gold tends to deposit far more readily than when
 in the ruby state. If the experiment be made with a body of fluid
 in a glass, twelve or twenty-four hours will suffice to separate gold
 which in the ruby state has remained suspended for six months.
     The fluid changed by common salt or otherwise, when most
 altered, is of a violet-blue, or deep blue.         Any tint, however,
  between this and the ruby may be obtained, and, as it appears
  fo me, in either of two ways ; for the intermediate fluid may be
  a mixture of ruby and violet fluids, or, as is often the case, all the
  gold in the fluid may be in the state producing the intermediate
  colour : but as the fluid may in all cases be carried on to the
  final violet-blue state,  I will, for brevity sake, describe that only
  in a particular manner.      The violet or blue fluid, when examined
  by the sun's rays and a lens, always gives evidence showing that
  the gold has not been redissolved, but is still in solid separate
  particles ; and this is confirmed by the non-action of protochlo-
  ride of tin, which, in properly prepared fluids, gives no indica
  tion of dissolved gold. When a ruby solution is rendered blue
   by common salt, the separation of the gold as a precipitate is
   greatly hastened ; thus when a glass jar containing about half a
   pint of the ruby fluid had a few drops of brine added and stirred
   into the lower part, the lower half of the fluid became blue whilst
   the upper remained ruby ; in that state the cone of sun's rays
   was beautifully developed in both parts.         On standing for four
   hours the lower part became paler, a dark deposit of gold fell,
   and then the cone was feebly luminous there, though as bright as
   ever in the ruby above.      In three days no cone was visible in the
   lower fluid ;  a fine cone appeared in the upper. After many days
   the salt diffused gradually through the whole, first turningthe gold
   it came in contact with blue, and then causing its precipitation.
      Such results would seem to show that this blue gold is aggre
   gated gold, i. e. gold in larger particles than before, since they

                  of Gold and other Metals    to Light.            521
precipitate through the fluid in a time which is as nothing to
that required by the particles of the ruby fluid from which they
are obtained.      But that the blue particles are always merely
larger particles   does not seem admissible for a moment, inasmuch
as violet or blue fluids may be obtained in which the particles
will remain in suspension as long as in the ruby fluids ; there is
probably some physical change in the condition of the particles,
caused by the presence of the salt and such affecting media,
which is not a change of the gold as gold, but rather a change
of the relation of the surface of the particles to the surrounding
 medium,      ^onnio
    When salt is added in such quantity as to produce its effect
in a short time, it is seen that the gold reflexion of the particles
 is quickly diminished, so that either as a general turbidness or
by the cone of rays it becomes less visible ; at last the metal
contracts into masses, which are comparatively so few and sepa
rate, that when shaken up in the fluid, they confer little or no
colour or character, either by reflected or transmitted light.      In
these cases no re-solution of the metal is effected, for neither
the salt nor hydrochloric acid, when used in like manner, have
 any power to redissolve the gold.     The same aggregating effect is
 shown with all the fluids whatever their colour, and also with
the deposits that settle down from them.         When salt is added to
the solution of gold before the phosphorus, and therefore before
the reduction of the gold, the fluid first produced is always ruby ;
 but it becomes violet, purple, or blue, with a facility in propor
tion to the quantity of salt present.       If  that be but small, the
ruby will remain for many days unchanged in colour, and the
 violet-ruby for many weeks, before the gold will be deposited,
 the degree of dilution or concentration        always having its own
 particular effect, as before described ; the more finely divided pre
 parations^', e. the ruby and amethystine, appear to be more perma
 nent than when the salt is added after the separation of the gold.
     Many other bodies besides salt have like action on the par
 ticles of gold. A ruby fluid is changed to or towards blue by
  solutions of chlorides of calcium, strontium, manganese; sul
  phates of magnesia, manganese, lime ; nitrates of potassa, soda,
  baryta, magnesia, manganese ; acetates of potassa, soda and lime;
  these effect the change freely : the sulphate of soda, phosphates
  of soda and potassa, chlorate of potassa, and acetate of ammonia
  acted feebly.    Sulphuric and hydrochloric acids produce the
  change, but show no tendency to dissolve the gold.        Nitric acid
  acts in the same manner, but not so strongly : it often causes
  re-solution of the gold after some time, because of the hydro
  chloric acid which remains in the fluid.
     Amongst the alkalies, potash produces a similar action in a

522            Prof. Faraday      on the     Experimental Relations
weak degree. So also does soda. Lime-water produces a change
in the same direction, but the gold quickly precipitates associated
with the lime.
    Ammonia causes the ruby fluid to assume a violet tint; the
deposit is slow of formation and often ruby in colour ; the alkali
apparently retards the' action of common salt.
    Chlorine or nitromuriatic acid turns the ruby fluid blue t/r
violet-blue before they dissolve the gold.
     Solution of sulphuretted hydrogen changes the ruby slowly
to purple, and finally to deep blue. iEther, alcohol, camphine,
sulphide of carbon, gum, sugar, and glycerine cause little or no
change in the fluids ; but glycerine added to the dense deposits
 causes serious condensation and alteration of them, so that it
•could not be employed as a medium for the suspension of par
ticles in the microscope.
     All endeavours to convert the violet gold back Into rutoy were
 either failures, or very imperfect in their results.      A violet fluid
 will, upon long standing, yield a deposit and a supernatant ruby
 fluid, but this I believe to be a partial separation of a mixture of
 violet and ruby gold, by the settlement of the blue or violet gold
 from ruby gold, which remains longer in suspension.             Mucus,
which often forms in portions of these fluids that have been exposed
 to the air, appears sometimes to render a fluid more ruby, but
this it does by gathering up the larger violet particles ; it often
 becomes dark blue or even black by the particles of gold adhering
 to it,  many of which may be shaken out                      by

 ruby before solution.        would rather appear that the finer ruby

       The state of division of these particles must be extreme;

   Whether those that are ruby have their colour dependent upon
   a particular degree of division, or generally upon their being
   under a certain size, or whether it is consequent in part upon
   some other condition of the particles, is doubtful ; for judging
   oi their magnitude by the time occupied in their descent
   through the fluid, it would appear that violet and blue fluids
  occur giving violet deposits, which still consist of particles so
   small as to require a time equally long with the ruby particles
   for their deposition, and indeed in some specimens to remain
   undeposited in any time which has yet occurred since their for

 ;  I    endeavoured to obtain an idea of the quantity of gold in a
   given ruby fluid, and for this purpose selected a plate of gold
(ruby glass, of good full colour, to serve as a standard, and
   compared different fluids with          varying their depth, until the
                                          it,
   light from white paper, transmitted through them, was ap
   parently equal to that transmitted            by
                                                the standard glass.             Then
   known quantities of these ruby fluids were evaporated to dry
   ness, the gold converted into chloride, and compared                     byreduc
   tion on glass and otherwise with solutions of gold of known
   strengths. A portion of chloride of gold, containing 0"7 of                       a
   grain of metal, was made up to 70 cubic inches by the addition
   of distilled water, and converted into ruby fluid on the sixth :
    day it  was compared with the ruby glass standard, and with                      a
    depth of 1*4 inch was found equal to it; there was just one
   hundredth of     a grain of gold diffused through              a   cubic inch of
    fluid. In another comparison, some gold leaves were dissolved
    and converted into ruby fluid, and compared              ;   the result was      a
    fluid, of which l-5 inch in depth equalled the standard,                     a leaf
    of gold being contained in 27 cubic inches of the fluid. Hence
    looking through     a depth of 2-7 inches, the quantity of gold
    interposed between the light and the eye would equal that con
    tained in the thickness of       aleaf of gold. Though the leaf                  is
    green and the fluid ruby, yet         it   easy to perceive that more

    of very different sizes (or that settle at least with very different
    degrees of rapidity), so    it   probable that the degree of colour,

524          Prof. Faraday   on the Experimental Relations
 and the quantity     of* gold present, may not be always in tie
 same    proportion. I need hardly say that mere dilution does
 not alter the tint sensibly, i. e. if a deep ruby fluid be put into a
 cylindrical vessel, and the eye look through it along thaaxis'''6f
 the vessel, dilution of the fluid to eight or ten times its volume
 does not sensibly alter the light transmitted.        From these Con
 siderations, it would appear that one volume of gold is present
 in the ruby fluid in about 750,600 volumes of water; and' that
 whatever the state of division to which the1 gold may be reduced,
 still the proportion of the solid particles to the' amount of space
 through which they are dispersed must be of that extreirte pro
 portion:    This accords perfectly with their invisibility in the mi
 croscope ; with the manner of their separation from' thfedr? solved
 state ; with the length of time during which they can remain
 diffused; and with their appearance when ilramiriatecFrif'the

    The deposits, when not fixed upon glass or paper, are Ttrach
 changed by drying; they cannot be again wetted to'tHie'lsame
 degree as before, or be again diffused; and the light reflected
or refracted is as to colour much altered, as might be expected.
 Whilst diffused through water, they seem to be physical associ
ations of metallic centres with enveloping films of water, and as
they sink together will lie for months at the bottom of the fluid
 without uniting or coming nearer to each other1, or without being
 taken up by metallic mercury put into the same vessel.            This
                                           '
 is consistent with what we know of the mannor in which gold
and platinum can be thoroughly wetted if cleaned in water, and
of the difference which occurs when they are dried' and become
 invested with air.    I endeavoured to trarisfer the gold1 particles
 unchanged into other media, for the purpose of noting any
alteration in the action On' light.       By ddcantingthe water very
closely, and then carefully adding alcohol wfth agitation, I could
diffuse them through that fluid ; they still possessed a blue
colour when looked through in the dark tube, but seemed much
condensed or aggregated, for the fluid Wats obscure, not clear,
and the particles soon subsided.             I could not transfer them
from alcohol to camphlne; they refused association with the
latter fluid, retaining a film of alcohol or water, and' 'adhering
by it to the glass of the vessel ; but when the camphirie wa's0
removed, a partial diffusion of them in fresh alcohol could be
effected,  and gave the colour as before. All these transfers, how
ever, injured the particles as to their condition of division.       In
one case I obtained a ruby film on a white plate; on pouring off
the water and allowing parts to become dry, these became violet;
seen by the light going through them to the plate and back
again to the eye.       I could not wet these places with ^vater* a

were dry from water they remained rosy, became bluish when
dry from the alcohol, and became rosy again when re-wetted
by it. _      .  -j   ,;.,, , ........ _

set of particles, in very small quantity apparently, yet containing
all that was present in the bulky green deposit. If the solution

precipitation    is  to appearance much less the reflexion by the

described.       The loose gold particles quickly adhere together.

larger quantity,   a more   bulky precipitate fell and more quickly.
Acid very much reduced this in quantity, dissolving out oxide of
tin, and leaving little else than finely-divided gold, which, when
diffused and examined in the dark tube, transmitted a blue colour.
I  believe the purple of Cassius to be essentially finely-divided
gold, associated with more or less of oxide of tin.
    Tartaric acid being added to a weak solution of gold gradually
reduced it.     The amethystine tint produced by diffused parti
cles first appeared, and then a blue deposit of larger particles,
whilst the side and bottom of the glass became covered by an
adhering film of finer particles, presenting the perfect ruby tint
of gold.
    iEther added to a weak solution of gold gradually reduced it^
the fluid was brown by reflected light, fine blue by transmitted
light, and gave a good cone by the sun's rays and lens.           The
blue colour was not deep, though all the gold had been sepa
rated from solution ; the preparation        closely resembled' th$t
made with protosulphate of iron and a little acid.
    A weak solution of gold, mingled with a little sugar, being
heated, yielded a very characteristic decomposition.       The gold
was reduced into diffused particles, which rendered the fluid of a
ruby-amethystine colour, and which, upon standing for twenty-
four hours, gave signs of separation by settling as on former
 occasions.   A little glycerine with solution of gold reduces it
 at common temperatures, producing a fluid, brown by reflexion,
 blue by transmission, giving a fine cone of rays by its suspended
 particles.   Heat quickens the action, and causes a blue deposit.
     Organic tissues often reduce solutions of gold, light if present
 assisting the action ; and they afford valuable evidence in aid of
 the solution of the question relative to the condition of the
 metal in the divided state.    If the skin be touched' with!ja80tr3-
 tion of gold, it soon becomes stained of a dull purple colour."^
 a piece of the large gut of an ox be soaked first in water; 'tHen
 in a solution of gold, and be afterwards taken out and allowed tb
 dry, either exposed to light or not, the inner membrane will be
 come so stained, that though of a dull purple colour by common
 observation, a transmitted ray will show it to be generally a Very
 fine ruby, equal to that of ruby-coloured glass, or the gold fluids
 already described, though perhaps in places of a beautiful violet
 hue.     The character of the particles which are here located and
 not allowed to diffuse and aggregate, as in the fluids, will be
 resumed when dealing with the whole question of the metallic
 nature of the particles of the variously-divided gold.
     Chloride of gold is reducible by heat alone.       If a drop 'of
  solution of chloride of gold be evaporated in a watch-gla^s,     Vjr
  on a plate of rock-crystal, and then heated over      a spirit-lamp

               of Gold and other Metals to Light.                      527
until the gold is reduced, it will generally be found that th«
vapour has carried a portion of gold on to the neighbouring
part of the glass, and that this part, when placed over a sheet
of white paper, has the ruby tint. With the rock-crystal both
ruby and blue parts are produced ; and when the ruby parts are
subjected to rock-crystal pressure, they become beautifully green.
In the arts also glass is oftentimes coloured ruby by gold;                I
think that glass in this state derives its colour from diffused
divided gold ; and if either the ruby glass or the watch-glass be
examined by a lens and the cone of rays, it will be seen that
the colours are not due to any gold dissolved, but to solid and
diffused particles.   There is nothing in any of the appearances
 or characters, or in the processes resorted to to obtain the
 several effects, that point at any physical difference in the
 nature of the results ; and without saying that gold cannot pro
 duce a ruby colour whilst in combination or solution, I think that
in all these cases the ruby tint is due simply to the presence of
                                                         '

              Metallic character    of the   divided qold.        ,   !
    Hitherto it may seem that   I   have assumed the various pre
parations of gold, whether ruby, green, violet, or blue in colour,
to consist of that substance in a metallic divided state.     I will
now put together the reasons which cause me to draw that conr
elusion.     With regard to gold-leaf no question respecting its
metallic nature can arise, but it offers evidence reaching to the
other preparations.      The green colour conferred by pressure,
and the removal of this colour by heat, evidently belong to it as
a metal ; these effects are very striking and important as regards
 the action on light, and where they recur with other forms of
 gold, may be accepted as proof that the gold is in the metallic
 state.   Although I do not attach equal importance to the fact
 already described, that gold-leaf frequently presents fine parts
 that appear to be ruby in colour, I am not as yet satisfied that
 they are not in themselves ruby ; and if they should be so, it
 will be another proof by analogy of the metallic nature of other
 kinds of preparations eminently ruby.
 '
     The, deflagrations of gold wire by the Leyden discharge can
 be nothing but divided gold.     They are the same whatever the
 atmosphere surrounding      them at the time, or whatever the sub
  stance on which they are deposited.    They have all the chemical
 reactions of gold, being, though so finely divided, insoluble in
 the fluids that refuse to act on the massive metal, and soluble in
 those that dissolve it,  producing the same result. Heat makes

 the same peculiar effect that            had with preparations of gold

    It may be thought that the fluid preparations present more
difficulty to the admission, that they are simply cases of pure
gold in  a    divided state ; yet have come to that conclusion, and
                                    I

film has every character of lustre, colour, &c, in the parts dif
fering in thickness, that a film formed at the surface has. Whilst
the particles are diffused through the fluid it is difficult to deal
with them hy tests and reagents ; for their absolute quantity is
very small, and their physical characters are very changeable,
chiefly as  I believe by aggregation, still there are some expe
dients which enable one to submit even the finest of them to
pjfoof. In several cases particles from ruby and amethystine fluids
adhered, to. the sides of the bottles or flasks in which the fluids
had been preserved, and the process of boiling seemed to favour
such a result ; the adhesion was so strong, that when the fluid
contents were removed and the bottles well washed, the glass
remained tinged of a ruby or a violet colour..         These films, in
which the fine particles were fixed mechanically apart and in
place, were then submitted to the action of various chemical
agents.    Drying and access of air did. not cause any marked
alterations in them.      Strong nitric acid produced no change,
nor hydrochloric acid, nor sulphuric acid.        Neither did a solu
tion of chloride of sodium, even up to brine, cause any alteration
in the colour or any other character of the deposit, A little
solution of chlorine or of nitromuriatic aeid dissolved them at
once, producing the ordinary solutions of gold.          I  can see no
other   mode  of accounting   for these effects (which are in strong
contrast with what happens when ruby fluid is acted on by these
agents), than to suppose that the gold particles, being in, a high
state of division, were retained in that state for the time by their
adhesion to the glass.     Of course chemical change was free to
occur, but not a change dependent upon their mutual aggrega
tion ; yet they were not held by any special chemical attraction
to, or combination with, the glass; for a touch with a card, a
feather, or the finger, was sufficient to remove them at once, and
if rubbed  off with a point of wood, they coated it with brilliant
metallic gold.                                  u!'mi <m"Jrt) <aiIhJ9m
    Again, though these particles are so finely divided that-.they ¦•
pass easily through ordinary filters, still a close filter catches
some ; and if a ruby fluid be passed through again and again,
the paper at last becomes of a rosy hue, because of the gold
which adheres to it ; being then well washed, and, if needful,
dried, the gold is again ready for experiment. Such gold paper,
placed across the middle of the dark tube and examined by trans
mitted light, was of the same ruby tint as when looked through
in the open air. It wa3 unaffected by salt or brine, though
these, added to the rosy fluid which had passed the filter, in
stantly changed it to violet-blue. Portions of the paper were
put into separate glasses with brine, solutions of hydrochloric; •'
nitric and sulphuric acids, ammonia, potassa, soda and sulphu-

retted hydrogen, but no change occurred with any of them in
two days.     On the other hand, a very dilute solution of chlorine
immediately turned the ruby to blue, and then gradually disr
solved the gold.      A piece of the ruby paper immersed in a
strong   solution  of cyanide of potassium suffered a very slow
action, if any, and remained unaltered in colour ; being brought
out into the air, the gold very gradually dissolved, becoming
first blue.   A portion of the ruby paper was dried and heated
in oil until the oil and the paper began to change their hqe j the
gold had not altered in its colour or character.       Another porr
tion was heated in the vapour of alcohol and also of sether until
the paper began to alter ; the gold remained unaltered.      A blue
fluid being passed oftentimes through a filter gave a blue paper,
which, being washed and tried in the same manner, was found
to contain particles unchanged by the simple acids or alkalies,
or by heat or vapours, but dissolving, as gold would do, in chlo
rine or nitromuriatic acid.      These tests are, I think, sufficient
to prove the metallic nature and permanence of the gold as it
exists in the ruby, amethystine, violet, and other coloured fluids.
    The production by such different agents as phosphorus, sul
phide of carbon, aether, sugar, glycerine, gelatine, tartaric acid,
protosulphate of iron and protochloride of tin, of gold fluids all
more or less red or ruby at the commencement, and all passing
through the same order of changes, is again a proof that only
gold was separated ; no single one or common compound of gold,
as an oxide or a phosphide, could be expected in all these cases.
Many of the processes, very different as to the substances em
ployed to reduce the gold, left good ruby films adhering to the
 glass vessels used, presenting all the characters of the gold
 described already ; this was the case with phosphorus, sugar,
tartaric acid, protosulphate of iron, and some other bodies.
    Again, the high reflective power of these particles (unalter
able by acids and salts), when illuminated by the sun's rays and
a lens, and the colour of the light reflected, is in favour of their
metallic character.      So also is their aggregation, and their
refusal to return from blue, violet or amethystine to ruby ; for
the cohesive and adhering force of the gold particles and their
metallic nature and perfect cleanliness is against such a reverse
change.     Particles transmitting blue light could be obtained in
such quantity as to admit of their being washed and dried in a
tube, and being so prepared they presented every character of
gold : when heated, no oxygen, water, phosphorus, acid of phos
phorus, nor any other substance was evolved from them : they
changed a little, as the film when heated changed, becoming
more reflective and of a pale brown colour, and contracted into
aggregated porous masses of pure ordinary gold.

    Gold is reduced from its solution by organic tissues; and
stained gut has been quoted as a case.      I have a very line speci
men which by transmitted light is as pure a ruby as gold-stained
glass, and I believe that the gold has been simply reduced and
diffused through the tissue.      The preparation stood all the trials
that had been applied to the ruby films on glass or the gold
deposit on filtering-paper.      Portions of it remained soaking in
water,   solution of chloride  of  sodium and dilute sulphuric acid
for weeks, but these caused no change from ruby to blue, such
as could be effected on loose ruby particles.         Strong hydro-r
chloric acid caused no change as long as the tissue held together j
but as that became loose, the gold flowed out into the acid in
ruby-amethystine streams, finally changing to blue. Caustic
potassa caused no change for days whilst the tissue kept to
gether, but on mixing all up by pressure, the loosened gold
became at last blue.       Strong nitric acid caused no change of
colour until, by altering the tissue, the gold particles first flowed
out in ruby and amethystine streams, and then were gradually
changed to the condition of common aggregated gold.                All
these effects, and the actions on light, accord with the idea jth^t
the stain was simply due to diffused particles of finely-divided
 gold ; and I am satisfied that all such stains upon the skin, or
other organic matter, are of exactly the same nature.
                                     I
    As to the gold in ruby glass, think a little consideration is
sufficient to satisfy one that it is in the metallic condition.   The
action of heat tends to separate gold from its state of combi
nation, and when so separated from the chloride, either upon
the surface of glass, rock-crystal, topaz, or other inactive bodies,
a ruby film of particles is frequently obtained.        The sunlight,
and lens show that in ruby glass the gold is in separated and
 diffused particles.   The parity of the gold glass, with the ruby-
 gold deflagrations   and   fluids described, is very great.    These
 considerations, with the sufficiency of the assigned cause tp pro
 duce the ruby-tint, are strong reasons, in the absence of any to
 the contrary, to induce the belief that finely-divided metallic
 gold is the source of the ruby colour.
     When a pure, clean, stiff jelly is prepared, and mixed, whilst
 warm and fluid, with a little dilute chloride of gold, as if to
 prepare a ruby fluid, it gelatinizes when cold, and if left for two
 or three days may become a ruby jelly ; sometimes, however, the
 gold in the jelly changes but little or changes to blue, or it may
 happen that it is reduced on the surface as a film, brilliant ana
 metallic by reflected light, and blue-gray by transmitted light.
 I  have not yet ascertained the circumstances determining one or
 the other state. If a trace of phosphorus in sulphide of carbon
 be added to the solution of gold in a dilute state, and some salt

   be added to the warm jelly, and the latter be then mixed gra
   dually and with agitation with the gold solution, a ruby jelly is
  generally produced.          In such ruby jelly the reduced particles of
   gold preserve     their  state and relative place, and the tint does not
  pass to blue, even though a considerable proportion of salt be
     resent.    Such jelly will remain in the air for weeks' before it
  5ecays, and has every character, in colour and appearance, of
   gold ruby glass.        It is hardly possible to examine the series of
  ruby glass, ruby membrane, ruby jelly cold and gelatinous, niby
  jelly warm and fluid, and the ruby fluids, to consider their pro
   duction, and then to conclude that the cause of their common
   ruby colour is not the same in all.            ,w.

   change will occur for any number of times, as often as the jelly
  is wetted and dried.          Here the gold remains in the same me
  tallic state through this great change of colour, the association or
  the absence of water being the cause : and the effect 'strengthens
  in my mind the thought before expressed, that in the ruby
  fluids the deposited particles arc frequently associates of water
  and gold.' It is a striking case of the joint effect of the media
  and the gold in their action on the rays of light, and the most
  striking ease amongst those where the medium may be changed

  place   in  the  ruby tint, no gold is removed.      When the last water

         Relations of Gold     {and other metals) to  polarised Light.
      It has been already stated, that when a jay of common bght
  passes through a piece of gold-leaf inclined to the ray, the light
  is polarized.       When the angle between the leaf and the ray is
  small, about 15°, nearly all the light that passes is polarized ; but
  as tbe leaf is really very irregular in thickness, and ill-stretched
  as a film, parts inclined at different angles are always present at
  once.     The light transmitted is polarized in the same direction
  as that transmitted by a bundle of thin plates of glass, inclined
ijjftjflft same direction. The proportion of light transmitted is
   small, as might be expected from the high reflective power of
   the metal.        The polarization does not seem due to any con
   strained condition of the beaten gold, for it Is produced, as will
  be shortly seen, by the annealed colourless leaf-gold, and also by
   deposits of gold particles; but is common to it with other un-
   crystallized transparent substances.         It would seem that a very
   small proportion of tbe gold-leaf can be occupied by apertures,

684             Prof. Faraday on     the   Experimental Relations
since the    light which passes is nearly all polarized.        Oh sub
jecting    thin  gold-leaf, or heated gold-leaf,  or  filths of  gold, or
any preparations which required the support of glass, results of
polarization were obtained, but the observations were imperfect
 because of the interfering effect of the glass.
     Proceeding to employ a polarized ray of light, it was found
 that a leaf of gold produced generally the same depolarizing
 effect as other transparent bodies.     Thus, if a plate of glass be
 held perpendicular to the ray, or inclined to it either in the plane
 of polarization or at right angles to     thereit, no depolarization
                                                               is                             ;
 but  if incUned in the intermediate positions, the ray          more Or           is
 less depolarized.     So  it   with gold-leaf; the same effects are
                                is
 produced        by
                 it. Further, the depolarization       accompanied  is                        by
a   rotation of the ray, and in this respect the quadrants alternate,
 the rotation being to the right-hand in two Opposite quadrants,
 and to the left in the intervening quadrants.      So       with gold-  it   is
                                                 by
 leaf; the same effects are produced            and the rotation
                                                 it,                   in                is
 the same direction with that produced           glass, when inclined
                                                          by
in the same quadrant.
   As further observation in this direction was stopped by the
necessity of employing glass supports for the leaves, films, &c.,
I  sought for     medium so near glass in its character, as should
                      a
either reduce its effect to nothing, or render           so small as to
                                                                     it
cause its easy elimination.      Either camphine or sulphide of car

to  a certain height with sulphide of carbon.           plate of crown-

            ;      inclined  as before described,  the effect on the ray
 Was still insensible, the glass appearing to be, for all ordinary
 observations such as mine, quite as the medium about it.                                 I
could now introduce gold-leaf attached to glass into the course
of the polarized ray, its condition as        flat film or plane being
                                                      a
far finer than when stretched oh wire ring as before. It proved
                                            a
to be so far above the sulphide of carbon, as to have powers of
depolarization    apparently as great as those         had in air, and

being inclined, brought iri the image at the analyser exceedingly
well.       It
            was indeed very striking to see, when the plate Was
moved parallel to itself, the darkness when mere glass intervened,
and the light which sprung up when the gold-leaf came into its
place   ;the opake hletal and the transparent glass having appa

 rently changed characters with each other. By care I was able to
introduce a stretched piece of gold-leaf (without glass) into the sul-
phideof carbon : its effects were the same with those just described.
    In all the experiments to be described, the plane of polariza
tion and the plane of inclination had the same relation
to each other : the figure shows the position of the po
larizing Nicol prism, as the eye looks through it at the
light, and a, b represents the vertical axis, about which __.
the plates were inclined. "Whether they were inclined \ A
in one direction or the other, or had the glass face or
the metal face towards the eye, made no difference.        In
all cases with gold-leaf, it was found that the ray had
                                                                  £
been rotated ; that it required a little direct rotation of
the analyser to regain the minimum light; that short of that
red tints appeared, and beyond it blue or cold, these being ne
cessarily affected in some degree by the green colour of the gold-
leaf. Thinned gold-leaf produced the same results ; but as holes
appeared in those that were thinnest, the results were interfered
with, because the light passing through them was affected by the
analyser in a different manner, and yet mingled its result with
that of the light which had passed through the gold.
    The gold-leaf plates, deprived of green colour by heating in
oil, were found with the glass in such good annealed condition,
as not to affect the ray ; but when they were moved, until the
oblique colourless gold came into the course of the ray, it was
depolarized ; a red image appeared ; direct rotation of the ana
lyser reduced this a little in intensity and then changed the
colour to blue.     The reduction was not much, and both in that
and   the  first appearance of the red image there is a differ
ence between the heated and the unheated gold : probably the
green tint of the latter, which would tend to extinguish the
red and produce a minimum, may be sufficient to account for
the effect.    Gold which had been re-greened by agate pressure
acted in like manner on the polarized ray, but the experiments
Were imperfect.
  A   glass plate having gold-leaf on one part of       it,
                                                         had    second

glass plate put over  itand gummed at the edges.          In the sul
phide of carbon, therefore,     represented in one part
                               it                              plate of

in the same direction, but the   air and  gold  much    more than the
air. Gold on glass in this medium, or gold in air, or glass in
air, all gave results in the same direction,        e. required direct

     that even at the distant parts of the deposit.               It was most
     striking to contrast the thinnest and faintest portion of such a
     film with the neighbouring parts of the glass from
                                                                  which it had
     been wiped off. It must be remembered that such a
                                                                 preparation is
    a  layer of separate particles ; that these particles arc not like those
    of starch or of crystals, for they have no action whilst in a

    perpendicular to the polarized ray ; nor have they a better action
    for being m a thick layer, as in the central
                                                        parts of the deposit.

    two surfaces here ; which would seem to
                                                    imply that the particles
    are so small and so near, that two or more can

   ment, and gave exactly the same result.          All of them depolarized,
   and required direct rotation of the

  with the matter.       A glass beaker, which had been employed to
  contain ruby fluid, had a film of gold
                                                deposited on its inner sur

                                       perceptible either by reflexion or
  otherwise, except by a ruby tint which appeared

                                               by a polarized ray, it save
  an effect as strong and as perfect as

  appeared to be almost perfect in its

 palladium      obtained  by phosphorus     acted well  in  the  same man
 ner.      These films appear to be exceedingly continuous, and it
 could be observed in them, that though the thickest were not
 the best, yet films could be obtained so thin as to be distinctly
 inferior to other parts a little thicker ; also that where the biil-
lkncyof reflexion which indicates perfect smoothness passed in
 any degree into dulness, the action of the film was injured : the
 perfect condition of the surfaces of the films seems to be essen
 tial to their good action.        Rhodium films by phosphdrus gave
 good actions, like those produced by gold.          Silver deflagrations,
 either in air or hydrogen, gave depolarizing results like those

  the analyser reduced at a little distance to a minimum and then
  converted to blue.     A film of mercury produced by sublimation,
  a film of arsenic produced in like manner, and a film of smoke
 from a candle, though all of them sufficiently pervious to light,
  did not produce any result of depolarization.          Films of the
 smoke of burning zinc, of antimony, or of oxide of iron produced
 no effect.
      I placed some metallic solutions in a weak atmosphere of
 sulphuretted hydrogen.         Gold and platinum gave no films;
  silver so poor a film as to be of no use ; and lead one so brittle
 as to be unserviceable.      That obtained with palladium    I believe
 to be the metal itself.     The films of sulphuret of mercury, sul-
 phuret of antimony which was orange, and sulphuret of copper
 which was pale brown, all acted on the light and depolarized it.
 The sulphuret of copper presented a difference from the metals
 generally, worth recording : it depolarized the light, producing
 an image which, if not blue at once, was rendered blue by a
 little direct rotation of the analyser; after which the same motion
brought in a minimum and then produced au orange or red
 tint, i. e. with the sulphuret of copper the warm and cold tints
appear on opposite sides of the minimum to those where they
occur when films of the metals are employed, though the mini
mum in both cases is in the same direction.
     Many of the results obtained in the sulphide of carbon were
 produced also in camphine, the analyser being ill each case ad
justed to the minimum of light before the metallic plate or film
 was introduced.       I pass, however, to a very brief account of
 some polarizations effected by the metals themselves in the sul
 phide of carbon, in which case the polarizing Nicol prism was
 dispensed with.      The results show that all the dry forms of gold
 accord in giving the same manifestation of action on light, what
 ever the state of their division, provided they be disposed in a
 thin tegular layer, equivalent to a continuous film. It was first
ascertained that a plate of crown-glass in au inclined position in
sulphide of carbon gave no signs of polarity to a ray of light
passing through it.       When fine gold-leaf was on the glass and
inclined to the ray, it polarized the light, and exactly in the
 same manner and direction as a bundle of glass plates in the
Same position in the air.     More light passed than when the gold-
leaf was in air, but it could not be so completely polarized ; the
minimum light was of a pale bluish colour.          A thinned gold-
leaf produced the same effect, but let more common light through.
I   think the difference between gold-leaf and sulphide of tiarboti
is sensibly less than that between the metal and air.       The depo
sitions of deflagrated gold, the films of gold obtained by phos
phorus, and even the heated deflagrated gold, produced polar-

izing effects, which, though not large, were easily recognized and
distinguished from the non-action of the glass.          Gold-leaf and
gold    films  on  glass produced a like effect in a Camphine-bath,
the results being easily distinguished from those of the glass
and camphine only, in places where the glass had been cleared
from gold.
     Films of palladium, rhodium, silver, a plate with deposited
gold particles, and a layer of deflagrated silver particles gave a
like result, the effect varying in degree. The sulphiiret of Cop
per before spoken of as in contrast with the metals, gave only a
doubtful result, if any.
     Before concluding, I may briefly describe the following nega
tive results with the preparations of gold.       I prepared a power
ful electro-magnet, sent a polarized ray across the magnetic field,
parallel to the magnetic axis, and then placed portions of the
ruby and violet fluids, also of their deposits wet and dry, also
portions of the gold films, of gold-leaf, the results of deflagrations
 sc, in the course of the ray ; but on exciting the magnet could
not obtain any effect beyond that due to the water or glass,
which in any case accompanied the substance into the magnetic
 field.    In some cases very dense preparations of the ruby and
 blue deposits were employed, the intense electric lamp light being
 required to penetrate them.
     I  passed the coloured rays of the solar beam through the
various gold fluids and films that have been described.             For
 this purpose a beam of sunlight entering a dark room through
 an aperture -jlth of an inch in width, was sent through two of
 Bontemp's flint-glass prisms, and its rays either separated, or at
 once thrown on to a pure white screen ; the different objects were
 then interposed in the course of the ray, but I Could riot per
 ceive when any portion of a ray passed (and that was generally
 the case) that it differed sensibly in colour or quality from the
 ray passing into the preparation.        In like manner^ the objects
 Were put into the differently coloured rays and observed by the
 reflected lights a lens being sometimes employed to concentrate
 the light ; but I could not find any marked difference between
 the colour or character of the ray reflected and the impinging
 fay, except in quantity.

unusual form, and the second treble      sounded and continued

was sounding, the first treble   was sounded loudly close to the
                                    D
tube, when the flame became excessively elongated and then dis
appeared.                           ,
   8. The flame being only 1'5 millim. in length, the first treble
D  was sounded.    The flame gave out the second treble       (and          D
perhaps sometimes also    higher D) only for
                              a                 moment and dis

the second treble D of a harmonium, but by no single C sharp
or D sharp of this powerful instrument.       It is also affected by
the third treble D of a clarionet, although only when quite
 close.   The sung note also acts when it is produced by inspira
tion (in this case the second treble), or when the mouth is turned
 from the flame.
     9. In immediate proximity the note G sung is effective.
     Some influence is exerted by noises, but not by all, and often
 not by the strongest and nearest, evidently because the exciting
 tone is not contained in them.
     10. The flame burning quietly in the interior of the D-tube
 was about 2'5 millims. in length.     In the next room, the door
 of which was open, the four legs of a chair were stamped simul
 taneously upon the wooden floor,      The phenomenon of the che
 mical harmonics immediately occurred.       A very small flame is
  of course extinguished, after sounding for an instant, by the noise
  of a chair.  A tambourine, when struck, acts sometimes, but in
general not.
   11. The flame burning in the excited, singing condition in
the interior of the D-tube, the latter was slowly raised as high
as possible without causing the return of the flame to the ordi
nary condition. The note, the first treble D, was sung strongly
and broken off suddenly at a distance of 1*5 metre.     The harv
monic tone ceased, and the flame fell into the state of repose
without being extinguished.
    12. The same result was produced by acting upon the draught
of air in the tube by a fanning motion of the open hand close
above the upper aperture of the tube.
    13. In the D-tube there were two burners close together j one
of them, 0'5 millim. in aperture, opened 5 millims, below the other,
thcdiameter of which was 1 millim. or more. Currents of gas, inde
pendent of each other, flowed out of both ; that flowing from the
narrower burner being very feeble, and burning, when ignited,
with a flame about 1*5 millim. in length, nearly invisible in the
 day ; the first treble D was sung at a distance of 3 metres. The
strong current of gas was immediately inflamed, because the
little flame situated below    it,becoming elongated, flared up into
it. By   a   stronger action of the tone the small flame itself     is
 extinguished, so that an actual transfer of the flame from one
 burner to the other takes place.        Soon afterwards the feeble
 current of gas is   usually again inflamed      by
                                                the large flame, and
if  the latter be again extinguished alone, everything      ready for

notice the remarkable resemblance that exists between the pro

with that obtained by M. Wurtz, we must come to the conclu
sion that the iodide of allyle, submitted to the action of bromine,
behaves in     different manner from the iodide of acetyle, which

is   usually regarded       as   its homologue.

  Dr. Smith     on the  Air  inspired during the Day and Night.            547
    The paper concludes with a summary of the principal results ob
tained and a series of deductions, applicable especially to the solution
or elucidation of hygienic questions.          From the former the following
facts are extracted : —
    The total quantity of air inspired in 24 hours (allowance being
made for intervals amounting altogether to 40 minutes, during
which it was not recorded) was 711,060 cub. ins. ; or an average of
29,627 cub. ins. per hour and 493-6 per minute. The quantity was
much less during the night than during the day. There was an
increase as the morning advanced and a decrease at about 8h30' p.m.,
but most suddenly at about 11 p.m.             During the day the quantity
increased immediately after a meal, and then subsided before the
next meal ; but in every instance it rose again immediately before a
meal.     The rate of frequency of respiration generally corresponded
with the quantity, but the extremes of the day and night rates were
greater.    The period of greatest parallelism was between tea and
supper. An increase was occasioned by one meal only, namely break
fast. The average depth of respiration was 26-5 cub. ins., with a
minimum of 18- 1 cub. ins. in the night, and a maximum of 32-2 cub.
ins. at lh 30' p.m.      The mean rate of the pulse was 76 per minute,
 the minimum at 31' 30' a.m., the maximum at 8h 45' a.m. ; the dif
ference being more than one-third of the minimum rate.
    Sleep came on in two of the series of continuous observations, and
the time of its occurrence was also that of the lowest quantities of
 air inspired.
    The amount of breathing was greater in the standing than in the
sitting posture, and greater sitting than lying.           It was increased by
riding   on horseback,   according   to  the  pace,  also by riding in or upon
 an omnibus.      In railway travelling the increase was greater in a
 second- than in a first-class carriage, and greatest in the third-class
 and on the engine.         An increase was also produced by rowing,
 swimming, walking, running, carrying weights, ascending and de
 scending steps, and the labour of the tread-wheel ; and in several of
 these cases the rate of increase was determined for different degrees
 of exertion used. Reading aloud and singing, and the movement
 recommended by Dr. Hall for restoring suspended respiration, in
 creased the quantity ; bending forwards whilst sitting, lessened it.
    The quantity of inspired air was increased by exposure to the
 heat and light of the sun, and lessened in darkness.              Increase and
 decrease of artificial heat produced corresponding           effects ; and the
 depth of respiration was greatly         increased    by great  heat.   An in
 crease in quantity was caused        also   by  cold  bathing,  and   sponging,
 and the cold shower-bath ; by breakfast, dinner, and tea — when tea
 actually was taken, but when coffee was substituted there was a
 decrease.     Supper of .bread and milk also caused a decrease.           Milk
 by itself or with suet caused an increase.
    An increase was obtained with the following articles of diet, viz.
 eggs, beef-steak, jelly, white bread (home-made), oatmeal, potatoes,
 sugar, tea, rum (1 oz.).      The following caused a decrease, viz. butter,
 fat of beef, olive oil, cod-liver oil, arrow-root, brandy (1 oz. to 1| oz.),
 and kirchenwasser.        Ether (^ drachm) increased the quantity and

tion, I have supposed the ice under consideration to be porous, and
to contain small quantities of liquid water diffused through its sub
stance.      Porosity and permeation by liquid water are generally
understood, from the results of observations, and from numerous
 other reasons, to be normal conditions of glacier ice. It is not,
 however, necessary for the purposes of my explanation of the plas
 ticity of ice at the freezing-point, that the ice should be at the outset
 in this condition ; for, even if we commence with the consideration
 of a mass of ice perfectly free from porosity, and free from particles
 of liquid water diffused through its substance, and if we suppose it to
 be kept in an atmosphere at or above 0° Centigrade, then, as soon as
 pressure is applied to     it,pores occupied by liquid water must in
 stantly be formed in the compressed parts in accordance with the
 fundamental principle of the explanation which      I   have propounded
 — the lowering, namely, of the freezing- or melting-point by pressure,
 and the fact that ice cannot exist at 0° Cent, under     pressure exceed
                                                          a
 ing that of the atmosphere.      I would also wish to make    itdistinctly
 understood that no part of the ice, even    if  suppqged at the outset to
 be solid or free from porosity, can resist being permeated by the
 water squeezed against     it from such parts as may be directly sub
 jected to the pressure, because the very fact of that water being
 forced against any portions of the ice supposed to be solid will
  instantly subject them to pressure, and so will cause melting to set
 in throughout their substance, thereby reducing them immediately
                                       *
  to the porous condition.
     Thus it   is
               a    matter of indifference as to whether we commence
 with the supposition of mass of porous or of solid ice.

     " On the Comparison of Transcendents, with certain applications
to the Theory of Definite Integrals."           By George Boole, Esq., Pro
fessor of Mathematics in Queen's College, Cork.
    The following objects are contemplated in this paper —    :
    1st. The demonstration of      a     fundamental theorem for the sum
mation of integrals whose limits are determined by the roots of an
algebraic equation.
    2ndly. The application of that theorem to the comparison of
algebraical transcendents.
    3rdly . Its application to the comparison of functional transcendents,
i.  e. of transcendents in the differential expression of which an arbi
trary functional sign  is     involved.
    4thly.    Certain  extensions   of the theory of definite integrals both
single   and   multiple,  founded    upon the results of the application last
mentioned.
    In the expression of the fundamental theorem for the summation
 of integrals, the author introduces   a      symbol, G, similar in its defini
tion to the symbol employed by Cauchy in the Calculus of Residues,
but involving an additional element.             The interpretation of this
 symbol   is  not  arbitrary,   but
                                  is   suggested by the results of the inves
 tigation by    which   the theorem     of summation is   obtained. All the
 general    theorems    demonstrated     in the  memoir   either involve this
 symbol    in their expression,   or are immediate  consequences of theorems
 into the expression of which     it   enters.

   The author directly applies his theorem of summation both to the
solution of particular problems in the comparison of the algebraical
transcendents, and to the deduction of general theorems. Of the
latter the most interesting, but not the most general, is a finite ex
pression for the value of the sum

 class, such as Abel's, suppose              polynomial and specify the form

integration any function which can be expressed as                    root of an          a

by means of                 it,
                     the cause of the peculiarity above noticed.
    In the section on functional transcendents,                remarkable casea
presents    itself  in which   the  several  integrals  under the  sign of sum
mation, 2, close up,          the expression may be allowed, into

qbserved in. the Nieol's prism, .1 have been struck -.by finding the
tints inverted in the band of total reflexion which corresponds with
 the limit direction of transmissibility of the extraordinary ray. Thia
inversion is certainly due to the fact, that, notwithstanding the
 slight difference of the average indices of refraction, the dispersive
 power of Canada balsam is greater than that of the spar for the
 limit direction of the extraordinary Tay. It follows from this that
 the relative indices of the various simple rays go on increasing from
 the violet tor the red, which explains why these different rays are
 totally reflected in the inverse order of their absolute refr*ngibilities.

Nicol's prism, a pencil exclusively formed of the moat refrangible:

 direction of the crystallographic axis, as upon that of the dominant
 cleavage.     The phenomena observed, whether with natural crystals
 or with diamagnetic or slightly magnetic masses, prepared so as to
 imitate the molecular arrangement of crystals, leave no doubt upon
 this subject.    The planes of cleavage place themselves equatorially
in diamagnetic, and axially in magnetic substances. From this fact
 these physicists have thought they might conclude that the elective
polarity of crystals, or of bodies which resemble these, depended on
the condensation of the molecules (each of them being regarded as a
 centre of action), which is greater in one direction than in the other.
    Serious objections may be made against this opinion.       The most
 important is that of M. Matteucci, who has ascertained that a needle
 of crystallized bismuth, in which the planes of cleavage are parallel
 to the length, tended to place itself equatorially with greater force
 when these planes are vertical than when they are horizontal.       Still
 more recently (Comptes Rendus, Sept. 14, 1857), M. Matteucci has
 published some experiments on magnetism by rotation which appear
 to prove that the direction of the planes of cleavage, relatively to the
 lines of force of magnets, acts otherwise than by the distribution of
 the molecules considered separately, in respect of their magnetic
 mass.    Hitherto experiments of this kind have only been made upon
 diamagnetic or slightly magnetic bodies. I proposed to try whether
strongly magnetic bodies, such as iron, would not disclose analogous
phenomena.
    I had in my possession some fragments of materials prepared for
the manufacture of cast steel by the process of M. Chenot.         These
are very pure iron ores, reduced either by hydrogen or by car
bonic oxide, and then compressed by the hydraulic press. In this
operation each grain of the reduced mineral is crushed and forms
a little lamella, which places itself perpendicularly to the direc
tion of the pressure. These materials were carefully cut into square
prisms, in such a way that the direction of the lamellae was parallel
to the length of the prisms, and at the same time to one of the
lateral faces.     I suspended these prisms either above a email mag
netized bar at the distance of a few centimetres, or over a strong
horseshoe magnet ; in the latter case the distance was increased to
24 centimetres.         Such a distance evidently prevents all objection
relative to some difference of thickness which the prisms might have
presented, notwithstanding the care taken in their formation.
    By means of a watch with a seconds-hand, I counted the duration
of 40 oscillations of a determined magnitude. The want of a proper
chronometer slightly diminishes the exactitude of my observations ;
but I have convinced myself that the utmost error of reading was
not more than one second.         Moreover, the differences upon which
the proof of the phsenomenon rests, were never less than 12 seconds.
The numbers given are the average of several experiments, between
which, however, there were but slight differences.
    To avoid the influence of a certain quantity of magnetism re
maining in the specimen to be investigated, each determination in
cluded eight observations made by presenting successively each of the
lateral faces of the prism to the magnet, and turning the bar each time.

   The specimen which gave me the most marked effects, is a small
prism of 21-55 millims. in length by 12-55 millims. in breadth,
weighing 16'94 grs. : its density is 6-25.            I had a great deal of
trouble in cutting            it,
                          in consequence of the slight mutual adherence
of the lamellae.        found that the action of the magnet upon this
                           I
material was stronger when the cleavages were vertical than when
they were horizontal.        Before annealing, the relation of the forces
which caused the bar to oscillate was' as            1*1   1

   Another prism produced by the reduction of a compact mineral
fragment, and also compressed, but in which the lamellated structure
was not apparent, furnished differences of the same nature as the
preceding, but very slight.
 I     also operated upon a specimen in which the iron was inter
mixed with lamellae of copper.         In consequence of the slight aggre
gation of the material,       was compelled, to enable me to work it, to

the preceding case.         There      also is  considerable difference the

     It    important to observe, that, at least in accordance with what
          is
is  generally admitted, these results are independent of the influence
 of the currents induced in the body which oscillates above the mag
 net.     In fact, the fundamental character of the phsenomenon dis
covered by Arago, of which induction furnishes the explanation,                         is
 the rapid diminution of the oscillations, without any sensible altera
tion of their duration.
    It also remarkable that the arrangement of the cleavages which,
         is
in our experiment, developes         more powerful magnetism,
                                            a                         also that
                                                                           is
which,     ifwe pay attention only to the possible currents of induction
in the moveable mass, would give greater energy to these currents.
    Lastly, to draw the last and most important consequence from the
fact to which       have just referred, we must observe that this influ
                     I
 ence of the arrangement of the molecules must be intimately con
nected with magnetism or diamagnetism itself.             We find it, in fact,
equally sensible with bismuth and iron, although the diamagnetism of
the former        about 25,000 times weaker than the magnetism of the
                    is
latter.     We also find that the same circumstance, namely, the ver
tical position of the cleavages, which increases the diamagnetism of
 bismuth, also increases the magnetism of iron. — Comptes Rendus,
