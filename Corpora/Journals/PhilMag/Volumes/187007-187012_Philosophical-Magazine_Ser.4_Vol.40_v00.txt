            I.    On the Cause of the Descent of Glaciers.
                     By John BALL, F.R.S. &c.”
 APT.        a   long period of
        motion of glaciers which
                                rest, the controversy respecting the
                                     occupied so much of the atten
tion of scientific men during the period between 1842 and 1858
has been lately reopened.       The Rev. Henry Moseley, who had
already in 1855 proposed a theory which failed to obtain the
adhesion of men conversant with the facts of glacier-motion,
made a communication to the Royal Society in January 1869,
                          º
wherein he sought to establish the insufficiency of the theory
generally accepted by men of science. The mathematical inves
tigation on which he grounded the results given in that paper
was communicated to this Journal in May 1869.
   Having cleared the way by removing from his path the esta
blished theory, Canon               proceeded to prepare for the ad
mission of his own views     by  two papers which also appeared in
this Journal. In      August  last he published an elaborate mathe
matical investigation of the problem of the “descent of a solid
body on an inclined plane when subjected to alternations of tem
perature;” and this was followed in January last by a paper
upon “The Mechanical Properties of Ice,” embodying the results
of observations and experiments made by himself and others
upon the dilatation, tenacity, and shearing-force of ice. At a
Meeting of the Bristol Naturalists’ Society in December last,
Canon Moseley gave a tolerably full exposition of his own theory,
and has lately developed the same views, nearly in the same

terms,        before a London audience,                         at the theatre      of the Royal
Institution.
   The arguments of Canon Moseley have not passed                                              unques
tioned. In March 1869 Mr. James Croll published                                               in these
pages a reply to Canon Moseley’s paper shortly before                                          commu
nicated to the Royal Society, wherein, after admitting                                        that the
argument            directed against the                  “ordinary opinion” on the sub
ject of glacier-motion must be considered “decisive,” he attempted
to refute the general conclusion by ingenious considerations as
to the condition of the molecules of a mass of ice when acted on
 by external heat.
     In the ‘Alpine Journal’ for February last, Mr. William
 Mathews, well known as a successful explorer of the Alps, and
 familiar with the phenomena of glaciers, has given an able sum
 mary of the present state of our knowledge of the causes of
 glacier-motion, along with a careful analysis of the views of
 Canon Moseley as developed in his various writings.                  In the
 same paper several weighty objections to Canon Moseley’s views
 are urged by Mr. Mathews; and the result of an interesting ex
 periment made by the writer, in conjunction with Mr. A. F.
 Osler, added a fact of considerable value to the materials avail
 able in the discussion.       A further experiment, made by the
 same observers under circumstances that much enhanced its im
 portance, was published by Mr. Mathews in the Number of
“Nature’ for the 24th of March last. The latest contribution
 to the discussion with which I am acquainted is a reply by Canon
 Moseley to the strictures of Mr. Mathews, published in the
 ‘Alpine Journal’ for May 1870.
     Itrust that I shall be acquitted of any want of respect for the
 learned and ingenious author of what has been well termed the
 “crawling theory” of glacier motion, if discuss it very briefly,         I
 and content myself with pointing out a few only of what appear
 to me insurmountable objections to            acceptance.          was sug

smaller part only will ascend.     Hence every alternation of tem
perature must cause a proportional, however slight, movement of
the centre of gravity in a downward direction, and a correspond
ing descent of the whole mass.
    In order to deduce from this observation an explanation of
the motion of glaciers, it was necessary to assume that a glacier
lying in an alpine valley is a continuous solid, comparable in
structure to the sheet of lead upon a roof, that under the influ
ence of sunshine, shade, radiation, &c.          temperature      sub         its                              is

amount      The utmost amount of differential motion yet observed”
shows a relative displacement of one inch per day in a distance
of sixteen feet. In other words, if we take two points in the
glacier one inch apart, it has been shown that the one may slip
past the other in twenty-four hours to an extent measured by
the sixteenth part of a line, or about the thickness of a sheet of
note-paper. There is no doubt that, to accomplish this relative
displacement, the force that urged the glacier forwards must
overcome the resistance opposed by the mutual cohesion of the
particles of the ice. To determine the amount of this resistance,
or the shearing-force of ice, Canon Moseley devised the experi
ment to which he has repeatedly referred in his writings.           A
cylinder of solid ice is closely fitted into a hole passing through
two blocks of hard wood whose faces are brought into close con
tact, one of which is fixed and the other moveable; and weights
are applied to the moveable block until displacement is effected.
In short, to ascertain the resistance opposed to very slow changes
in the relative positions of the particles, so slight as to be insen
sible at short distances, Mr. Moseley measures the resistance op
posed to rapid disruption between contiguous portions of the
same substance.     Without entering into a detailed examination
of the   question,           I
                      should think that so familiar a fact as the
behaviour of sealing-wax at temperatures between 70° and 80°F.
sufficiently shows the fallacy of this experiment.      A cylindrical
stick of  sealing-wax   half an inch in diameter     requires a sharp
blow to break             it,

     Idesire, however, to go a step further, and to offer a still more
fundamental objection to the method of investigation adopted by
Canon Moseley—and the more so as it is frequently employed
by eminent men of science, and, when not applied with great
                                                      I
caution, leads to results which believe to be altogether fallacious.
    The device adopted in order to bring such problems within
the grasp of strict mathematical reasoning is to break up the
mass under consideration into imaginary elements, and to assume
that the forces acting on each of these may be expressed by cer
tain constants determined experimentally, and by functions of
variables depending on their position with reference to fixed co
ordinates.      The fundamental assumption that underlies the
application of this method is that of the uniform structure of the
entire mass. Already open to question when used in regard to
imperfect fluids, this method is altogether fallacious when applied
to solid bodies, for the simple reason that no solid body is ho
mogeneous, and that pressures and tensions acting within it are
modified by the varying constitution of the mass.             But if this
be true generally, the objection falls with tenfold force when it
is proposed to treat a glacier as a body made up of uniform
strata, slices, or cubes, identical in structure, and acted on by
similar forces.     Not to speak of wide openings and narrower
fissures, of inequalities of composition made manifest by the
veined structure, air-bubbles, &c., there is this special charac
                      very near the freezing-point—that under pres

Canon Moseley’s objections to the received theory be admitted
as valid, they will be found to apply with equal force to his own
theory.    Observation abundantly proves that the resistance
offered by  the bed of great glaciers to the sliding of the lower
surface is very much less than even the smallest amount of shear
ing-force derived from his several discordant observations.                                If
the mass of the glacier were dragged onwards, as he contends,
by the alternate expansion and contraction of the superficial
strata, it is certain that the lower surface would slide on its bed
at the same rate as the upper part.       It is equally easy to show
that the differential motion found in going from the central part
to either bank would be an impossibility.         The whole would
move forward as one mass, like the sheet of lead upon the roof,
and only where some small lateral portion of the ice encountered
a fixed obstacle would the resistance lead to fracture—just as in
Canon Moseley’s cylinder experiments.        The larger mass would
move   on, the smaller   fragment  would be left behind.
       If I
        might presume to estimate the net results of this renewed
discussion of the causes of glacier-motion,     should say that they   I
are not    considerable,   but yet are far from worthless.   Canon
Moseley’s experiments have added something to our knowledge,
and especially those on the tenacity of ice, which have some bear
ing on the origin of crevasses.      Of far greater importance are
the observations on    ice-planks  made by Mr. William Mathews.
The first of these, published in the ‘Alpine Journal,” gave pro
minence to a fact which had long been familiar to myself, and
probably to many others.                         I
                                  have often found that long icicles
placed in an inclined position, and supported only at the upper
end, will gradually resume the vertical direction, and I had, per
haps too lightly, assumed that this was a particular instance of
the process by which ice changes                           its
                                          form through fracture and
regelation.            In

II.   Reply    toM. Delaunay’s objection to the late Mr. Hopkins's
     Method   of determining the Thickness of the Earth's Crust by the
     Precession and Nutation of the Earth's Awis. By Archdeacon
     PRATT,   M.A., F.R.S.
      To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
      is only two days ago that I saw for the first time M. De
IT    launay's strictures + upon the late Mr. Hopkins's method
of ascertaining the least thickness of the Earth's Crust by means
of the phenomena of Precession and Nutation, although had                    I
previously seen a notice that such strictures had been laid before
the French Academy.         Having now that gentleman’s paper
before me,     I
              write to endeavour to convince your readers that the
point of Mr. Hopkins's reasoning has been altogether missed, and
that his method stands altogether unimpaired by these strictures.
   2.   Iam ready to allow, and so would Mr. Hopkins have
allowed, that if the crust of the earth revolved round a steady
axis, always parallel to itself in space, and if at some parti
cular epoch a difference existed between the rate of movement
of the crust and of the fluid within       it,
                                         the resulting friction would
gradually destroy this difference and bring about conformity      a
                   both parts.      will even go further, and allow
                    of of

    3. Suppose a spherical shell or crust of mass C to have within
it a solid spherical nucleus, of radius b and mass N, fitting it
exactly; and the crust to receive an angular velocity of rotation
around an axis fixed in the crust, the nucleus at that moment
having no angular velocity; but suppose that a slight force of
friction between the surfaces gradually generates a rotary mo
tion in the nucleus; and suppose this force to vary as the differ
ence between the angular velocities of the crust and nucleus—
that   is,   of

12      Archdeacon Pratt on        the   Method of determining    the
   We may conclude perhaps that the same effect would be pro
duced, though in a much longer time, if the interior were not a
solid sphere, but a fluid mass.
   The above reasoning shows that if the disturbing force produ
cing precession and nutation did not exist, and the interior of
the earth were fluid (whatever the thickness of the crust), it may
be fairly assumed that the motion of rotation of the crust would
now, the earth having existed so many ages, be exactly what it
would have been had the earth been one solid mass, all difference
of motion having been long ago annihilated by the internal fric
tion and viscidity.
   4. But the disturbing force producing precession and nutation
does exist.    It consists of two parts, one constant and the other
variable and periodical.     The constant part is that which produces
the steady precession of the axis (and which           I
                                                      will call for con
venience the precessional force); the other produces the mutation.
I  will consider the precession first. Suppose now, for the sake
of argument, that at the present moment, as M. Delaunay
imagines, the crust and the fluid are revolving precisely as one
mass, all previous differences of motion, even under the action of
the disturbing force which produces precession and nutation,
having been annihilated by friction and viscidity.          Iask, What
will be the action of the    precessional  force from this moment 7
It tends to draw the pole of the crust towards the pole of the
ecliptic: and this tendency, as mathematical physicists well
understand, combined with the rotary motion of the crust, pro
duces this singular result, viz. the pole does not move towards
the pole of the ecliptic, but shifts in a direction at right angles
to the line joining the poles towards the west; so that the incli
nation of the axis to the ecliptic remains constant, but the axis
shifts towards the west. The space through which it shifts in
an infinitesimal portion of time varies as the length of the time
and the force directly, and as the inertia of the mass to be moved
inversely.    The inertia of the mass depends upon the thickness
of the crust only; for the friction of the fluid against the inner
surface of the crust (which might, as I have shown, in the course
of years produce a sensible effect) cannot do so during the infi
nitesimal portion of time      Iam considering before the precession
is actually produced.      The precessional force has       its
                                                              full effect
in  producing the precession        ofthe solid crust, the fluid not
having time   to  diminish that effect before the axis has assumed
a  new position; and    in  this new position     the axis the preces
                                                 of

steadily, the amount of it depending upon the mass of the crust
thus moved, which the fluid has not time to retard or lessen.
M. Delaunay says that “the additional motion due to the above
mentioned causes [the disturbing forces which give rise to pre
cession and mutation] is of such slowness, that the fluid mass
which constitutes the interior of the globe must follow along
with the crust which confines             exactly               it,

copper wire de terminates in a
brass knob in the vicinity of b.
From c and e insulated conduct
ing wires pass to the knobs                 f
and g. Two other conducting
wires pass from the joints c and
e to the galvanometerg, of which
instrument I have already given
a description.    The bridge h,
which consists of a German
 silver wire, connects the points
 i and k with one another; l is a
 conducting wire leading to the
 earth, and m a rheostat consist
 ing of fine German-silver wire.
 The deflections indicated by the
needle of the galvanometer when
the machine is in action are pro
duced by three different cur
rents—namely, (1) that part of
the discharge of the machine
which passes through the coil of the galvanometer, (2) the dis
junction-current formed in the spark between              and g, and (3)   f
the induction-currents which are          produced    by  the discharge
in the coil of the galvanometer.       As regards the first current, it
is under ordinary circumstances so inconsiderable as compared
with the others that it need not be taken into account.               The
disjunction-current, on the contrary, produces a considerable de
flection; but this is very materially diminished when the induc
 tion-currents from the galvanometer traverse the spark between
f  and g. As I have already shown in a previous paper*, the
                                                               is,

 two equal but oppositely directed induction-currents             pass                to         in
 larger quantity than the other.        The difference        the two in        in
 duction-currents thus occasioned acts therefore            the magnetic       on
 needle, and always          in

 16    Prof. E. Edlund on                the    Path of Electrical Induction- and
  weaker; moreover, of the two opposite induction-currents, equal
  parts pass through the bridg: , Jy which their action on the needle
  is annulled.      Only that part of the two currents which traverses
  the spark can affect the needle.        In order to make this as small
  as possible, the resistance in the bridge must be small as com
  pared with the sum of the resistance in the rheostat and in the
  spark. But in proportion as the resistance in the bridge is                                                  di
  minished, the deflection of the disjunction-current is also dimi
  nished; for this now takes                   its
                                       path more and more through the
 bridge instead          through the galvanometer.

                                          made smaller than           that the                  so
 action  of the induction-currents upon the magnetic needle just
 becomes imperceptible.
     Experiments specially made for this purpose showed that                                                    a

This series, therefore, gave the same result as the first.
    In order to investigate the nature of the electromotive force
of disjunction when the spark was formed in various more or less
rarefied gases, a glass cylinder 12 centims, in length and 7 cen
tims. in diameter was used.         Brass caps could be screwed on
air-tight at each end of the cylinder.         In the centre of each cap
was a stuffing-box, through which a round brass rod could be
moved air-tight backwards and forwards. To the inner ends of
these brass rods were firmly screwed the poles which were used
in the experiments. The outer ends were provided with binding
screws for the conducting-wires; and on one rod was marked a
scale of millimetres, to determine the distance between the poles.
The brass rods were insulated from the caps and the stuffing-boxes.

On one of these caps was screwed a brass tube with a stopcock,
the other end of which was provided with a screw-thread by
which it could be screwed to an air-pump.   The brass tube was
bent at right angles, so that during the experiments the glass
cylinder was in a horizontal position.
   To convince myself whether the bridge acted efficiently when
the spark was formed in rarefied air, the glass cylinder was                           in
serted between the points c and e, and the air rarefied until it was
at a pressure of 15 millims. ; the spark, therefore, at fig was
formed in rarefied air.

observed;   and the same result was obtained when the air was
exhausted to a pressure of 6 millims.       In      the subsequent ex  all

   Hence the deflection is always greater in dry air than in that
which is saturated with moisture. Even when dry air was com
pared with air in the working-room, which was far from being
saturated with moisture, the deflection was greater in dry air. In
an experiment on this point a deflection of 8 divisions was ob
tained for the dry air, and for the undried air a deflection of 6-1
divisions.
   It does not seem very easy clearly to make out the causes why
the greater deflection was obtained with the spark in dry air.
The following circumstance would have to be taken into account.
It is necessary for the formation of the sparks in dry                  that             air
the electric density upon the pole-surfaces                              be
                                                              greater than
when the air      is  moist. Before the formation               sparks, the   of
electrical  density   increases   upon    the  polar   surfaces until                         it   is
great enough      totraverse the layer            of
                                              air between them. Hence               ,
in  moist air the spark appears soomer and with           smaller electrical
                                                                     a

                                         the  polar   surfaces thereby be

it was certain that         no

was   prepared  from marble and hydrochloric acid, and was ascer

ticles of mercury in their separation from the surface.              To   in
vestigate this the following series of experiments were made.
    Experiment 25.-The conical brass point previously used was
placed vertically over a porcelain dish which was filled with mer
cury. The mercury was connected by a conducting-wire with
the point e, and the sharp point with the point c (see figure,
p. 15).     From this the following results were:—
                               Mercury           Mercury         Mercury
                               positive.         negative.       positive.
        Mean deflections     .   37.2              43-0            40-1
    Here, then, the deflection was greater when the mercury was
negative; in the foregoing experiments the reverse was the case.
Hence the electromotive force of disjunction must have been
smaller when sparks were formed between mercury poles than
between brass poles. This is confirmed by the following two
series  of experiments.
    Eageriment   26.-The      conical brass point was removed            and
replaced by a brass knob 17 millims. in diameter, which, as
special experiments     showed, acted about the same as a disk of
the above    magnitude.     There were thus obtained in two inde
pendent series of observations:—
                          Mercury            Mercury           Mercury
                          negative.          positive.         negative.
                           <U+017F>º 51.8            35.9               51.9
                    -
       Mean deflections.
                                 4.           16-9               29-2
Hence the deflections became considerably smaller when the posi
tive discharge traversed the spark from the mercury surface to
the brass knob.
    It might be urged against the above experiments, that the
mercury does not retain a level surface while the spark passes,
but rises in the form of a peak towards the opposite pole.               The
 smaller deflection when the        positive discharge      goes  from the
mercurial surface to the knob would, on this supposition, have
been caused by the discharge taking place from the peak to the
knob. But there was no such elevation of the surface perceptible.
 Moreover the deflection, even assuming that a point was formed
 of the same extent as the brass one, could not have been so small
as was observed when the discharge took place from the mercury
to the knob, unless we also assume that the mercury itsek coope
rated in making the deflection smaller. These experiments merely
 show that the electromotive force of disjunction between mercury
 poles is less than that between brass poles; the true ratio be
tween these forces cannot be ascertained by them.              In order to
 examine what takes      place   when both   poles     consist of mercury,
 the  following  method was    adopted.

26        Prof. E. Edlund on                     the      Path of Electrical Induction- and
   Two vessels, provided in the bottom with exit-tubes and stop
cocks, were filled with mercury and placed so close together that,
when the cocks were opened, the mercury-streams were so near
each other that a spark could strike across.               The mercury was
received in the two separate compartments of a glass vessel placed
below.      When one vessel was connected with the point c by
means of a conducting-wire, and the other with the point e, de
flections so distinct were obtained, as soon as the machine was set
to work, that there could be no doubt in reference to the elec
tromotive property of the mercury in the above respect.
   The same experiments were repeated after the mercury had
been replaced by water containing sulphuric acid.                 Although a
slight spark, which was very distinct in the dark, passed between
the two jets, no evident deflections were observed which could
be ascribed to the disjunction-current.              Notwithstanding this
negative result, I doubt not that water is an electromotor in this
respect, although the means at my disposal were not suitable to
show this.                                                                     -

          have shown in a previous paper that, when induction-cur
rents which result from voltaic induction have the opportunity
of traversing the spark of an electrical discharge, those currents
which tend to traverse the spark in the same direction as the
discharge can most easily penetrate                                   it.
                                                      The spark acts thus

of intensity of the spark undergoes a change in form, although
both induction-currents pass with equal facility.    That this
cannot be the case can be easily seen from the following con
siderations.
    We assume for a moment that both induction-currents tra
verse the spark in exactly equal proportions; the electricities
which have passed are then exactly equal, whether the induction
coil is in the circuit or not; and therefore it is solely the change in
the curve of intensity of the spark when the induction-coil is                                             in
serted between e and y or between e and k which causes the
diminution in the deflection of the disjunction-current.          But it
is to be remarked that the intensity of the spark increases when
the induction-coil is inserted between e and k, while it decreases
 when the coil is between e and g; two entirely opposite changes
 in the intensity would thus both have the same effect—that            di                             is,

 in    the deflection.                 To   acquire    a    better idea              of   this matter,          we

may conceive it as follows:—The induction-current in question
produces a disintegration of the polar surfaces; and this gives
rise to a disjunction-current which is in the opposite direction to
the former disjunction-current, and therefore diminishes the de
flection of the magnetic needle.    Now, from experiments 22 to
24, we know that the greatest disjunction-current is obtained
when the valve has such a position that the discharge which
the disintegration causes goes from the disk to the point.   Hence
it follows that the greatest diminution in the deflection must oc
cur when the induction-current in question goes from the disk
to the point, or, what is the same thing, when the discharge goes
from the point to the disk.   Subsequent experiments show, how
ever, that the fact is quite the reverse, and therefore that the
assumption, that that induction-current which is opposite in                             di
rection to the discharge is the one which traverses the spark most
readily, cannot be correct.   In these experiments the brass disk
previously mentioned was fastened to one rod of the glass cylin
der, and the platinum wire surrounded by a glass tube was
firmly screwed to the other rod. The pressure of                 the          air   in
glass cylinder was     atmosphere.

   This last experiment therefore confirms the preceding. Hence
it cannot be the induction-current opposite in direction to the
discharge which most readily traverses the spark, but must be
the other.
   As it is now certain that the induction-current which has the
same direction as the discharge most readily traverses the spark,
another conclusion can be drawn from the preceding experiments;
for they show that the diminution in the deflection of the magnetic
needle which the induction-current causes is greater when that
current traverses the spark from the disk to the point than when
 its direction    opposite. is  An induction-current which traverses
a spark does        most readily when
                             so                 can      from the disk

   We can hereby explain the peculiarity that, in that position
of the valve which gives the smallest deflection in a space filled
with air, the deflection remains unaltered towards the same side
when the air in the valve is rarefied.
    On a superficial consideration, it may seem absurd to sup
 pose that the disjunction-current can produce upon the magnetic
 needle an action many times as powerful as the discharge by which
it is caused. It might be thought that the direct action of the
 discharge upon the magnetic needle must be just as great as when
this current first produces a disjunction-current which subse
quently exerts magnetic action. Yet it may easily be seen that
 this discrepancy is only apparent.             That electricity consists of
 motion is indubitable; but this presupposes something which
 moves, whether it is the smallest particles of a body, the
aether, or any other body.          Now, if the mass set in motion in

                                   are mostly made with German
                      and a set of coils equalling 10,000 B.A. units
forms a box of convenient size.     But in electrical research resist
ances of several million units are often useful; and to produce
such with wire in the ordinary way would be both expensive and
cumbrous.
  Latterly  Mr. Hockin has used selenium for this purpose. Fine
glass tubes with a platinum wire blown in at each end and filled
with different fluids, according to the resistance required, have
also been largely used; but these latter necessarily give very
variable results, owing to polarization and electrolysis; and the
former,       I
           believe, are somewhat difficult to construct.
   Requiring a high resistance for some experiments,     made one              I
as follows:—Upon a strip of vulcanite, 6 inches long by 1 inch
wide, I ruled several pencil lines with an ordinary H.B. pencil in
such a manner as to produce a continuous line about tº of
an inch wide and 4 inches long.      At the extremities of the line
I  rubbed the pencil plentifully over a space as large as a six
penny piece, upon which                    I
                               firmly screwed two binding-screws
                                                                                   off
by means of “nuts” underneath, and, gently dusting              su                 all
perfluous plumbago, varnished the whole with several coats                                of
pure shellac varnish.
    The above arrangement gave me resistance         aslightly over   of
two million B.A. units.        was constructed three months ago,
                                           It
and
         up the present time the resistance has remained very con
              to

                                By Professor voN BEzoLD*.
IN Ithe    course of the further investigation on the connexion
        have recently describedt as existing between the mode
of discharge  and the character of the dust-figures thereby pro
duced,         I
          strongly felt the necessity of producing the phenomena
in question by a more simple apparatus than Ruhmkorff's.
   The first experiments with charged Leyden jars, as well as
with the ordinary electrical machine without condensing-arrange
ments, soon showed that with these means only simple figures
(that is to say, discharges) could be obtained.
   The observation of the spark is sufficient to prove that the
discharge which, with a good conducting circuit only inter
rupted by a break, is alternating, is changed into a simple
one by inserting a test-plate<U+017F> ; for while in the first case the
spark is brilliantly luminous, it appears in the second only as a
narrow purple line with a bright point towards the positive
electrode.
     In order,therefore, to obtain alternating discharges even when
the  test-plate was interposed, no way was left but the use of a
suitable branch or return conductor.
     If this conductor (which goes to earth) is continuous (that
is, nowhere interrupted          break),  by
                                           a         expected that the
                                                              it   is

take   place.
        In
         experiments made with such return conductors,            various
entirely new and surprising facts were observed which seem
suited         to

also the circumstance that it was not always unequivocally suc
cessful (for the figures were at times scarcely perceptible)
made it desirable to repeat the experiment with another source of
electricity.    The electrical machine was therefore replaced by
the   inductorium,   one pole being connected with the spark-mi
crometer and the other with the earth. The knobs of the elec
trometer were gradually moved apart.
   As long as the striking-distances were small, figures were
formed which were of the same kind as that of the electricity
passing across the break; that                              is,

it takes, at any rate apparently, the path, of many hundred times
that length, through the wire D.
    If the wire D be still more lengthened, the phenomenon at first
remains, within tolerably widelimits, unchanged; and not until
the length has nearly doubled does the figure at A become again
larger, until with still more considerable lengths the difference
in magnitude of the two figures again quite disappears.    In this
case it was immaterial whether a thick or a thin, a good or a bad
conducting-wire was used, or whether it was tied in a tight knot
or made to describe an arc of a circle.     have not yet worked                  I
with spirals.
   The phenomenon being so entirely novel, I thought it would be
interesting to investigate the deportment of the wire D in various
positions. Hence an alteration was made which is represented in

ting discharges the wire D is again immediately discharged, it

follows that in such a process electricity first passes into the
extreme end of the wire D and is again immediately expelled—
that, in short, motions take place which are perfectly comparable
to a reflection.
   This consideration leads to an hypothesis on the peculiar
changes in magnitude which the dust-figures undergo with the
branchings described; for if electrical waves are driven into a
wire, and after reflection at           its
                                          end return the same way, the
progressing must interfere with the reflected waves and produce
phenomena which are analogous                 those observed with organ
                                                  to
pipes.     The observations hitherto communicated exhibit this
analogy       inhigh degree; and we may well venture                    compareto
the  placesin a  which maximum and minimum                figures   appear  with
vibrating loops and nodes.

shorter path, and even carries with         electricity   the same kind

THEaction, and that of the     conservation of energy, are the
expression of one and the same thing to those who believe that
heat is motion, and therefore itself a form of force or energy.
They both alike express this—that when the action of force,
continued through a space, results in motion or heat, or vice
versá, there has been a true conversion, a change of one form
into another, and that when no motion results there is no con
version. The selfsame expression \<U+017F>ils expresses indifferently the
pressure accumulated at any point in a fluid mass by the action
of   all

     following communication was read:—
                 on Solar Physics.-No. II.       The Positions and
Areas of the Spots observed at Kew during the years 1864–66, also
the Spotted Area of the Sun's visible disk from the commencement
of 1832 up to May 1868.”      By Warren De La Rue, Esq., Ph.D.,
F.R.S., F.R.A.S., Balfour Stewart, Esq., LL.D., F.R.S., F.R.A.S.,
&c., and Benjamin Loewy, Esq., F.R.A.S.
   The paper commences with a continuation for the years 1864–66
of Tables II. and III. of a previous paper by the same authors; it
then proceeds to a discussion of the value of the pictures of the
sun made by Hofrath Schwabe, which had been placed at the dis
posal of the authors; and the result is that these pictures, when
compared with simultaneous pictures taken by Carrington and by the
Kew heliograph, are found to be of great trustworthiness.     From
1832 to 1854 the pictures discussed are those                      of Schwabe, who         was the
only observer between these dates; then follows the series taken by
Carrington, and lastly the Kew series, which began in 1862.
   A list is given of the values of the sun's spotted area for every fort
might, from the beginning of 1832 up to May 1868, and also a list
of three-monthly values of the same, each three-monthly value being
the mean of the three fortnightly values which precede and of the
three which follow        These three-monthly values are also given for

    Another fact previously noted by Sir J. Herschel is brought to
 light—namely, that the time between a minimum and the next maxi
 mum is less than that from the maximum to the next minimum.
    Thus the times from the minimum to the maximum are for the
 three periods 3-06, 4:14, and 3:37, while those from the maximum
 to the minimum are 6.75, 8:44, and 7.44 years.
    In             all
            the three periods there are times        secondary maxima after     of

determinations of the chemical intensity of total daylight made in
the autumn of 1867 on the flat tableland on the southern side of
the Tagus, about 8% miles to the south-east of Lisbon, under a cloud
less sky, with the object of ascertaining the relation existing between
the solar altitude and the chemical intensity.         The method of
measurement adopted was that described in a previous communi
cation to the Society”, founded upon the exact estimation of the
tint which standard sensitive paper assumes when exposed for a given
time to the action of daylight. The experiments were made as fol
lows:—
   1. The chemical                    action        of total daylight was observed in the
ordinary manner.
   2. The chemical action of the diffused daylight was then observed
by throwing on to the exposed paper the shadow of a small blackened
brass ball, placed at such a distance that    apparent diameter, seenits
from the position      the paper, was slightly larger than that

    The Rev. Samuel Haughton on the Granites of Scotland.                                     59
vations, from 1837 to 1869 inclusive, of the four great earth-ther
mometers sunk into the rock of the Calton Hill, at the Royal Ob
servatory, Edinburgh, by the late Principal Forbes, pursuant to a
vote by the British Association for the Advancement of Science.
   Leaving on one side the several matural-philosophy data which
have been investigated from smaller portions of the same series of
observations both by Principal Forbes and Sir William Thomson,
the author applies himself solely to trace the existence of other
cycles than the ordinary annual one, in the rise and fall of the dif
                                                - - - - -
ferent thermometers.
   Of such cycles, and of more than one year's duration, he considers
that he has discovered three; and of these the most marked has a
              l
period of l l years, or practically the same as Schwabe's numbers
for new groups of solar spots. Several numerical circumstances,
however, which the author details, show that the sun-spots cannot be
the actual cause of the observed waves of terrestrial temperature,
and he suggests what may be, concluding with two examples of the
practical use to which a knowledge of the temperature cycles as ob
served may at once be turned, no matter to what cosmical origin
their existence may be owing.

                                  Prof. Roscoe on Vanadium.                            .    68
that the metal absorbs hydrogen.         This conclusion has been fully
borne out by subsequent experiment; and it appears that the amount
of absorbed or combined hydrogen taken up by the metal varies ac
cording to the state of division, first, of the chloride (VCL) from
which the metal is prepared, and secondly, and especially, of the
metal itself.    The metal containing absorbed hydrogen slowly takes
up oxygen on exposure to dry air, water being formed and the
metal undergoing oxidation to the lowest oxide, W. O.             At this
  oint the oxidation stops, but in moist air it proceeds still further.
   The difficulty of obtaining metallic vamadium free from admixture
of oxide has been again rendered evident. Perfectly pure tetra
chloride was prepared in quantity; and from this, pure dichloride was
made.     On heating this to whiteness in dry hydrogen for 48 hours
a substance was obtained which gained on oxidation 70.7 per cent.
(vanadium requiring 77-79 percentage increase), and therefore still
contained a slight admixture of oxide.
   The reducing action of sodium on the solid chlorides was next
examined; in this case the reduction takes place quietly in an atmo
sphere of hydrogen at a red heat, and is best conducted in strong iron
tubes.    Explosions occur when sodium acts on the liquid tetrachlo
ride.   The substance thus obtained was found, after lixiviation, to
be free from chlorine, and on washing it separated into two portions
—(1) a light and finely divided black powder (trioxide), which
remains in suspension, and is soluble in hydrochloric acid, and (2) a
heavier grey powder, insoluble in hydrochloric acid, which soon de
posits, and can, by repeated washing, be completely freed from the
lighter trioxide.     This bright grey powder consists of metallic
vanadium, mixed with more or less oxide.                          If
                                                   this metallic powder,
after  drying in  vacuo, be reduced at a low red heat in a current of pure
hydrogen, it takes fire spontaneously, even when cold, on exposure
to air or oxygen, water being formed, whilst the vanadium undergoes
oxidation, forming the blue oxide, W. O. A portion of metal exposed
for some weeks to the                  air
                             also slowly absorbed oxygen, passing into
the oxide, W.O.

bromide was not formed in this reaction was shown, inasmuch as, on
distilling the excess of liquid which had collected in the receiver, it
was found to consist of free bromine, containing mere traces of the
tribromide mechanically carried over. The tribromide is likewise
formed when bromine is passed over a red-hot mixture of vanadium
trioxide and pure charcoal, as in the preparation of the tetrachloride;
but this method is not one to be recommended, as the tube becomes
constantly stopped up by the formation of the solid tribromide.
   The analysis of the tribromide was made by dissolving the com
pound in water, and precipitating the bromine with excess of mitrate
of silver, the vanadium being estimated as W. O., either in the filtrate
from the bromide of silver or in a separate portion.      The bromine
in the above determinations, obtained by precipitation as silver-salt,
was invariably found to be too high, whilst the vanadium nearly
agreed with the theoretical percentage. This is due to the fact
pointed out by Stas, in his ‘Recherches,       p. 156, that bromide of
silver, when boiled, encloses mechanically a portion of the precipi
tant, which them cannot be washed out. The loss of weight ob
tained by reducing the bromide to metallic silver in a current of
hydrogen, taken as bromine, gave more nearly agreeing numbers:–

   2. Panadium Orytribromide, or Vanadyl Tribromide, WOBr,
molec. wt. =307-3.-The oxytribromide is a dark-red transparent
liquid, evolving white fumes on contact with the air, obtained by
passing pure and dry bromine over vanadium trioxide (W.O.) heated
to redness.    Moisture prevents the formation of the oxytribromide;
and it not only undergoes sudden decomposition when heated to 180°,
but also slowly decomposes at the ordinary atmospheric temperatures.
The boiling-point of the tribromide can, however, be brought below
its  temperature          of

   The sodium in this and in the following compounds                    was separated
from the vanadium           by    precipitating the vanadic acid as the perfectly
insoluble basic lead salt hereafter described.                This was dried at 100°
and weighed, then dissolved in nitric acid and decomposed by sul
phuric acid, and the solution of W. O. in excess of this acid gave on
evaporation a finely crystalline mass.             The filtrate from the lead pre
cipitate freed from lead yielded on evaporation sodium sulphate. Full
analytical details of this method, as well as of the other by precipi
tation as the insoluble ammonium metavanadate, are given in the
memoir. By frequent crystallizations the trisodium vanadate is slowly
decomposed into the tetrasodium salt, caustic soda being formed.
This singular reaction was most carefully examined and the amount
of sodium hydroxide liberated determined volumetrically.
   2. Tetrasodium Panadate, Na, V, O,-- 18H, O.—This salt crystal
lizes in beautiful six-sided tables; it is easily soluble in water, inso
luble in alcohol, and is precipitated by the latter liquid from aqueous
solution in white scales of a silky lustre. As long as the salt contains
free alkali or tribasic salt, it forms, on precipitation with alcohol, oily
drops which solidify after some time. The tetrasodium vanadate is
always formed by the first fusion of vanadic acid with excess of car
bonate of soda, and can be easily prepared in the pure state by re
                                                                           -

   The salt   loses 17 molecules of water at 100°.
   The corresponding Calcium and Barium Vanadates, Ca, V, O,
and Ba, W. O., are white precipitates obtained by adding the chlo
rides to a solution of tetrasodium vanadate.                  If calcium chloride be
added to a solution of the trisodium salt, dicalcium vanadate is pre
cipitated, the solution becoming strongly alkaline from formation of
calcium hydroxide and absorbing carbonic acid from the air.                      Com
plete analysis showed that the calcium salt contains 2% molecules
of water of crystallization, whilst the barium salt is anhydrous.

After cooling, a greyish crystalline mass is left, containing cavities
filled with long crystals having the same colour as the mass, which
under the microscope could be distinguished as six-sided prisms.
The crystalline powder is then boiled with water until no further
traces of soluble chlorides are extracted.

   3. “On Hypsilophodon, a new Genus of Dinosauria.”       By Pro
fessor Huxley, F.R.S.,   President.
   The author described the characters presented by the skull of a
small Dinosaurian reptile obtained by the Rev. W. Fox from a
Wealden bed at Cowleaze Chine in the Isle of Wight.      One of the
most striking peculiarities of this skull was presented by the prae
maxillary bone, which seems to have been produced downwards
and forwards into a short edentulous beak-like process, the outer
surface of which is rugose and pitted.    The author remarked upon
the known form of the symphysial portion of the lower jaw in the
Dinosauria, and indicated that       peculiar emargination was pro

beak. The dentigerous portion       the praemaxilla bears five small
                                                       of
conical teeth. The alveolar margin      the maxilla bears ten teeth,

which are imbedded by single fangs, and apparently lodged in distinct
alveoli.   The summit of the crown, when unworn, is sharp and pre
sents no trace of the serrations characteristic of Iguanodon; but it is
sinuated by the terminations of the strong ridges of enamel which
traverse the outer surface of the crown.       The teeth thus present
some resemblance to those of    Iguanodon;   but the author regarded the
two forms as  perfectly  distinct,  and named the species under con
sideration  Hypsilophodon    Fowii.   Of the lower jaw the right ramus
is present;  but          its
                     distal extremity      broken off, and     teeth are

     With regard               to   the relation                of   the Ornithoscelida                        to   birds, the

Mr.     Duncan on the Physical Geography of Western Europe.               71
author stated that he knew of no character by which the structure
of birds as a class differs from that of reptiles which is not fore
shadowed in the Ornithoscelida, and he briefly discussed the ques
tion of the relationship of Pterodactyles to birds.        He did not con
sider that the       majority  of the Dinosauria stood so habitually upon
their hind feet as to account for the resemblance of the hind limbs
to those of birds by simple similarity of function.
.   The author then proceeded to notice the Dinosauria of the Trias,
commencing with an historical account of our knowledge of the occur
rence of such reptilian forms in beds of that age.         He identified the
following Triassic reptilian forms as belonging to the Dinosauria:—
 Teratosaurus, Plateosaurus, and Zanclodon from the German Trias;
Thecodontosaurus and Palaeosaurus from the Bristol conglomerate
(the second of these genera he restricted to P. cylindrodon of Riley
and Stutchbury, their P. platyodon being referred to Thecodonto
saurus); Cladyodon from Warwickshire; Deuterosaurus from the
Ural; Ankistrodon from Central India; Clepsysaurus and Bathygma
thus from North America; and probably the South-African Prote
rosa  atrºtts.
    2. “The Physical Geography of Western Europe during the
Mesozoic and Cainozoic periods, elucidated by their Coral-faunas.”
By P. Martin Duncan, M.B. Lond., F.R.S., Secretary.
    The author commenced with a notice of the typical species of the
coral-fauna of the deep seas which bound continents remote from
 coral-reefs, and then made some remarks upon the littoral corals.
The peculiarities of reef, lagoon, and shallow-water species were
then explained, with the relations of the two faunas to one another.
The author then referred to certain exceptional species, indicated
 the genera the species of which constitute the existing reefs and
 contributed to form those of the past, and noticed the representa
 tives of some modern genera in old reefs.             He pointed out that a
 correspondency of physical conditions during the deposition of cer
 tain strata was indicated by their containing analogous forms—the
 presence of compound coenenchymal species indicating neighbouring
 reefs, and their absence in places where simple or non-coenenchymal
 Madreporaria are found being characteristic of deep-sea areas remote
 from the Coral-seas.         By applying the principles thus elaborated to
  the evidence as to the condition of the seas of the European area
 from the Triassic period to the present time, the author then showed
  what must probably have been the physical condition of this part of
  the world at different periods.

    The following communications were read:—
     1. “Notes on the Brachiopoda hitherto obtained from the Pebble
 bed at Budleigh-Salterton, near Exmouth, in Devonshire.”                 By
 Thomas        Davidson, Esq.,   F.R.S., F.G.S., &c.
    The author first described the general characters, and discussed

72                          Geological Society:—
the opinions that have been put forward as to the origin, of the
pebbles forming this bed. Nearly 40 species of Brachiopoda have
been obtained from them. The fossils contained in the pebbles
have been regarded as of Lower-Silurian age; the author considered
the great majority of the Brachiopoda to be Devonian.               The
species identified   with Silurian fossils are:–Lingula Lesueuri
 (Rouault), L. Rouaulti (Salter), and L. Hawkei (Rouault). The species
regarded by the author as undoubtedly Devonian (i.e. either pre
viously described from Devonian deposits or associated with such
species in the same pebble) are 12 in number, namely:-Spirifer
 Verneuilii (Murch.), S. macroptera (Goldf.), Athyris budleighensis
(sp. n.), Atrypa (reticularis?), Rhynchomella inaurita (Sandb.), R. el
 liptica (Schnurr), R. Vicaryi (sp. n.), and 2 undetermined species
 of Rhynchonella, Streptorhynchus crenistria (Phil.), Productus Wi
 caryi (Salt.), and an undetermined Chonetes.     Eight species occur
 ring in the same rock, three of which have been doubtfully identified,
 are considered by the author to be probably Devonian.      The species
 supposed to be determined are:—Orthis reduc (Barr.) and 0. Ber
 thosi (Rouault), Silurian;   and Spirifer octoplicatus (Sow.), Devo
 nian and Carboniferous, but possibly identical with the Silurian
 S. elevatus (Dalm.). The others are 2 new species of Orthis, and a new
 Rhynchonella (?), and an undetermined species of Terebratula (?) and
 Strophomena (?).    Finally the author noticed 14 species (all new, ex
 cept Orthis pulvinata, Salt.) only known from these pebbles, but
which were stated to        possess a Devonian facies.
     2.   “Onthe relation of the Boulder-clay without Chalk of the
North of   England    to the Great Chalky Boulder-clay of the South.”
By Searles W. Wood, Jun., Esq., F.G.S.
   The author described the Yorkshire glacial clays as of two kinds:—
the lower, containing chalk débris, and belonging to the uppermost
member of the glacial series in Eastern and East-central England;
the upper, containing chalk sparingly in                its
                                                  lower part, and gradually
losing this upwards.       On the coast only the latter occurs north              of
Flambro'. He stated that, palaeontologically, the Lower and Middle
glacial deposits closely agree with the Crag, and are quite distinct
from the deposit       Bridlington, which

that the chalk found in     it (equal, according to him, to a layer of at
least 200 feet over the entire Wold) could only have been detached
by the agency of moving ice, which he believed to have covered
nearly the whole Wold for a long period.
    The author stated that boulders of Shap Fell granite are confined
to the deposit of clay without chalk, and discussed the means by
which they could have been distributed.          He ascribed their disper
sion to the   agency  of floating  ice during an adequate submergence of
the district. He     supposed    them to have passed from Shap Fell by
what is now the     pass  of Stainmoor.
    Thus he ascribed the formation of the “Great Chalky Clay” to
the extrusion from the sea-foot of a great sheet of ice, of mate
 rials abraded by the latter, the land being depressed 600–700 feet
 below its present level; and that of the clay without chalk and
 with boulders of Shap-Fell granite to deposition during a period
 of much greater depression (about 1500 feet), throughout which the
 sea bore much floating ice.       He considered that the “Great Chalky
 Clay” indicated a long period during which the land, with its
 enveloping ice, remained stationary, and that during this period,
 when intense cold prevailed, the arctic fauna of Bridlington be
 came established.     He thought that the recommencement of sub
 sidence was indicated by the reddish-brown or brownish-purple
 sediments of Holderness, in which some chalk occurs.             He then
 indicated the species of Mollusca which have occurred in the purple
 clay without chalk about Scarbro’ and Whitby, all of which were
 said to belong to existing forms, and thus to be in accordance with
 the date assigned by him to that deposit.         The molluscan fauna of
 Moël Tryfane was referred to by the author, who stated that he
 regarded it as belonging to the period of emergence from the
 deepest depression, during which the clay without chalk was as
  sumcd to have been deposited, i. e. to the earliest part of the post
 glacial period, to which the stratified drifts of Scotland are referred
  by Mr. A. Geikie.

     The following communications were read:—
     1. “On the Iron-ores associated with the Basalts of the North
  east of Ireland.”    By Ralph Tate, Esq., Assoc. Linn. Soc., F.G.S.,
  and John S. Holden, M.D., F.G.S.
     The authors introduced their account of the iron-ores of the
  Antrim basalts by stating that since 1790 an iron band had been
  known in the midst of the basalt of the Giant's Causeway, but that
  only within the last few years have further discoveries been made,
  which have developed a new branch of industry in the north-east of
  Ireland.
     The iron-ore of the numerous exposures was considered to repre
   sent portions of one sheet extending uniformly throughout the basalt
   and over a very large area.       Indeed everywhere the iron band and

its associated rock-masses present identical features, from which the
authors deduced the following generalized section:-
    The underlying basalt gradually passes upwards into a variegated
lithomarge of about 30 feet thick, graduating insensibly into a red
or yellow ochre or bole of about 5–6 feet in thickness, which passes
into a dense red ochreous mass of about 2 feet, charged with ferru
ginous spheroids consisting chiefly of a protoxide and peroxide. The
spheroids are of the average size of peas; they increase in number
and size towards the upper part of the band, and not unfrequently
constitute that portion of     The line     junction between the iron
                                               it.                       of

ruthers         on

isted; that the difference in minute structure between Sigillaria
and Stigmaria involves no serious difficulty if the former be regarded
as allied to Cycadaceae; and, further, that we do not know how many
of the Stigmariae belong to Sigillaria proper, or Favularia, or to
such forms as Clathraria and Leioderma, which may have been
more nearly allied to Lepidophloios; that the fruit figured by Golden
berg as that of Sigillaria is more probably that of Lepidophloios, or
may be a male catkin with pollen ; and that he has found Trigono
carpa scattered around the trunks of Sigillaria, and on the surface of
the soil in which they grew.      He agreed with Mr. Carruthers in
regarding Mr. Binney's Sigillaria vascularis as allied to Lepido
dendron.
   Prof. MoRRIs thought that Clathraria and Lepidophloios ought to
be discriminated  from the Sigillaria, as being rather more nearly
allied with cycadaceous plants, especially the former.  He pointed
out the manner in which certain vascular bundles communicating
between the centre of the stem of Sigillaria and allied genera and
their bark might be mistaken for medullary rays.

   The author described the characters presented by the lower jaw of
an Amphibian, of which a cast had occurred in the coarse sandstone
of the Coal-formation between Ragged Reef and the Joggins Coal
mine. It measured 6 inches in length;                 its
                                               surface was marked      the        on

teeth, some                                  in of

Museum, from Kimmeridge Bay, which had been previously re
garded as Pliosaurian, and was recently identified with Dakosaurus
by Mr. Davies, Sen.    From the agreement of their dimensions, and
their occurrence near together, the author thought it probable that
this skull and the lower jaw described by him last session belonged
to the same individual. It differs from the Steneosaurus rostro-minor
in the greater stoutness of its snout, in the presence of an anterior
pair of nasal bones prolonged into the nostril, and in the number of
 itsteeth. The author proposed         name     Steneosaurus Manseli,

departure and return, was 1206.5 metres.        The temperature of the
water at the top of the conduit was 20°, and 13° at the bottom.
The temperature of the surrounding air was 18°. Under these con
ditions the velocity of the propagation of the compression was found
to be 897-80 metres per second.
   The second and the third return shocks were too feeble to enable
us to deduce any accurate measure.
   Wertheim deduced, from the sound given by brass organ-pipes
dipping in water, 1173 metres per second as the velocity of sound
in water. This number is much less than 1435 metres per second,
found by MM. Colladon and Sturm in direct experiments made on
the Lake of Geneva.
   The value which I found is still further from the number observed
in an indefinite mass of water.     Notwithstanding this divergence,
which I do not   pretend  to explain, I think it useful to give my re
sults, which subsequent studies may confirm.
     I
     confine myself to calling the attention of physicists and geome
ters to the influence which the elasticity and friction of the con
taining sides may have on the propagation of a shock in the midst of
an almost incompressible fluid.    Probably the difference between the
propagation of a shock in an indefinite medium and that which we
observed in a cast-iron cylinder is due to this circumstance.—Comptes

internal work in a given change of state is evidently of very
great importance in the establishment of a law of molecular forces.
The mechanical theory of heat gives us the means of discovering
this sign in a great number of cases.
     It is generally admitted that, in a material system, positive
 work caused by the use of heat only is correlative to the ap
 pearance of a number of thermal units proportional to this work,
 and that negative work is correlative to the disappearance of
 a like number of thermal units.         By saying that work is con
 verted into heat in the first case, and heat into work in the
 second, we express this correlation in a convenient manner for
 drawing conclusions.        Hence when a body experiences a change
 such that some internal work has been effected and a quantity
 of heat has disappeared, without revealing any other pheno
 menon, mechanical or thermic, this work must be negative.
 This is what happens in the melting of ice when it is occasioned
 by the disappearance of a certain quantity of heat coming from
 external bodies, and when no pressure is exerted on the surface
 of the ice. In the most general case, where heat disappears ex
 ternally to a body whilst some of it appears internally, and ex
 ternal and internal work are effected at the same time, we shall
 be able to deduce from the measure of the first three quantities
 the value and sign of the last.
      In gases we are accustomed to take into account only the ex
 ternal work, and can hardly conceive attractive molecular forces.
 For a long time we have imagined these bodies as assemblages
 of molecules mutually repelling each other. This was a way of
  explaining their expansibility; and the repulsion was attributed
 to caloric when this agent was invoked in order to interpret
  the effects of heat. The mechanical theory of heat rejects this
  explanation, and leads to other hypotheses on the constitution
  of gases. By supposing that the molecules of gases are en
  dowed with certain motions, we easily explain the expansibility
  and the principal properties of this kind of bodies. Although
  these hypotheses cannot express the truth so long as they are
  devised with the object of explaining approximate laws, such as
  those of Mariotte and Gay-Lussac, they are nevertheless impor
  tant; for they disengage us from the old ideas, and certainly pre
  pare other, more complete hypotheses, which will be suggested
  by a more profound knowledge of the phenomena.
      Thus it is especially to experiment that we must have recourse,
  if we wish to possess exact motions on the work in gases. As every
  thing leads to the belief that the molecular forces in these bodies
  are simply directed according to the lines of the centres, it may
  be supposed that they       are subject to a more simple law than
  those of solids and   liquids, and it may be hoped that this law will
  be more   easily discovered.

    Many experimental researches have been made on this subject;
 but, whether because they have led us to regard the internal
 work of gases as very slight, or because they have not appeared
sufficiently conclusive, several authors who have developed the
mechanical theory of heat have only applied              principles                 its                            an

   Sir W. Thomson has substituted for this principle the follow
ing, which he has also taken as axiomatic:—It is impossible to
obtain work from the heat of a body without having another
body at a lower temperature to take from it a part of this
heat. These two principles do not constitute true axioms; they
are, rather, experimental facts.      M. Hirn has recently given a
new demonstration of the second fundamental principle, in which
he seeks to deduce it from the first principle without making
any hypothesis”.       But even if this demonstration should rest,
like M. Rankine's, on some hypothesis, the truth of the second
fundamental principle cannot be doubted, since                   conse                                    all   its

son obtained results which accord with the thermodynamic for
mulae: for carbonic acid the fall was 8°33 for an excess of
pressure of 6.95 atmospheres at the ordinary temperature. For
aqueous vapour at a temperature of 244° and with an excess of
pressure of 6 atmospheres, M. Hirn obtained 233 after the ex
pansion, and consequently a fall in temperature of 11°.           He also
found a satisfactory agreement between his results and the for
mulae to which he had been led.
    This method is not free from every objection; it will be com
pletely discussed in the course of this memoir.
    These two methods are certainly useful in revealing the exist
ence of attractive molecular forces in gases; but in practice a
host of circumstances may complicate the phenomena, and it
 appears to me that it will be useful to submit them to new
tests.                                                 I
         The experiments which am about to describe will show
how the expansion takes place in the case of two reservoirs.
They form a sequel to the experiments which I have described
in the Annales de Chimie et de Physique *. I observed at that time
 the passage of gas from one reservoir to the other when the ex
cess of pressure was small, and                             I
                                          devised a method for obser
ving the condition of the gas at each moment during the
 passage.     By using at the present time an analogous method,
I  have succeeded in observing        the particulars all the flow     gas          of                 of

                             § I. Principle of the method.
   The gas is enclosed in two reservoirs at the same temperature,
connected by a large stopcock; one of them can communicate
with an open-air manometer.          The stopcock being open, com
munication with the manometer is first established; then the
stopcock is closed, communication with the manometer is cut off,
and by means of a pump a portion of the gas is made to pass from
one reservoir to the other. To make an experiment the stopcock
is opened; the compressed gas begins to move, and communica
tion is established with the manometer at a stated time from the
moment when the opening of the stopcock commenced.                    The
displacement of the level of the manometric liquid is followed,
and   itssuccessive positions are noted       stated periods.
                                                            at     curve          A
can thus    be traced,     which the abscissae measure the periods,

                         of            rest. When certain conditions

   The stopcock C (fig. 2) is open, and the pressure of the gas
contained in the reservoirs differs but little from the atmospheric
pressure; for an instant the valve R is opened, and the levels in
the manometer Q are allowed to settle themselves.           The stop
cock C and the valve are closed.     By   means of the    pump    some
gas is caused to pass from the reservoir B to A; and when the
temperature is stationary, the pressure p, is measured in the
manometer K, and the pressure p, in the manometer M.               The
stopcocks r, r" are closed, so that the gas contained in the mano
meters may be separated from that which the reservoirs contain,
and not disturb the expansion; without this precaution the
effects observed during the expansion would depend on the move
ment of the gas in the tubes L N O, IPO, and it would be im
possible to obtain an accurate result.
   After these preparations, the strip of paper is put in motion;
the stopcock C is opened by an assistant, who writes down the
various positions of the exterior level of the liquid contained in
the manometer Q as they are read aloud on the scale of this
manometer, closing at the same moment the circuit of the elec
tromagnet. The highest and lowest points which the level has
reached are particularly noted.
   In general this level does not return quite to     initial position,  its

  92           M. Achille Cazin   on Internal Work in Gases.
     In   fig. 4 we have only shown six curves, to avoid confusion.
  In  figs.  4, 6, 7, and 8 a division represents a second in the di
  rection of the abscissae, and 1 centim. in the direction of the
  ordinates.
     It is plainly seen from the figure how the curves run as the
  time 6 increases.      For a small value of 6 (curve A) the line falls
  rapidly for three seconds until     h- –  136 millims. ; then it rises
  more    slowly, passes the abscissae-axis until h-  +16 millims., and
  again descends very slowly till h-0.
     For a greater value of 6 (curve E) the line falls for two se
  conds, until    h--41     millims. ; then it rises at first parallel to
 the preceding, attains ha +30 millims., and further on coincides
  with the curve A.
     The separation of these curves evidently depends on the liquid
 in the manometer not instantly indicating the pressure of the
 gas, and on the level being more or less behind according as it
 must run a greater or less length before reaching the position of
 equilibrium.
     Let us suppose the variation of the real pressure of the gas
 to be represented by the line g h i (fig. 5). When the valve of
 the manometer is opened the liquid would indicate h– —f g if
 it could move instantly, and if the pressure of the gas remained
 invariable.      But whilst the liquid moves, the pressure of the gas
 increases; and when the level indicates has —kb, the pressure
 corresponds to the point l. The point b is evidently higher
 than the point g, and it is also lower than the point l on account
 of the impulse the liquid receives. The level afterwards rises until
 the manometric column and the pressure of the gas are in equi
librium, which can only take place after a certain time.
    Let the valve be opened after a time of' > of Instead of
instantly indicating h = —f'g', it only indicates has —k'b'; and
the distance of the point b! from 9' and l' is less than before,
because the impulse and the initial rarefaction f"g' have been
less; moreover the duration f" k! of the depression is also less
than     f K, because k'b' < kb.      Hence the curve b'c' approaches
closer to h i than the curve b c and will join it sooner.
             g
    In the following paragraph several observations will confirm
this interpretation.      In fig. 4 the line XX is traced, with which
the   experiments    of Series I. agree as well as possible. It repre
sents approximately the law of the variable pressure of the gas
during the expansion from 0.5 second.             Several other experi
ments, in which the value of 6 was less, have shown that the
curves differ very little from the curve A until 6=0.1 second.
I  have not made observations of shorter duration.

excess    of the pressure of the compressed gas in reservoir A above

     The coordinates of the minimum of the curves are
            h=     – 65            millims., t = 4:5 seconds, in Series                               IV.,

              = —62 millims., t = 2-9                              seconds, in Series W.
   Hence a result of the increase of the dimensions of the mano
meter, as might be foreseen, is to lessen the variation of the
levels, without changing materially the values of h. We also see
that the curves of Series IV. rise more slowly from the minimum
than those of Series W.
   The differences which the curves present at their point of de
parture are due to the presence of the tube a a' in Series W., as
we shall see in the following paragraph.        It may be observed
that, the effect of this tube being to raise for an instant the curve

    At the moment equality of pressure commences, the first part
 is cold, the second is warm, and the third is in a condition
which depends on the friction which it has produced during the
expansion. Let us suppose that this friction is greater in one
experiment than in another; then there is a greater heating in
the third part of the gas; consequently the pressure p is greater.
If we notice a value p-p' with slight friction, we may observe,
with friction sufficiently great, p-p'        having, moreover, the     (p'
same value             in
                 both cases).

   The readings of these lines on the scale of my spectroscope are
         Na S, 56;     Nay, 75.5;            Na 8, 832;         Nae, 43;
the Fraunhofer lines C, D, and             F reading 34.5, 50, and 90 re
spectively.
   The same lines were observed by Huggins* in the spark taken
between sodium poles, and were shown to be due to sodium itself,
since they were obtained by the use of pure sodium-amalgam.
Diacon't obtained them from the flame of hydrogen which had
been passed through an iron tube in which sodium was volatilized.
   The sodium-spectrum obtained by means of a Bunsen burner
gives only the D lines; but if the temperature of the flame be
increased, these other lines become visible and in the order given
above.
  I find  that Na & becomes visible almost precisely at the tem
perature at which platinum melts. This, according to the ex
periments of Deville, is 2000° C.
   The flame of hydrogen in air (of which the temperature, ac
cording to the experiments of Bunsen, is 2024°C.) gives the D
lines only. The flame is incapable of fusing platinum except at
one point.
   The Bunsen flame of coal-gas and air gives only D. The
flame is incapable of melting platinum.
   The flame of coal-gas fed by a jet of air gives a spectrum in
which, besides D, the line Na 3 is faintly visible. This flame is
just capable of fusing a fine platinum wire.
   The flame of coal-gas fed by a mixture of oxygen and air (con
taining about 30 per cent. oxygen and 70 per cent. nitrogen)
gives Na 3 distinctly and Na 8 faintly.      Nay and e are not seen.
The flame fused   platinum  tolerably  easily.
   The flame of coal-gas fed by pure oxygen gives a spectrum
containing Na 3, y, 8, and e, but e is only faint. The flame
fuses platinum easily.
   The flame of carbonic oxide in air (temperature 1997°, Bun
sen) gives only the D line. It is incapable of melting platinum.
  3.
   Carbonic oxide fed by a jet of air still gives only D. The
flame just melts platinum.
             oxide fed by oxygen (temperature of flame 3033°C.,
Bunsen) gives Na 3 and y brilliantly.      Na 8 and e were not seen.
The flame melts   platinum   easily.
   The flame of sulphur in           air
                                  (calculated temperature 1900° C.)
gives the    lines only.
              D             Itmelts gold, but not platinum.

rature 2250° C.) gives the D lines only.    It melts gold but not
platinum.
   We may therefore employ the line Na 3 as a test of tempera
ture indicating a temperature at least 2000° C.
   Certain lines of the lithium-spectrum may be employed for
the same purpose. In the Bunsen burner, a bead of lithium
chloride gives a spectrum of one red line whose wave-length is
about 6684. The flame of coal-gas fed by a jet of air shows,
besides the red line, an orange line whose wave-length is about
6107.    In the flame of coal-gas and oxygen a blue line (4605)
is added;  and in the electric arc a fourth line (4921) becomes
visible. All these lines can be obtained by means of lithium
chlorate in the Bunsen-flame.
   A vacuum-tube containing coal-gas gives the same spectrum
as            oxide or olefiant gas were employed, viz. the spec
      if carbonic
trum C     II.
             This experiment was repeated with a coal-gas tube
containing pieces of metallic sodium. At first the spectrum was
 that of carbon, as previously described; but as the tube became
 heated by the continued discharge, the line Na 3 came out fol
 lowed by the lines y, 8, and e, and the carbon-lines faded away
 till ultimately the sodium-spectrum of five lines alone remained.
 During this change the carbon-lines and the sodium-lines were seen
 together; and as the temperature to which the sodium-vapour
 was heated cannot be supposed to be different from that to which
 the carbon-vapour was heated, it follows that the spectrum C II.
 may be produced by carbon heated above 2000° C.
     It is to be observed also that this spectrum may be produced
by carbon heated not much above 2000°C., since it was obtained
together with C6 and without Cy, which comes out under
3000° C.
    Carbon-spectrum No. I. is given by the blue cone of the
Bunsen flame, the temperature of which cannot be much above
 1500° C., and is certainly less than 2000° C.; and the same
spectrum (with the addition of two new groups of lines, and 6)
is obtained at          all
                      temperatures          that   up                 of

the electric spark.
   The sodium-lines 3, y, 8, and s are seen in the spectrum of the
electric light, of the spark of an induction-coil between sodium
poles in air, both with and without the Leyden jar, and are ob
tained simultaneously with the hydrogen-lines a, 3, and y in a
hydrogen vacuum-tube. The simplest mode of obtaining them
is to heat the narrow part of the vacuum-tube with a Bunsen
flame; the discharge inside the hot part of the tube becomes
yellow and exhibits the sodium-lines brilliantly.

pressure is still far from being continuous.  Ha is still a very

      GENTLEMEN,
If I      rightly understand the paper of the Rev. J. M. Heath,
       published in the Philosophical Magazine for July 1870,
p. 51, he lays down a principle which may be virtually expressed
by saying that the work done by a force in overcoming attrac
tions or repulsions cannot take effect in producing heat, that                                        is,
in accelerating molecular motions. That principle                perfectly
correct, and   is        an
                      obvious consequence          the laws    of motion;            of is
and   every  one who knows those laws must        agree  with Mr. Heath
when he states it. But from the remarks with which his state
ment   is accompanied,               he
                               seems not            aware that this very

great number of that group of bodies which stand next to the
metals in degree of opacity, as the protoxides, oxides, peroxides
and chlorides, bromides, iodides, and sulphides of the heavy me
tals. The method depends on the fact that these substances admit
of being prepared as uniformly thin layers, which show interfe
rence-colours varying with the thickness of the layer. When these
colours are examined by the spectroscope, we see spectra of alter
nate bright and dark bands, from the number and position of
which the wave-length of light in the substance, and therefore the
refractive index, not only en bloc, but also for the different colours
or Fraunhofer's lines, may be deduced.        From the comparative
perfection of the methods of preparing the thin layers, the accu
racy of the results which this method furnishes depends almost
entirely on the delicacy of the balance, which is preferable to any
indirect method of determining the thickness of the layers.

   To determine the wave-length from the position of the maxima
or minima in the spectrum, it is first of  necessary     deduce   all                    to
the equations subsisting between these magnitudes with regard
to elliptical polarization and absorption. As the interference
bands       the spectrum are best observed

     Inthe preparation of the interference-layers of this body two
different ways are available. In both cases a solution consisting
of 30 grs. hydrate of soda, 60 grs. seignette salts, and 25 grs.
blue vitriol in 500 cubic centims. of water, serves as a decompo
sing liquid. Using as cathode a thin platinum plate about 1 deci
metre square, and, as anode, two 4 copper points at a distance of 2
centims. on each side of the middle point of the plate (each pre
senting a surface of a few square millimetres), by means of the
current of a smallt Bunsen's element only so much hydrogen
is condensed on the platinum plate as will reduce the oxide of
copper to suboxide. The surface of the anode may at first be
taken a little larger, for the first precipitate is formed slowly; the
anode may afterwards be lessened to the prescribed size, to be
certain that no metallic copper is reduced along with the prot
oxide. If the anode be too large, then at first pure protoxide is
obtained; but afterwards the hydrogen, which is developed more
abundantly, reduces the oxide either wholly or partially to metal.
The limit between the two processes, however, is tolerably wide;
and the smallest traces of metallic copper can be recognized by
placing iodine on                  it,
                          which leaves the suboxide perfectly un
changed, whilst       immediately changes the metal into subiodide.

   To ascertain the specific gravity of the suboxide of copper, the
absolute weight and also the loss of weight of a platinum plate
in water were determined by several experiments, and it was then
coated with a thicker layer of suboxide (being exposed twelve, and
from that to thirty-six hours to the action of the current). When
the layer becomes opaque, the copper colour changes to a dark
violet; the least traces of metallic copper, which in the event of
a too strong current might be mixed, would change the beautiful
violet into an ugly dark brown. When the layer has reached
the desired thickness, the absolute weight and the loss of weight
of the whole plate are determined.
   From four experiments with layers of different thicknesses and
almost perfectly agreeing in their results, the density of the
suboxide of copper (at 15°C.) was found to be
                                s=5'975.

                    2. Hydrated Perovide of Lead.
    By the electrolytic decomposition of a solution of oxide of
lead in potash at the positive pole, a series of colours is obtained
which is commonly used to represent Nobili's rings.        The solu
tion for this purpose is prepared by boiling litharge with a strong
alkaline lye. As, however, comparatively little lead goes into so
lution, and operations with strong alkaline fluids are attended with
inconvenience, it is more judicious to prepare the solution in the
following manner:—50 grims. of acetate of lead dissolved in
water are poured, whilst being stirred, into a solution of 50 grims.
of tartar and 35 grims. of hydrate of soda, and after the precipi
tate has disappeared is diluted with water to 500 cubic centims.
This liquid still gives good results when three-fourths of the lead
have been precipitated by the electrolytic process.
    As a positive electrode I have always used a platinum plate
about 1 decimetre square, which is preferable for the measure
ments, as other metals might become oxidized by the active
oxygen; the negative pole consists of two small plates of lead
or platinum, arranged on both sides of the platinum plate at
equal distances from the edges and bent sharply downwards.
This system, after insulation of the conducting-wires, it is easy
to regulate so that the positive platinum plate shall be uniformly
coloured. With these dimensions of the apparatus a small weak
Bunsen’s element is sufficient to produce the layers.
    It appears to be generally considered that the body which
 gives the interference-colours is peroxide of lead; but the far
 lower specific gravity (the statements of the density of PbO" vary
 between 8.903 and 8.933) which I found as the result of nume
 rous concordant experiments induced me to investigate it more
 closely. It followed that the coloured layers on the positive-pole
 plate, whatever solutions were applied, are never PbOº, but a
 hydrated oxide of definite composition, which only with difficulty
 entirely loses  its water    at higher temperature, without
                                   a                              the   at

116 On the Refractive Indices and the Dispersion of Opaque Bodies.
relation is implicitly contained. The discussion of this equation,
of which one side is an infinite series, presents some difficulties;
it has been thought* sufficient to retain the first two terms of
this series and neglect the rest. This would be permissible, as
M. Christoffel has shown, if in every case the sphere of action
were infinitely small in comparison with the wave-length. That
the last assumption is not admissible, however, the discussion of
the incomplete equation shows; for it yields the result that every
spectrum is bounded at the violet end by a visible beam of defi
nite refraction. This inference is a physical absurdity, since it
presupposes the existence of bodies which, under any arbitrary
angle of incidence, totally reflect a visible beam, or completely
absorb it on the surface.           The dispersion-formula derived from
the imperfect series, even if correct for large wave-lengths, can
offer no explanation as to what really occurs at that limit at the
more refrangible end of the spectrum.
   Whilst this limit with substances of weak dispersion would                                                  lie

120       Mr. G. M. Seabroke on the Determination whether
   Therefore the only part of the photosphere available in this
case for illuminating the atmosphere is a ring of photosphere
0".75 in width; and from the figure it will be seen that only that
part of the corona most distant from the centre (as at B) will
receive even the whole of this light; and it is manifest from the
figure that the nearer any part of the corona is to the centre
(nearer C) the less light will it receive from the photosphere, so
that the mean illumination of the corona by the photosphere is
only equal to that which would be given by a ring # x 0".75
 =0"-375 wide.
  Now, since the chromosphere extends from E towards F, the
whole of the atmosphere producing the corona is illuminated
equally by the chromosphere; and since the mean height of the
chromosphere is much more than 0"-375, or other height deduced
from the foregoing formula, it is quite possible that the dark
lines of the spectrum coming from so small an area of photosphere
may be blotted out, as Mr. Lockyer observes, by the light from a
greater area of chromosphere wherever the chromosphere contains
the proper substances; and it is probable that the vapours of a
number of substances from the photosphere are carried up into
the chromosphere in small quantities sufficient to obliterate the
dark lines, since we find the vapours of magnesium, sodium, ba
rium, and iron sometimes in the chromosphere.
                                                                                       by by   an an

                   erased               by
                               the chromospheric lines (wherever the
chromosphere contains the proper substances); and                the moon                        as
moves forward the spectrum should                                     on

and when the illuminating area                the photosphere becomes
                                                                 of

photospheric spectrum should appear.           will also    seen that  It                        be
the larger the illuminating area      the photosphere becomes, the

smaller will    the difference between the spectrum
                     be                                   the interior                      of
part      of
        the corona and that       the exterior part, since, whatever
                                                      of

122         Prof. R. Clausius on a Mechanical Theorem
be the extent   of the illuminating surface of the photosphere, the
exterior parts of the corona will only receive an excess of light
over that received by the interior part equal to the amount of
photospheric light received by those parts during totality, or, as
in the case above taken, the excess will be equal to that given by
a ring of light from the photosphere 0"75 wide (or G E in the
figure), so that, when a few seconds of photosphere are visible to
the observer, the difference between the spectra of the exterior
and interior parts of the corona would be inappreciable.
   5. What spectrum ought the corona to give before totality on
the following side of the moon? In this case, when the angular
distance of the limits of the sun and moon is some seconds, the
difference between the spectra of the exterior and interior parts
of the corona is small, since no part of the atmosphere in this
case will be illuminated by the photosphere; so we ought to ob
tain a chromospheric spectrum, together with a faint photospheric
one caused by a small amount of photospheric light reflected
from the photosphere by the chromosphere.
   6. On the foregoing hypothesis, during totality the parts of the
corona nearest the centre should give a different spectrum from
the more distant portions, since the portions nearer the centre
receive less photospheric light than the more distant parts, and
 the same amount of light from the chromosphere.
    In order to test the correctness of this theory, advantage may
be taken of the following facts:—1st. At that period of the
eclipse when the limb of the sun and moon are in line with the
observer, there will be a difference between the central and dis
 tant parts of the corona; and this difference will decrease as the
moon passes on, whereas, by the other theory, there should be
the same difference as long as the corona is visible. 2nd. If the
 corona be terrestrial, the spectrum of any portion of it ought to
 be continually changing during the passage of the moon; but if
 solar, the spectrum should remain unchanged.

      theory of heatt, I advanced a theorem which, in     sim    its
plest form, may     thus expressed:—The effective force

conjunction with that of the equivalence of heat and work, have,                                    I
in the subsequent portion of that treatise, deduced various con
clusions concerning the deportment of bodies towards heat. As
the theorem of the equivalence of heat and work may be reduced
to a simple mechanical one, namely that of the equivalence
of vis viva and mechanical work,                                  I
                                         was convinced a priori that
there must be a mechanical theorem which would explain that
of the increase of the effective force of heat with the temperature.
                                           I
This theorem I think shall be able to communicate in what
follows.
    Let there be any system whatever of material points in sta
tionary motion.       By stationary motion I mean one in which the
points do not continually remove further and further from their
original position, and the velocities do not alter continuously in
the same direction, but the points move within a limited space,
and the velocities only fluctuate within certain limits.         Of this
nature are              all
                  periodic motions—such           those     the planets     as           of
about the sun, and the vibrations             elastic bodies, further, of
 such  irregular  motions      are attributed  as  the atoms and mole       to
 cules   of  body

 word vis (force).

124                Prof. R. Clausius on a Mechanical Theorem
  In relation to these two magnitudes the following theorem may
now be advanced:—
            The   mean    vis viva              of   the system is equal to              its   virial.
  Distinguishing the mean value          magnitude from      vari
                                                                of   a                                its
able value         by
              drawing     horizontal line over the formula which
                                           a
represents the latter, we can express our theorem      the follow                          by
ing equation:—
                         sº-               –         $2(Xa      +    Yy-HZ2).
     As regards the value   the virial,  the most important
                                            of                    thein                                  of

example, the forces which act upon the points         the mass may                  of
be attractions    repulsions which those points exert upon one
                        or
another, and which are governed         some law                  by
                                                        the distance.                 of
Let    us
        denote, then, the reciprocal force between two points                                                  of
the mass,    and m',      the distance atfrom each other,        p(r),                                by
                 an m

in which     attraction will reckon        positive, and repulsionas   a                       a
as
a    negative force; we thus have, for the reciprocal action:-
      Xa,   +   X'a'= p(r)          *::          a    +    p(r)
                                                                  ***-             —  p(r)     (ºr,
And since for the two other coordinates corresponding equations
may     be   formed, there results
             —  ,   (Xa   +    Yy--Z2+ X'a' +Y'y'--Z'2')= }rºp(r).
Extending this result                      to   the whole system              of   points,       we   obtain
                        –    $2(Xa              +    Yy--Zz)=             }Xrºb(r),
   which the sign                   the right-hand side         on
                                  all of
in                 summation                               the                                           of
equation relates    combinations
                             to       the points   the mass          of                  of                   in
pairs. Thence comes for the virial the expression
                                                 $2rgb(r);
and we immediately recognize the analogy between this expres
 sion and that which serves   determine the work accomplished
                                                      to
in  the motion.  Introducing the function q2(r) with the signi
fication
                                           q'(r)=      \    }(r)dr,

duration of a period may be taken as the time t; but for irregular
motions (and, if we please, also for periodic ones) we have only
to consider that the time t, in proportion to the times during
which the point moves in the same direction in respect of any
one of the directions of coordinates is very great, so that in the
course of the time t many changes of motion have taken place,

Mr. W. H. Barlow        on the Resistance   of  Flewure in Beams.      131
    The theory of Liebnitz    assumes a beam to be composed of longi
tudinal fibres  only,  contiguous, but unconnected, and exercising no
mutual lateral action. But it is remarked that a beam so constituted
would possess no power to resist transverse stress, and would only
have the properties of a rope.
    Cast iron and steel contain no actual fibre; and wrought iron
(although some qualities are fibrous) is able to resist strain nearly
equally in any direction.
   The idea of fibre is convenient as facilitating investigation; but the
word fibre, as applied to a homogeneous elastic solid, must not be
understood as meaning filaments of the material.        In effect it repre
sents lines of direction, in which the action of forces can be ascer
tained and measured; for in torsion-shearing and “angular defor
mation ” the fibres are treated by former writers as being at the
angle of 45°, because it has been shown that the diagonal resistances
have their greatest manifestation at that angle.
    Elastic solids being admitted to possess powers of resistance in the
direction of the diagonals, attention is called to omission of the effect
of resistance in the theory of beams.
    The author then states, as the result of his investigation, that com
pression and extension of the diagonal fibres constitute an element of
 strength equal to that of the longitudinal fibres, and that flewure is
 the consequence of the relative extensions and compressions in the
direct and diagonal fibres, arising out of the amount, position, and
direction of applied forces.
    Pursuing the subject, it is shown that certain normal relations
 subsist between the strains of direct fibres and their relative diago
 mals, evenly distributed strain being that in which the strain in the
 direct fibres is accompanied by half the amount of strain in the rela
 tive diagonal fibres.
    Any disturbance of this relation indicates the presence of another
 force.
    Thus tensile forces applied at right angles to compressive forces
 of equal amount, produce no strain in the diagonals.         But if forces
 applied at right angles to each other are both tensile, or both com
 pressive, the strain in the diagonal is as great as that in the direct
 fibres.
     It is also pointed out that in a given fibre a b c, the point b
 may be moved with regard to a and c, thus producing plus and
 minus strains in the same fibre.
    Treating a solid as being made up of a series of laminae, and showing
 that every change of figure can be represented by the variation in
 length of the diagonals, taken in connexion with, those of the direct
 fibres, the author proceeds to trace the effects of the application of
 tensile and compressive forces acting longitudinally on either side
  of the neutral plane, and shows that curvature is the result of the
 relation between the strains in direct fibres and those in the diagonals.
     The operation of a single tensile force applied along one side of
  the plate and a transverse stress are likewise traced out, and the
  conditions of “elastic equilibrium” referred to.

      a b c d represents a portion of a beam strained by transverse
 forces into the circular curve a e.
     Two resistances arise.
      1. That due to the extension and compression of the longitudinal
 fibres produced by the rotation of b d about the neutral axis, which
 is the resistance considered in the theory of Leibnitz.
     2. That due to the extension and compression of the diagonal
 fibres, caused by the deformation of the square a b c d into the figure
 a hoc, which is the resistance of flexure.
     It is then shown that, in a solid rectangular beam, the second
 resistance is equal to the first, and that both resistances act indepen
 dently, and consequently that the true theoretic resistance of a solid
 rectangular beam is exactly twice that arrived at by the theory of
  Leibnitz,
      The strength so computed is in general accordance with the results
 of experiments in cast iron, wrought iron,      steel, and other materials,
  the maximum strength being found in cast iron, which is one
  eighth above, and the minimum in glass, which is one-fourth below
  the calculated strength.
      The author considers this treatment of the subject as arising ne
  cessarily out of Dr. Hook's law “ut tensio sic vis,” and that it is
  in effect completing the application of those principles which were
  only partially applied by Leibnitz.
      The paper concludes with some practical illustrations (accompa
  nied by photographs) of the effect of diagonal action.
      The appendix contains the results of experiments on the tensile,
  compressive, and transverse resistances of steel.
      “On   Deep-sea Thermometers.”       By Staff-Commander John E.
  Davis,   R.N.
      The results of thermometric observations         at great depths in the
  ocean not being   of a satisfactory nature, the attention of the       Hy
  drographer of the Navy was directed to the defects in the construc
  tion of the Six's self-registering thermometers then in use, and also
  to the want of knowledge of the effects of compression on the bulb ;

  and as it was known that a delicate thermometer was affected in
  vacuo, it was natural to suppose that an opposite effect would be had
  by placing them under pressure, and particularly such as they would
  be subjected to at great depths.
      Several thermometers, of a superior construction, were made by
  different makers, and permission was granted to make experiments by
  pressure in an hydraulic press; but much delay was caused by not
  being able to obtain a press suitable to the requirements, until Mr.
  Casella, the optician, had a testing-apparatus constructed at his own
  expense, and the experiments were commenced.
     Previously to the experiments being made, Dr. W. A. Miller,
  W.P.R.S., proposed, or rather revived, a mode of protecting the bulb
  from compression by encasing the full bulb in glass, the space between
 the case and the bulb being nearly filled with alcohol".
     A wrought-iron bottle had been made to contain a thermometer,
 for the purpose of comparison with those subjected to compression;
 but it failed, and finally burst under great compression; it proved,
 however, of but little consequence, as those designed by Dr. Miller
 showed so little difference under pressure that they were at once ac
 cepted as standards.
     Two series of experiments were then most carefully made, at pres
 sures equal to depths of 250, 500, 750, &c. to 2500 fathoms, the
 results of which satisfactorily proved that the strongest-made unpro
 tected thermometers were liable to considerable error, and therefore
 that      previous observations made with such instruments were in
          all
 correct.
     Experiments were also made         the testing-apparatus with Sir Wm.

a is deduced, namely, certain weights of argentic chloride and
magnesic pyrophosphate, are, if singly considered, new with each
experiment; they depend on time, rate of heating, the state of divi
sion of the nitrate, and other conditions.  But, assuming the results
to have been brought about under a law of chemical action, the values
of a must be independent of those circumstances, by which the pri
mitive numerator and denominator could have been only pari passu
affected; they are related only to the actual occurrence of the re
action.   This property, in a chemical ratio, has not, it is believed,

     1. “On the Geological Position and Geographical Distribution of
  the Reptilian or Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Bristol Area.”           By
  R. Etheridge, Esq., F.G.S., Palaeontologist to the Geological Survey
  of Great Britain.
      The author noticed the history of our knowledge of the Dolomitic
  Conglomerates of the Bristol area from which the remains of Dino
                                                                              º
  saurian Reptiles have been obtained, and then described their mode
  of occurrence and distribution over the district near Bristol.          He
  regarded these deposits as due to the action of the sea-waves
  of the later or Middle Triassic periods upon the rocks of older
  Triassic (Bunter) or Permian age during the gradual elevation of
  the land, and as the probable representatives in point of time of the
  Muschelkalk, otherwise deficient in Britain.             The author then
  noticed the influence of the         conglomerate   upon  the production of
   certain minerals, such as calamine and haematitic iron-ores, and

conglomerate at different levels, in which he recognized two great
periods of oscillation, the first witnessing a downward movement of
the Palaeozoic lands and lasting throughout the deposition of the
New Red marl and sands, and the second, during which the accu
mulations of the former were again, at least partly, denuded. With
regard to the time at which the remains of Thecodont Reptiles were
imbedded in the conglomerate, the author inferred from the evidence
that this took place late in the period of the Keuper.
    2. “On the Superficial Deposits of portions of the Avon and
Severn Walleys and adjoining Districts.”       By T. G. B. Lloyd, Esq.,
C.E., F.G.S.
    The author, after describing the general characters of what he
termed the Drifts of the Upper and Lower series, and the fresh
water gravels of the Lower Avon, comprised within the district
of the Avon valley between Tewkesbury and Rugby, and of the
 Severn valley above and below the town of Worcester, endeavoured to
 show that there was a balance of evidence in favour of the existence
 of an upper and lower platform of drift in the main valley of the
 Lower Avon, the upper one being of marine origin, and probably
 belonging to the same epoch as the stratified beds of gravel in the
 neighbourhood of Worcester, which contain marine shells and mam
 malian remains, whilst the lower one, of freshwater origin, had been
 derived from the former by fluviatile action, as supposed by the
 late Prof. Strickland. Further, that there was no evidence to warrant
 the supposition of the existence of high- and low-level river-gravels
 in those portions of the Severn and Avon valleys under review, and
 that the apparent absence of any freshwater shells in the gravels of
 the Severn valley between Bridgnorth and Tewkesbury led to the
 inference that the freshwater gravels of the Avon were not repre
 sented in the adjoining portions of the Severn valley, although re
 mains of some of the same species of Mammalia occurred in both
 localities.  After stating his opinion that the time had not yet   ar
 rived for indulging in theoretical speculations concerning the pheno
 mena of the Drifts of the Upper and Lower series exhibited in so
  small an area as the one under consideration, the author concluded
 by expressing hopes that the facts which he had brought forward
  would contribute their share of help to the further elucidation of
  the question.
     3.  “On the Surface-deposits    in the neighbourhood of Rugby.”
  By  J.  M. Wilson, Esq., F.G.S.
        January 26th, 1870–Prof. T. H. Huxley, LL.D., F.R.S.,
                          President, in the Chair.
     The following communication was read:—
     “On the Crag of Norfolk and associated Beds.” By Joseph
  Prestwich, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S.
     The author commenced by referring to his last paper, in which

 138                      Geological   Society:—
 he divided the Red Crag into two divisions—a lower one, of variable
 oblique-bedded strata, and an upper one, of sands passing up into the
 clay known as the Chillesford clay. In 1849 he had alluded to the
 possibility of this clay being synchronous with the Norwich Crag.
 He has since traced this upper or Chillesford division of the Red
 Crag northwards, with a view to determine its relation to the Nor
wich Crag. He has found it at various places inland; but the best
 exhibition of it occurs in the Easton-Bavant Cliff.            He there
 found in it a   group   of shells similar to those at   Chillesford, and
 under it the well-known bed of mammaliferous or Norwich Crag,
 with the usual shells. The author also showed that in this cliff and
the one nearer Lowestoft traces of the Forest-bed clearly set in upon
 the Chillesford clay.     He traced these beds at the base of Hor
ton Cliff, and then passed on to the well-known cliffs of Happis
burgh and Mundesley.        He considered the Chillesford clay to pass
beneath the   Elephant   bed,  and to represent some part of the Forest
bed. The same       clay may   be traced to near Weybourne.     The Crag
under these beds he referred to the Chillesford sands. Mention was
then made of the sands and shingle above the Chillesford, for
which the author proposed the names of “Southwold Sands and
Shingle.” These, usually, are very unfossiliferous; but at two or
three places near Southwold the author found indications of an
abundance of shells (Mytilus &c.) and Foraminifera in some iron
sandstones intercalated in this series.       In the Norfolk cliffs these
beds contain    alternating   seams of marine and freshwater shells.
The inland range of the beds to Aldeby, Norwich, and Coltishall
was next traced, and the Chillesford clay shown to be present in
each section, and the sands beneath to be referable to the Chilles
ford sands, as already shown by other geologists, on the evidence of
the organic remains. Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys, who had carefully examined
the shells of the Norwich Crag for the author, stated that a consi–
derable number of arctic species were found in the Norfolk Crag
which did not occur in Suffolk. While, therefore, the Norwich Crag
seems to be synchronous with a portion of the Suffolk Crag, that
portion is the upper division; and therefore the triple arrangement
proposed by Mr. Charlesworth and advocated by Sir C. Lyell, together
with the fact of the setting in of a gradually more severe climate,
pointed out by the late Dr. Woodward and by Sir C. Lyell, are con
firmed.
   Mr. Prestwich then referred to      the origin of the materials of the
Southwold shingle, and showed that, with few exceptions, they
came from the south.       In it he had found a considerable number of
worn   fragments   of chert and ragstone from the Lower Greensand of
Kent. He considered this a convenient base-line for the Quaternary
period, as then commenced the spread of the marine gravels over the
south of England, and soon after commenced the great denudations
which have given the great features to the country.

      On the Fossil Corals of the Australian Tertiary Deposits.        139
     February 9th, 1870.-Prof. Huxley, LL.D., F.R.S., President,
                                in the Chair.
     The following communications were read:—
     1. “On the Fossil Corals (Madreporaria) of the Australian
Tertiary Deposits.” By P. Martin Duncan, M.B. Lond., F.R.S., Sec.
Geol. Soc., Professor of Geology in King's College, London.
     The author noticed the history of our knowledge of the South
Australian Tertiary Deposits, and indicated the general distribution
of the fossiliferous beds from which the corals forming the subject
of his communication were derived. These were said to be con
fined to the region west of Cape Howe, prevailing especially in the
province of Victoria, where they had been admirably surveyed by
Mr. Selwyn and the officers under him, and to consist chiefly of
limestones covered, and in some cases underlain, by great outflows of
basalt.     The author then gave a list and descriptions of the species
(31 in number) of fossil Madreporaria obtained from these South
Australian Tertiary beds, followed by remarks on the characters and
relations of the more remarkable forms, and on the localities where
they have occurred.          From his examination of these fossils, he
objected to the application of the divisions adopted in European geo
 logy to the deposits in which they are found.      He then compared the
 assemblage of corals obtained from the South-Australian Tertiaries
 with those found in various deposits elsewhere, or living in the
 existing seas.     The species were stated not to belong to reef-building
 forms, but to such as now occupy the sea-bottom from low spring
 tide mark to the depth where Polyzoa, abound.         Of these, 20 genera
 were said to be now       represented  in the Australian seas; but only
 three of them to have species in the Tertiaries, viz. the cosmopolite
  Trochocyathus, Flabellum, and Amphihelia. The fossil species of
  these were stated to be quite distinct from those now living in the
  neighbouring sea.       Two species, viz. Flabellum Condeanum and F.
  distinctum, are living in the Chinese, Japanese, and Red Seas; the
  author's Plecotrochus elongatus is very nearly allied to the Chinese
  P. Condeanus; and a Deltocyathus is regarded by the author as only
  a varietal form of a living West-Indian and European Miocene
   species (D. italicus).   Three species are common to the Australian
   and European cainozoic deposits. Several of the species were said to
   present curious anomalies of structure, such as so frequently appear
   in Australian forms, and those of the different beds to exhibit so close
   a general resemblance, that they offer no evidence of great changes
  having taken place during the deposition of the whole series of sedi
   ments. The evidence afforded by the fossil corals led the author to

the same age throughout Northern Europe.”    By     W. Judd, Esq.,            J.
F.G.S.
    This paper embodied the results                   of   the author's further study                       of

 Mr.      J.W. Judd on the        Neocomian Strata           in Yorkshire &c.         141
the Neocomian beds of the north of England, in connexion with
those of North-western Germany.
    The inland development of these strata in the Wale of Pickering
was described as being greatly obscured by superficial deposits. The
beds, however, exposed at Reighton, West Heslerton, and Knapton
were shown to agree, both in physical and palaeontological characters,
with several of those before described in the cliff section at Speeton.
    The Neocomian ironstones of Lincolnshire have, since the date of
the former paper on the subject (1867), been extensively opened out
 by mining-operations;         and the valuable and instructive sections
thus afforded were described in detail. A general sketch was then
given of the range and characteristics of the Neocomian strata in
Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.
    Evidence was next adduced to show that strata of the same age,
 and remarkably similar in character, had been deposited over a very
wide area in Northern Europe. Throughout the whole of these
 districts, however, the Neocomian strata were very inadequately ex
 posed, and afforded no good general sections; and the Speeton Cliff
 thus acquired an additional interest from the fact that it forms a
 valuable, and almost the only, key whereby we can correlate the
 beds over this vast area.
    Studying the continental deposits in this manner, by the aid of
 the Speeton section the fossiliferous clays of the island of Heligo
 land were shown to belong to the “zone of Ammonites Speetonensis,”
 i. e. the upper part of the Lower Neocomian. The boulders found
 in the drift deposits of Holland were referred to as evidence of the
 former wide extension of limestones similar to those of Tealby in
 Lincolnshire. In Westphalia the sandstones, limestones, ironstones,
 and clays, so extensively developed in the hills of Bentheim and the
 Teutoburger Wald, were shown to be of Middle Neocomian age,
 while certain beds of clay in the same district were referable to the
  Upper Neocomian. In Hanover the “Hilsthon” of M. Fr. Ad.
  Römer was shown to be in              its
                                         upper part Upper Neocomian, and
in      its
         lower   part  Middle   Neocomian,    the latter passing locally into
  beds    of
           oolitic  ironstone,  sandstones,  and limestones precisely similar
 to  those     of
               the same    age    Lincolnshire. The narrow strip

  ever, the Neocomian series was more complete; for underneath some
  400 feet         clays, which
                   of              onpalaeontological evidence clearly belong
 to  the Upper and Middle divisions, there were certain marly lime
  stones,     places becoming ferruginous, containing
              in                                                       an

of 3 or 4 degrees is produced; this is noted, after which the cooling
of the thermometer is observed during five minutes.         The quantity
of heat  given off is known,    the effect it has produced  is calculated,
and from the known     formulae   of calorimetry  the desired  capacity is
deduced *.
   The old method required two operations, which were:—the first,
to heat in a stove for a long time the body to be studied, and to pour
it with minute precautions into the calorimeter; the second, to ob
serve the thermometer immersed in the calorimeter.         In the method
which I propose the first operation is omitted, and the second suffices
such as it was before. The corrections remain the same, but are
simplified.
   They are simplified because a lower temperature is sufficient, and
because, the heat given off being proportional to the time, the me
thod known as Rumford's is applicable.                    We may even dispense
with all correction, as I shall show.
    I provided the external envelope of the apparatus with a spiral
twenty times as long as the first, and immersed the whole into a
vessel containing twenty times as much liquid as the calorimeter,
and forming a medium in which the latter is immersed.                              The
current     passes   simultaneously      into   the     two    spirals;   it produces
there heats proportional to the quantities of liquid, and consequently
equal heatings.       At each moment the temperatures of the calorimeter
and       its
          surroundings    are      equilibrium, and the first, neither gaining

in  unison with the tuning-fork.         By this method, which         more                         is
correct than the first, M. Helmholtz found that the vowel               was                          A

by M. Donders, and he found it to be re.               If a tuning-fork be
tuned for this note, we ascertain, in fact, that it is increased whilst
the mouth passes from E to I; at least I have been able to assure my
self that the increase occurs before the mouth is exactly arranged for
the I.     Hence the true characteristic of I must be higher.            By
constructing tuning-forks more and more acute, I ascertained that this
note was approached; it was finally found to be si Po; with tuning
forks still higher, it is immediately felt that the limit has been passed.
   For OU M. Donders had given fa, This note can undoubtedly be
strengthened by the mouth, but it is only in departing very little
from the position O; and one feels that the note of OU must be much
                                                                 fa,
more grave.      M. Helmholtz assigns          OU. However,     to  tuning                   a

         COMPRESSIBILITY OF GASES UNDER HIGH PRESSURES,
                       BY M. L. CAILLETET.
  In  order   obtain very high pressures applicable
                   to                                  the experi                       to
ments       in
          which   am  engaged,
                       I       after numerous trials   fixed upon                   I
an apparatus which consisted         hollow steel cylinder firmly
                                                      of   a

fastened on a cast-iron stand. A piston, also of steel, is moved in this
cylinder by a square-threaded screw, which works in a female screw
of bronze, wedged in the axis of a fly, also of cast iron. When this
fly is turned by means of the pegs on its circumference (as the screw
cannot follow it in its rotation, owing to a catch secured by two
slide bars), the piston traverses the vacuum of the cylinder in a direc
tion determined by the direction of the motion of the fly. The water
which the cylinder contains cannot escape; a leather is fitted so per
fectly that, even under pressures of more than 800 atmospheres,
scarcely a drop of liquid escapes.      To the cylinder in which the
compression is effected a steel laboratory-tube can be united by a
capillary tube of copper—which, leaving that part of the apparatus
 quite free, allows the majority of the experiments to be made here.
The pressure is estimated by two mutually controlling processes:
 (1) by a lever which rests on a very moveable valve; (2) by a Des
goffe's modified manometer, which I will briefly describe.
    This instrument consists of a cylindrical cast-iron vessel, filled
with mercury, upon which rests a metallic disk. A thin membrane
of cadutchouc separates the disk from the mercury, which con
 sequently cannot escape.     A metal rod penetrates to the centre of
 the disk, passing through a leather fixed in a bronze cylinder con
nected with the pressure-machine.        When the compressed water
 acts on the small piston, the pressure is transmitted to the mercury,
 which rises in a vertical glass tube, communicating with the reser
voir.
  If  the ratio of the surface of the small piston to that of the disk is
= 1 : 100, then for a pressure of 100 atmosphercs the mercury will
only rise in the manometric tube 1 atmosphere, or 0.76 metre.
    A grave a priori objection might be made to this apparatus; in
fact, it is not known what resistance the leather exercises on the
piston.    In the apparatus employed by me, the ratio of the surfaces
is = 1  ; 212, and it is sufficient to lower the piston   of a millimetre in
order to raise the mercury 4:30 metres, the height of my manometric
tube.     The path traversed being very small, the resistance will be
nearly none. To overcome the inertia, the mercury is caused to oscil
late about its position of equilibrium in the glass tube by means of a
small lever, which acts on the compressing disk.           The manometer
thus constructed has been verified up to 80 atmospheres by the help
of a very large manometer, in which the compressed air was replaced
by hydrogen.      The graduation was based on the numbers published
by M. Regnault. The apparatus for pressure, such as I have just
 described       it,
                easily gives pressures from     8   900 atmospheres, which

 the sound of a pistol-shot; but the splinters of broken glass were
 not thrown about, owing to the metal cover.
     In order to investigate Mariotte's law under high pressures,                 I
 employ a cylindrical glass tube capable of containing 40 to 50 cubic
 centims. of gas; a capillary glass tube is welded to this reservoir, in
 which the compressed gases will be measured. The other extremity
 of the reservoir is open and tapered. This apparatus is filled with
 the gas to be examined pure and dry, the extremity of the capillary
 tube is welded, and to the lower point a kind of small inverted gauge
 filled with mercury is fitted, which admits of the apparatus being
 placed in the laboratory-tube filled with mercury.           At the moment
 when the pressure is exerted by the machine, the mercury, pressed
 by the water, will penetrate into the reservoir through the tapered
 part, will drive back the gases in the capillary tube, and will just
 stop at a point of its height.      In order to determine this point exactly
 (which cannot be done during the experiment, because the apparatus
 is enclosed in the steel tube), I had recourse to an artifice which
 gives extremely correct results.
     With this object Islightly gilded the interior of the capillary tube
 by M. Böttger's process. The mercury, rising in contact with the sides,
 dissolves the gold; and the height of the bright metal corresponds
 exactly with the height attained by the mercury.            This is noted on
 a coat of varnish applied to the surface of the glass.         It can be un
 derstood how a great number of heights, corresponding to the vo
 lumes occupied by the gas at pressures determined by the manometer,
may thus be found.
     The correctness of the determinations which I have obtained de
pend especially (1) on the marking of the heights attained by the
mercury in the capillary tube, (2) on the weights of this mercury,
(3) on the correctness of the manometer. I have assured myself by
numerous experiments that the volume of the mercury could be ob
tained very correctly; the weight taken has always been the mean
of four operations.      I have already discussed the correctness of the
manometer; I have moreover compressed at the same time, in the
same tube, two different gases.         I thus proved that the volumes occu
pied by the two gases under identical pressures corresponded well to
the numbers found in my experiments.             The numbers obtained have
not   undergone    the correction due to the compressibility of the glass
apparatus; I did not know this contraction; I made                     all
                                                                       my de
terminations for the different gases under the same pressures,           suchin
a   manner   that,   if cause
                          a        of
                                   error not   recognized  should vitiate my
results    by the same   quantity,   the  experiments,  made under identical
 conditions, will still remain comparable.

                                      his memorable researches         on

ON THE RAPIDITY OF THE ABSORPTION OF CARBONIC OXIDE BY
                    THE LUNGs.      BY M. N. GRKHANT.
    In the researches which I made in 1864      on the renewal of air in
the lungs of man, I proved that in a man the volume of whose
lungs is equal to 2-93 litres after an inspiration, and to half a litre of
air after an expiration, 100 cub. centims. of gaseous mixture, taken
at any point of the air-vessels, have received 11 cub. centims. of
 pure air.
                                                          I
    From this measurement, obtained by experiment, drew this con
 clusion—that if a man be placed in an atmosphere containing
poisonous gas, from the first inspiration this gas is distributed
throughout all the air-vessels, to be given up to absorption by the
blood.
    To establish more completely this consequence, and to study the
 successive phases of poisoning by the medium of the lungs, I made
 several experiments in the physiological laboratory at the Museum
 of Natural History, under the direction of my illustrious teacher, M.
 Claude Bernard.        As a poisonous gas I used carbonic oxide; and I
 chose this    gas   for several reasons.   M. Claude Bernard was the
 first to make out that carbonic oxide kills animals because it fixes
 itself on the red blood-globules and displaces the oxygen combined
with these globules, that in an animal which succumbs to poisoning
 by carbonic oxide the arterial blood contains much less oxygen than
the normal arterial blood and the globules are combined with a
large proportion of carbonic oxide.
    We know that the crystalline combination of carbonic oxide with
haemoglobine has been investigated and isolated by M. Hoppe
Seyler, and that the spectroscope supplies a qualitative test for this
combination of oxygen with haemoglobine.
    But in the research which I have undertaken I had another
object.     I proposed to determine quantitatively the proportion of
 carbonic oxide combined with the red globules at the different periods
                                I
of poisoning: this is why have employed, in order to extract the
carbonic oxide from blood, the following method, which offers every
certitude.
    After having extracted the gases from some normal blood in a
vacuum at 40°, by means of a mercury pump, a volume of sulphuric
acid double that of the blood was introduced into the extraction-appa
ratus, the bath was heated to 100°, and boiling was maintained for
half an hour; under these conditions we still obtained carbonic acid,
a trace of oxygen, and a little nitrogen, but no trace of carbonic
oxide.    But if the blood of an animal poisoned with carbonic oxide
is operated on in the same manner, the vacuum alone at 40° gives
carbonic acid, oxygen, and nitrogen, but no trace of carbonic oxide;
whilst sulphuric acid at 100° in the vacuum destroys the globules,
and completely drives away the carbonic oxide combined with the

   Other experiments, made under the same conditions, give analo
gous results.     Hence we see that in an animal breathing air con
taining tº of carbonic oxide (a mixture highly poisonous), the
arterial blood, between the 10th and 25th second, contains already
4 per cent. of carbonic oxide and less oxygen than the normal
blood (14.6 per cent.); and between 1 minute 15 seconds and 1
minute 30 seconds, 18.4 per cent. and oxygen in very diminished
quantity (4 per cent.).     At that time the animal was in great dan
ger; and had the experiment lasted a minute longer, it would have
died.                                                               -
   These  indisputable   results are directly   applicable  to   man;  and we
may assert that if a man enters a highly deleterious atmosphere,
the gaseous poison is dissolved in the arterial blood from the first mi
nute, and brought into contact with the anatomical elements, which
kills him.
   Every day we have too numerous examples of sudden death hap
pening to workmen whose occupations compel them to expose them
selves to deleterious gases or vapours, either in descending wells or
entering the galleries of mines, the air of which is poisoned, or more
or less deprived of oxygen.       But physiologists have certainly given
advice which might in future free the life of man from all such dan
gers; and this advice ought to be carried out by law.
    Before descending a well, ditch, or gallery, of which the air has
not been renewed for a long time, the workman ought to lower a
cage containing a bird or a small mammal, as a rat or a guinea-pig :
if the animal, left in the confined atmosphere for ten to fifteen
minutes, can stand this test, a man may descend without fear; if
the animal succumb, ventilation must be energetically established,
until another animal can resist a new proof.
    The employment of an animal in this manner would preserve man
from accidents too frequently mortal, as the Davy lamp, in coal
mines, has saved the lives of so many miners.—Comptes                  Rendus,

The generally accepted theory proved by the Rev. Canon Moseley
                                          to be incorrect.
     INCE  the time that Professor Tyndall had shown that all the
      phenomena formerly                  Professor Forbes to plas
ticity could be explained upon the principle of regelation, disco
vered by Faraday, the viscous theory of glacier-motion has been
pretty generally given up. The ice of a glacier is now almost
universally believed to be, not a soft plastic substance, but a sub
stance hard, brittle, and unyielding. The power that the glacier
has of accommodating itself to the inequalities of      bed without        its
losing   its
           apparent continuity    referred     the property

that   impels the  glacier  forward       still question under discus
                                                    is         a
sion. Various theories have been propounded regarding the
cause   ofthe descent       glaciers,of             all   of
                                              which have been abandoned
with the   exception             of
                          that which attributes their descent         gra              to

Rev. Canon Moseley has lately investigated this point, and
has found that the amount of work performed on a glacier (assu
ming, of course, that the ice shears in the solid state) during                                                          its

supposed; and the generally received theory                     glacier-motion
must therefore                  be
                         abandoned.           can perceive  I   way       escape           no of              of

I    presume that few who have given much thought           the                                                    to
subject    glacier-motion have not had some slight misgivings
            of
in  regard    the commonly received theory. There are some

facts which      never could harmonize with this theory.

the  upper    half     the  plank    must rise and the lower half descend.
But the side which rises has                 perform work against gravity,

case  also,   favours the      descending      part  and    opposes    the   rising
part, more         the plank will descend than rise, and consequently

                 of                 Neither does this experiment prove
that the ice was deflected without shearing; for although the

Mathews,        Ipresume, admits, yet Mr. Moseley would reply that

moving, everybody (whatever might be his theory as to the
cause of the motion of glaciers) would at once admit that the
middle of the plank (which, of course, was not fixed) would begin
slowly to descend the incline in the manner that the ice of a
glacier actually does, and that the plank, not being permitted to
move at its ends, would become bent or deflected in the middle.
Then, if everybody would admit that the plank would be deflected
in the middle notwithstanding the friction of the ice on the                                                                            in

ing the unit of shear on this ground:—The shearing of the
ice in a glacier is effected with extreme slowness; but the shear
ing in Canon Moseley’s experiment was effected with rapidity;
and although it required 75 lbs. to shear one square inch of sur
face in his experiment, it does not follow that 75 lbs. would be
required to shear the ice if done in the slow manner in which it
is effected in the glacier. “In short,” says Mr. Ball, “to ascer
tain the resistance opposed to very slow changes in the relative
positions of the particles, so slight as to be insensible at short
distances,   Mr. Moseley measures the resistance opposed to rapid
disruption between contiguous portions of the same substance.”
   There is force in this objection; and here we arrive at a really
weak point in Canon Moseley’s reasoning.                 His experiments
show that if we want to shear ice            quickly  a  weight   of nearly
120 lbs. is required; but if the thing is to be done more
slowly, 75 lbs. will suffice+.       In short, the number of pounds
required to shear the ice depends to a large extent on the length
of time that the weight is allowed to act; the longer it is allowed
to act, the less will be the weight required to perform the work.
“I   am curious to know,” says Mr. Mathews when referring to
this point, “what weight would have sheared the ice if a day
had been allowed for               its
                             operation.”           not know what would

cause the one to slip over the other, then the amount of pressure
required to do this will depend upon the time you allow for the
thing being done.     If the thing is to be done rapidly, as in some
of Mr. Moseley’s experiments, it will take, as he has shown, a
pressure of about 120 lbs. ; but if the thing has to be done more
slowly, as in some other of his experiments, 75 lbs. will suffice,
And if sufficient time be allowed, as in the case of glaciers, the
thing may be done without any weight whatever being applied to
the ice, and, of course, Mr. Moseley’s argument, that a glacier
cannot descend by                      its
                        weight alone, falls   the ground.     But                    to                                        if,

                                        I
of glacier-motion which ventured to advance some time ago*.
It results, therefore, from Canon Moseley’s own theory, that the
longer the time that is allowed for the pressure to shear the ice,
the less will be the pressure required; for, according to his
theory, a very large proportion of the displacement is produced
by the motive power of heat entering the ice; and, as it follows
of course, other things being equal, the longer the time during
which the heat is allowed toact, the greater will be the proportionate
amount of displacement produced by the heat; consequently the
less will require to be done by the weight applied. In the case of
the glacier, Mr. Moseley concludes that at least thirtyorforty times
as much work is done by the motive power of heat in the way of
shearing the ice as is done by mere pressure or weight. Then,
if sufficient time be allowed, why may not far more be done by
heat in shearing the ice in his experiment than by the weight
applied ? In this case how is he to know how much of the shear
ing is effected by the heat and how much by the weight. If the
greater part of the shearing of the ice in the case of a glacier is
produced, not by pressure, but by the heat which necessarily
enters the ice, it would be inconceivable that in his experiments
the heat entering the ice should not produce, at least to some
extent, a similar effect.        And if a portion of the displacement
of the   particles  is  produced    by heat, then the weight which is
applied cannot be regarded as the measure of the force employed
in the displacement, any more than it could be inferred that the
 weight of the glacier is the measure of the force employed in the
shearing of         it.  the weight

glacier-motion which                        I
                               have adopted, heat will aid the displace
ment of the particles whether the temperature be kept constant or
not. In short, it is absolutely impossible in our experiments to
be certain that heat is not in some way or other concerned in the
displacement of the particles of the ice.             But we can shorten the
time, and thus make sure that the amount of heat entering the
ice during the experiments is too small to affect materially the
result. We cannot in this case say that                  the displacement has    all

        Although Canon Moseley has thus ably and     successfully           so                        so
shown the insufficiency     the generally received theory
                                                  of          the                                                    of

not been so fortunate in his attempt to establish a theory of his
own. And            I
                cannot help thinking that the influence which his
remarkable communication to the Royal Society, on the impossi
bility of the descent of glaciers by their weight alone, would have
had on the minds of physicists, has been much impaired by the
prominence which he has since been giving to a theory which few,
I fear, will ever be able to accept.      Whatever may be the fate which
awaits the generally accepted theory of the cause of glacier
motion, his own theory seems to be beset by difficulties of a phy
sical nature which will require to be removed before he can expect
that it will be received by physicists in general.                           -
    Most of these difficulties have already been noticed and dis
cussed by Professor Forbes, Mr. Mathews, Mr. Ball, and others.
I  shall therefore only briefly allude to a few of those that more
particularly bear on some points which have not already been
sufficiently discussed.
    Canon Moseley has shown that the mere weight of the ice is
wholly insufficient to overcome the cohesion of the crystalline
particles, so as to break their connexion and cause them to be
displaced one over the other.           This point I regard as fully esta
blished.     It is implied in the generally received theory, that, in
the descent of a glacier, owing to differential motion the cohe
sion of the particles of the            broken, and that these solid par
                                                   ice
                                                     is
ticles are forced over one another and alongside one another. Mr.
Moseley then concludes that follows,               itnecessary consequence,
                                                                        as
                                                                         a
that there must                  be
                         some other    force,    addition       the weight
                                                                    in              to                      of
the  ice,  pushing   the   glacier  forward. Here lies the fundamental
error.     He has not proved that            the descent      the glacier the
                                                              in                    of

True, the ice moves with differential motion, and,

consequence, the particles are displaced over each other.                 Two
particles separate, and the one moves past the other; but the

moment when separation took place both                   the hard crystalline in
and solid state? Canon Moseley does not prove this;                     merely                    he
assumes    it    to  the becase;   but     must      proved
                                                          it             be

you must be wrong when you assert that the glacier descends by
its weight only; for,          have demonstrated, the mere weight

       Mr.  J. Croll  on the Cause  of the Motion of Glaciers.      165
sun's rays are cut off. The sun shines down with piercing rays
and the traveller is scorched; the glacier melts on the surface, but
it still remains “cold as ice.” The sun passes behind a cloud
or disappears behind a neighbouring hill; the scorching rays
are then withdrawn, and the traveller is now subjected to radia
tion on every side from surfaces at the freezing-point.
    It is also a necessary condition in Mr. Moseley’s theory that
the heat should pass easily into and out of the glacier; for unless
this were the case sudden changes of temperature could produce
little or no effect on the great mass of the glacier. How, then,
is it possible that during the heat of summer the temperature of
the glacier could vary much f During that season, in the lower
valleys at least, everything, with the exception of the glacier, is
above the freezing-point; consequently when the glacier goes into
the shade there is nothing to lower the ice below the freezing
point; and as the sun's rays do not raise the temperature of the
ice above the freezing-point, the temperature of the glacier must
therefore remain unaltered during that season.            It therefore
follows that, instead of a glacier moving more rapidly during
the middle of summer than during the middle of winter, it
 should, according to Moseley’s theory, have no motion whatever
                                 id:
 during summer.
    The following, written fifteen years ago by Professor Forbes
 on this very point, is most                   :—“But how stands the
 fact? Mr. Moseley quotes from De Saussure the following daily
 ranges of the temperature of the air in the month of July at the
 Col du Géant and at Chamouni, between which points the gla
cier lies:                                   o
          At the Col du Géant
                                                      ,

          At Chamouni         .  .  .    . 10-092
 And he assumes ‘the same mean daily variation of temperature
 to obtain throughout the length "[and depth ?] ‘of the Glacier du
 Géant which De Saussure observed in July at the Col du Géant.”
 But between what limits does the temperature of the air oscil
 late 7 We find, by referring to the third volume of De Saussure's
 Travels, that the mean temperature of the coldest hour (4 A.M.)
 during his stay at the Col du Géant was 33°03 Fahrenheit, and
 of the warmest (2 P.M.) 42°-61 F. So that even upon that ex
 posed ridge, between 2000 and 3000 feet above where the glacier
 can be properly said to commence, the air does not, on an ave
 rage of the month of July, reach the freezing-point at any hour
 of the night. Consequently the range of temperature attributed
 to the glacier is between limits absolutely incapable  of effecting the
 expansion of the ice in the smallest degree **.

    Again, during winter, as Mr. Ball remarks, the glacier is com
 pletely covered with snow and thus protected both from the                                                                 in
 fluence of cold and of heat, so that there can be nothing either to
 raise the temperature of the ice above the freezing-point, or to
 bring it below that point; and consequently the glacier ought to
 remain immoveable during that season also.
    “There can be no doubt, therefore,” Mr. Moseley states,
 “that the rays of the sun, which in those alpine regions are of
 such remarkable intensity, find their way into the depths of the
 glacier. They are a power, and there is no such thing as the
 loss of power.   The mechanical work which is their equivalent,
and into which they are converted when received into the sub
stance of a solid body, accumulates and stores itself up in the ice
under the form of what we call elastic force or tendency to                                                                 di

the ice in the direction in which the resistance is weakest, and
by      its

168         Mr.       J.   Croll on the Cause of the Motion of Glaciers.
the mere weight of the glacier was sufficient to shear the ice.
Canon Moseley has investigated this point, and shown that it
is not. He has found that for a glacier to shear in the way that
it is supposed to do, it would require a force some thirty or forty
times as great as the weight of the glacier. Consequently, for
the glacier to descend, a force in addition to that of gravitation
is required. What, then, is this force?         It is found that the rate
at which the glacier descends depends upon the amount of heat
which it is receiving. This shows that the motion of the glacier
is in some way or other dependent upon heat... Is heat, then,
the force we are in search of? The answer to this, of course, is,
since heat is a force necessarily required, we have no right to
assume any other till we see whether or not heat will suffice. In
what way, then, does heat aid gravitation in the descent of the
glacier? In what way does heat assist gravitation in the shear
ing of the ice? There are two ways whereby we may conceive the
thing to be done: the heat may assist gravitation to shear, by
pressing the               ice
                    forward,        may assist gravitation
                                                or it           diminish                  by
ing the cohesion        the particles, and thus allowing gravitation
                                 of                                                                          to
produce motion which           otherwise could not produce. Every at

                   The alleged limit to the thickness of a glacier.
      In his memoir “On the Mechanical Properties of Ice,” pub
 lished in the Philosophical Magazine for January 1870, Canon
 Moseley arrives at a conclusion in regard to the crushing of ice
 to which I am unable, without some qualifications, to agree. In
 Xis experiments                  ice
                         was crushed under           pressure        308.4 lbs.

 feet  in thickness the ice       the under surface must be crushed
 by   the incumbent weight. Professor Phillips also made some
 experiments              on
                    the crushing        ice, and       came of      the conclu  he             to

172     Mr. G. Gore   on the Molecular Movements and Magnetic
further   results showing the existence of additional molecular
changes.
    I took a well-annealed   and straight bar of wrought iron 32
inches (=81.3 centims.)     long  and § of an inch (=9.5 millims.)
in diameter, supported it in a horizontal position by two wooden
clips, placed one end of the bar in a coil of thin insulated copper
wire connected with a distant galvanometer, and the other end
within a coil of thick insulated copper wire for attachment to a
voltaic battery; the battery consisted of ten large Smee's cells.
A row of five Bunsen’s burners was placed beneath the middle
part of the bar for the purpose of heating it to redness; and the
 bar at that part was between notched plates of firebrick to      in
crease the heat. With the whole of the bar at 60°F. (= 15°.5 C.),
on connecting the thick coil with the battery a deflection of 14° or
 16° was obtained of the needles of the galvanometer; but with
 the middle of the bar at a red heat a deflection of only 4° could be
 obtained. In a similar experiment with a bar 2 feet (=61 cen
 tims.) long and # an inch (= 12.7 millims.) thick, the same bat
 tery, and more suitable coils of wire, a deflection of 20° or 22°
 was obtained with the middle of the bar red-hot, and a powerful
 swing of 90° with the whole of the bar cold, the needles striking
 strongly against the stops of the galvanometer. With the bar of
 iron entirely absent, no perceptible electrodynamic induction took
 place.   Similar but much less powerful results were obtained on
 substituting a permanent bar magnet for the battery and thick
 wire coil. A red heat, therefore, in the middle part of a wrought
iron bar largely diminishes, but does not entirely prevent the trans
mission   of magnetism along the bar.
    The number of molecular movements and magnetic changes
which occur in wrought iron by change of temperature at a mo
derate red heat are quite remarkable, and were gradually revealed
by the following experiments:–An iron bar 32 inches (=81-3
centims.) long and § of an inch (=9.5 millims.) thick, in a hori
zontal position and diagonal to the magnetic meridian, was sur
rounded at one end by a coil of thin insulated copper wire con
nected with a distant galvanometer.       On gradually heating the
middle part only of the bar to redness, when the temperature
acquired a low red heat a slight sudden deflection of the needles
occurred; and on gradually cooling the bar a similar slight and
 sudden deflection in an opposite direction took place, apparently
at the same temperature.      The directions of the induced current
during the heating agreed with what would be produced by a
decrease of magnetism, and during the cooling with an increase of
magnetism.      With a bar 2 feet (=61 centims.) long and # an
inch (= 12.7 millims.) thick, and the north pole of a small per
manent bar magnet lying in contact with one end of the bar, the

                Changes in Iron &c. at different Temperatures.                                   173
other end of the bar being enclosed within a coil 5 inches (= 12.7
centims.) long, containing 20 layers or 2674 turns of “No. 27”
 (=0.25 millim. thick) insulated copper wire, connected with the
galvanometer, a slight deflection only of the needles was pro
duced during the process of heating, and a quick motion of the
needles 3° in the opposite direction during the cooling.                  The
directions of movement agreed with the previous ones, and
showed that the bar suddenly increased in magnetic capacity
during cooling at a particular temperature of moderate red heat,
and apparently at the same temperature at which it undergoes
the anomalous diminution of cohesion and increase in length
already referred           to.
                           With the same bar and fine-wire coil, and
a  coil    53inches (= 13.3 centims.) long containing               layers         8              or
464 turns         “No. 16” (= 1.5 millim. thick) insulated copper

wire      on
          the opposite end connected with the battery                ten large     of
Smee's elements,           gradually applying the heat the following
                            on
effects took place:–When the bar became red-hot                  the middle,      in
a  small and    irregular    deflection             of
                                             the needles       1%.” occurred,of
and the needles then returned          steadily     zero, and to    other de       no
flection took place         the bar became somewhat hotter. The gas

                                                                    in                            a
minute the needles moved slowly                    the opposite direction,
                                                         1°   in
then stopped, and then went rapidly 184° further and quickly
back again, swinging nearly equally                       on
                                                   each side       zero, and       of
soon settled near that      point, and remained there      during   the whole
of  the remainder         the cooling process.

174      Mr. G. Gore                  on the Molecular Movements and Magnetic
at –26°F. (= —32°2 C.), composed of 4 pounds of ice and 6
pounds of crystallized chloride of calcium, an irregular deflection
of the needles, indicating another feeble molecular change and
increase of magnetism was observed; the general deflection, how
ever, obtained by this artificial cooling was in accordance with a
decrease of magnetism, contrary to that which resulted from cool
ing at higher temperatures: a repetition of this experiment gave
similar results. With a bar 3 feet (=91.4 centims.) long and
1 inch (=25.4 millims.) thick none of the electrical effects were
obtained by the heating process, owing to the heat of the gas
burners being not sufficiently powerful.
   These results show that on gradually heating a bar of wrought
iron, when it attains a moderate red heat a succession of distinct
                                            similar kind, take place

Cold water being now very freely applied to the black hot bar, a
similar deflection of 13° occurred; part of this last deflection
was probably due to the more rapid cooling.
   With a bar of cast iron 30 inches (= 76.2 centims.) long and
# of an inch (= 19 millims.) in diameter, and the same wire coils
and battery, the effects obtained were similar, but much more
feeble than with the bar of steel. At a feeble elevation of tem
 perature, below that at which a similar effect took place in the
 steel bar, a feeble sudden molecular movement and decrease of
 magnetism took place. At a red heat a second similar change
 occurred. Soon after this the gas was stopped and the bar
 allowed to cool; in about twenty seconds a molecular change
 commenced, feeble at first and then suddenly stronger, producing
a deflection of 6° and then ceasing, as with the steel bar.
    Various other small irregularities in these molecular changes
 in wrought iron, cast iron, and steel were observed, but are not
here recorded; and each different bar gave somewhat different
results. If the processes of heating and cooling were more rapid,
 all the changes would           more powerful.

the needles were rather suddenly deflected 23° with irregular
action at a particular temperature not even approaching that of
the lowest visible redness in the dark; and by heating to a much
higher temperature, but still below redness, faint signs of a
second similar molecular disturbance in the same direction were
manifested. The heat being now stopped and the bar allowed
to cool gradually, the same phenomena, and to the same extent,
took place, but in an exactly reverse order.              On repeating the
experiment with this bar, but cooling the bar rapidly by conti
nuous application of cold water, a sudden deflection of 8° oc

magnetic changes in bars of iron, steel, nickel, &c., especially if
a powerful battery and a delicate galvanometer are employed,
and might probably be used to throw a light upon the influence
which the presence of foreign substances have upon iron &c.
   The foregoing phenomena may be employed as an illustration
of a very general (I may say, universal) property of matter
which has not, that I am aware, been specially recognized as
such.   Every substance, even those of the simplest constitution
 (as the elementary bodies, and even those of them which are in
the gaseous state), when acted upon by a single external force, pos
sesses the power of dividing the influence of that force in such a
way that, instead of producing only one force or one effect, it
produces several; or, stated more briefly, matter has a universal
property of dividing and multiplying forces and effects.           For
instance, simply in heating a bar of iron to redness a whole

178        Prof. W. Gibbs on              the Measurement                    of Wave-lengths
successfully accomplished by Ångström"; but an attentive study
of his work, as well as of the elaborate researches of Van der
Willigent and Ditscheinert, will show that new measurements
will be far from superfluous. The imperfections even of the
best ruled glasses are so great that                         it may be reasonably doubted
whether the wave-lengths of very fine lines can be satisfactorily
measured directly.     Methods of determining such wave-lengths,
depending upon the comparison of the refraction- and diffrac
tion-spectra, have been given by myself Š and by Thalen||.     As
it seems at least desirable to multiply such methods,   will here                           I

indices which are at once sufficiently exact and sufficiently nu
merous. In addition they have the great advantage of having
been made with reference to lines in the solar spectrum the wave
lengths of which had been measured by the same observer.
There can therefore be no question of identity.            As a first ex
ample of the method,         I give a determination of the wave-length
of C, taking B as one of the lines exterior to C, and taking in
 succession seven other exterior lines more refrangible than C, to

     In  this Table the first column gives the designation or num
 ber of the line, the second its index of refraction as determined
 by a Steinheil prism of 60°, the third the corresponding wave
 length according to Van der Willigen, and the fourth the wave
 length as found by formula (2) by combining B with each line
 after C in succession.
     The mean of the seven values of the wave-length of C thus
 found is 656-70, which is in excess of Van der Willigen's own
  determination of the value of C by 0:14.          From this it appears
  that the method        may be  applied  with a tolerable degree of ap
  proximation, even in the case of a flint-glass prism of high dis
  persive power, and for indices of refraction which refer to lines
  at considerable angular distances from each other. The increase
  in the computed values of C as the intervals between B and the
  second line of comparison are increased, however, will clearly
  appear from the Table.        The following results were obtained with
  the indices of a second Steinheil prism, No. 2, of 46° 52'25".8,

  mine to what extent the method       applies  when  flint-glass   prisms
  are used and the indices are selected from the more refrangible
 portion of the spectrum, the following data were assumed:—

     In this Table line 37 is taken as the middle line in applying
 formula (2), and the results obtained by combining the other
 lines in pairs are given in columns 4, 5, and 6. It will be seen
 that, as in the case of the less refrangible portion of the spec
 trum, the results obtained are with this prism always too high.

 For the purpose of comparison, have computed the same wave
 length from the indices of refraction of the second prism.            The
 data and results are as follows:–                             -
    F     -   1.62332     486-39    F and G       439-07      -- 0:49

    G     .   1:63400     431'12   35 and 39      438-84      + 0.26
    In  the case of the first prism the mean of the errors is +0:21,
while for the second the mean of the errors is +0.35.                From
 this it appears   that in the more   refrangible  portion  of the spec
trum the errors are     considerably  greater  than in the less refran
 gible portion, even for equal differences of wave-length, and,
 further, that the advantage in precision is with the prism having
 the higher dispersive power.        As the probable errors of the
measurements of the indices of refraction are not given, it is
impossible to determine to what extent the errors in the com
puted wave-lengths are due solely to want of precision in the
indices. It is also to be remarked that, while with the second
prism the errors in the less refrangible portion of the spectrum
are affected with the sign     –,   in the more refrangible portion
they are largely positive. The close agreement in the value of
the wave-length of 37, as found by Van der Willigen, with the
values as found by Ditscheiner and Angström (438:27 and
438:28), proves that the source of error is not an erroneous de
termination of this quantity.      It seems, therefore, certain that
the   nearly constant errors noted above are due in part to the fact
that the indices of refraction are determined only to five places

                            by means      of    Indices       of Refraction.                            181
of decimals, and in part to the high dispersive powers of the
prisms employed,                which would render                   it   necessary       to employ
more than two terms in Cauchy’s formula to obtain a closer ap
proximation.   As the formulae for interpolation would in this
way be rendered extremely complicated, it is better, in the case
of any series of observations embracing a particular part of the
scale, simply to determine the mean of the errors, and to apply
this mean with               its
                    proper sign    the computed values   to  the                                   of

both of wave-lengths and of indices of refraction is difficult, on
account of the feeble intensity of the light.
    Since only the differences between the angular deviations of
the spectral lines are employed in the formulae above given, it
follows that, in determining wave-lengths by the method in ques
tion, it is not necessary to employ a spectrometer with a divided
circle and appliances for the measurement of large angles. A
common spectroscope will be sufficient if the observing-telescope
be provided with a filar micrometer, by means of which the an
gular distances of any given line from two other lines of which
the wave-lengths are known may be measured.        The researches
of Angström leave nothing to be desired as regards the wave
lengths of standard lines; and the method given may prove a
convenient means of determining with    requisite precision the       all
wave-lengths         of   metallic lines.

  This follows also from another consideration. The average
velocity of comets when at a great distance from any stars, with
respect to any one star, must be as great as their average velocity
with respect to any other star. As the average velocity of the
stars is probably greater than, or at least as great    the sun’s                                  as,

   This expression has been obtained on the assumption that at
the distance R there are as many comets with one velocity as
with another. Taking the average velocity of comets at a dis
tance R to be 1-6, this assumption may be taken as roughly true
for   all
        velocities between 1:6 and                           0,
                                          and for velocities not very
much greater than 1-6. We will assume that                  true for all               it      is

the sun.
    The truth will lie within the results of the calculation on these
three assumptions. We see, then, that a large percentage of
those comets which approach the sun in hyperbolic orbits will
have orbits with excentricities greater than 1-02.        Now out of
the large number of comets whose orbits have been carefully cal
culated not one has an excentricity greater than 1-02; and we
 are therefore led to the conclusion that though several known
comets are probably moving in hyperbolic orbits, yet by far
the greater number of those comets whose orbits are undistin
 guishable from parabolas are moving in elliptic orbits of very
 great length.

on purity of surface:– “If you wish to study the adhesion between
two bodies, it is of great importance that the surfaces of contact
be clean and free from every other substance, such as moisture,
grease, dust, &c.      Indeed if there be any extraneous substance
between two bodies, it will adhere to them with greater or less
energy, depending on the magnitude and continuity of the stra

somewhat uncertain and troublesome.           the level     the liquid

A still greater evil connected with this method is that one and
the same body has to contend in contact with different liquids;
and is it not possible that the results will vary by varying the
form and material of the solid that is set in motion on the liquid
or within it? The laws of capillary action would never have been
discovered if the phenomena had been studied only by means of
one narrow tube of one material; so it appeared to me that the
extensive class of phenomena           thus indicated by M. Plateau
could not be    properly   investigated   unless a diligent examination
were made as to the behaviour of solids of varied shape and ma
terial set in motion upon the surface of a liquid or below                                                          it.   I
held     it       impossible that the varying adhesion between
                   to       be
solids and liquids would not produce some variation              the effects                          in
now under consideration.

I found, however, from a large number of trials, that in the latter
case the mean of each pair of experiments gave results perfectly
agreeing with those first obtained, even when the index came to
rest 2° or 3° from the position of equilibrium.     I should notice,
however, that in my experiments the torsion of the thread was
never less than 10°, but more frequently it was 40°.       Knowing
how much torsion to give, abridges in many cases the time                                                 re

     Inow procured a number of needles and plates of various
forms and dimensions of brass, copper, iron, steel, glass, wood,

rhombs like a   magnetic  needle, some rectangular, some circular,
some in segments of circles, many in the form of a disk with
circular holes, or with radial openings, or with holes in the form
of sectors extending to the circumference, still leaving an annular
boundary.

view there seemed to be something anomalous in the two state

perficial resistance opposed by the liquids to the motion of solids
has a different origin from that of tension.              Plateau refers this
resistance to the viscosity of liquids.
    The increased resistance of the liquids operated on by me, in
consequence of a protracted exposure to the air, could only arise
from a more or less rapid alteration in them, either by the adhe
sive action of the air or by the deposition of acrial dust.                   So
trifling a circumstance disturbs the purity of a liquid, that it is

different from those actually obtained by him.   will cite a single            I
example in support of this.     One   day   had a plate of tinned    I
iron in contact with the surface of  water, and noticed that the
water became sensibly changed by the oxidation                 of the iron and
 other influences that                I
                                could not     explain.     Now this plate of
 tinned iron and a similar        plate  of brass experienced an equal re
 sistance on the surface of the water thus changed, while below
 the surface the resistance encountered by the brass was consider
 ably less than that encountered by the tinned plate.
    4. The resistance offered by the surface of liquids to solids
 may be distinguished into linear and superficial, while below the
 surface the resistance is superficial only. This distinction, though
 simple, is important.        The resistance which the body encounters
 when    its
           surface          contact with the liquid
                               is

  § X.         Influence     of the       dimensions and nature                        of the      reservoirs.
   This influence is ascertained by the comparison of experiments
in which for the reservoir B either the cylindrical zinc vessel,
containing 33:805 litres, or the glass globe of 60.617 litres was
taken and the gas in reservoir A compressed under a constant
pressure pl. Thus we had in both cases the same mass of gas
expanding from the same pressure p, to the same final pressure                                                           p'.

    The same result is obtained by comparing Series IV. and I.
 (air). The coordinates of the minimum are h--35 millims.
 (sulphuric acid) in Series IV. (glass), and       136 millims.                     h- –
(sulphuric acid) in Series I. (zinc). Moreover the abscissa of
the point ha-0 is greater, and the curve does not rise so far
above the abscissae in Series IV. as in the other.
   The experiment shows thus that the cause of the depression
is intimately connected with the quantity of gas which the jet
encounters during the expansion. We must attribute this depres
sion to a mechanical or thermic effect counteracted by the gas
contained in reservoir B. Let us examine how this can take
place.
   By distinguishing three parts in the gas in motion as we have
done before, we see, first, that the quantity of gas left in reservoir
A is the same in each pair of experiments, since the expansion
commences at the same pressure pi and finishes at the same
pressure       p'.
               The quantity                         of
                                  gas which passes into reservoir                                                      B
is also the same, since the reservoir       always contains the gas
                                                                 A

than ps; hence it may happen that the quantity of heat created
in this part during the expansion increases with the volume
of reservoir B. We may prove that it is so by the following
reasoning.
   The gas of the second part absorbed the work of expansion
of the first part, and transmitted to the third a less quantity of
work, which served for the compression; the velocities acquired
by the molecules of this second part correspond to the difference.
In each pair of experiments the work absorbed remains the same,
but the velocities change; when they diminish, the work trans
mitted increases, and with it the quantity of heat which it causes
to appear.
   The creation of this heat is evidently opposed to the depres
sion, and the greater it is the smaller the depression; this is
what occurred in our experiments.

the exchanges of motion and heat will be accomplished in a space
which receives heat at the same time, and the temperature will
end by being higher than the initial temperature.                   From this
moment the gaseous mass will slowly return to the exterior tem
perature, losing exactly the heat which it had gained.                     It is
sufficient for this effect to be possible that the heat should spread
more rapidly in the gas than in the sides.                 Since such is the
effect observed, we are able to say from experiment that the heat
given up by the sides in A exceeds the heat withdrawn in B.
    Let us now examine what results from a modification of the
reservoir B.
   The reservoir A being the same, the heat given up to the gas
which is there does not change; but things are different in re
servoir B.       The gas which at first filled it under the pressure ps
has been       compressed,      supporting an exterior pressure nearly
equal to        its
                 elastic   force, and     has passed from the pressure

reservoirs of the same form and size; but the foregoing is suffi
cient to prove the small importance of this research, and I have
not considered it necessary to undertake                                                          it.

 206            M. Achille Cazin                  on Internal Work in Gases.
     The maximum depression is about one-third of that in Series
 IV.,  and the curves rise considerably above the axis of the ab
 scissae.  We must remark that the curves of this latter series
 affect the form a'b'b"c' (fig. 1), although the water-manometer
 communicated    with the tubulure H of the rarefied reservoir.
 This denotes friction in the tube which joined the two reservoirs.
 Without this disturbing influence the depression would have
 been greater in Series XII.      In mentioning these experiments
 (which were made at the outset of this research) I wished to con
 vey some notion of the difficulties which present themselves in
 researches of this kind, and of the progressive course which has
 led me to adopt the present apparatus, the results of which pre
 sent no uncertainty.
                     §   XII.       Influence      of the    nature     of the gas.
     We are now going to compare with one another Series I. (air),
IX.   (carbonic acid), and VIII. (hydrogen).   All these series
were made with the     apparatus ultimately adopted, and under
the same circumstances.     Their curves are traced in figs. 4,
7, 6.   The curves XX present considerable differences, which
we   will examine.
   Let us consider the gases in the following order—hydrogen,
air, and carbonic acid.   We see from figs. 6, 4, and 7 that the
maximum of h is nearly the same       the three gases; but  for                                   it
                                                                                                  is

     If these
            effects be compared with what is known of the velocity
of the efflux of these gases, it will be found that the grºater the
velocity the smaller the abscissa of; hence the idea of a rela
tion of cause and effect between this velocity and the depression
observed in my experiments.       We have thus a confirmation of
the opinion advanced in Sections X. and XI. The depression
is due to the velocities acquired during the expansion.     If it is
due to this cause  alone,   it must disappear simultaneously   with
the velocities; and the prompter the extinction of these velocities,
the closer the point h will be to the origin of coordinates, o.
    The mobility of hydrogen is certainly greater than that of
carbonic acid.   The molecules of hydrogen are to those of car
bonic acid as a very elastic ball is to one which is but slightly
 so.  Consequently the agitation, the whirlings, which gradually
destroy the motion              in

                                        must continue longer with
hydrogen than with other gases.       On the other hand, the velo
cities acquired     the moment when the expansion ceases are
                          at
greater for the former gas.    This tends     increase the duration  to

curve    XX above the axis of the abscissae present. They may be
due to several causes—such as the difference of temperature ac
quired during the expansion by the various parts of the gaseous
mass, the difference of the specific heats, that of the conducti
bility, and, finally, that of the emissive and absorbent powers.
   Let us first compare hydrogen and air.           Both must un
dergo almost the same thermometric effects; for we have ap
proximately, for the gas expanded in A and the gas compressed
in B, the usual formula

    Besides, these two gases have the same specific heat for a con
stant volume, and also the same emissive or absorbing-power;
but they have not the same conductivity. That of hydrogen
is the greatest.     Hence the less the conductivity the higher the
curve     XX  rises. What can be the effect of conductivity?         The
 variations of   temperature   due to the action of the sides will be
more rapid for hydrogen than for air. If the temperature of the
total mass is greater than the temperature of the sides when the
mixture is effected, it will descend more rapidly; hence the
maximum of h must be less for hydrogen, and the curve must
reach the axis of the abscissae more quickly.
    Let us now compare air and carbonic acid. The thermome
tric effects are less for the latter, and the specific heat is greater;
 it is the same with regard to           emissiveits    absorbing-power.or

 thereabouts. Hence the difference is still more marked than in
 the preceding series. We also see from the Table of Series II.
 that the initial depression is greater for hydrogen—which con
 firms a conclusion already given, because for this gas the velocities
 of efflux are greatest.   It is certainly convenient to make reser
 voir B of greater capacity than the zinc reservoir; but the neces
 sity of keeping up a current of water around it makes me prefer-
 the latter in final experiments.
       §   XIII.      Summary and conclusions of the eaperiments.
     All the observations above given may be summed up in the                -
  following statement:—
     When a reservoir containing compressed gas is placed in com
 munication, by a large orifice, with a reservoir containing the
  same gas rarefied, equality of pressure establishes itself very
 quickly in the two reservoirs (0:1 second). When equality of
 pressure commences, the velocities acquired have not completely
 disappeared.       At this instant there is a mechanical work pro
 duced in the first reservoir and a certain quantity of heat has
 disappeared.       There          is,
                                     the contrary, mechanical work ex
                                         on
 pended    in  compression and heat created           the second reservoir;
                                                                 in
 but a   part  only     of
                         the vires viva   produced    during   the efflux has
 been transformed into heat. Whilst the velocities acquired con
 tinue   to disappear        creating more heat, the pressure increases.
                             in
 When      allagitation    has ceased, the heat which has disappeared
 from the   gas    ofthe first reservoir remains greater than that which
 has been created       bythe gas         of
                                      the second reservoir.          the sides   If

                                                      less than the initial.

one  side, and wish  only to discuss some differences between the
results of Dr. Sondhauss and my own, regarded from an experi
mental point of view.     The rational formula corresponding to
(VII.) is

  The rational formula (C) was first given by Helmholtz in his
admirable paper in Crelle, on Vibrations in open Pipes; it is
only strictly applicable to openings of circular form. The dif
ference between (A) and (VII.) is never very great, being on one
side when L is small, and on the other when L is large, and ac
cordingly vanishing for some intermediate value.        The greatest
difference is shown in (VIII.) and (B) when L is very large.                                                             I
therefore consider Dr. Sondhauss's opinion and anticipation to
be in the main justified by my investigation, when he says,                                                             “I
remark that          I
                 regard the formula (VII.) . . . . not merely as an
empirical formula useful for interpolation, but am convinced
that it forms the theoretical expression of a natural law.      From
the zeal with which the field of mathematical     physics is now cul
tivated, we may expect that the laws which I have discovered
experimentally will soon be proved by analysis.”          But   must                                              I
observe that (A) is only true subject to a series of limitations,
which Dr. Sondhauss seems scarcely, if at all, to have contem
plated. All the dimensions of the vessel (with a partial excep
tion of the length of the neck) must be small compared with the
 quarter wave-length, and the diameter of the neck must be
 small against the linear dimension of the body of the vessel.
 The latter condition excludes the case of S small or nothing, to
 which Dr. Sondhauss pushes the application of his formula.
 But there is a rational formula proper for closed cylindrical tubes,
 as has been proved by Helmholtz in his paper on open pipes, to
 which Dr. Sondhauss refers, but apparently without availing
                                  “T)

     Dr. Sondhauss   expresses himself strongly as to the difficulty
which exists in   determining    accurately the pitch of the very un
certain sound produced by tubes whose diameter is not small
compared with their length, an opinion which entirely share. It                                     I
is indeed difficult to understand how Wertheim obtained results
of such precision. But            cannot agree with Dr. SondhaussI
when he goes on to say that resonance is not a sure guide in de
termining accurately the pitch of a pipe; for it was by this me
thod exclusively that the determinations recorded in my paper
were made.                          I

represented by (VII.) than by (A); but it must be remembered
that (VII.) contains an arbitrary constant, c, which acts nearly as

feared in the measurement of pitch or of the dimensions of the

between the formulae, if proper attention is given to the choice

   I    understand Mr. Rankine’s first proposition                be, that     the                 to                  if

no motion   whatever, although  it is a force exercised by a moving
body; but it has neutralized the resistance; so that they might
both of them be at once entirely struck out of the equations of
solution, and the problem so converted into a more simple one
of the condensation of a gas possessing no elasticity by the action
of the force                       (P-p)lo.

   The corrections which this solution supplies to the twoproposi
tions of Mr. Rankine respectively are, that, in the first, it admits
the generation of heat by the force                                       (P– pi)do,            which     Mr. Ran
kine denies; and in the second it denies the generation of heat
by the

                                     pdv, which           Mr. Rankine             asserts.       I believe       my      so
lution to be right in both instances; but it is upon the latter
point that I anticipate there will be the greatest difficulty of
agreement                   between             us, as the appeal is tacitly to a proposition
which       I
           think Mr.                             Rankine will at first sight consider inad
missible.
   In speaking of a gas whose elasticity results from the motion
of    its
       particles, Mr. Rankine says, “work done                   diminishing                     in

THE“On   Supersaturated Saline Solutions.”—Part II.                                                   By Charles
Tomlinson, F.R.S.
   The object of this paper is to develope more fully the principles
attempted to be established in Part I.", not only by clearer defini
tions of terms, but also by new facts and conclusions.      The paper
is divided into two sections; in the first of which are stated the con
ditions under which nuclei act in separating salt or gas or vapour
from their supersaturated solutions, while in the second section is
shown the action of low temperatures on supersaturated saline solu
tions.
   The first section opens with definitions of the terms used.
  A   nucleus is a body that has a stronger attraction for the gas or
vapour or salt of a solution than for the liquid that holds it in solution.
   A body is chemically clean the surface of which is entirely free
from any substance foreign to                    its
                                      own composition.      Oils and other
liquids are chemically clean       chemically pure, and contain
                                            if                         sub                                 no

                     or               foreign     their composition.

The broken petioles show a single crescentic vascular bundle. The
section of the true stem shows a white parenchymatous medulla, a
narrow vascular cylinder interrupted by long slender meshes from
which the vascular bundles of the petioles spring, and a parenchy
matous cortical layer.      The author described the arrangement of
these  parts in  detail, and indicated their agreement with the same
parts in Osmunda    regalis.   He did not venture to refer the Fern, to
which this stem had      belonged,  positively to the genus Osmunda,
but preferred describing it as an Osmundites, under the name of
 O. Dowkeri.    The specimen was silicified; and the author stated that
even the starch-grains contained in its cells, and the mycelium of a
parasitic Fungus traversing some of them, were perfectly represented.
Its precise origin was unknown; it was said to be probably derived
from the London Clay, or from the beds immediately below.

Esq., F.G.S.
   The author stated that his ultimate purpose was to describe seve
rally the Oolitic beds occurring in the Northampton district, in the
more northerly parts of the county, and in the neighbourhood of
Stamford, to exhibit fossils gathered from each locality, and to
correlate the several series and thus to endeavour to establish the
character and sequence of the Oolites of this Midland district.   He
anticipated, however, that the publication by the Geological Survey
of their maps and memoir of North Northamptonshire (the work of
Mr. Judd) would intervene and might render superfluous the carry
ing out this work in                its
                          entirety; but   the meantime         in

 these several areas were described      detail, the beds in the North                     of
 ampton Sand (as comparatively little known) being those          which
 the greatest interest attached.  These he proposes       class   three               to        in to

  proved that the polarization was not completely destroyed by this
  means.      But it may be hoped that it can be completely annulled by
  diminishing the duration of the alternate currents, which diminishes
  the perturbing electrolytic effect—and by increasing the size of the
  electrodes, which diminishes the intensity of the currents, and con
  sequently the polarization, which is nearly proportional to                                                         it.   It

of wood leaving after combustion only a charred spot. When not in
use, the prisms should be kept in an iron pot with a tight cover.          In
this manner I have        employed     and preserved two during   a  long and
hot summer. The viscid or, rather oily nature of the solution serves
to prevent, to a great extent, the formation of ascending and
descending currents from slight changes of temperature; and when
the prisms are well shaken before use, the definition remains perfect
for a long time. In my spectroscope the prisms rest upon a plate of

               ON THE PROPAGATION OF SOUND            IN TUBES.
                             BY M. A.D. SEEBECK.
     It is admitted that the velocity of sound propagated in a tube is
 less than in the open air, and the smaller the tube the less the velo
 city". Kirchhoff has given the following formula for the velocity of
 sound:—
                               v=A(1–
                                               K_
                                            2r Wºr/"
 in which    A is the velocity in air, r the radius of the tube, n the num
 ber of vibrations, K a constant dependent on the calorific conduc
 tivity and on friction. This formula is the same as the one given
 by Helmholtz, except the meaning of the constant K.
     The method employed by Seebeck does not differ materially from
  that which Schneebeli adopted in order to verify Helmholtz's for
  mula, and of which he has already given an accountt.
    The apparatus used was constructed of a horizontal tube, closed near
  one end by a moveable piston; near the other a very narrow lateral
  tube was soldered, to which a caoutchouc tube was fitted which com
  municated with the ear. A sound was produced in front of the open
  ing of the tube by means of a tuning-fork fixed horizontally to a piece
  of wood insulated by some caoutchouc supports. That the ear may
  hear distinctly the sound produced by the tuning-fork, at the junc
  tion of the large tube closed by the piston and the small tube com
  municating with the ear there must be a node, due to the coexist
  ence of direct and reflected waves against the piston.          If  a loop is
  produced, the sound perceived by the ear will have its minimum in
   tensity; it is this character which is to be appreciated; and it is then
   known whether the distance from the piston to the opening of the
   small tube is equal to           or in general to             A being
                                }                    (2n+1)}                the
   wave-length of the sound produced; from this we get the velocity
   of sound by the formula VanA, n being the number of vibrations of
   the corresponding sound.          The whole section of the tube was agi
   tated, which Kirchhoff's formula presupposes, except for the largest

 tubes used.    The observations were reduced to zero by means of the
 formula   X,- -*—, by         observing at the commencement and the
                WI-F at
end of each series of observations a thermometer placed close at
 hand : the air in the tube was first dried by chloride of calcium.
 Seebeck used König's four tuning-forks, which give the notes ut,
sol, mi, ut, of which the numbers of vibrations were 512, 384, 320,
256.      He found the following results:—

    The velocity of the sound diminishes with the diameter of the tube,
except for the largest (2r= 29 millims.), which Seebeck attributes
to the whole of the section not having been agitated; it may also
be that in the large tubes the motion of the gaseous molecules is not
parallel to their axis.     By adopting for the velocity of sound in air
a the number 332.77 millims., a result obtained from the determina
tions by Moll and Van Beek, Seebeck has calculated the difference
A—V. According to the formula by Kirchhoff, we must have

an equation which the determinations of Seebeck satisfy, except for
the largest tube (2r=29 millims.).           But it was also found that
(A–V)      Vn, for the same value of r, is no longer constant. Seebeck
recognized, on the contrary, that the product (A–V)n} was ob
viously constant; and consequently the diminution of velocity of
sound in a tube varies in inverse ratio with the power # of the num
ber of vibrations of the corresponding sound.
    Seebeck also made some investigations when the interior of his
tubes was covered with leather or flannel : he proved that there was
a considerable diminution in the velocity of sound; in the latter case
it fell to 281.7 millims. These experiments, however, leave some
thing to be desired, because the interior of the tube was not com
pletely covered. A small slit was made that the position of the
piston might be observed: would it not be possible to determine the
position of the piston exactly by means of the rod by which it is re
gulated?—Poggendorff's. Annalen, vol. cxxxix. p. 104; Annales de

       is no        point connected with ocean-currents on which
THERE
    more diversity        of opinion has existed than in regard to
their origin. At present, however, there may be said to be only
two theories held on the subject, viz. that which attributes
the currents to the influence of the trade and other winds, and
that which attributes them to differences in specific gravity be
tween the waters of intertropical and polar regions.          The latter
theory appears at present to be the more prevalent of the two,
although, perhaps, not so among scientific men.            It is difficult
to conceive how a theory so manifestly erroneous should have
gained such general acceptance.          Its popularity is no doubt
chiefly owing to the very great prominence given to it by Lieut.
Maury in his interesting and popular work “The Physical Geo
graphy of the Sea.” Another cause which must have favoured
the reception of this theory is the ease with which it is per
ceived how, according to                    it,

234             Mr.     J.   Croll       on the      Physical Cause              of Ocean-currents.
             examine this theory at some length, for two reasons:
      We shall
1, because it lies at the root of a great deal of the confusion
and misconception which have prevailed in regard to the whole
 subject of ocean-currents; 2, because, if the theory is correct,
 it militates strongly against the physical theory of secular
 changes of climate advanced in the preceding part of this paper.
 We have already seen that when the excentricity of the earth’s
 orbit reaches a high value, a combination of physical circum
  stances tends to lower the temperature of the hemisphere which
 has      its
           winter solstice       aphelion, and
                                             in         raise the temperature
                                                                          to

 other words, the warm and equable condition                      the one hemi          of

    specific gravity between the waters at the equator and the poles,
    I shall now proceed to consider at some length his views on the
    subject, the more especially as we find in his work on the phy
    sical geography of the sea almost every argument that can be
    advanced   in favour of the theory which he advocates.
        Although considerable diversity of opinion has prevailed in
    regard to the cause of ocean-currents, yet it is remarkable how
    little is to be found of a purely, scientific character bearing
    directly on the dynamics of the subject.
        Another reason which has induced me to select Maury’s work
    is,   that not only contains
                 it                   much fuller discussiona       the                                          on

                              it     is   discover what they really       to

from difference of    specific  gravity  can be ultimately resolved into

        Mr.   J.   Croll on the Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.               237
       “Itis not necessary,” he says, “to associate with oceanic
 currents the idea that they must of necessity, as on land, run
from a higher to a lower level.      So far from this being the case,
some currents of the sea      actually run up hill, while others run
on a level. The Gulf-stream is of the first class” ($403). “The
top of the Gulf-stream runs on a level with the ocean; therefore
we know it is not a descending current’’ (§ 18).      And in § 9 he
says that between the Straits of Florida and Cape Hatteras
the waters of the Gulf-stream “are actually forced up an inclined
plane, whose submarine ascent is not less than 10 inches to the
mile.” To the same effect see §§ 25, 59.
    It is perfectly true that “it is not necessary to associate with
ocean-currents the idea that they must of necessity, as on land,
run from a higher to a lower level.”       But the reason of this is
that ocean-currents do not, like the currents on land, owe their
motion to the force of gravitation.              If
                                          ocean-currents result from
difference of   specific gravity between the waters in tropical and
polar regions, as Maury maintains, then it is necessary to assume
that they are descending currents. Whatever be the cause which
may give rise to a difference of specific gravity, the motion which
results from this difference is due wholly to the force of gravity;
but gravity can produce no motion unless the water descend.
    This fact must be particularly borne in mind while we are con
sidering Maury’s theory that currents are the result of differ
ence of specific gravity.
    Ocean-currents, then, according to Maury, owe their existence
to the difference of specific gravity between the waters of inter
tropical and polar regions. This difference of specific gravity he
attributes to two causes—(1) to difference as to temperature, (2)
to difference as to saltness.    There are one or two causes of a
minor nature affecting the specific gravity of the sea, to which
Maury alludes; but these two determine the general result. Let
us begin with the consideration of the first of these two causes,
WIZ.   :—
  Difference of specific gravity resulting from difference of tempe
rature.—Maury explains his views on this point by means of an
illustration.   “Let us now suppose,” he says, “that               all

regions, and returning as before” ($20). “Now,” he says ($22),
“do not the cold waters of the north, and the warm waters of
the Gulf, made specifically lighter by tropical heat, and which we
see actually preserving such a system of countercurrents, hold, at
least  in some degree, the relation of the supposed water and oil?”
    In § 24 he calculates that at the Narrows of Bemini the
difference in weight between the volume of the Gulf-water
that crosses a section of the stream in one second, and an equal
volume of water at the ocean temperature of the latitude, sup
posing the two volumes to be equally salt, is fifteen millions of
pounds. Consequently the force per second operating to pro
pel the waters of the Gulf towards the pole would in this case,
 he concludes, be the “equilibrating tendency due to fifteen mil
lions of pounds of water in the latitude of Bemini.”    In §§ 511
 and 512 he states that the effect of   expanding   the waters at
 the torrid zone by heat, and of contracting the waters at the
 frigid zone by cold, is to produce a set of surface-currents of
 warm and light water from the equator towards the poles, and
 another set of undercurrents of cooler and heavy water from the
 poles towards the equator.    See also to the same effect $$ 513,
 514, 896.
    There can be no doubt that Maury concludes that the waters
in intertropical regions are expanded by heat, and those in polar
regions are contracted by cold, and that this tends to produce a
 surface-current from the equator to the poles, and an undercur
rent from the poles to the equator.
    We shall now consider his second great cause of ocean-cur
rents, viz.:-
     Difference    of specific gravity
                                resulting from difference in degree
of saltness.-Maury maintains, and that correctly, that saltness
increases the density of water—that, other things being equal, the
saltest water is the densest. He suggests “that one of the pur
poses which, in the grand design, it was probably intended to
accomplish by having the sea salt and not fresh, was to impart to
its waters the forces and powers necessary      make their circu

      very considerable portion of Maury’s book, however, is
      A
devoted to proving that the waters of equatorial and intertropical
regions are salter and heavier than those of the polar regions;
and yet, notwithstanding this, he endeavours to show that this
difference in respect to saltness between the waters of the equato
rial and the polar regions is one of the chief causes, if not the chief
cause, of ocean-currents.     In fact, it is for this special end that
so much labour is bestowed    in proving that the saltest water is
in the equatorial and intertropical  regions, and the freshest in
the polar.
   “In the present state of our knowledge,” he says, “ concern
ing this wonderful phenomenon      (for the Gulf-stream is one of the
most marvellous things in the ocean) we can do little more than
conjecture. But we have two causes in operation which we may
safely assume are among those concerned in producing the Gulf
stream.     One of these is the increased saltness of its water after

at the same time be both lighter and heavier than the water at
the poles.      They may be either the one or the other, but they
cannot be both. Let it be observed that it is not two currents,
the one contrary to the other, with which we have at present to
do; it is not temperature producing currents in one direction,
and saltness producing currents in the contrary direction.
We have two theories regarding the origin of currents, the
one diametrically opposed to the other. The tendency of the
one cause assigned is to prevent the action of the other cause.
If   temperature is allowed to act, it will make the intertropical
waters lighter than the polar, and then, according to theory, a
.
current will result.        But if we bring saltness into play (the
other cause) it will do the reverse: it will increase the den
       of the intertropical waters and diminish the density of the
 polar; and so far as it acts it will diminish the currents pro
 duced by temperature, because it will diminish the difference of
 specific gravity between the intertropical and polar regions
 which had been previously caused by temperature. And when
 the effects of saltness are as powerful as those of temperature, the
 difference of specific gravity produced by temperature will be
 completely effaced, or, in other words, the waters of the equato
 rial and polar seas will be of the same density, and consequently
 no current will exist. And so long as the two causes continue
 in action, no current can arise, unless the energy of the one
 cause should happen to exceed that of the other; and even then
 a current will only exist to the extent by which the strength of
 the one exceeds that of the other.
     The contrary nature of the two theories will be better seen by
 considering the way in which he supposes difference in saltness
 is produced and acts as a cause.
      Ifthere is a constant current resulting from the difference in
  saltness between the equatorial and polar waters, then there
  must be a cause which maintains this difference in saltness. The
  current is simply the effort to restore the equilibrium lost by this
  difference; and the current would very soon do this, and then                          all
  motion would cease, were there not          constantly operating cause
                                                  a
  maintaining this disturbance.       What,   then, according     Maury,       to
is   the cause      this disturbance, or,
                      of                        other words, what
                                                      in                            is   it

  evaporation and precipitation.
      The trade-winds enter the equatorial regions         relatively dry
                                                                    as
  winds thirsting for vapour; consequently they absorb far more

moisture than they give out; and the result is that, in intertro
pical regions, evaporation is much in excess of precipitation; and
as fresh water only is taken up, the salt being left behind, the
process, of course, tends to increase the saltness of the inter
tropical seas.     Again, in polar and extratropical regions the re
verse is the  case;   precipitation is in excess of evaporation. This
tends in turn to diminish the saltness of the waters of those
regions. See on these points $$ 31, 33, 34, 37, 179, 517, 526,
and 552.
    In the system of circulation produced by difference of tempe
rature, as we have already seen, the surface-currents flow from
the equator to the poles, and the under or return currents from
the poles to the equator; but in the system produced by differ
ence of saltness, the surface-currents flow from the poles to the
 equator, and the return undercurrents from the equator to the
poles. That the surface-currents produced by difference of salt
 mess flow from the poles to the equator, Maury thinks is evident
 for the two following reasons:—
     (1) As evaporation is in excess of precipitation in intertropical
 regions, more water is taken off the surface of the ocean in those
 regions, than falls upon it in the form of rain. This excess of
 water falls in the form of rain on temperate and polar regions,
 where, consequently, precipitation is in excess of evaporation.
 The lifting of the water off the equatorial regions and            deposit             its
 on    the polar  tend      to
                           lower the level      the ocean  of   equatorial         in
 regions and       raise the level
                   to                 polar; consequently,
                                             in                    order            in             to

                           the  ocean, the surface-water         the polar         at
 regions flows towards the equatorial regions.
      (2) As the water taken                 in up
                                         the equator at    fresh, and the  is

      is                             intertropical regions, thus made              is
  salter and   consequently    denser.   This dense water, therefore,
 sinks and passes away                 an
                                 undercurrent. This water, evaporated
                                  as
 from intertropical regions, falls          fresh and lighter water
                                                                                                   in of in

 the occan raised, but the waters are made lighter.             Hence,

gravity of this upper layer, therefore, is diminished just as much
as the specific gravity of the sea-water in the evaporating regions
was increased. And thus we have a surface-current of saltish water
from the poles towards the equator, and an undercurrent of water
salter and heavier from the equator to the poles” (§ 522).
    “This property of saltness imparts to the waters of the ocean
 another peculiarity, by which the sea is still better adapted for the
 regulation of climates, and it is this: by evaporating fresh water
 from the salt in the tropics, the surface-water becomes heavier
 than the average of sea-water.      This heavy water is also warm
 water; it sinks, and being a good retainer, but a bad conductor
 of heat, this water is employed in transporting through under
 currents heat for the mitigation of climates in far distant
regions” (§ 526).

causes                 7
   The only explanation of the matter appears to be that Maury
has failed to perceive the contradictory nature of his two theories.
This fact is particularly seen when he comes to apply his two
theories to the case of the Gulf-stream.      He maintains, as has
already been stated, that the waters of the Gulf-stream are
salter than the waters of the sea through which they flow (see
§§ 3, 28, 29, 30, 34, and several other places). And he states
that one of the chief causes of the Gulf-stream is this, that “we
have on one side the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, with
their waters of brine; on the other the great Polar Basin, the
Baltic, and the North Sea, the two latter with waters that are
but little more than brackish.      In one set of these sea-basins
the water is heavy, in the other it is light. Between them the
ocean intervenes; but water is bound to seek and to maintain
   its
    level; and here, therefore, we unmask one     the agents                                         of

attributes so much, can in no way be regarded as a cause of
motion.     Its effect, so far as it goes, is to stop the motion of
the stream rather than to assist it.
   But, again, although Maury maintains that difference of salt
ness and difference of temperature are both causes of ocean
currents, yet he appears actually to admit that temperature and
saltness neutralize each other so as to prevent change in the
specific gravity of the ocean, as will be seen from the following
 quotation        :-
      “Itis the trade-winds, then, which prevent the thermal and
specific-gravity curves from conforming with each other in
intertropical seas. The water they suck up is fresh water; and
the salt it contained, being left behind, is just sufficient to coun

ocean-currents being the result of difference of specific gravity
caused by a difference of temperature and difference of saltness?
Here is a distinct recognition of the fact that difference in salt
ness, instead of producing currents, tends rather to prevent the
existence of currents, by counteracting the effects of difference
in temperature.          And so effectually does it do this, that for 40°,
or nearly 3000 miles, on each side of the equator there is abso
lutely no difference in the specific gravity of the ocean, and
consequently nothing, either as regards difference of tempera
ture or difference of saltness, that can possibly give rise to a
current.
    But it is evident that, if between the equator and latitude
40° the two effects completely neutralize each other, it is not at
to all
     likely that between latitude 40° and the poles they will not

trade-winds to evaporate and to counteract the dynamical force
of the sun, this hot and light water, by becoming hotter and
lighter, would flow off in currents with almost mill-tail ve
locity towards the poles, covering the intervening sea with a
mantle of warmth as a garment. The cool and heavy water of
the polar basin, coming out as undercurrents, would flow equa-
torially with equal velocity.”
    “Thus two antagonistic forces are unmasked, and, being un
H.T.
masked, we discover in them a most exquisite adjustment—a com
                 which the dynamical forces that reside in the sun
  eam and the trade-wind are made to counterbalance each other,
by which the climates of intertropical seas are regulated, and by
 which the set, force, and volume of oceanic currents are mea
 sured ” (§§ 437 and 438, eleventh edition).
    The force resulting from difference of specific gravity not suffi
cient to produce motion.—I shall now consider whether the forces
to which Maury appeals have the potency that he attributes to
them. Is the force derived from the difference of specific gravity
between the waters of the ocean in intertropical and polar
 regions sufficient to account for the motion of ocean-currents?
    The utter inadequacy of this cause has been so clearly shown
 by Sir John Herschel, that one might expect that little else
would be required than simply to quote his words on the sub
ject, which are as follows:—
    “First, then, if there were no atmosphere, there would be no
 Gulf-stream, or any other considerable ocean-current (as distin
 guished from a mere surface-drift) whatever.       By the action of
the sun’s rays, the surface of the ocean becomes most heated, and
the heated water will, therefore, neither directly tend to ascend
 (which it could not do without leaving the sea) nor to descend,
which it cannot do, being rendered buoyant, nor to move late
rally, no lateral impulse being given, and which it could only
do by reason of a general declivity of surface, the dilated por
tion occupying a higher level.        Let us see what this declivity
would amount          to.

is less than one two-millionth part of gravity, we may dismiss this
as a cause capable of creating only a very trifling surface-drift,
and not worth considering, even were it in the proper direction
to form, by concentration, a current from east to west, which it
would not be, but the very reverse.”—Physical Geography, ar

    It is singular how any one, even though he regarded this
conclusion as but a rough approximation to the truth, could
entertain the idea that ocean-currents can be the result of dif
ference in specific gravity.     There are, however, one or two
reasons which may be assigned why the above has not been
generally received as conclusive. These calculations refer to
the difference of gravity resulting from difference of tempera
ture; but this is only one of the causes to which Maury ap
peals, and even not the one to which he most frequently alludes.
Maury insists so strongly on the effects of difference of saltness,
that many would no doubt suppose that, although Herschel may
have shown that difference in specific gravity arising from dif
ference of temperature could not account for the motion of
ocean-currents, yet nevertheless         this, combined with the
effects resulting from difference in saltness, might account for
their motion. This, of course, would not be the case with those
 who perceived the contradictory nature of Maury’s two causes ;
 but most people probably read the “Physical Geography of the
 Sea’ without being aware that the one cause is destructive of
                                                 is,
 the other. Another reason               few very plausible-looking

                                                  Maury and others
 against the theory that occan-currents can            caused      thebe         by
 impulses    ofthe trade-winds, which have not been duly con
sidered; and probably these objections appear           many      for  to        as
midable against this theory           Herschel's arguments appear
                                                 as

as   we shall see, does not materially affect his conclusions.

  ocean at the equator decreases at a uniform rate from the sur
  face downwards, which is far from being the case. The rate of
  decrease is most rapid at the surface, and decreases as we de
  scend.   The principal part of the decrease of temperature takes
  place within no very great depth from the surface; consequently
  the greater part of the excess of temperature at the equator
  over that at the poles affects the sea to no great depth.           But
  there is another reason     why   the  expansion  of the waters at the
  equator cannot amount to near 18 feet.          It is this: the rate at
  which water expands as           temperature rises  its    not uniform,                           is
  but increases with the     temperature.      Sea-water,    according                                                        to

form and direction of the great system of oceanic circulation,
but also the way that the circulation is caused by heat.                     It is
no doubt true that if we               apply   heat   (say   that of a     spirit
lamp) to the bottom of a vessel filled with water, the water at
the bottom of the vessel will become heated and rise to the
surface; and if the heat be continued an ascending current of
warm water will be generated; and this, of course, will give
rise to a compensating under current of colder water from                                                                    all

ture of the water at the equator is about as low as that of the
poles. We must therefore suppose the water at the centre of
our pool to diminish in temperature from the surface down
wards, so that at a depth of half an inch the water is at 32°.
We have in this case a thin layer of warm water half an inch
thick at the centre, and gradually thinning off to nothing at
the edge of the pool. The lightest water, be it observed, is at
the surface, so that an ascending or a descending current is
impossible.       The only way whereby the heat applied can have
any tendency to produce motion is this:–The heating of the
water expands                    it,
                         consequently the surface          the pool must            of
stand
             at
             alittle higher level         centre than at   its  edge, where            at   its
 no   expansion takes place; and therefore,               order       restore  in                     to
the level        the pool, the water

improbable, that the compensating current flowing from the
Atlantic into the southern hemisphere is as cold as the Ant
arctic current.       But Dr. Carpenter admits that the quantity of
warm water flowing from the Atlantic in equatorial regions to
wards the south is even greater than towards the north.               “The
unrestricted communication,” he says, “which exists between
the Antarctic area and the great Southern Ocean-basins would
involve, if the doctrine of a general oceanic circulation be ad
mitted, a much more considerable interchange of waters between
the Antarctic and the Equatorial areas than is possible in the
northern hemisphere” +. And as a proof that this is actually
the case, he adduces the fact known to navigators that in the
Southern Ocean there is a perceptible “set” of warm surface
water towards the Antarctic Pole.

                           the history of the ideas connected with
                  (base), and salt was concisely stated, and it was
shown that while, on the one hand, those ideas are erroneous and
self-contradictory when they designate something particular, so,
on the other hand, the most consistent and general theory that
has been stated with respect to them is that of Avogadro, who is
their modern expounder in the sense of chemical polarity. These
results were in harmony with the idea of motion, the criterion
adopted in these papers.       The practical result is that there is no
such  thing  as an  acid, base,  or salt, though the use of the adjec
tives and qualitative nouns derived from these terms might pro
bably be successfully defended.                 If
                                         any one deny this conclusion
he is bound to     give a  satisfactory   definition of an acid, for ex
ample—a task in which, as history clearly shows, success is un
likely to accrue.

the concrete sphere of external chemistry,                  I

and Chemical Functions, where the service of the same idea will
prove available.
                       1. Chemical Substance.
   We are accustomed, in the language of everyday chemistry, to
say that such and such bodies or substances undergo certain
operations; sulphur, hydric nitrate, aniline, &c. are spoken of as
bodies or substances indifferently.  In recording the facts of an
analysis (even of a mechanical mixture), it is customary to say
that so much substance contained or furnished so much of a pro
duct; and this product may be volatile matter or organic matter,
which, in       its   turn, may become substance for analysis.                 A    che

individual diverseness.          Then,           the present day, but few

numerical relations of the highest value and merit, are usually
understood to mean much more than any experimenter has yet
been able to adduce.   Consider, for instance, the formula
                                                        H

I pass over the assertions that H, H, and O stand for atoms fixed
in space or elsewhere *, one H being above the other, and the O
being outside the two, and so forth. Almost every one takes that
formula to mean, among other things, that water contains hy
drogen and oxygen—probably because hydrogen and oxygen are
obtainable from water. Yet when the hydrogen and oxygen
united they underwent loss, and are consequently no more the
antecedent hydrogen and oxygen than liquid chlorine is gaseous
chlorine.     Our symbolic system does not guard against this
error.    It is an evident and not an uncommon statement that we
                                                                                                   is,   by

But so, the statical argument abandoned, and we can neither

                       By GeoRGE GoRE, F.R.S.*
     HAVE   made some experiments on the influence of high
     temperatures upon the magnetic condition of electrody
namic spirals formed of iron, copper, and platinum, the heat
being obtained by means of a voltaic battery.
  Experiment 1.—Two horizontal spirals of wire, A and B, fig. 1,
                          Fig. 1.
were employed.     A was composed of a platinum wire 349 ven
tims. long  and 1:42 millim. thick, and B of a copper wire 34-9
centims. long and 2.59 millims. thick—each being coiled into a
cylindrical helix about 3.8 centims. long and 1.6 centim. in dia
meter, with exactly the same number of turns in each ; they
were united by means of binding-screws, C.       A magnetized
steel needle, D, about 8 centims. long, was suspended in the                                   di
rection of north and south (by means of a fibre about 35 or 40
centims. long), with              its
                             south pole between and equidistant from
the ends      of
              the two   coils, which were about      centims. asunder;     3
                                                                      by

 rent through them the magnetism excited              their ends nearest   in
to  the needle was        the same kind; and the direction
                             of                                       the                 of

 tims. long and 7.7 centims. wide, the platinum wire became very
 hot, but not red-hot, whilst the copper wire remained cold; the
 needle remained equidistant between the two wire poles, being
 equally repelled       by
                       the hot platinum and cold copper.

Mr. G. Gore     on the Magnetism      of Electrodynamic Spirals.      265
     Experiment   2.-In     this experiment the spirals were 1.5 cen
tim. in diameter and 2.9 centims, long,                     Fig. 2.
and were placed parallel to each other,                        N
as in fig. 2, and were formed of platinum
wire '82 millim. thick, and copper wire
2.05 millims. thick; but in other re
spects the arrangements were similar to
those of No. 1 experiment. With the
ten Grove’s cells as one series the pla
tinum wire was quite red-hot through
out, and the copper wire cold, and the
pole of the needle remained equally re
pelled by each spiral as before; and
with the cells as a double series of five,
the platinum wire was bright red-hot,
and the needle remained in the centre
the same as if no current was passing.
A bright red heat, therefore, did not
sensibly increase or decrease the mag
netizing influence of the platinum spiral;
and the magnetism of that spiral was independent of change of
temperature, and of the molecular state produced by change of
 temperature.
     Eageriment 3–The arrangements were the same as in the
last experiment, except that an iron wire was substituted for the
 platinum one, and ten large Smee's cells, 12 inches x 8 inches,
 substituted for the Grove’s battery. With an iron wire 1:42
 millim. thick the iron wire became heated to about 200°C., and
 repelled the needle, much more powerfully, than did the cold
 copper spiral. With an iron wire 95 millim. thick the iron
 spiral, though much hotter, still repelled the needle more strongly
 than the copper one; and also repelled it strongly after the cur
 rent was stopped and both the wires were quite cold, evidently
 because it retained much of           its induced magnetism. With        a
 “No. 23” iron       wire,  '68 millim.   thick,  the iron spiral became
 red-hot, and repelled the pole      of the needle with but little greater
 force than that   of  the copper spiral;         on
                                                 shifting the copper spiral
 to
 a      distant part   ofthe circuit and   renewing    the current, the iron
  spiral repelled the needle strongly.        This experiment shows:–
  first, thatan  electric current    ofa given strength passing simulta
 neously through two similar spirals          ofwire, one of   iron and one
      copper, produces                                       greater degree
 of of

                                                  total magnetic power    is
  not much    greater  than that  of  the   copper;   thirdly, that the iron

at moderate temperatures possessed both the magnetism due to
the current itself and that induced by the current upon the mole
cules of the iron, whilst the copper possessed only that which
belonged to the current itself; and, fourthly, that by a rise of the
temperature of the iron to redness the induced portion of the
magnetism in it decreased, whilst the magnetism due to the cur
rent alone remained equal to that in the copper.
   Eageriment 4.—I now tried flat spirals of wire facing each
other about 4 centims. apart, with their axes in one horizontal
line (see fig. 3); the spirals were about 2.5 centims. in diameter,
                                  Fig. 3.
and   each contained four        turns         With 20 centims.

length of iron wire 95 millim. in diameter, and 20 centims. of
copper wire 2.07 millims. in diameter, and the ten large Smee's
elements, the iron spiral became nearly red-hot; at the first in
stant of passage of the current the iron repelled the similar pole
of the needle somewhat more strongly than the cold copper; but
as it became hot     its
                     excess   repulsion became less.

double series   of   five for the Smee's battery: the iron wire be
came red-hot, whilst the copper one remained cold, and the needle
remained about equidistant between the two helixes. With                    a
flat helix of  thin platinum wire substituted for the one          to ofiron
the platinum one became nearly white-hot, and appeared                 repel
the needle      little more than the copper;            difficult, however,

composed       of thin    iron wire                    Fig. 4.
15 centims. long, and each       of
thesamethickness,were taken,
and one of them freely sus
pended (by means of the two
fibres C, C) vertically and
facing the other at a distance
of about 2 or 3 millims. apart.
The lower ends of the spirals
dipped into two small cups of
mercury to enable the con
nexions to be made with free
dom of motion to the sus
pended       one; and the similar
poles    of the spirals faced each
other.   The current from the
twelve Grove’s cells in single
series was passed through
them; they immediately re
pelled each other and then melted.       The same current was now
passed through two similar ones 1-6 centim. in diameter, com
posed of thicker iron wires, each 12 centims. long and 95 mil
lim, thick; they repelled each other most distinctly and strongly
whilst warm, and also whilst quite red-hot, and the moveable one
instantly fell back on disconnecting the battery.
   As general results of these experiments on electro-spirals, it is
shown, first, that a red heat diminishes only the induced magne
tism in an electro-spiral of iron, and does not increase or decrease
that due to the current alone; secondly, that a red-hot electro
spiral of iron is capable of inducing magnetism, but not of having
magnetism induced in it; thirdly, that the production of heat
by electricity in a wire of great resistance, whether of iron, cop
per, or platinum, is not attended by a diminished production of
the magnetism due to the current in the heated part of that wire.
    These results also support the view that the magnetism of an
electro-spiral of copper or other non-magnetic or slightly mag
netic metal is not due to a particular position or mode of motion
of the particles of the metal, but is a direct result             of,
                                                             and inse

§ I. On      the internal work performed in a gaseous mass when the
     reservoir which contains it is connected with a second, empty
     reservoir.
      MONGST the problems which                                can be treated        by means of
      the thermodynamical formulae, and which relate to the ex
periments described in the first part, the following is the most
simple:—
    Problem         I.-
                  In a reservoir whose sides are impermeable to
heat, there is 1 kilogramme of gas of which the volume and tem
                         vi,

a  second, empty reservoir, with sides impermeable             heat,                 to             r,
                                                                                                   of
capacity:      calculate the
                    to        temperature      and the pressuret'   which                     p'
are established when the exchanges           heat and motion have en

tirely ceased, and the internal work effected.
    Whilst the efflux       going on, heat disappears
                                     is                          the first               in
reservoir, with production          mechanical of  work;     the second             in
reservoir vires virae are created which are equivalent         this work,                to

nary temperature *, K would be equal to 0-18.         But it is not
proved that this ratio does not increase with the temperature.
M. Hirn took 0-164 for the value of K. By taking 0-17 I do
not think a very large error is made.

   Hence p'v'=p,v) is positive, and there is a production of ex
ternal work during the efflux. This work has been produced at
the expense of the virtual energy of the gas; and by that may be
explained why the fall of temperature T1–T' is greater than in
the first problem.
Discussion of the eageriments                of Messrs. Joule and Thomson and
                                          of M. Hirn.
   Messrs. Joule and Thomson have made their experiments
under conditions in which the gas on leaving the orifice resumed
the initial temperature T1. From that moment the sides fur
nished to each unit of weight of the gas the heat Co(T1–T), C,
being the specific heat at constant pressure. We shall easily pass
from the preceding case to this latter.

culation, n, =47 atmospheres and n'=0.989, we find
                                 T-TV-3°46,
which number is a little less than that deduced from formula
(12); but the difference is so trifling that the approximation of
formula (14) is justified.
   All the preceding formulae follow the course of the phenomena;
but they can never give very exact numbers, on account of the
uncertainty which prevails as to the value of some of the con
stants, such as a, A, K, and Cº.         Thus Messrs. Joule and
Thomson have taken, from Mr. Rankine,
               log 3Aaro. 10334 =2:5111438                      and   To-274,
                        Cp
instead  of 2:4365685 and 273, which I have adopted.
     Consequently formula (14) gives with these numbers
                                 T-T =4°09.
   On page 336 of the memoir just quoted may be read that
the cooling observed with a difference of pressure of 60601
pounds on a square inch was 5°049 at the temperature of
 12°-844.
   This excess of pressure is equivalent to ni-n'=4'216 atmo
spheres, if we assume for one atmosphere a pressure of 14:373
pounds per square inch.
   Formula (14) gives the preceding number with the constants
of Mr. Rankine very well; but with those which have been used
in the preceding calculations we obtain under the same circum
stances 4°65, a smaller number.
   It is possible that in the experiments of Messrs. Joule and
Thomson the thermometer may have been placed at too small a

    The general effects correspond           the theory; but  to         not                        I       do

influence  of the sides and the porous partition         the thermometer            on

     I donot think that the thermal effects at present in question
can be studied very exactly by means of the thermometer. The
inevitable action of the sides, alone, prevents entire exactness.
   M. Hirn has given in one of his last memoirs some very simple
formulae, by means of which we can solve the problems before
us+.        I
          tried to apply them; but the results to which they lead
differ from those which I have given.
   Following the method invented by M. Hirn, and which is
applied in the memoir quoted to the vapours of water, of bichlo
ride of carbon, of sulphide of carbon, of alcohol, and of ether,                                                I

But     I    not found for the constants a, b, 8 values which
            have
made the formula agree sufficiently with the Table on page 272.
Ifan agreement between them were established, that formula
would take the place of the formula of Mr. Rankine, and, intro
duced into the preceding equations, would solve our problems.
  For example, in the problem of §       formula (5) would give

1.                             stated.—The object of this paper
                            Principle
       GENERAL
          is to state in a more general and comprehensive form
than has hitherto been done to my knowledge, a thermodynamic
and hydrodynamic principle of which many particular cases are
well known and understood. That principle may be stated as
follows:—
       a steady stream of any fluid, the abstraction of heat at and
      In
near places of minimum pressure, and the addition of heat at and
near places of mawimum pressure, tend to produce acceleration; the
addition of heat at and near places of minimum pressure, and the
abstraction of heat at and near places of maximum pressure tend to
produce retardation; and in a circulating stream the quantity of
energy of flow gained or lost in each complete circuit is equal to
the quantity of energy lost or gained in the form of heat; and in
the absence of friction, the ratios borne by that quantity to the heat
added and the heat abstracted (of which it is the difference) are
regulated by the absolute temperatures at which heat is added and
abstracted, agreeably to the second law of thermodynamics.
   2. Equation of the Flow of a steady Stream without Friction.
—Let   a steady stream of any fluid, whether liquid, vaporous, or
gaseous, flow in a suitable smooth passage or channel without
friction.    At a given point in the stream             the velocity, let v      be

       GENTLEMEN,
      HE  Rev. J. M. Heath, in his paper “On Thermodynamics,”
        published in the Philosophical Magazine for September,
states, with reference to certain dynamical principles, that          have                   I
admitted, by my silence, that those principles were ignored by
the earliest original investigators in the science.         This is a mis
conception of the meaning of the statement made by me in my
letter published in your August Number, which was as fol
lows:—“This very principle” (that                             is,
                                                the principle that the
work done        by
                  force
                     a       overcoming attractions and repulsions
                                     in
cannot take effect       accelerating molecular motions) “has been

understood those researches.”          did not keep silence respecting
                                                    I
the earliest  original  investigators; for my statement obviously
 comprehends every original investigator, early           late. The only      or
 writers   as   whom
                to        kept silence were those who had not un
                              I
 derstood the original researches.
    Mr. Heath then refers          the more modern writers having

                           regards this,    have       state that,

 I     have only      add the following remark

the particles.      He supposes the piston             moved inwards du    to   be

upon       it,

    For the sake of simplicity, the preceding demonstration has
been applied to elastic particles striking a piston and rebounding;
but the same principle can be proved for any mode of internal
motion of matter in a confined space; and when the particles
 exert attractions and repulsions, it can be proved for the work
 done by that term in the value of the external pressure which is
 equal and opposite to the outward pressure due to the motions
 of the particles—a term which, according to the second law of
 thermodynamics, is found by performing the operation

 the external pressure,    t being the absolute temperature.       For
 example, when a mass of saturated vapour occupying the space
 S, at the pressure p, and absolute temperature t, is compressed
 into the liquid state, occupying then the volumes, the temperature
 and pressure during the compression being maintained constant
 by abstracting the heat produced, the principle just mentioned
 gives for the amount of that heat in dynamical units

 end is to use clean filtered solutions in clean tubes, kept plugged
 with cotton-wool.
    For example, the sulphates of zinc and magnesia in atomic
 proportions, with a small quantity of water, are heated in a flask,
 boiled and filtered into test-tubes in which they are again heated
 nearly to boiling, and then plugged and set aside to cool. When
 cold, one of the tubes is put into a freezing-mixture at about
  —10°; and in about ten minutes or so large tetrahedral crystals
 beautifully formed begin to grow, as it were, from the side of the
 tube, and they go on increasing until the whole of the solution
 is transformed into a solid mass.           If the tube be now transferred
 to snow and water at 32°, the solid melts rapidly and the solu
 tion becomes clear as before.                          If,
                                              however, the cotton-wool                                           be

deposit    of crystals in the flask; but on gently shaking it the
clear   transparent   solution immediately became opaque from the
multitude of octahedral crystals that at once started into exist
ence. These quickly subsided; and on the deposit a fine crop of
the seven-atom salt soon began to form, consisting of flat plates
or prisms with oblique summits from which heat-currents as
cended, while the liquor above, consisting of a solution of the
anhydrous salt, became quite clear.
    It is perhaps useless to speculate on the condition of this so
lution, reduced, as it was, perhaps 30° below the point at which
it usually deposits anhydrous crystals.            Did they start into ex
istence in a moment? or were            they   present   in the solution in
some molecular condition in which they were not visible because
they had the same index of refraction as the solution, until by
shaking they threw off, as it were, the water external to the
molecular groups and assumed an independent existence and
their own peculiar refractive density and so became visible 7

     This modified salt               of
                              zinc and magnesia, like the seven-atom

                on Supersaturated         Saline Solutions.                 299
sulphate of soda, is of course quite different from the tetrahedral
crystals already noticed, being much more perimanent, even at
atmospheric temperatures, and not changing so long as it is co
vered by the solution.     But, like the seven-atom sulphate of
soda, it cannot exist if exposed to the air; for it immediately
fixes an additional quantity of water and becomes the normal salt.
   The sulphate of zinc and soda, as also the sulphate of zinc and
cadmium, also form supersaturated        solutions which at about
10°F. form compounds resembling the tetrahedral crystals, of a
silky texture, which at about 50° rapidly melt, leaving the solu
tions clear and bright as before.     At a lower temperature the
sulphate of zinc and soda forms crystals of a peculiar character,
which will be noticed in another paper.
   By varying the strength of the solutions and the temperature
to which they are reduced, as well as the time of exposure to
cold, varied results may be obtained.      Rüdorff's showed some
years ago that, by employing saturated solutions of single salts
and reducing them to low temperatures, ice is formed together with a
hydrated compound of the salt in question.       In my experiments
with supersaturated solutions in close vessels chemically clean,
the conditions are of course quite different, and no ice is formed.
In some cases the solutions became viscid like syrup; but they
never froze.     For example, sulphate of soda and potash-alum
in atomic proportions formed in an evaporating-dish an amor
phous mass containing 55 per cent. of water of crystalliza
tion.    A portion of this wetted with a few drops of water can by
gradual heating be raised to the boiling-point without depositing
the anhydrous salt. When filtered into tubes it may be kept for
hours at about 0°F., when it becomes very viscid without any de
posit of salt.  Under the influence of a nucleus the solution crys
tallizes, the soda-salt apparently separating from the alum in the
process.
   In some cases the results vary, unless the double salt is first
formed before a supersaturated solution is made with              For it.

other flat ring similarly marked. Twenty grains of the double
salt heated in a porcelain crucible became 7%, thus giving 62%
per cent. of water of crystallization. One ounce of this salt with
half an ounce of water was boiled and filtered into two tubes :
when cold, the tubes were reduced to 0°, when, after some time,
the cup-shaped cavity at the bottom of the tube became lined
with an anhydrous powder, from which grew small, sharp, aci
 cular crystals. After this the capillary curve of liquid at the
 surface became solid and shot down acicular crystals.        Suddenly
 the sulphate of soda separated at the surface and shot downwards
in the well-known crystalline lines.
     But amidst all these variations the main conclusion from this
 inquiry is left undisturbed, namely, that highly supersaturated
 solutions, chiefly (but not entirely) of double salts, when preserved
 from the action of nuclei and reduced to low temperatures, form
 compounds of various degrees of hydration, which can exist only
 at such temperatures and in close vessels chemically clean.

 XXXVII.        Addendum to a Theory of Nebulae and Comets.       By A.
     S.  DAvis,   B.A.,  Mathematical   Master,  Leeds Grammar School.
       To the Editors   of the Philosophical Magazine   and Journal.
         GENTLEMEN,
 Titº            is one point in the theory of nebulae and comets,
           published in the June Number of your Magazine, which
 may appear unsatisfactory.                         I
                                    In that theory suppose that ne
 bulae are formed       by   masses of gas coming into collision and
 forming, where they may become mixed, a chemical union, with
 evolution of light and heat.
      It may be objected that two masses of gas on becoming mixed
 when in a cold and highly rarefied condition do not generally
 combine, or do not at least combine with an energy sufficient to
 produce light. To this objection I would answer, that though
 the masses of gas on approaching each other are in a cold and
 highly rarefied state, yet when they meet, the parts which come
 into collision become so much condensed and heated that they
 are put into a condition very favourable to their chemical union.
 This I will endeavour to show.
      When two masses of gas come into collision, the portions which
 first meet will act only to a very small extent as a cushion or
  buffer to the remaining portions; their velocity is so great that
  the increased pressure produced by the condensation at the col
  liding surfaces has not time to transmit itself into the interior por

                       Notices respecting New Books.                 301
 tions of the masses before those portions themselves come close
 up to the colliding surfaces. Now the pressure due to the sudden
 condensation produced by the collision cannot transmit itself
 with a greater velocity than that with which sound would travel
 through the gases.        Hence, if the masses collide with a velocity
 much greater than that with which they would transmit sound,
 the internal portions of the masses would not be brought gra
 dually to rest, but would move on with undiminished velocity
 until they were brought to a violent check by meeting with a
 partition of gases in an exceedingly condensed state. The sud
 den condensation thus produced, together with the heat evolved,
 would put the gases into a condition highly favourable to che
 mical union.
    Now in the formation of nebulae       I  think that the velocity of
the   colliding   masses would be very much greater than the velo
city of sound, and therefore that the above-mentioned effects
would be actually produced.          Suppose, for example, that each
of the masses of     gas  contained as much matter as the sun, and
 that their relative velocity was simply that due to their mutual
 gravitation from a great distance: their relative velocity when
 their centres of gravity were at a distance equal to the earth’s
 distance from the sun would be twice the orbital velocity of the
 earth, or 36 miles per second, a velocity very much greater than
 the velocity of sound in any gas whatever.

THE“Note   on the Spectra of Erbia and some                             other Earths.”        By
William Huggins,          LL.D., F.R.S.
   Bahr and Bunsen have shown * that erbia, rendered incandescent
in a Bunsen's gas-flame, gives a spectrum of bright lines in addition
to a brilliant continuous spectrum. As they were unable to discover
the bright lines in the flame beyond the limits of the solid erbia,
they suggest that the light which is dispersed by the prism into
bright lines is emitted by the solid erbia, which substance therefore
appears to stand alone, as a remarkable exception, among solid
bodies.     Bahr and Bunsen found the spectrum of bright lines to
coincide very nearly with the absorption spectrum of some com
pounds of erbium.
    A few weeks since, when in Ireland, I made the observation that
the spectrum of the ordinary lime-light contains bright linest.          Dr.
Emerson Reynolds, Director of the Laboratory of the Royal Dublin
Society, kindly undertook to make experiments to ascertain from the
position of the lines if they were due to the cylinder of lime, or to im
purities contained in       it.

lines were more distinct when a small proportion of oxygen was ad
mitted.     With the full proportion of oxygen, the light from the
glowing erbia was more intense, but the lines were not so well seen.
                                                             I
Even with the intense heat of the oxyhydrogen flame was unable
to trace the lines beyond the limits of the solid erbia, though the
line of sodium could be seen for some distance from the erbia. I
found, however, that the lines appeared more distinct, in conse
quence, probably, of their being brighter relatively to the parts of
the continuous spectrum where they occur, when the slit was di
rected from the side upon the gas immediately in front of the glow
ing part of the erbia.
     The spectrum of bright lines obtained by means of the oxyhy
drogen flame agreed more completely with the absorption spectrum
represented by Bahr and Bunsen (No. 2 in their diagram) than the
spectrum of bright lines figured by those observers (No. 3). The
most important differences occurred in the band in the red, which
showed two points of greatest brightness, thus forming a double line
with a little outstanding light, and the line in the green at 65 of the
scale, which was double, precisely as the corresponding absorption
line is represented in spectrum No. 2 of the diagram.
     Lime.—The experiments were made with the cylinders of lime
prepared for use with the oxyhydrogen blowpipe, and also with
pieces of pure caustic lime; but there was no sensible difference pre
sented in the spectroscope.
     The bright lines consisted of a double line in the green, and
several bands in the orange and red, which were found to form a
spectrum identical with that which is produced when chloride of cal
 cium is heated in the flame of a Bunsen's burner.
     When the spectroscope was directed to a point in the flame a
little above the incandescent portion of the lime, the lines appeared
 beyond the bright continuous spectrum, showing that they are not
produced by the white-hot solid lime, but by the luminous vapour
 into which a portion of the lime has been converted by the heat of
the flame.
     Magnesia.-The commercial heavy oxide of magnesium was made
 into a paste with distilled water, and formed into a small pellet upon
 the end of a platinum wire. The pellet of magnesia was slowly dried,
 and then placed in the oxyhydrogen flame.          I was surprised to see
 a  spectrum  of bright lines precisely similar to that which is produced
 by lime.    Chloride of   magnesium,   when introduced into the Bunsen
 flame, gave a similar spectrum.      I record these results as the oxide
 and chloride were those sold as pure. I found afterwards that a very
 small trace of lime may be detected in magnesia by means of the
 oxyhydrogen flame.
     I then took metallic magnesium, which I had found by the spec
 troscope to be nearly pure, and formed from it magnesia and chloride
 of magnesium.                                                            -
     When this magnesia, formed into a small ball upon a wire, was
  subjected to the oxyhydrogen flame, two bright bands were seen in
  the green.   One of these was found to be coincident with the triple

304         Royal Society    :-Dr. W.     Huggins on the Spectra
line of Fraunhofer's b, which distinguishes      magnesium, and the other
with a group of bright lines which is seen      between b and F, nearly in
the position of the brightest double line       of nitrogen, when metallic
magnesium is burnt in air.
     The chloride formed from magnesium,        when introduced into the
 Bunsen flame, gave the same bands; but the more refrangible band
was exceedingly faint.
     When an induction-spark was taken from a wire covered with
 cotton-wool soaked with a solution of the chloride, the lines at 6
 and the more refrangible group were seen.           If the heating-power of
 the    spark  be increased   by  the introduction of a Leyden jar, the
 band between b and F becomes scarcely distinguishable, while the
 lines peculiar to metallic magnesium are much more intense. When
 a spark was taken between electrodes of the same specimen of magne
 sium from which the chloride was formed, no trace of this band was
 detected.
     Baryta.--When pure caustic baryta is subjected to the heat of
 the oxyhydrogen flame, a brilliant spectrum is seen identical with
 the well-known spectrum which presents itself when chloride of ba
 rium is heated in the Bunsen flame. Baryta furnishes a larger quan
 tity of vapour than lime and magnesia, and therefore the lines could
 be traced to a greater distance from the solid baryta.
       Strontia.-Pure strontia was fused into a large bead upon a
  platinum wire.       When this bead was heated by the oxyhydrogen
  flame, the same spectrum of bright lines presented itself as is seen
  when chloride of strontium is placed in the flame of a Bunsen’s burner.
      Zirconia—One of the small pellets of zirconia prepared in France
  for use with the oxyhydrogen blowpipe was found to give no trace of
  bright lines. This great fixity of zirconia as compared with lime is in
  agreement with the inalterability of the substance under the action of
  the oxyhydrogen flame.
      Alumina-Pure alumina treated in the same way as the magnesia
  gave a continuous spectrum only, without any trace of bright lines.
      Glucina.-Glucina gave a bright line in the red, which I found
  to be due to potassium.        Glucina, therefore, appears not to form
  vapour of any kind under the heat of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe.
      Titanic acid gave a continuous spectrum without lines.
      Oride of uranium a continuous spectrum without lines.
      Tungstic acid a continuous spectrum without bright lines.
      Molybdic acid a continuous spectrum without bright lines.
      Silica (precipitated) a continuous spectrum without bright lines.
      Oride of cerium a continuous spectrum without bright lines.
      The question presents itself as to the nature of the vapour to which
  the bright lines are due in the case of the earths lime, magnesia,
  strontia, and baryta.     Is it the oxide volatilized 7 or is it the vapour
  of the metal reduced by the heat in the presence of the hydrogen of
  the flame?     The experiments show that the luminous vapour is the
  same as that produced by the exposure of the chlorides of the metals
  to the heat of the Bunsen gas-flame. The character common to
  these spectra, of bands of some width, in most cases gradually shading

                                   of Erbia         and some other Earths.                  305
off at the sides, is different from that which distinguishes the spectra
of these metals when                      used as electrodes in the metallic state*.
     Roscoe and Clifton have investigated the different spectra presented
by calcium, strontium, and barium; and they “suggest that, at the
lower temperature of the flame or weak spark, the spectrum observed
is produced by the glowing vapour of some compound, probably the
oxide, of the difficultly reducible metal; whereas at the enormously
high temperature of the intense electric spark these compounds are
split up, and thus the true spectrum of the metal is obtained.          In
none of the spectra of the more reducible alkaline metals (potassium,
sodium, lithium) can any deviation or disappearance of the maximum
of light be noticed on change of temperature”f.
     As the experiments recorded in this paper show that the same
spectra are produced by the exposure of the oxides to the oxyhy
 drogen flame, Roscoe and Clifton's suggestion, that these spectra are
 due to the volatilization of the compound of the metal with oxygen, is
 doubtless correct.
     The similar character of the spectrum of the bright lines seen when
 erbia is rendered incandescent would seem to suggest whether this
 earth may not be volatile in a small degree, as is the case with lime,
 magnesia, and some other earths.       The peculiarity, however, of the
 bright lines of erbia, observed by Bahr and Bunsen, that they could
 not be seen in the flame beyond the limits of the solid erbia, deserves
 attention.     My own experiments to detect the lines in the Bunsen
 gas-flame, even when a very thin wire was used, so as to allow the
 erbia to attain nearly the heat of the flame, were unsuccessful.     The
 bright line in the green appears, indeed, to rise to a very small ex
 tent beyond the continuous spectrum, but I was unable to assure
 myself whether this appearance might not be an effect of irradiation.
     It is perhaps worthy of remark that the chlorides of sodium, po
 tassium, lithium, caesium, and rubidium give spectra of defined lines
 which are not altered in character by the introduction of a Leyden
 jar, and which, in the case of sodium, potassium, and lithium, we
  know to resemble the spectra obtained when electrodes of the metals
 are used. Now                      all
                          these metals belong      the monad group     to                   ;   it

  lines.   The chloride was then mixed with alumina (which had been
  found      give
             to      continuous spectrum only) and exposed
                          a                                       the oxy            to

                               lines were visible.   When,   however,  the
  moistened chloride was placed         cotton and subjected on    the                to      in

306         Royal Society:—Dr. W. Huggins on the Spectra
   The behaviour of silver, therefore, is similar to that of the other
metals of the monad group. Now the difference in basic relations
which is known to exist between the oxides of the monatomic and
polyatomic metals is in accordance with the distinction which the
spectroscope shows to exist in the behaviour of the chlorides: the
chlorides of the polyatomic metals would be more likely to split up
in the presence of water into oxides and hydrochloric acid.
    In the case of some of the oxides and chlorides, one or more of the
lines appeared to agree with corresponding lines in the metallic
spectra; it may therefore be, that under some circumstances, as in
the case of magnesium burning in air, the metallic vapour and the
volatilized oxide may be simultaneously present.
                        Dr. Reynolds's Experiments.
    “After you observed the occurrence of two bright lines in the
spectrum of the light emitted by incandescent lime, you recollect we
identified these as belonging to calcium.              At the time we supposed
that these lines were         produced      by  the  ignition  of the vapour of
some volatile calcium compound probably present as an impurity in
the samples of lime used in the experiments.             If this explanation were
found to be true for        lime,   the  bright  lines seen in the spectrum of
erbia    might    possibly    be accounted for in a similar manner.             In
order to examine the matter fully, I arranged the experiments de
scribed below.
    “I   selected two oxides for comparison with erbia, viz. lime and
magnesia. As it seemed desirable to prepare these oxides in precisely
the same manner as the erbia, some calcium and magnesium nitrates
were made chemically pure to ordinary tests, and then used             -
                                                                            in the
preparation of the respective oxides.
    “The oxyhydrogen flame was employed as the chief source of heat.
The hydrogen was made from zinc and sulphuric acid in the usual
way, and the oxygen from potassium chlorate.                   As both gases are
certain to be contaminated with traces of acids,                 I took the pre
caution of passing each gas through a long tube filled with fragments
of solid potassium hydrate.           If this plan were not adopted, the traces
                   ...}

flame might produce volatile compounds with the earths, and so lead
to mistakes.
    “l.   Experiments with Magnesia.-A loop of stout platinum wire
was moistened with syrupy phosphoric                       and some magnesium
nitrate made to adhere.           The nitrate was then heated in the hydro
gen flame, and a residue of magnesia obtained.                No lines were ob
served in the    spectrum     of the  light  emitted  by the incandescent earth;
and when the latter was           intensely    heated in the oxyhydrogen jet,
only a continuous spectrum was seen*.
   * “Since writing the above, I have succeeded in observing the bright lines de
scribed by Mr. Huggins as occurring in the spectrum of the flame surrounding
the incandescent magnesia.       . In the earlier experiments I probably admitted
too much oxygen to the mixed gas-flame in the first instance.”

   “2. Experiments with Lime.—A platinum wire of the same thick
ness as the last was moistened with the phosphoric acid, some calcium
nitrate was then taken up in the loop, and heated in the hydrogen
flame until a residue of lime was obtained.      At the outset the calcium
spectrum was observed; but the light speedily gave only a continuous
spectrum.     The lime and loop of wire were kept well enveloped in the
hydrogen flame for nearly half an hour, in order to ensure the complete
decomposition of the nitrate.        During this time no lines could be
detected on the     background     of the continuous spectrum, or in the
spectrum of the flame surrounding the lime.            More hydrogen was
now turned on and      oxygen   slowly admitted, the light  being examined

oxygen had reached a certain point, faint traces of the two brightest
Ca lines appeared on the bright background; and the intensity of
these lines increased with the amount of oxygen admitted, up to a
definite extent.    When a certain proportion of oxygen was exceeded,
the lines became less distinct.       The best results were obtained when
the hydrogen was decidedly in excess of the oxygen in the flame—
that is to say, more than in the proportion of 2:1.
    “When the slit of the spectroscope was pointed in such a way that
only the light from the flame surrounding the incandescent lime
entered the instrument, all the Ca lines and bands were observed
with great ease without a continuous spectrum.          On looking at the
mantle of flame with the naked eye, it was easy to perceive a reddish
tinge.      I

    before, and the lime               on
                                the wire had very appreciably diminished
in as

erbia lines were most distinctly seen when the slit of the spectroscope
took in the light from the extreme edge of the incandescent solid.
When the bright lines were best observed, the continuous spectrum
was relatively faint.   Again, when the slit was made to cut the edge
of the   ignited bead of the earth, the strong green line of erbia was
seem to extend to a very small but appreciable distance above or
below (as the case might be) the continuous spectrum.        I could only
observe this for the  strong line.   I failed to get any trace of lines in
the spectrum of the flame beyond the incandescent erbia.
   “The erbia was next heated in the oxyhydrogen flame to the maxi
mum temperature that the wire would bear for three and a half
hours; but the green line was seen to be just as strongly marked at
the end as at the beginning of the experiment.         The bulk of the
erbia was so much reduced by this treatment, that have now scarcely          I
a trace left.

   The following communications were read:—
   1. Professor Huxley communicated a letter received by him from
Dr. Emanuel Bunzel, of Vienna, giving a short account, illustrated
with figures, of the posterior portion of a skull obtained by Professor
Suess from a coal-mine of Upper Cretaceous (Gosau) age. Dr. Bun
zel stated that at the first glance this skull appeared to possess
Reptilian characters, but that the convexity of the occiput, and its
gentle passage into the roof of the skull, the presence of a transverse
ridge in the occipital region, the absence of sutures, the globular
form of the condyle, and some other peculiarities prevent the animal
to which this skull belonged from being referred to any known order
of Reptiles. The author compared this fragment of a skull with that
of a bird, and suggested the establishment of a new order of fossil
Reptiles (Ornithocephala), closely related to Prof. Huxley's Ornitho
scelida.   He proposed to refer his fossil to a new genus, which he
named Struthiosaurus.
   2.  “On the  Discovery of Organic Remains in the Caribbean Series
of Trinidad.” By R. J. Lechmere Guppy, Esq., F.L.S., F.G.S.
   The author described the rocks of the “Caribbean Group” as con
sisting of gneiss, gneissose, talcose, and micaceous slates, and crystal
line and compact limestones, and remarked upon the probable distri
bution of rocks of the same series on the continent of South America.
In Trinidad the uppermost member of the series is a compact dark
blue limestone, which contains obscure but very abundant fossils;
in the subjacent clay-slates and quartz rocks calcareous strings and
bands containing more distinct traces of organisms occur.           The
author believed that he had detected an Eozoon (which he called
E. caribbeum), a Favosites (named F. fenestralis), a Coral, and frag
ments of Echinoderms. He considered it probable that the Caribbean
series was pre-Silurian.
   3. “On the Palaeontology of the Junction-beds of the Lower and
Middle Lias in Gloucestershire.”         By Ralph Tate, Esq., A.L.S.,
F.G.S.
   The object of this paper was to show that the attachment of the
 zone of Ammonites raricostatus to the Lower Lias and that of A.
Jamesoni to the Middle Lias harmonizes with the distribution of the
 organic remains: 50 species were catalogued from the united zones
of A. orynotus and A. raricostatus, 8 of which pass up into the
 Middle Lias, whilst 13 occur in the lower horizons; 115 species were
 enumerated as occurring in the zone of Ammonites Jamesoni, 60 of
 which pass to higher zones, whilst 11 made their first appearance in
the Lower Lias, the number of species common to the contiguous
 zones being 14.
    The author inferred that, as the conditions of depth and deposit
 of the upper part of the Lower Lias are repeated in the lower part

of the Middle Lias, accompanied by       total change in the fauna, a
                                                                 a
break in the stratigraphical succession existed between the Lower
and Middle Lias. This view is supported by the fact of the nume
rical decrease of species in passing up through the several stages
of the Lower Lias, and that of the introduction of many new generic
types with the zone of Ammonites Jamesoni.     Many new species were
described.
   4. “Geological Observations on the Waipara River, New Zealand.”
By T. H. Cockburn Hood, Esq., F.G.S.
   In this paper the author described the general features of the
locality from which he has obtained bones of Plesiosaurus, Ichthyo
saurus, and Teleosaurus. The bones were not obtained in situ, but
from large boulders and blocks scattered in the ravines of the Wai
                H. its
para and     tributaries.

     EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH ON THE INFLUENCE OF HEAT ON
         ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE.  AY DR. L. BLEEKRODE.
           question has already been the object            the researches              of                           of
THIS
  several     physicists.   Until the present time, only three cases have
been considered—(1) when metals are placed              contact with acids,           in
(2) saline solutions with one      another,  (3) metals with their saline
solutions.
   Faraday commenced this investigation          1840*. He heated one
of  the branches         U-tube containing
                              of   a              acid                   an in
                                                            which two iden                 in
tical metallic wires were immersed. The current was strong when
the metal was attackable, weak when gold              platinum was used:          or
in  the latter case Faraday considered the current thermoelectric.
   Wildt experimented          liquids       on
                                          contact with one another.

still considered the current          thermoelectric, but he tried
                                                  to   be              vain                                   in

    Dr. Bleekrode has varied these experiments considerably.              He
immersed two electrodes of the same metal in two vessels          containing
a salt of this metal, united by a siphon.          One of these vessels was
maintained at nearly a constant temperature, whilst the other, placed
in a hot air-bath, was gradually heated. The electrodes were con
nected by a circuit, including a coil whose resistance was such
to render imperceptible the variations produced by heat in the con
ductivity of the liquid; and in the second place a reflecting galvano
meter, the deflections of which never exceed 3°, measured directly the
intensities.      As the resistance of the circuit remained sensibly con
stant, these deflections were also proportional to the electromotive
forces.
     The memoir by Dr. Bleekrode is very rich in numerical results.
These results are collected in twenty-one Tables, of which the majo
rity are represented by curves.         Some of these curves do not differ
 much from the straight line, so that the electromotive force is pro
 portional to the difference of the temperatures; this is what takes
 place, for instance, with copper in sulphate or nitrate of copper,
 and with amalgamated zinc in sulphate or chloride of zinc ; but it is
 rarely like this.
     In general the current goes through the siphon from the cold
 vessel to the heated vessel, except with silver immersed in acetate or
 nitrate of silver, when it is in a contrary direction.
     The most curious cases are those in which the current changes
 sign.     Of these the author distinguishes three. When amalga
 mated zinc is immersed in a solution of double cyanide of zinc and
 potassium, the current is at first positive or passes from cold to hot ;
 then it changes direction when the difference of temperatures exceeds
 30°; it is the same at 53° for silver in double cyanide of silver and
 potassium.       Lead in nitrate of lead is still more singular : the couple
 is at first negative (the current passes from hot to cold); then it
  changes direction when the difference of temperatures exceeds 21°,
  and again changes and becomes negative when the difference
  reaches 51°.
      Too much importance must not be attached to the numerical de
  terminations of electromotive forces, because the composition of the
  liquids changes under the action of the current, and soon produces
  other currents which are superposed on the first and produce hetero
  geneity of the solutions in which the electrodes are immersed. This
  phenomenon is particularly remarkable with silver immersed in            ni
  trate of silver.     Although in this case the current passes from hot
  to  cold, it produces   in the heated vessel some free acid at the same
  time that it deposits some metallic silver, partly black and partly
  crystallized under an arborescent form.—Poggendorff's Annalen,

   ON    TESTS FOR THE       PERFECTION     AND PARALLELISM OF PLANE
       SURFACES OF GLASS.       BY WOLCOTT GIBBS, M.D., RUMFORD PRO
       FESSOR IN HARVARD        UNIVERSITY.
      When    a plano-convex    lens of long radius of curvature     is placed

upon a plane surface of glass and the system is illuminated by an
obliquely incident beam of monochromatic light, as, for example, by
a sodium-flame, the well-known phenomenon of Newton's rings is
observed with remarkable distinctness and perfection of definition.
The symmetry of the rings will depend, in part, on the perfection of
figure of the lens, in part on that of the plane surface.  An extremely
minute deviation from a perfect plane will produce a marked distor
tion of the circular figure of the ring nearest the centre. That this
distortion is or is not due to the lens may be determined by rotating
the lens round its optical axis normal to the plane.       No change of
figure will be seen if the lens is perfect in form and the inequality is
in the plane surface only. Different parts of the plane surface may
of course be tested in succession, by moving the lens from point to
point; and, if necessary, the rings may be observed with a telescope.
    Prof. Rood, of New York, has suggested for the observation of
Newton's rings a method which permits of the employment of a lens
of comparatively small radius of curvature and a microscope.       In his
 arrangement the lens and plate of glass are placed upon the stage of
 the microscope, the light from beneath being cut off; and monochro
 matic light is then thrown down upon the system by means of a
 plate of glass with parallel surfaces inclined to the axis of the micro
 scope at a convenient angle, and placed between the objective and
 the plano-convex lens.      In this manner the rings are seen with great
 distinctness and beauty, and the arrangement is particularly compact
 and convenient.
   The interference bands of Talbot afford a method not merely of
observing with great precision the inequalities of surface and want
of parallelism of the faces of plates of glass, but also of photographing
these defects and obtaining a permanent chart of the glass which may
                                                        to its

                   the  characteristic forms of the protuberancest
                   the spectroscope used with wide slit now enables
 every one to examine, a considerable number convince the ob
 server at once that we have here to do with enormous eruptions
 of incandescent hydrogen.
     Without stepping beyond the range of known analogies, and
 therefore of conditions explanatory of cosmical phenomena, it is
 scarcely possible to find a cause for these eruptive protuberances
 other than that of a difference       of pressure   between the gases       in
    * Translated from a separate impression, communicated by the author,
 from the Proceedings of the Royal Saxon Society of Sciences, June 2, 1870.
   t The protuberances may be classed in two characteristic divisions, accord
 ing to their shapes, viz. into the vapour- or cloud-forms, and the eruptive
forms. The predominance of the one or of the other type appears to de
 pend partly upon local conditions of the solar surface and partly upon
 periodic variation; so that at one time one type may prevail, whilst at an
 other time the other type may be most strongly developed.        It is easy to
 see why the cloudy prominences so closely correspond in form to terrestrial
 clouds and vapours, when we remember that the forms of our clouds depend
 not upon the suspended vesicles of water, but upon the mode in which dif
 ferent masses of heated and moving air are distributed. The vesicles in
 terrestrial clouds form only the material by means of which this difference
 in the masses of air is rendered visible. The clouds of the solar protube
 rances are rendered visible by the light emitted by the masses of glowing
 hydrogen.

314                         Prof. F. Zöllner on the Temperature and
the interior and those on the surface of the sun. The possibility
of such a difference of pressure, however, necessitates the exist
ence of a zone of separation between the interior and exterior
masses of hydrogen, the latter of which has been shown to form
an essential portion of the solar atmosphere.       ,
   The  supposition of such a  layer of separation is so forcibly im
pressed on the mind on the first sight of such an eruptive pro
tuberance, that it even suggests itself to observers who, like
 Respighi, suppose that electricity may be the cause of these solar
volcanic phenomena.

     Inorder to connect this equation with the three previous ones,
a twofold hypothesis must be made:–
   (1) That the chief constituent of the solar atmosphere exert
ing the pressure p, consists of the same gas which issues from
the interior of the sun during the activity of the eruption.
    (2) That the absolute temperature t of the atmosphere may
be supposed mainly to correspond with the absolute temperature
t, at the level of the point from which the gas issues.

proved by observation to allow of         use for the purposes   its

  Considering      that the density of the solar atmosphere is re
duced to an almost infinitely small quantity at a very moderate
distance from the sun's surface, and that the resistance thereby
offered is very slight, we may for the sake of simplicity make the
value of H equal to the mean height of the eruptive protube
rances. A more exact discussion of the conditions under which
this may be done will be given hereafter.
    Protuberances are not unfrequently observed having an eleva

                          Physical Constitution              of the Sun.                         319
   From Wüllner's researches” we may,       believe, conclude that I
the pressure at the base of the chromosphere  or at the outer edge
of the luminous solar disk is equal to that of a column of mer
cury at the earth’s surface from 50 millims. to 500 millims. in
heightf.
     It
      is thus clear that it is not necessary, in order to explain the
presence    of the dark lines in the solar spectrum, to assume that
the continuous spectrum is produced by the incandescence of
a solid or liquid body; for we may with equal right consider
that the continuous spectrum is produced by the glowing of a
powerfully compressed gas.
   This has indeed been experimentally proved by Wüllner for
the sodium-lines, inasmuch as he remarks, “Under a pressure of
1230 millims. the maximum of light at H. becomes less distinct,
the whole spectrum is most dazzling, and the sodium-lines are
seen as beautiful dark linest, so that the light of glowing hy
drogen is intense enough to produce in an atmosphere of sodium
vapour a Fraunhofer-line—a proof that the light of a glowing
solid is not requisite for this purpose.”
   Hence it follows that the radius of the visible solar disk need
not be necessarily identical with that of the supposed layer of
separation, but that this latter may probably be assumed to                                          lie
below the point        which the hydrogen gas under compression

320              Prof. F. Zöllner on the Temperature and
elevation*, it appears that the simplest supposition is that the
liquid surface required by this theory of the sun-spots is identical
with that out of which the protuberances burst forth.       The ra
dius of this surface r will be r=R-8" when R signifies the
sun's radius expressed in seconds; or taking R at the mean
distance of the sun to be 16', we have r=15'52".      According
to Hansen, the mean solar parallax is 8"–915; hence we have
r=680,930,000 metres, or 8"=5,722,500 metres.          In order,
therefore, to be able to obtain a numerical value for the mini
mum temperature in the space from which an eruption of the
height of 1.5 minute breaks out, we have only to substitute the
following values in equation (5):
     r=680,930,000,                        H=64,370,000,            A=4}x,               k=3:409.
Hence we find ti-40690°.
     Ifwe give H double the above value, or suppose an eruption
of 3 minutes (as not unfrequently occurs) to take place, we have
a minimum temperature tº-74910°.
   We may, however, now inquire whether we are justified in
taking the extreme heights of observed protuberances as values
for H in our formula, H signifying the height to which a body
thrown out from the sun's surface would rise without resistance.
If  we have really to do with rising masses of glowing hydrogen, as
is indeed sufficiently proved, this rise may take place, according to
Archimedes's principles, like air heated and made specifically
lighter than the neighbouring parts.          It                        is,

322          Prof. F. Zöllner on the Temperature and
   According to the mechanical theory of heat, such velocities in
the case of hydrogen necessitate a difference of temperature
amounting to 40690° C. The temperatures themselves may be
approximately determined if we can succeed in obtaining any
limiting value for t, the temperature of the outer atmosphere of
hydrogen. This temperature, as has been already shown, may
be taken to be nearly identical with that in the neighbourhood
of the outlet.

  A limiting   value for t may be obtained from equation (W.),

In this the density   a   of the enclosed mass of gas is expressed as
a function of the three values pn, h, and t. I shall now show
that the value of a cannot exceed a certain limit; and thus the
value of t is also ascertained within a given limit, inasmuch as
limits to the values p, and h have been already determined.        It
has been already pointed out that the explanation of the eruptive
protuberances presupposes the existence of a layer of separation,
 dividing the space out of which the eruptions break forth from
that into which they empty themselves.       It is only by the exist
ence of such a division that the  required difference in pressure is
rendered   possible.
    Respecting the physical constitution of this layer, the further
assumption is necessary that it is in some other state than the
gaseous.    It may be either solid or liquid. In consequence of
the high temperature the solid state is excluded; and we must
therefore conclude that the layer of division consists of an incan
descent liquid.
    Respecting the mass of hydrogen enclosed by this liquid
layer, two suppositions appear at first sight possible:–
    1. The whole interior of the sun is filled with glowing hy
drogen, and our luminary would appear like a great bubble of
hydrogen surrounded by an incandescent atmosphere.
   2. The masses of hydrogen which are thrown out in these vol
canic outbursts are local aggregations contained in hollow spaces
formed near the surface of an incandescent liquid mass, and
these burst through their outer shell when the increased pressure
of the material in the interior reaches a certain point.
   According to the first assumption, a state of stable equilibrium
will only occur when the specific gravity of the liquid dividing

of the layer of division must necessarily be smaller than that of
the mean specific gravity of the sun.         we assume that the          If

326            Prof. F. Zöllner on the Temperature and
mind the very small power of emission which permanent gases ex
hibit compared with that of vaporized solid bodies. If we consider
the power of emission of very small quantities of different gases
 at the same temperature for rays of the same refrangibility*,
we find that the above-mentioned experiment of Wüllner affords
a good illustration of the extraordinary difference in the power
of emission, and therefore, according to Kirchhoff’s law, the power
of absorption of different gases at the same temperature. In
this experiment the small quantity of the sodium-vapour which
is volatilized in the Geissler's tube gives out more light than
hydrogen compressed under a pressure of 1000 millims. of mer
cury.    It is only by bearing in mind this circumstance that we
can   explain  why, if on this ground the lines of nitrogen and
oxygen are absent, we yet see those of other elements whose
atomic weights and therefore densities are much greater than
those of oxygen and nitrogen.       From these considerations the
 following conclusions may either be immediately drawn, or may
be shown to follow by a train of reasoning which I propose more
fully to develope elsewhere.
   1. From the absence of certain lines in the spectrum of a self
luminous star the absence of the corresponding elementary body
cannot be affirmed.
   2. The absorbent layer in which the reversal of the spectrum
occurs is different for each element.       This point lies nearer to
the centre of the star the  greater   the  density   and the smaller
the power of emission of the element in question.
   8. In the case of different stars this layer lies, under otherwise
similar circumstances, nearer to the centre the greater the inten
sity of gravitation    is.
   4. The separation           of
                          the layers      reversion      of
                                                      the several          of
elements, both from one another and from the centre      the star,              of
                      of of
increase with rise   temperature.
   5. The spectra     different stars are, under otherwise similar
circumstances, richer
                              of in
                            lines the lower the temperature         and               is
the greater   the mass    the star.
   6.  The great difference     intensity exhibited
                                       in               the lines    the

                                           make some remarks         the                  on

                 Physical Constitution     of the Sun.              327
de Boisbaudranº, with regard to Wüllner's experiments on the va
riation of the spectra with pressure and temperature, that these
results must be applied only with the greatest care to the phe
momena of the pressure-variations of the solar atmosphere, inas
much as these alterations in the spectra are influenced far more
by changes of temperature than by changes of pressure.             Even
if this suggestion should be established by future experiments,
the results developed in the foregoing memoir would only be
very slightly affected; for the constitution of the function
(formula W.) which has served us for the determination of the
temperature of the atmosphere is such that the pressure pay at
which the hydrogen spectrum becomes continuous, may be
altered within very wide limits without necessitating a corre
sponding alteration in the temperature.         Thus, if we employ the
two extremes of the assumed       pressures    1:10,  we find that the
corresponding values for the temperatures stand in the ratio of 1
to l'15 only.                                                           -
    Nevertheless it must be admitted that the exact elimination of
the influences which pressure and temperature exert on the con
stitution of the spectrum is to be regarded as a problem the
solution of which is of the greatest importance for Stellar
Physics.
    Perhaps by the application of the well-known laws of the heat
 of the current and of Gay-Lussac’s law, it may prove possible so
 to regulate the pressure of the gas by alteration of the level of
 the mercurial column, that the increase of pressure produced by
 the elevation of temperature of a powerful discharge may be com
 pensated for by a reduction of pressure before the discharge. In
this way the pressure could be kept constant, and without know
 ing the temperature itself the effects of the changes of tempera
 ture on the spectra could be readily observed.         In this case the
 loss of heat by conduction and radiation experienced during the
 short period of the discharge is neglected, and the quantity of
 heat evolved in the circuit is considered to be approximately pro
 portional to the temperature of the incandescent gaseous mass.
 If this mass is known, it would be possible to calculate a superior
 limit for the absolute temperature of the incandescent gas, pro
 vided the duration of the discharge and the quantity of heat de
 veloped during such discharge were determined.

there the   experiment  of Le Cat, to which, I presume, Mr. Tem

shadows are very distinct, and their coalescence          therefore easily      is
traced, easier than the gradual disappearance            Helmholtz's ex        in

342          Mr.   J.   C. Donglas's Reply to Mr. Templeton’s
sufficient evidence, that the eye is simply a camera obscura, with
a lens to form a picture, a retinal surface to receive a picture,
and an adjusting-power for distance.” That inaccuracies exist
in works on “physics” is not to be denied; but text-books on
experimental physics are scarcely the sources from which to ob
tain authoritative statements on difficult points in physiological
optics. The comprehensive work of Professor Helmholtz”, the
works of Donders, C. Stellwag, von Cariou, &c., would be truer
representatives of the opinions of those who are building up this
branch of knowledge.                   I
                                  do not find such physicists consider the
eye any more like a camera obscura than it really                  Helmholtz,     is.
for  instance,   states       in
                             one   place,  the camera obscura       the optical         is

   Mr. Templeton has given an extract without mentioning his
authority.   I submit, this should have been given, as readers
might probably infer from the heading of Mr. Templeton's paper
that the quotation represented my opinion.    Mr. Templeton                                                in
sists “that further inquiry should take place before it be assumed
that ‘the known properties of light afford a complete elucidation
of the whole mechanism of vision and the use of every part of
the visual apparatus.’” I have never met with the above state
ment in works on vision; on the contrary,      find the admission            I
*     general that knowledge in this direction is very incomplete.
      elmholtz states that doubts may be justly entertained if the
state of this young and rising branch of science admits of such
treatment, even only preliminary, as the plan of his book de
mands. And in another place, as the attempt to introduce order
and connexion must ultimately be made, and as the science must
be ultimately freed from contradictions, he has undertaken the
task under the conviction that order and connexion, even on an
unstable basis, are better than contradiction and disconnexion.
He also states that the history of the science would only have an

 ried to inaccuracy, and Mr. Templeton's objection is perfectly
 valid.   In referring to the eye of an albino &c., “this has the
 advantage that, as the choroid is destitute of pigment, light can
 traverse it without loss;” in other words, the choroid is perfectly
 transparent. The distance of distinct vision has been retained,
 although it has been proved such does not exist as a definite
 distance; the region of accommodation, near point, and far point
 are not referred to; myopia and presbyopia are regarded as op
 posite defects; short sight is defined as “the habitual accommo
 dation of the eyes for a distance less than that of ordinary vision;”
 spectacles  are calculated    from the distance of distinct vision;
 as a proof of chromatic aberration in the eye, it is stated, the
 image of a white disk on a dark ground, if formed before or
 behind the retina, appears surrounded by a very narrow blue
 edge, and the optical centre of the lens is used without reference
 to the effect of the thickness of the refractive media.       Brevity
 cannot be    urged  as an excuse for    inaccuracy.    Dr. Donders's
 ‘Anomalies of Refraction and Accommodation’ was published in
 English in 1864; and Professor Helmholtz's Physiologische
  Optik was published early in 1867.
    Carpenter’s “Physiology’ has been brought up to date; this
 and the recent publication of several surgical works must tend to
 disseminate views consonant with the more recent discoveries.
 The work selected by me as an example no doubt does good service
                                                          I
 in the cause of elementary scientific education; but think such
works as Professor Tyndall’s “Heat’ and ‘Sound,’ and the excel
lent philosophical elementary works of Professor Huxley, do more
good, and are more useful to the teacher, than works which treat
briefly of ten or twelve subjects. Professor Huxley's elementary
lectures appear, in my humble opinion, perfect models, not
cramming many facts into little space, and fully developing the
capacity of elementary scientific instruction for training the
mind in correct habits of thought.       I do not think such general
works as those referred to above could be made to approach such
a model without greatly increasing their bulk and making the
expense of using them a still greater objection than it is at pre
sent; while the vast labour of reference in compiling a work on
so many subjects must preclude the possibility of the facts being
so reliable as in more special works.       It may be urged that a
work treating only of the rudiments of a subject can be easily
kept up to date; but there is yet the danger of even this foun
dation being shaken by discovery, and of statements no longer
true being copied from time to time, from the difficulty, or even
impossibility, of one man being equal to the labour of the neces
sary reference.

346           Mr. F. Guthrie           on Approach caused by Vibration.
pieces of card in planes perpendicular to the plane of the vibra
ting body, Mr. Faraday was able to control the accumulation of
the powder, and by performing the experiment in vacuo he
showed that the internodal deposition no longer took place. By
scattering a light powder upon a tuning-fork, one prong of which
was vertically above the other, both being horizontal and vibra
ting in a vertical plane, Mr. Faraday showed how the powder
collected along the middle line of the prong in little travelling
heaps, each heap consisting of moving particles which rose from
the fork in the middle of the heap, fell down the side of the heap
and were gathered in at the bottom. A general conclusion at
which Mr. Faraday arrived was this: whenever the different parts
of a surface are vibrated to different degrees, there is always a
tendency for the air to flow along the surface of the vibrating
body towards the more violently agitated portions from the less
agitated.
    § 4. It is clear that, before examining the possible connexion
between these superficial whirlwinds and the fact mentioned in
 § 1, it is necessary to examine into the existence of air-currents
of unclosed paths. The tuning-fork which was most employed,
 and which I call fork A, vibrated 256 times per second (UT.),
 and had the following dimensions (Plate IV. fig.                                1.):-
                                                     metre.

in fig. 2, namely:-
    (1) He, axis of tubes perpendicular to a.
    (2) He, axis of tubes perpendicular to b.
    (3) H, or H, axis of tubes perpendicular to c.
    (4) The same as (3), but having one prong of the fork thrust
as far as possible into the tube T.         In none of the cases did the
smoke show      any  tendency   to escape   through    the tube t; nor was
fresh air drawn in.
   § 7. Experiment 3.—The cork and tube t of Experiment 2
were withdrawn and replaced by a film bubble of glycerine-soap
water. The combinations of position of Experiment 2 were re
peated.     In none of the cases did the bubble show any variation

of plane vibration, no permanent true air-currents are formed;

                             sounding-box, was          adjusted that when so
at rest (H,) the surface         was parallel        the plate.
                                                                   in to

   At           of about 0.005 metre the magnesia begins to
        a distance
be disturbed.  It is dragged from a distance of about 0:008
metre on both sides of the fork towards the fork. It collects in
 three ridges beneath the fork—namely, in two very fine ridges
 exactly beneath the edges of the prong, and a very much thicker
 ridge beneath the centre of the prong.            Seen in section parallel
 to c, the accumulations     appear  as in  fig.  3 (1). The general ap
 pearance when the fork is withdrawn is shown in fig. 3 (2).
     § 12. It appears from the ultimate distribution of the powder,
  as well as from the motion of the particles during the commence
  ment of the disturbance, that four cylindrical whirlwinds are
 here concerned, the position and direction of which are shown in
 section in fig. 4.    As the air moving in the whirl m and the air
 moving in the whirl n approach one another horizontally, they
 drag the powder with them towards s. When they meet and
 turn vertically upwards, there is necessarily about s a region of
 comparative calm.        For the same reason there is a region of
 comparative calm about t. Similarly the air which descends at
 v is divided as it approaches the rigid surface, some of it entering
 the whirl n and some of it entering the whirl o. At the exact
 centre of v there is calm, where the air goes neither to the right
 nor left. That there are upward currents above s and t is shown
 by the projection of particles in the directions q and r when the
 vibration is very violent and the plate is very near the fork.
    § 13. That there is a region of calm where the axis of the
 descending current would, if produced, cut the horizontal sur
 face, and where the axis of the vertically ascending current,
 formed by the clashing of two horizontal currents, would meet
 the surface, is shown by blowing dry            air
                                                   upon the strewn plate,
 (1)  through a   single vertical tube, and            (2)
                                                       through two neigh
 bouring ones.         Inthe first case, fig.5    (1), the powder appears
 undisturbed immediately below the centre                 the tube; and
                                                             of          in
 the second case the powder remains undisturbed, not only below
each tube, but also midway between the two, fig.                (2).5
  It   is clear that the occurrence    of  the   powder       the places de
                                                                  in
scribed    may    be  partly attributed     to  the   equilibrium    between
equal and opposite forces.        This would account for the repose      of
the particles  in   the places specified, but not for their accumula
tion there.
  §    14. Experiment       5–An     arrangement was employed pre
cisely similar                               11, with the exception that
                b to
                     that described  in §
(H,) the face was horizontal. On stroking the fork across
OY and bringing the magnesia near                  it,       no
                                                           disturbance was
shown until the interval      between   the   fork  and  powder    was about
                             powder             slightly
                                                                  a en
0.001 metre. Then the                 moved                  masse towards
that portion   of  the plate which was accidentally           little the fur

thest from the fork, fig. 6 (1) and (2). When both plate and
fork were accurately horizontal, and the strongly vibrating fork
was very close to the powder, the latter partly separated into
irregularly shaped flakes which showed no inclination to adjust
themselves into any definite geometric form.
   § 15. It may be remarked that when powder is strewn on the
face b, when the fork is vibrating as in § 14, the particles are
jerked in straight lines backwards and forwards to distances de
pending upon their masses. These lines cross the central line
of the fork’s b-face; and although, after a time, it is along this
line that powder chiefly remains, this is because, at other parts,
the powder is cast off at one or other edge as each particle falls
within the amplitude of the fork’s vibrations.
   § 16. I conclude from $$ 14 and 15 that no sensible whirl
winds are established in the air in contact with the b-face when
the plane of vibration is parallel to that face.
   § 17. Eaperiment 6.-The fork was fastened vertically down
wards (H,); and being set in vibration as in § 11, the glass plate
strewn with magnesia was approached vertically.     As in Experi
ment 5, the two had to be brought very near before any disturb
ance occurred.                When within
                                    or 2 millims. the magnesia began
                                                                                                  f

to be scattered,    the portion nearest to the edges parallel to
 (fig. 1) being most disturbed and being driven from under the
fork.
    This distribution of the powder is evidently to be traced to the
 different lengths of path and consequent different rates of motion
of the different parts of the face c. The edges parallel to f(fig. 1)
 move further and faster than the central line between them, since
 (fig. 8) C A > CB. Indeed, assuming that the prong remains
 unbent and swings as a pendulum about C, then

thrown across the middle line parallel to f, remain on the fork
for a longer time.    The apparent effect produced is assisted by
the retention of  images   on the retina; and the appearance is as
though a nebulous band of powder rested along the middle of
the c face parallel to f. On account of the greater amplitude of
the vibrations at the edges of the prong, a particle there will be
hurled forward with greater force than one nearer to the central
line.         If
           the particle projected happen to alight upon the fork
when the latter is moving in the same direction as the particle, it
will be hurled forwards again, and perhaps be precipitated over
the edge parallel to f. If it alight when the fork is moving in                               -
the opposite direction it will be thrown back again.
    § 19. It appears, then, from $$ 11–18 that when the fork is
vibrating in a plane parallel to b, it is only on face a that any
appreciable air-circuits are formed, and that there such circuits
do not extend sensibly beyond at most 0:006 metre.
    § 20. We shall see that the existence of such air-circuits, con
fined as they are to the immediate vicinity of the fork, are quite
insufficient to account for the class of phenomena which have to
be described, and which are similar to the fundamental fact men
tioned in § 1.
    § 21. Eaperiment 7–To one end of a splinter of wood, 0:5
metre long, a card 0.08 metre square was fastened in such a way
that the plane of the card was vertical, and contained the line of
the splinter. The whole was hung from a fibre of unspun silk
 (fig. 9) and counterpoised.   The tuning-fork A was set in vibra
tion as before, and was brought towards the card in the three re
lative positions corresponding to those of § 6; namely:—
        (1)   (H,). Theface a parallel to the card.
        (2) (H.). The face b parallel to the card.
        (3) (H, or H,). The face c parallel to the card.
        In all     three cases the card moved towards the fork.                    The rate
at which the card moved was greatest when the fork was sounding
loudest. In               all
                   three cases    was possible

test the reciprocity of the motive tendency in the case under con
sideration, the following experiment was tried.
   § 23. Eaperiment 8.—The tuning-fork A was fastened to the
end of a rod 1 metre long; the other end of the rod was counter
poised, and the whole was hung from a silk tape.        If the ver
tical plane passing  through  the rod be called  V,  then the rod
and fork received in succession the three relative positions:—
     (1) (H,), W parallel to a.
     (2) (H,), W parallel to b.
     (3) (H, or H,), W parallel                   to c.
     In(1) and (2) the fork was simply hung from the suspended
rod; in (3) it  was fastened to an iron rod in the direction of                                          its
axis, and the two were then attached       the suspended rod

from the tube T by warming it with the hand, so that, when the
atmospheric temperature was regained, the water stood at some
distance up the tube t. The tubet was firmly clamped in several
places to prevent vibration, and consequent centrifugal effect.
On passing the bow across f, the enclosed prong was also set in
vibration. When the amplitude of the vibration was as great as
possible, the water had sunk in the tube t to the amount of
0 003 metre. The moment both prongs were suddenly stopped
the level of the water in t was restored.              The depression of the
level in t cannot be due to increased temperature; for, if it were
so, the increase of volume would be gradual and accumulative,
and on stopping the vibration the contraction due to cooling
would be also gradual, whereas the attainment of maximum
depression and the restoration to normal volume are practically
instantaneous.
     § 27. We have here accordingly an experimental proof that
the rapid motion (in this instance vibration) of a body in a me
dium produces on the whole an effect similar to that which
would be produced by the expansion of the body, namely, a dis
placement of the medium.              If air were perfectly elastic and had
no    inertia,  no such total     displacement   could ensue; and I think
I   may safely predict that the apparent expansion of the medium
will be found, in the case of hydrogen less, and in the case of
carbonic acid greater, than in that of air%.
     § 28. Though we know the dimensions of the fork and                                       its
rate    of vibration, and though we can measure with tolerable ac
                                  is of of
curacy the amplitude                 vibrations, we can only calculate from
this the mean velocity            any given point, because          the middle  in
of  a   vibration the fork              its

                                termination.      Hence this vibratory dis

   § 30. Experiment 11.-A “Cartesian diver” was made out
of a test-tube, a bubble of air, and a beaker-glass of water. This
was so nicely adjusted that it rose when near the surface of the
water, and sank when the top of the tube was 0.05 metre below
the surface. When resting on the bottom of the beaker, the top
of the test-tube was below the surface of the water. When the
diver was resting on the bottom of the beaker, the tuning-fork
A in a state of vibration was presented to the glass in various
directions with regard to the tube. The fork was placed some
times in contact with the water, sometimes in the neighbouring
air, and sometimes in contact (towards the base of the fork) with
the glass. Although the vibration of the bottom of the beaker
caused the diver to leap up, it invariably sank again and showed
no sign of undergoing any alteration in specific gravity.              now,               If,

of  the molecules, and consequently the attenuation                 the film;                                of

 356           Prof.     J.   Plateau on the Figures     of Equilibrium
  saturated with aqueous vapour, but only for a few minutes when
 they are freely exposed to the air. The glycerine-solution not
 only does not emit vapour, but, on the contrary, absorbs the
 moisture of the surrounding air; and it is partly because of this
 that films of this liquid last so long even when exposed to the air.
     In the third place, since gravity constantly causes the liquid
 to descend towards the base of the films, it is plain that, by get
 ting rid of or lessening the action of this force, the duration of
 the film must be increased.         Hence it evidently follows that,
 other things being equal, a horizontal film will last longer than
 one which is inclined or vertical.                  I
                                          have made this comparison
 in the case of films of soap-water formed upon rings of iron
 wire 7 centims. in diameter and exposed to the air, one being
horizontal and the other vertical. The average persistence of the
 first was 25 seconds, and that of the latter 13 seconds.      Hence
 the position, or, more accurately, the greater or less degree of                  in
 clination, of the film must be reckoned as one of the secondary
causes that we are considering.
    In the fourth place, combinations of films always last a much
shorter time than figures formed of a single film. This is because
the highly concave surfaces of the small masses of liquid which
form the liquid edges, and especially those which exist at the
points of junction of these edges, produce a continual drain upon
the liquid of the films and thus tend powerfully to make them
thinner.    The combination of films into systems is therefore
likewise one of the secondary causes which modify their per
manence.
    In the fifth place, films generally last longer in proportion as
 they are of smaller size. For instance, if systems of films are
 produced upon two skeletons of similar shape but of different
 sizes, the one on the smaller skeleton lasts the longest.
   If  the persistence generally diminishes when the size of the
 films is increased, this           is,
                                   think, simply because the greater
                                        I                                          a
 film   is,the greater      the chance that one point
                               is                                  or
                                                             another will
 yield   to  some cause       rupture.
                                   of     Under certain circumstances
 this effect   ofsize does not show itself; for instance, films     soap     of
                                             7,
water formed        upon  rings   10,        and
                                             2,     centim.

                                                        time. This last
fact may       be explained             by
                                  the consideration that the drain                 of

358           Prof.    J.   Plateau on the Figures              of Equilibrium
   According to figures represented on an Etruscan vase preserved
in the Museum of the Louvre, it appears that even in ancient
times children amused themselves with blowing complete bubbles.
                                                I
With regard to modern times, will content myself in this ex
tract with saying that the colours, tension, pressure, average
thickness, persistence, constitution, and different modes of pro
duction of the films, the phenomena of endosmose exhibited by
them, a few special facts and applications, the form of certain
films, and, subsequently to my investigations, of systems of films
have been made the subject of these observations.
   Before returning to the general questions connected with the
figures of equilibrium,               I
                           discuss in the present Series two phe
nomena, the discussion of which could not well be brought in
elsewhere.
   As every one knows, the ascent of liquids in tubes, the sides
of which they are able to wet, does not take place to any consi
derable extent except when the internal diameters of the tubes
are very small, whence has arisen the expression capillary pheno
mena; and gravity always puts a limit to the height of the column
that is raised.   But if the action of gravity were neutralized,
these limitations ought to disappear, and a liquid ought to be
able to rise to any height in a tube of any diameter.
   It appeared to me to be interesting to try this application of
 my processes, by using either                      oil
                                            surrounded          the alcoholic by

approach to a cylinder, or rather to a very elongated cone; only
one of the figures would exhibit as depressions what the other
exhibited in relief. Now, considered with regard to molecular
forces, the conditions of equilibrium and stability are exactly the
same for hollow figures as they are for figures in relief.   Hence,
just as the liquid vein changes into isolated masses under the
action of the molecular forces, so the current of gas ought to
transform itself into separate bubbles—which, as every one knows,
is conformable to experiment.
    But I point out that there is this difference between them;
that the liquid vein always presents a continuous portion of
 greater or less length, while with the current of gas, unless it
has quite an enormous velocity of translation, the bubbles ought
 to be formed very near the opening, and hence the current can
 not have a continuous part.    I verified this deduction by means
 of air escaping  under a  pressure  of 130 centims. of water from
 an opening 5 millims. in diameter, below a stratum of water
 only 20 millims. in thickness: this current, notwithstanding                                    its
 great rapidity and         its

Goldschmidt, and more recently MM. Lindelöf and Moigno,
have discussed the catenoid analytically.                conclusion,   Inthe                as

 360        Prof.  J. Plateau on the Figures of Equilibrium
 without weight; and he accordingly thus obtained the equation to
 surfaces of constant mean curvature.       Meusnier had pointed out
 the skew helicoid with     directing plane  as a surface whose mean
curvature was nothing; M. Catalan has proved that this helicoid
 and the plane are the only ruled surfaces of the mean curvature
 zero.    M. Lamarle has integrated the general equation in the
 case of helicoids, and has thus found four other surfaces besides
the skew helicoid with directing plane. Mr. Jellett has indicated
a simple condition which every closed surface of constant mean
 curvature, except the sphere, must satisfy.
    The general case of surfaces whose mean curvature is zero was
first treated by Monge and Legendre; M. Scherk has deduced,
from the integral which they gave, the equations in finite coor
dinates of five particular surfaces.     M. Ossian Bonnet has made
known another more convenient integral, and has applied his
method to the investigation of surfaces of the kind in question
which pass through a determinate continuous contour.           M. Ser
ret has shown how they can be made to pass through a series of
straight lines not situated in the same plane; and M. Mathet,
by a method different from that of M. Bonnet, how they can be
made to pass through a given plane curve.              M. Catalan has
published another integral still of the general equation, and has
deduced from it several surfaces.
    I  also recall the researches of Dupré, Rennes, and M. Van der
Mensbrugghe relating especially to the tension of liquid sur
faces, researches     of which  I have spoken   already in the Eighth
Series.
    Now let us      see  what are the experimental verifications.   I
have measured the limit of stability of the catenoid by means of
a laminar catenoid formed between two equal rings, whose dis
tance could be gradually varied and exactly measured; and the
result was found to agree perfectly with that deduced from Gold
schmidt’s calculation.
    I  have applied the general principle which concludes my
Seventh Series to the realization of the skew helicoid with direct
ing plane, by employing a closed outline of iron wire composed
of two spires of a regular helix, of a part of the axis, and of two
straight lines connecting this part with the extremities of the
helix. When this outline is taken out of the glycerine-liquid, it
is found to be occupied by a beautiful curved film which repre
sents exactly the helicoid in question.
   I  have realized in the same way in the laminar form, upon an
appropriate framework, a portion of a remarkable surface first
discovered by M. Scherk, and since discussed by M. Catalan.
   M.Van der Mensbrugghe, by applying still the same principle,
has also realized another of M. Scherk's surfaces.

    I have verified a consequence of M. Bonnet's researches—
namely, that an infinity of surfaces having the mean curvature
zero can always pass through a closed outline, either plane or
not plane, of absolutely any form.     I have had the strangest and
most   complicated    closed outlines made of iron wire, and on
issuing from the glycerine-solution each of them was found to
be occupied by a single film: this experiment proves, in the first
place, that, given any closed outline whatever, there is always at
least one surface of mean curvature zero a finite portion of which
can fill    it.  next show how
                   I               make the film undergoto      many                                      as

to the last. The last three ratios were, on the contrary, below
the theoretical limit, but also successively approached it; and
with them the character of stability was recognized, although
likewise becoming less and less marked from one to another.
 Lastly, with the theoretical ratio 3:14 itself neither of these
characters was exhibited: in this case, as with the lower ratios,
the exact cylinder was arrived at without difficulty; but when
this cylinder was left to itself, it began, after remaining appa
 rently unaltered for a few seconds, to change, at first with ex
 treme slowness, but afterwards gradually more and more quickly.
The figure divided itself as usual into a bulging and a constricted
portion, and the change of shape continued until complete separa
 tion had taken place.        The results of experiment accordingly
agreed completely with that of calculation.

be done by help of an appropriate artifice, the transformation
becomes more and more rapid.                For the limiting ratio 3:14, the
duration of the       phenomenon        was eleven minutes; with the ratio
3.18 it was only four minutes; with the ratio 33 it was two
minutes; and with the ratio 3-6 one minute.                      Now it is plain
that a more      rapid     transformation      implies   forces of greater                              in
tensity.
    It follows, besides, from the calculation of which have spoken,               I
that if the ratio of the distance between the bases to their dia
meter is less than 7, and if we suppose one half of the figure to
be slightly increased and the other half to be slightly diminished
in width, the capillary pressures of the swollen portion will over
come those of the contracted portion, and so the cylindrical form
tends to reproduce itself.            Lastly, the same calculation shows
that if the ratio is      exactly  equal   to     and       it,
                                                           the swelling and the

   One point still remained to be cleared up. According to the
calculation I have been speaking of, in order that the surface may
be diminished by the kind of transformation here indicated, it is
sufficient that the sum of the lengths of an expanded and con
tracted part of the figure should exceed the circumference of the
cylinder; and this allows us to attribute to this sum an infinite
number of different values.    But nevertheless, as has been shown
in the Second Series, in a cylinder that is very long relatively to
 itsdiameter, when the transformation takes place quite regularly,
the sum       question
             in          always the same for the same cylinder
                                     is

posterior faces, s, l the cross-section and depth of the pile, c pro
portional to the mean conductibility of the material of the pile, Q
the quantity of heat falling on the pile in a unit of time, and k a
constant.
   Let us now suppose the circuit completed, and we shall have, in
addition to the above, two causes operating to reduce the tempera
ture of the anterior face—the abstraction of heat by the electric cur
rent, and proportional to that current = LI, where I is the intensity
of the current and L a constant; then there will be equilibrium when
               k(t+1)+LI=kt++ (t-t')+LI=Q.
It is quite clear therefore that if Q be constant, will become the                            I
larger the smaller the other two terms become ; and therefore as long
as the first term continues small compared with the remaining terms,
and the resistance in the pile is very small compared with that in
the rest of the circuit, we shall increase the intensity of the current
by every reduction of the cross section of the elements of the ther
   +.
mopile.
          is another point which, though less important, cannot be
entirely lost sight of namely, that the more we reduce the mass of
the anterior face and adjacent parts of the pile, the more rapidly
will the temperature rise to                            itsand therefore

and in more experienced hands their construction would be still
easler.
     An experiment was made with one of the piles to ascertain
whether, when the heat was not directed centrally on the pile, much
diminution of power would take place. There was less deviation, in
consequence of the increase of the mean distance which the heat
had to travel before it reached the soldering; but          I believe that
this defect might be remedied, probably without diminution of the
power of the pile, by increasing the thickness of the face and
leaving the dimensions of the bars the same.
    “On   the Radiation   of Heat from the Moon.”—No.         II.   By the
Earl of Rosse, F.R.S.
    In  a former communication to the Royal Society         I gave a short
account of some experiments on the radiation of heat from the moon,
made with the three-foot reflector at Parsonstown, during the season
of 1868–1869.       I then showed:—
    1st. That the moon's heat can be detected with certainty at any
time between the first and last quarter, and that, as far as could be
ascertained from so imperfect a series of observations, the increase
 and decrease of her heat with her phases seems to be proportional to
 the increase and decrease of her light as deduced by calculation*.
    2ndly. That a much smaller percentage of lunar than of solar rays
 is transmitted by a plate of glass; and we therefore infer that a large
portion of the rays of high refrangibility which reach the moon
 from the sun do not at once leave the moon’s surface, but are
 first absorbed, raise the temperature of the surface, and afterwards
 leave it as heat-rays of low refrangibility.
    3rdly. That, neglecting the effect of want of transparency in our
 atmosphere, and assuming, in the absence of any definite informa
 tion on the subject, that the radiating-power of the moon's surface is
 equal to that of a blackened tin vessel filled with water, the lunar
 surface passes through a range of 500°F. of temperature; conse
 quently the actual range is probably considerably more.
    4thly. The proportion between the intensity of sunlight and moon
 light, and between the heat which comes from the sun and from
 the moon, as deduced from those observations, agreed as nearly as
 could be expected with the values found by independent methods,
 and for this reason might be considered the more reliable.
    During the past season these observations have been continued: but
 much time has been spent in trying various modifications of the ap
 paratus; and a satisfactory comparison of observations made on dif
 ferent nights, under different circumstances, has been impossible.
 However, by more numerous and more complete experiments, made
 alternately with and without an interposed plate of glass, the second
 conclusion arrived at during the previous season has been to a great
 extent confirmed.
    The following Table gives the values found for the percentage
 of the moon's heat which     passes through glass:—

      If  the temperature of space be really as low as is supposed, this
  result seems to indicate considerable opacity of our atmosphere for
  heat-rays of low refrangibility.
      The ever varying transparency of our atmosphere has been found
  to be a very serious obstacle; but the much greater steadiness of
  the needle during the later experiments (the mean error of the last
  few nights’ observations having been from two to three and a half
  per cent. only of the whole deviation *) encourages us with the hope
  that, by taking advantage of favourable moments, and measuring the
  moon's light simultaneously with her heat, more accurate informa
  tion on this subject may soon be acquired.
       The observations were examined with the view of ascertaining how
  far the heating-power of the moon's rays varies with her altitude.
  Owing to the interference of clouds, and the limited range of altitude
  within which the observations were made, it is hardly worth while to
  give the results in detail; however, I may just say that the heating
  power of the moon's rays appears to diminish with her altitude only
  about one-third as fast as the intensity of the solar chemical rays as
  ascertained by Roscoe and Thorpe.
       An attempt was made to ascertain, by comparing two measure
  ments of the moon's light at different altitudes with two corresponding
   measurements of her heat, whether our atmosphere intercepts the
   heat-rays to a greater extent than the luminous rays.           It was found
   that while the light was diminished with the altitude in the propor
   tion of about 3 to 1, the heat was diminished in the proportion of
   about 5 to 1. In consequence, however, of much of the moon's light
   and heat being intercepted by hazy clouds or condensed vapour at
   the lower altitude, the experiment was inconclusive as to the effect
   of a transparent atmosphere on the dark rays of heat.
        The accompanying diagram shows the proportion between the
   amount of lunar heat found on various nights at various ages of the
   moon. There appears to be a general accordance between the varia
   tion of her radiant heat with her phase and the corresponding amount
   of her light as deduced by calculation.
       * During the experiments of the previous season   the mean error varied  be
   tween 27 per cent. and 85 per cent, or more.

   DEAR        SIR,--I

                                                                       to
 to  the star    Argås. Thinking that larger dispersion would

 advantage,    I have had      supplementary arrangement added
                                          a                               the                            to

                     means       which     of

 between the collimator and the usual prism.
   With this increased dispersion, the red line keeps            place; the               its
 yellow one turns out           slightly more refrangible than
                                  to       be                                                       D.
    The green lines, which, with the smaller dispersion, were very                                                  :

 throw some doubt               on
                          their reality,     mere extra dispersion should

 have little effect on real lines.
    The direct prism being small one, does not take

 of  utilizing the full condensation, the smallness       the prism has not        of

the green lines, the appearance of the spectra is due to a character
of light somewhat similar to that of a Orionis, &c., a spectrum of
groups of dark lines, with spaces more or less free between them,
producing the effect (when the light is not sufficient to bear a slit fine
enough for dark lines) of a spectrum crossed by bright lines.
   The behaviour of the red line, however (of the blue one, being less
conspicuous, I cannot speak with so much confidence), would lead
to the already drawn inference that it is a real hydrogen line.
   I have examined other stars of about the same magnitude as m Argås;
in the majority of these there is not even a suspicion of condensation
in any part of the spectrum; red stars, R. Leporis for instance, give a
spectrum not dissimilar to that of m Argås; but the red line on none
of the stars examined is so conspicuous as in m.
   The weather since the beginning of this year has been more fa
vourable, so that I am able, by degrees, to increase the amount of
work done. The routine work is the review of figured nebulae; as
might be expected, the 4 feet gives views considerably different from
the C. G. H. drawings; but at present I have nothing worthy of spe
cial mention.
   The light of the             as they are taken        general exami
                                                  .. for have

nation, is analyzed with the prism; of those      which        been exa
mined    I  have yet found none of which it may be certainly said that
the light is not of definite refrangibilities.
    In irregular nebulae, the bright knots even, which are so distinctly
mottled as to point to a cluster condition, give out, as far as    I have
yet seen, light which is monochromatic, or nearly so.
   Acknowledged clusters, where discrete stars are plainly discernible,
are of course excluded. Of the nebulosity mixed up with such clus
ters as 47Toucan,    I cannot speak with certainty; but if the light were
monochromatic, I think that (in the case particularized at least) the
brilliancy would be sufficient to afford
a definite impression.                                     N
      Would you call Lord Rosse's
attention to 1477–78 (general cata
logue) of which I enclose a diagram
from measured positions? The confi
guration differs so widely from that
given in the Philosophical Transac-                 e
tions, that, with reference to the ro
tation of the two nebulous stars, it
would be interesting to have the evi-r
dence of any additional observations
made at Parsonstown.

  1. A letter from Dr. Gerard Krefft, dated Sydney, 29th January,
1869, accompanying a model of the left lower incisor of Thylacoleo
carnifer, Owen, and the original fragment from which the model
was made.     Dr. Krefft also referred to the fossil remains of Herbi
vorous  Marsupials  in the Museum at Sydney, which included, ac
cording to him, besides a great number of Wombats (Phascolomys),
many wombat-like Kangaroos or Wallabies (Halmaturus).          He pro
posed to divide the Kangaroos into the following groups:—
  (1) Macropus, dentition as in Macropus major.
  (2) Halmaturus, with the premolar permanent, divided into two
subgroups:—
      a. True Wallabies, with the premolars long, narrow, and com
           pressed, and the rami of the lower jaw but slightly anchy
           losed.
      b. Wombat-like Wallabies, with the premolars       compact,
          rounded, and molar-like, and the rami of the lower jaw
          firmly anchylosed.

  2. “On the Fossil Remains of Mammals found in China.”                By
Prof. Owen, LL.D., F.R.S., F.G.S.
   The specimens of teeth described by the author were obtained by
Robert Swinhoe, Esq., late H. M. Consul at Formosa, chiefly by
purchase in the apothecary’s shops at Shanghai.        They included two
new species of Stegodon (named S. sinensis and S. orientalis), a new
Hyaena (H. sinensis), a new Tapir (Tapirus simensis), a new Rhino
ceros (R. sinensis), and a species of Kaup's genus Chalicotherium
(C. sinense). The author remarked that the whole of these teeth
presented an agreement in colour, chemical condition, and matrix
which led to the conclusion that       allbelonged   to the same period.
But for the   presence   of the Chalicotherium,   they  would have been

 Dr. A. A. Caruana. Communicated       by Dr. A. Leith  Adams,   F.G.S.
    The author described a new locality in Malta in which the re
mains of Elephants had been found recently—the Is-Shantiin fissure
 at the entrance of Micabbiba.     It was filled with a compact deposit
 of red earth containing fragments of limestone, many teeth and
fragments of bones of Elephants, associated with bones of large
birds.   The author found three small shark's teeth, and a small
tooth which he regarded as belonging to Hippopotamus.          He indi
cated the nature of the teeth and bones of Elephants found by him
in the newly discovered fissure. The whole of the five localities in
which ossiferous fissures have been discovered are in the same part
of the island; and the author concluded with some remarks upon the
geological conditions under which the remains of mammalia must
have been accumulated, and upon the probability that a connexion
then existed between Malta and Africa.
   In a note appended to the paper Dr. A. Leith Adams stated that
the supposed tooth of Hippopotamus was a germ true molar of one
of the pigmy elephants, and that the Shark's teeth have probably
been derived from the Miocene deposits.

                     Vice-President, in the Chair.
   The following communications were read:—
   1. “On the Species of Rhinoceros whose remains were discovered
in a Fissure-cavern at Oreston in 1816.” By George Busk, Esq.,
F.R.S., F.G.S.
   The object of this paper was to show that the Rhinoceros whose
remains were discovered by Mr. Whidbey in a fissure-cavern
at Oreston, near Plymouth, in the year 1816, and described by
Sir Everard Home in the ‘ Philosophical Transactions” for 1817,
belonged, not as has hitherto been supposed by every one except
the late Dr. Falconer, to Rhinoceros tichorhinus, but to Ith. lepto
rhinus, Cuv. (R. megarhinus, Christ.).
   The remains in question are in the Museum of the Royal College
of Surgeons, and consist of between thirty and forty more or less
broken portions of the teeth and of numerous bones of the skeleton.
The greater number being hardly in a condition to afford satisfactory
diagnostic specific characters, the remarks in the paper were limited
to the teeth and to a perfect metacarpal bone, which appeared
amply sufficient for the purpose.
   The teeth mainly relied upon were the first or second upper
molars (m' or mº) of the right and left sides.      Both the teeth were
broken, but what was wanting in one was supplied by the other.
The characters exhibited were shown to be unlike those of R. ticho
rhinus, and quite in accordance with those of R. leptorhinus. These
were the thinness and smoothness of the enamel, the configuration
of the dorsal surface, the form and size of the columns, and the dis

 position and relations of the “uncus” and “pecten” (“crochet” and
  “anterior combing-plate,” and the consequent absence of the cha
 racteristic “tichorhine pit” or fossette.     The less strongly marked
 characters by which the teeth could be distinguished from those of
 R. hemitoechus, Falc., and R. etruscus, Falc., were also pointed out.
    The metacarpal bone selected for the illustration of the diagnosis
 is 93 inches long, and remarkable for the compression of the shaft
 and its comparative slenderness, as contrasted with the same bone
 in R. tichorhinus, specimens of which were exhibited on the table,
 and which, in no case within the author's knowledge, ever exceeds
 74 or 8 inches in length, and is proportionally much thicker than
 in R. leptorhinus or any other extinct species. The size and form
 of the bone also showed that the species could not be either R. hemi
 toechus or R. etruscus; for although the means of direct comparison
 with the third metacarpal of those species did not, to the author's
knowledge, exist in London, its probable general dimensions and
 proportions could be deduced from those of the corresponding meta
 tarsal, of which bone numerous specimens were available.           It was
 further shown that the Oreston metacarpal exactly corresponded
with those of R. leptorhinus, from Grays Thurrock, in the British
 Museum.
    The determination of the species appears to be of considerable
interest, inasmuch as it affords an additional instance of the occur
rence in England of the great southern Rhinoceros.            This is also
the   only  example  of the discovery of that species, except  in river or
other deposits, either in this country or on the Continent.
    2. “On two Gneissoid series in Nova Scotia and New Bruns
wick, supposed to be the equivalents of the Huronian (Cambrian)
and Laurentian.” By H. Youle Hind, Esq., M.A.
    This paper described the relations of two gneissoid series in Nova
Scotia and New Brunswick, which have hitherto been regarded as
intrusive granites and syenites, and have been thus represented on
the published geological maps of those provinces.        The author con
sidered that these gneisses were in the main of Laurentian age, the
Huronian or Cambrian rocks occurring only in patches over a vast
area of Laurentian porphyroid gneiss.
    The old gneiss was stated to be brought to the surface by three
great undulations between the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia and
the Laurentian axis of America north of the St. Lawrence.           These
axes were     rudely parallel to one another;   and in the troughs  which
lay between them the Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous series
occurred in regular sequence, the New Brunswick Coal-field occu
pying the central trough.        On the line of section, in the troughs
to the north-west and        south-east, the Lower Carboniferous was
stated to be the highest rock series which has escaped denudation.
    The gold-bearing rocks of Nova Scotia are of Lower-Silurian age,
and rest either on Huronian strata or, where these had been re
moved by denudation, on the old Laurentian gneiss.            The gold is

                            beds

which, in Nova     Scotia, is 12,000 feet thick; and the auriferous
beds are worked,   in one district or another, through a vertical space
of 6000 feet. Besides auriferous beds of quartz, intercalated beds
and true veins are found to yield gold, and are worked.
    A series of sharp and well-defined anticlinals ridge the province
of Nova Scotia from east to west, while another series of low broad
anticlinals of much later date have a meridional course.          At the
intersection of these anticlinals the gold-districts are situated, be
cause there denudation has best exposed the upturned edges of the
 auriferous beds of quartz, and rendered them accessible, sometimes
 exposing also the underlying gneiss.     Plans of Waverley and She:-
 brooke  gold-districts were  exhibited, showing    the outcrop of the
edges of the slates and auriferous beds of quartz in semielliptical
 forms, with the gneiss at the base of the ellipse.       On this ground
 it was  suggested  that a correct   mapping  of the   gneisses  of Nova
 Scotia would have an important influence on the development of the
mineral resources of the province.
    A plan of some of the lodes in the Waverley gold-district showed
 the result of operations in 1869, subsequently to the publication of
 a geological map and sections of the district furnished to the De
 partment of Mines by the author in 1868.          Citations were made
 from the annual reports just issued of the Chief Commissioner of
 Mines and of the Inspector of Mines, confirming the correctness of
 the author's plans exhibiting the geological structure of Waverley,
 which is a type of           all

    (2) Mr. Billings next described the doublure or pleura in the   Tri
lobites, comparing it to that of Limulus. He then proceeded to
describe a row of small scars and tubercles on the underside of the
pleurae, to which both Dr. Wolborth and Dr. Eichwald believed soft
swimming feet or hard horny legs had been attached. As these
were first seen by Dr. Pander in a Russian Trilobite, Mr. Billings
has called them “Panderian organs.”             He thinks, soft natatory
 appendages may have been attached to these scars.
    (3) Mr. Billings directed attention to the Protichnites and     Cli
mactichnites, which he thinks may now be referred to Crustacea,
belonging to the division Trilobita.
     (4) Finally, Mr. Billings described a section of a rolled-up Caly
mene senaria, the interior cavity of which appears to be full of
minute ovate bodies, from ºn to rºm of an inch in diameter. These
 small ovate bodies the author believes to be eggs.
     2. “ Note on the palpus and other appendages of Asaphus, from
 the Trenton Limestone, in the British Museum.”        By Henry Wood
 ward, Esq., F.G.S., F.Z.S.
     Mr. Woodward, when comparing the Trilobite sent over by Mr.
 Billings with specimens in the British Museum, presented by Dr. J.
 J. Bigsby, F.R.S., discovered, upon the eroded upper surface of one
 of these, not only the hypostome exposed to view, but also three
 pairs of appendages, and what he believes to be the palpus of one of
 the maxillae. This furnishes an additional fact to Mr. Billings's most
 interesting discovery, besides confirming its correctness.
     Mr. Woodward considers the so-called “Panderian organs” to be
 only the fulcral points upon which the pleurae move, and showed
 that such structures exist in most recent Crustacea.
     He considered that the evidence tended to place the Trilobita
 near to, if not in, the Isopoda Normalia.
     He remarked that the prominence of the hypostome reminded one
 strongly of that organ in Apus, and suggested that we might fairly
 expect to find that the Trilobita represented a more generalized type
 of structure than their representatives at the present day, the mo
 dern Isopoda.
     3. “On the Structure and Affinities of Sigillaria, Calamites, and
  Calamodendron.”      By J. W. Dawson, LL.D., F.R.S., F.G.S., Prin
  cipal and Vice-Chancellor of M'Gill University, Montreal.
     The object of this paper was to illustrate the structure and affi
  nities of the genera above named, more especially with reference to
  the author's previous papers on the “Structures in Coal” and the
  “Conditions of Accumulation of Coal,” and to furnish new facts and
  conclusions as to the affinities of these plants.
     Wih reference to Sigillaria, a remarkably perfect specimen of the

and Affinities of Sigillaria, Calamites, and Calamodendron.          385
axis of   a plant of this genus, from the Coal-field of Nova Scotia, was
 described as having a transversely laminated pith of the Sternbergia
type, a cylinder of woody tissue, scalariform internally and reticu
lated or discigerous externally, the tissues much resembling those
 of Cycads. Medullary rays were apparent in this cylinder; and it
was traversed by obliquely radiating bundles of scalariform vessels
or fibres proceeding to the leaves. Other specimens were adduced
to show that the species having this kind of axis had a thick outer
bark of elongated or prosenchymatous cells. The author stated
that Prof. Williamson had enabled him to examine stems found in
the Lancashire Coal-field, of the type of Binney's Sigillaria vascu
laris, which differed in some important points of structure from his
specimens, and that another specimen, externally marked like
Sigillaria, had been shown by Mr. Carruthers to         be more akin to
Lepidodendron in structure.        These specimens, as well as the Sigil
 laria elegans illustrated by Brongniart, probably represented other
types of Sigillarioid trees; and it is not improbable that the genus  Si
gillaria, as usually understood, really includes several distinct generic
forms.      The author had recognized six generic forms in a previous
paper and in his “Acadian Geology;” but the type described in the
present paper was that which appeared to predominate in the fossil
 Sigillarian forests of Nova Scotia, and also in the mineral charcoal of
the coal-beds.     This was illustrated by descriptions of structures oc
curring in erect and prostrate Sigillaria, on the surface of Sternbergia
 casts, and in the coal itself.
    The erect Calamites of the coal formation of Nova Scotia illus
 trate in a remarkable manner the exterior surface of the stems of
 these plants, their foliage, their rhizomata, their roots, and their
 habit of growth.     Their affinities were evidently with Equisetaceae,
 as Brongniart and others had maintained, and as Carruthers and
Schimper had recently illustrated. The internal structure of these
 plants, as shown by some specimens collected by Mr. Butterworth, of
 Manchester, and soon to be published by Prof. Williamson, showed
 that the stems were more advanced in structure than those of mo–
  dern Equiseta, and enabled the author to explain the various ap
 pearances presented by these plants when the external surface is
 preserved, wholly or in part, and when a cast of the internal cavity
 alone remains.     It was further shown that the leaves of the ordinary
 Calamites are linear, angular, and transversely wrinkled, and differ
 ent from those of the Asterophyllites properly so called, though some
 species, as A. comosus, Lindley, are leaves of Calamites.
    The Calamodendra, as described by Cotta, Binney, and others,
 and further illustrated by specimens from Nova Scotia and by
 several interesting and undescribed forms in the collection of Prof.
 Williamson, are similar in general plan of structure to the Cala
 mites, but, much more woody plants—and if allied to Equisetaceae,
  are greatly more advanced in the structure of the stem than the mo
 dern representatives of that order.       Specimens in the collection of
  Prof. Williamson show forms intermediate between Calamites and

386                         Geological       Society:—
Calamodendron, so that possibly both may be included in one family;
but much further information      on this subject is required.     The
tissues of the higher Calamodendra are similar to those of Gymno
spermous plants.     The wood or vascular matter of the thin-walled
Calamites consists of multiporous cells or vessels, in such species as
have been examined.
    In conclusion, a Table was exhibited showing the affinities of             Si
gillariae, on the one hand, through Clathraria and Syringodendron
with Lycopodiaceae, and, on the other hand, through Calamodendron
with Equisetaceae; while in another direction they presented links
of connexion with Cycads and Conifers.
   4. “Notes on the Geology of Arisaig, Nova Scotia.”          By the
Rev. D. Honeyman, D.C.L., F.G.S.
   The author referred to a previous paper on the Upper Silurian
 rocks of Nova Scotia, which he stated appeared to him now to be
generally repetitions of his Arisaig series. He noticed the occur
rence of fossils in one of the beds previously supposed to be almost
destitute of organic remains, and described the occurrence, in Arisaig
township, of a band of crystalline rocks which appeared to contain
Eozoon and were probably of Laurentian age.        A note from Prof.
Rupert Jones, giving an account of the fossils referred to by Dr.
Honeyman,       was also read.

   1. “Contributions to a knowledge of the Newer Tertiaries of
Suffolk and their Fauna.” By E. Ray Lankester, Esq., B.A.
   (1) The Suffolk Bone-bed and the Norfolk Stone-bed.—The author
pointed out that the recognition of the distinction of these two de
posits from the overlying shelly crags was an important step in the
determination of the history of these beds.    He combated the notion
that the Bone-bed and Stone-bed were identical in their contents,
and especially dwelt on the differences of the mammalian fauna found
in the two. The late Dr. Falconer's views, hitherto prevalent, con
sisting in regarding the fauna of the Suffolk Bone-bed, Norfolk
Stone-bed, and Forest-bed as           all
                                       one and the same history and
                                             of

   the Stone-bed     Forest-bed                                               a
different fauna from that indicated by the other mammals common
to  the Bone-bed and Stone-bed (Fauna 2), viz. Mastodon arvermen
sis, Equus sp., and certain forms             of
                                       Cervus (studied     Mr. Boyd    by
Dawkins). On the other hand, the Elephas meridionalis (Fauna 3),
occurring  in the Norfolk Stone-bed and    the Forest-bed, had never
                                                   in

        On the Newer Tertiaries of Suffolk and their Fauna.            387
been found in the Suffolk Bone-bed.        Mr. Lankester suggested that
the association of the first two of these three groups of mammals in
Suffolk, and of the second two in Norfolk, might be explained by the
hypothesis that they succeeded one another in time, the first (late
Miocene)being confined to Suffolk, and dating from before the Diestien
period, since he had obtained a Mastodon tooth of the M. tapiroides
form enclosed in a Diestien box-stone, the third having existed in
Norfolk at a period subsequent to the Coralline Crag, but before the
Norwich Crag was deposited, chiefly represented in the lower part
of the Forest-bed, but also in the Stone-bed, whilst the second
group of mammals had existed in both areas at an intermediate
period.    Mr. Lankester maintained that this was the explanation
suited to the facts as they at present stand, and considered that the
question was not one to be shirked.        All geological inferences from
palaeontology rest on what is called negative evidence, and hypo
theses must be used in investigation.      It was shown that the London
clay had contributed very little indeed to the number of mammalian
remains found in the Suffolk Bone-bed.          Six teeth of Coryphodon
and four fragments of Hyracotherium were all that could be found
in the various collections.
   (2) The Suffolk Bow-stones.—These nodules the author had pre
viously described as being the remains of a deposit approximately
similar to the Diestien or Black Crag of Antwerp, which had pre
ceded the Coralline Crag in Suffolk.       An enlarged list of remains of
Mollusca from these nodules was       given,   and a large series of spe
cimens collected     by the author was   presented    to the Society's Mu
seum. It was from the Diestien       beds,  containing   Conus Dujardinii,
 Voluta  auris-leporis,  Isocardia lunulata,  &c.,  that the Cetacean re
mains of the Suffolk Bone-bed were derived.
   (3)  A  new   Ziphioid Cetacean from the Bone-bed of Suffolk.-The
rostrum (described in detail) was in the collection of the Ipswich
Museum.       It indicated a Cetacean of the genus Choneziphius, differ
ing from C. planirostris of Cuvier and C. Cuvieri (of Prof. Owen's
recent Monograph) in having a solid projecting apex to the rostrum,
and no trace of a bifid structure.     Mr. Lankester had recently care
fully examined Cuvier's original specimens in Paris, and suggested
that possibly Chomeziphius planirostris, C. Cuvieri, this, and two
other Antwerp specimens are but varieties of one species, according
to age and sex. This form, however, was noted as Choneziphius
                                       i<U+017F>:
Packardi.
   (4) A new Mastodon from the                   Bone-bed.—A Mastodon
tooth, enclosed in Diestien matrix, and indicating a form with open
and clear valleys, had been obtained by Mr. Baker of Woodbridge,
and noticed by the author a year ago.           He had since, in various
collections, detected eight other fragments of a Mastodon, very di
stinct from M. arvernensis, and approaching M. tapiroides. Possibly
the fragments indicated more than one such distinct species.           The
condition of these specimens and other evidence tended to associate
them with the Rhinoceros Schleiermacheri, Hipparion, &c. forming

a fauna quite distinct from and older than that which was indicated
by Mastodon arvernensis.
   (5) List of Mammalian Fossils of the Suffolk Bone-bed, with refer
ence to Collections containing them, and Number of Specimens.—The
object of this list was to furnish an idea of the actual and relative
abundance of the various mammalia, and to afford those interested
in the matter information              as to the much-scattered                     materials     in
private collections.
    2. “ Notes on an Ancient Boulder-clay of Natal.”          By Dr.
Sutherland, Surveyor-General of the Colony.
    The author described the extensive occurrence in Natal of a
formation which he considered to present the essential characters of
Mr. Bain’s “claystone porphyry.” It consisted, of a greyish-blue
argillaceous matrix, containing fragments of Granite, Gneiss, Green
stone, Clayslate, &c., often of large size, exhibited ripple-markings
in some places, and in others showed a rude approach to wavy stra
tification.  It rested generally upon Old Silurian Sandstones, the
upper surface of which was often deeply grooved and striated. The
author regarded this deposit as an ancient Boulder-clay, perhaps of
Permian     age.
     3.   the Distribution of Wastdale-Crag Blocks, or ‘Shap-Fell
          “On

F.R.S., F.G.S.

general  distribution of the blocks of granite derived from    and                        it,

      ON THE MOLECULAR THEORY AND LAWS OF ELECTRICITY.
                BY L. LORENZ OF COPENHAGEN.
  In a paper on the mechanical theory of heat", M. A. Dupré has
given a lower limit for the number N of molecules contained in a
milligramme of water, namely
                                               N>          1.25 ×    10”;

of work which can be exerted by a certain quantity of electricity; for
the tension is diminished by a certain amount.     According to Weber
and  others, a milligramme   of water is  decomposed    by 107 units of
current in a  second,  and therefore by 107 units of electricity. If we
denote by N the number of molecules contained in a milligramme,
and by e the quantity of electricity which each must receive and give
up in order to be decomposed, then
                                 Ne= 107.
   Further, according to Bosscha, the electromotive force of a Da
niell's element in electromagnetic units (or, what is the same thing,
the tension of the positive pole of such an element whose negative
pole is connected with the earth) is equal to
                                 10258    x 10",
a number which may also be deduced from Favre and Silbermann's
experiments.    The decomposition of water requires a tension 1:46
as great; if this is denoted by P, we have
                                P=   15 ×     10°.
Let us suppose that the molecule of water has a tetrahedral arrange
ment, then
in which   3 is the distance of two adjacent molecules of water, and
the  quantity   of electricity e which a molecule has received must some
how have    spread    inside a spherical surface the diameter of which is 3.
The work e     corresponding      to this quantity of electricity will have now
 itssmallest value if   the   electricityis   uniformly diffused over the sur
face   of
        this  sphere;   for  any  other   arrangement  of the electricity would
require     an
             increased work. The tension           corresponding  to   this order
will be
and this magnitude must therefore         be
                                     smaller than the actual tension
Presulting from another distribution            of
                                        the same quantity       elec    of
tricity. Thus we get
                             2a’e        <
                                   -a-

     This limit to the number sought is eleven times                that           as great, and
for the distance 3 half as great as that found by Dupré. We readily
see moreover that the limit for N may be put higher, if we assume
that the quantity of electricity e is distributed on the surface of each
of the atoms of which a molecule of water consists. The same re
sult is obtained from the consideration of other more easily decom
posable bodies; and the same calculation made for oxide of silver
(AgO) shows that the limit for N may be put twenty-seven times
as great, and that for 3 one-third as great, if it be assumed that the
molecule of silver oxide contains two atoms, and that an equivalent
of silver oxide consists of the same number of molecules as an equi
valent of water.
   It seems remarkable also that while the quantity of electricity e of
a source of electricity P performs the work Pe, in a molecule with
the same quantity of electricity e and the same tension P only half

     The present memoir consists of five sections.
      In       the first     I    describe          the apparatus and the experimental
processes           I have    used.
        In
       the second                 I
                      give the results furnished by experiment in
operating upon a certain number of liquids very different one
from another.
   In the third I study the influence of variation of temperature
on the magnetic rotatory polarization of liquids.
   In the fourth I endeavour to determine the ratio which exists
between the magnetic rotatory power of a mixture of two liquids
and those of the ingredients of which the mixture consists.
   In the fifth I exhibit the result of the experiments I have made
upon the magnetic rotatory power of some isomeric liquids.

                                                 had sometimes to content
 myself with a shorter one, taking care, for the purpose of accu
 racy in the comparison, that in each case the length of the water
column should be the same as that of the liquid in question*.
I  started from the principle that the ratio between the angles of
 rotation is not affected by the absolute length of the liquid co
lumns, provided this be the same in the case of the two liquids
 compared.        Moreover this principle results from that established
 by M. Verdet in his beautiful researches on rotatory polarization,
in which he showed that the rotation is proportional to the
thickness of the substance submitted to the magnetic action,
provided that                   its
                        intensity remain the same even when the thick
ness varies.       Nevertheless       wished     Iassure myself to        direct               in   a

    It   results from this Table that the ratio between the rotations
for the lengths of 25 and 5 centims. is 1:22 for each of the four
 liquids—that is to say, the same, although the absolute magni
tudes of these rotations are very different; so that to obtain the
magnetic power of a liquid relative to that of water taken as unity,
 it is only necessary to give to the water column the same length
 as to the column of liquid operated upon, whatever the absolute
 length of the two columns.
     It follows also from the numbers contained in the preceding
 Table, that not much is gained by increasing the length of the
 path of the polarized ray through the liquid, since the magnetic
 force, as we have remarked, diminishes in proportion as the dis
 tance of the polar surfaces is increased in order to lengthen the
 liquid column. It is true that the increase and the diminution
  do not follow the same law, since a less rotation is obtained with
  short columns than with longer ones; but the difference is not
  very considerable.
     The increase of the magnetic force in proportion as the dis
  tance between the poles diminishes can be calculated.            In fact,
  knowing that, if the magnetic force were constant, the rotation
  would be proportional to the length of the liquid column, and
  consequently, for each of the liquids, the rotation corresponding
  to a length of 5 centims. would be one-fifth of that which corre
  sponds to 25 centims., we find that for water it would be 2° 16'
  instead of 9° 15', for alcohol 1954' instead of 7°45', for sulphide
  of carbon 6°6' instead of 27°, for iodide of ethyle 4° 50' instead
  of 19° 40'. On the other hand, knowing that the rotation is
  proportional to the magnetic force, we can easily determine how
  much this force has increased by the diminution of the distance
  of the poles from 25 centims. to 5 centims. We have only to
  take the ratio between the rotations such as they would be if the
  distance had not been diminished and the actual rotations with
  the distance of 5 centims. Now, for each of the four liquids,
  this ratio is 4:1, or rather a little less, about 4:08; which proves
  that by the reduction of the distance of the surfaces to one-fifth
  the magnetic force has only been increased to fourfold, at least
  with the apparatus I used : it is probable that with electromag

nets whose polar surfaces were smaller, the increase of distance
of those surfaces would produce a greater diminution of the
magnetic force.      Besides, this has been verified by M. Verdet
in his first memoir on magnetic rotatory polarization*, in which
he has established the two important laws we have mentioned,
namely:-the rotation of the plane of polarization is proportional
to the intensity of the magnetic action; and it is likewise propor
tional to the thickness of the substance through which the polarized
ray passes, the intensity of the magnetic action remaining constant.
  It seems to me that the phenomenon of magnetic rotatory po
larization might be usefully applied to determine the intensity
of the force existing between two magnetic poles, in what Fara
day calls the magnetic field. It would only be necessary to place
between the polar surfaces a liquid the coefficient of magnetic
rotatory polarization of which is known, taking care that the
tube containing it shall be hermetically closed at       two ends                                           its

should be the distance between the two polar surfaces; for it will
be remembered that, to avoid the influence of the glass disks,
each end of the tube containing the liquid entered about 1 cen
 tim. within one of the two soft-iron cylinders of the electro
magnet.
    Magnetizing by means of a Bunsen’s pile of 60 pairs, I ob
tained, under these conditions, with distilled water, a total rota
tion of 13°; with a pile of from 50 to 40 pairs, the angle was
only from 12° to 9°, according to the strength of the pile.
    I will now give the results at which I arrived by operating on
some liquids chosen as different as possible from one another.
                               Alcohol.
    Five series of experiments, each consisting of several compa
rative observations of rectified alcohol (sp. gr. 0.804) and water,
gave the following numbers:—
                 Alcohol.         Water.          Ratio.

    To give an idea of the differences presented by the consecu
tive observations of one and the same series, the numbers above
given being the means,    I here transcribe in detail those composing
the fifth. The first column indicates the azimuth of one of the
sensible tints, the second that of the other, and the third the
difference between these two angles, which represents the total
rotation. The observations upon water alternated with those on
alcohol; but it is easy to perceive that the intensity of magneti
zation did not sensibly vary during the experiment.

404        Prof.   A. De la Rive's   Researches on the Magnetic
                               Sulphurous Acid.
  I  made four series of experiments on liquefied anhydrous sul
phurous acid, taking care that the tube which contained it and
the disks which closed the tube should be sufficiently solid.     In
the first series the magnetization was effected by the current from
a Bunsen pile of 60 pairs, in the three others by that from a
pile of 40 or 50 pairs.    The experiments were singularly con
cordant.    Here is the result of the observations of each series:—
           Sulphurous acid.         Water.                  Ratio.
                   15 16             12 10                  1-246
                   13 40             11  0                  1.241
                   12 0               9 40                  1.241
                   13 40             11  0                  1-241
   Suspecting that the first result was due to the temperature of
the acid being lower, I took sulphurous acid at the temperature
of 4° or 5°, and obtained:—
           Sulphurous acid.       Water.                 Ratio.
                14°                11°                    1:272
   Then, the acid having attained the temperature of the room
 (12° or 13°), I again obtained 1241.
   A series of experiments made a few days afterwards gave again
the number 1:241; but the room becoming warmer, the ratio
was reduced to 1233; and at the end of the experiment it was
 1.207, the temperature of the room having risen to 20°C.
   These variations, so considerable for small changes of tempe
rature, are due to the great dilatability of liquefied anhydrous
sulphurous acid.    In fact we shall see in the next Section the
marked influence exercised by the temperature on the mag
neto-rotatory power of liquids—an influence connected with their
dilatability.
  I  think, then, we may, without sensible error, take the num
ber 1240 for the coefficient of the specific magneto-rotatory po
larization of sulphurous acid at 12°C.
   Sulphurous acid dissolved in water in sufficient quantity to
saturate   it gave:—
           Acidulated water.      Water.                Ratio.
                  129              110                  1:100
  We know that water dissolves fifty times             of itsvolume  ofgaseous
sulphurous acid.   Even under the pressure                  three atmospheres,
gaseous sulphurous acid presented      trace no  magneto-rotatory
                                                         of
polarization.
I    will only mention, without dwelling upon them, some expe
riments made upon other liquids, particularly the essences.
   The essence      of
                 orange and the essence      citron gave me only
                                                  of

                  Rotatory Polarization of Liquids.                   405
unsatisfactory results, on account of the difficulty experienced,
with those which have a natural rotatory polarization, in deter
mining the sensible tint. The essence of copaiba is more suitable
for experiment.      I  first determined the natural rotatory polari
zation of a column of this liquid 10 centims. long, and found it
to be 23° 30'. The analyzer, placed so as to give the sensible
tint without the action of the magnet, marked 124° 30'. Mag
                              I
netizing in one direction, recovered the sensible tint at 118°45';
magnetizing again in the other direction, I recovered the same
tint at 130°20': this gives for the double of the polarization
11° 35', that of water being 8° 45' in the same circumstances.
We thus obtain 1920 for the specific-polarization coefficient of
essence of copaiba.        It may be remarked that the two magnetic
rotations give angles sensibly equal (5° 45' and 5° 50'), to the
left and to the right of 124° 30', the azimuth of the natural sen
sible tint. It is not so with the essence of turpentine, the natural
rotatory polarization of which is greater. Starting from 145°40',
the angle corresponding to the natural sensible tint, we have,
according to the direction of magnetization, 14.1° and 151° 20',
which gives 4° 40' in one direction and 5° 40' in the other,
 together 10° 20' for the double of the angle of magneto-rotatory
polarization.     Now, the corresponding angle for water being
 8° 40', this gives 1.192 for the coefficient of the specific magneto
 rotatory polarization of the essence of turpentine.            I do not
attach much importance to this number, on account of the diffi
 culty of procuring essence of turpentine always of the same com
 position.
    The same remark applies to the creosote of commerce, upon
 which I made several experiments, but will cite only one; it gave
2-259 for the coefficient of specific magneto-rotatory polarization.

    We shall not at present discuss the results recorded in this
 Section; but we shall return to them at the end of this memoir,
 when we shall have more data for the deduction of consequences
 from them.
 § 3. Influence of Temperature on the Magneto-rotatory Polariza
                               tion of Liquids.
    According to some physicists, rise of temperature increases the
 magneto-rotatory power of solid bodies (of glass, for example);
 acording to others it diminishes that power.          It is probable that
 these  divergences    arise from the     inequalities  of the dilatation
 presented by solids, according to the direction in which they are
 observed—especially those which, like glass, have a structure
 which is not uniform.        For observations of this kind, liquids are

406             Prof. A. De la Rive's Researches on the Magnetic
much preferable to solids. on account of their dilatation being
equally uniform in         directions.        all those     which have        In       all               of             I

   Thus, then, as in the case of rectified alcohol, the diminution
which a rise of temperature occasions in the magneto-rotatory
power of iodide of ethyle and in that of amylic alcohol will be
proportional to the corresponding diminution of density. Of
these liquids, again, I determined the ratio between the densi
ties by means of the ratio between their volumes, at different
temperatures, as given in the Tables prepared by M. Isidore
Pierre”. The results obtained with alcohol are the most con
clusive, being derived from experiments upon a greater range of
temperature and at the same time more numerous. Neverthe
less both series indicate that, if the law to which they seem to
conduct is not absolute, it is at any rate very nearly accurate, at
least within the limits of temperature within which the obser
vations took place.        then,            If,                   we
                                      could strictly prove that the

     The preceding Table shows that, in the case of water, the
  magneto-rotatory power diminishes very regularly with the                  in
  crease of temperature—in particular, that the ratio between the

410           Prof.   A. De la Rive's                Researches on the Magnetic
magneto-rotatory powers at temperatures differing by 10° remains
sensibly the same, with a slight tendency to increase as the tem
perature rises.    But we do not find, as with those liquids on
which we operated at first, the ratios between the rotations equal
to those between the corresponding densities; the latter are much
less, especially at the lowest temperatures.          Thus, in water,
the effect of rise of temperature upon the magneto-rotation does
not depend solely upon the diminution of the density; it acts
independently, and the more in proportion as the absolute tem
perature is lower.     For example, the ratio between the density
at 40° and the density at 51° is 1:0048, while the ratio between
the densities at 10° and 21° (which, like the preceding, differ by
11°) is only 1-0017; and yet the ratio between the rotatory
powers is the same (1:008) in both cases; it should have been a
little less in the second than in the first. There must, then,
have been two factors in the influence of the temperature upon
the magneto-rotatory power—the one depending on the variation
of the density, the other on the temperature itself independently
of      its
       influence     the density—both factors acting
                             on                              the same                       in

§ 4.   Determination   of the Magneto-rotatory Power of the Mixture
                             of Two Liquids.
    I began   by mixing equal volumes of distilled water and rec
tified alcohol of sp. gr. 0.804. The magneto-rotatory power of
the mixture was obtained by means of two series of experiments,
made at two different periods, and which gave the following
numbers:—
                   Mixture.        Water.      Ratio.
                   11° 40'          129        0.972
    The magneto-rotatory power calculated as the mean of those
of water and alcohol is 0.938, that of water being 1-000, and
that of alcohol 0-876. The actual density of the mixture was
found to be 0.935; the density calculated as the mean of those
of alcohol and water would be 0.902. Now the ratio of the
real rotatory power to the calculated is 1.0362; and the ratio
between the actual and the calculated densities is 1.0365. Thus,
in a mixture of equal volumes of water and alcohol, which is ac
companied by a sensible contraction (proved by the increase of
density), the magneto-rotatory power augments in exactly the
same proportion as the density—which proves that the molecular
magneto-rotatory power does not change.          We have seen, in the
preceding Section, that it is the same with alcohol with respect
to the changes of density proceeding from variations of tempe
rature.     In taking a mixture of equal volumes of water and
alcohol,   I  chose that in which the change in volume is the
greatest; it is evident, then, that with mixtures in other propor
tions the same result would be found.
    The mixtures of water and sulphuric acid in different propor
tions gave very interesting results, which       I think deserving of
detailed   exposition.      This kind of   experiments  present some
difficulties, especially with concentrated solutions, on account of
the rapidity with which they attract humidity from the air, which
changes their identity; nevertheless this inconvenience may be
avoided by taking precautions.        In fact we have seen that mo
nohydrated sulphuric acid having a rotatory power of 0.750
 acquires one of 0.757 after one or two removals from one vessel
to another in the air,andone equal to 0.768 after a greater number.
    My first experiments were made with the Paris sulphuric acid,
of which the rotatory power is 0.800, and the density (taken

   I ascertained the magneto-rotatory power of each of these so
lutions; and I compared this real power with that calculated
by taking 0800 for the magneto-rotatory power of the pure acid
and 1.000 for that of water, taking account of the proportions
of water and acid in the mixture, and supposing that no change
of volume takes place by the act of mixing. I likewise deter

   This Table shows that, in solutions containing only a relatively
small proportion of acid or of water, the magneto-rotatory power
increases in the same ratio as the density. Thus the ratio of the
actual to the calculated power is 1.032 for the solution which
contains, in 10 parts by volume, l of sulphuric acid and 9 of
water; for the same solution the ratio of the actual to the calcu
lated density is also 1.032.    Similarly the ratio between the
actual and the calculated rotatory powers is 1:040 for the solu
tion which contains, in 10 parts by volume, 8 of acid and 2 of
Water; and the ratio of the actual to the calculated density of
the same solution is 1.045, or very nearly the same, only a little
higher.   But if solutions be taken which contain nearly equal
quantities of water and acid (such as those comprised between
8 tenth parts of water and 7 of acid, on the one hand, and 3
tenth parts of acid and 7 of water, on the other), then the ratios
between the actual and the calculated rotatory powers become
much lower than those between the actual and the calculated
densities; and this difference attains     maximum           its
                                                         the solu                 in
tion which contains exactly equal volumes        acid and water.   of
   As  tothe rotatory  powers   themselves,  the ratio between the
actual and the calculated power does not differ much from one
solution    another; yet
            to               increases slightly, but regularly, with

the concentration             of
                      the solution.
  It  seems      me that we may infer from these observations that
                 to
the combination of the acid and water diminishes the molecular
rotatory power, since the ratio between the actual rotatory power
ofa  certain volume       the mixture and the rotatory power

                                         Isomeric Liquids.
     M. Berthelot     had kindly given me, in the spring of 1869, a
 certain  quantity   of two isomeric liquids; but not having prepared
 them himself, he took care to tell me that he did not guarantee
 their perfect purity.         They were ethylvaleric ether and amyl
acetic ether, both having the general formula C*H*O4.                  Sub
 mitted several    times,   and at different   periods,  to experiment, the
 second always exhibited a stronger magneto-rotatory power than
 the first.    The most accurate experiments gave 0.877 for the
 specific magneto-rotatory power of the first, and 0.895 for that
                                         I
of the second. When wished to compare their rotatory powers
with their densities,              I
                             was much embarrassed on account of the
difficulty of ascertaining these densities.            Thus, according to
 M.   Delffs,  the  density    of amylacetic   ether is 0.863 at 10°, and
according to M. Kopp 0.8837 at 0°. The density of ethylvaleric
ether      is,
            according        M. Delffs, 0-870
                                 to                   13°5, and according

    I have excluded one of the series of experiments, which gave
results, for the three liquids, very different from those furnished
by the five series from which the above Tables were constructed;
yet the numbers found agreed very well, as to their ratios, with
those resulting from the respective means of the three Tables:
they were, for acetate of amyle 0-893, for valerate of ethyle 0.858,
and for butyrate of isopropyle 0.853.            I can only attribute this
difference (which only occurred once) to the very high tempera
ture (more than 30°) at which these last-mentioned experiments
were made. But if this series be introduced into the three Tables,
the mean becomes for the acetate 0.902 instead of 0.904, for the
valerate 0-877 instead of 0-879, and for the butyrate 0-862
instead of 0.864: these numbers would then express the specific
magneto-rotatory powers of the three liquids respectively.                  I
prefer, however, to adopt the former ones.
    In either case it follows from the preceding experiments that
the three isomers have sensibly different magneto-rotatory
powers—the butyrate a lower power than the valerate, and the
valerate a considerably lower one than the acetate, as I had
º:
      I
   * ought to remark that I had not sufficient liquid to give the columns
a length of 10 centims.      Those of acetate of amyle and butyrate of iso
         were each 6 centims., and that of valerate of ethyle only 53
centims. long. Of course the water column was always of the same length
as that of the liquid with which it was compared.

It is probable, as have remarked, that these differences are con
nected with the mode of molecular grouping—which is not the
same in the three substances, as is shown in M. Wurtz's che
mical formulae above given. The boiling-points, too, follow the
same order as the rotatory powers: that of the acetate is 138°,
that of the valerate 133°, and that of the butyrate 128°.     On
the contrary,  the densities do not seem to have any influence on
the phenomenon; for that of the valerate (0.894) is greater than
that of the acetate (0.880), though it is true that the density of
the butyrate is the least of the three.      It ought to be remarked
that the valerate of    ethyle  has a rather strong natural rotatory
 power, 1° 30'        length      for                          10
                                    centims. this property does not

their elementary composition, have not the same magneto-rota

little.  This difference does not        appear      have any connexion       to is
with their different     densities,  but rather with the difference                                        of
their boiling-points; for,          each group

compose it—account being taken of the proportion of each in
the mixture, and of the alteration of density, in this case very
small. On the contrary, when the proportion of acid or of
water is more than two tenths, the rotatory power increases in a
much less proportion than the density, proving that the combi
nation diminishes the molecular magneto-rotatory power.     It is
true that in this case there is a strong chemical action, as is
proved by the great disengagement of heat.               I am disposed to

                       have been anticipated by Professor Cayley,

Philosophical Magazine in 1859 (S. 4. vol. xviii. p. 264). An
exact knowledge of the first elements of physical geography,
however, is so important, and loose notions on the subject are
so prevalent, that I have no hesitation in sending you what you,
I hope, will have no scruple in rejecting if you think it superfluous
after what has been done by Professor Cayley.

    1. ON CoNToUR-LINEs                      AND   MEAsurEMENT of HEIGHTs.
    The results of the survey of the surface of a country are most
conveniently exhibited by means of a map on which are traced
contour-lines, each contour-line representing the intersection of
a level surface with the surface of the earth, and being distin
guished by a numeral which indicates the level surface to which
it belongs.
    When the extent of country surveyed is small, the contour
lines are defined with sufficient accuracy by the number of feet
above the mean level of the sea; but when the survey is so ex
tensive that the variation of the force of gravity must be taken
into account, we must adopt a new definition of the height of a
place in order to be mathematically accurate.            If we could de
termine the exact form of the surface of equilibrium of the sea,
                                                                                          we

                                                             of   a  might
draw    a normal      this surface from the top           mountain, and
                                                                      of
                                                                       a
call this the height                of
                             the mountain. This would             perfectly          be
 definite   inthe case when the surface       equilibrium
                                                        of     everywhere       is
convex; but the lines         equal height would not
                                     of                    level surfaces. be
    Level surfaces are surfaces          equilibrium, and they are not
                                                   of
 equidistant. The only thing which            constant  is  the amount     is                  of
 work required       rise from one
                      to                another.    Hence the only con

place, and defining every other level surface by the work required
to raise unit of mass from the standard station to that level
surface.   This work must, of course, be expressed in absolute
measure, not in local foot-pounds.
   At every step, therefore, in ascertaining the difference of level
of two places, the surveyor should ascertain the force of gravity,
and multiply the linear difference of level observed by the nu
merical value of the force of gravity.
   The height of a place, according to this system, will be defined
by a number which represents, not a lineal quantity, but the
half square of the velocity which an unresisted body would
acquire in sliding along any path from that place to the standard
station. This is the only definition of the height of a place con
sistent with the condition that places of equal height should be
on the same level.          If
                         by any means we can ascertain the mean
value of gravity  along the line of force drawn from the place to
the standard level surface, then, if we divide the number already
found by this mean value, we shall obtain the length of this line
of force, which may be called the linear height of the place.

   Let us begin with a level surface entirely within the solid part
of the earth, and let us suppose it to ascend till it reaches the
bottom of the deepest sea.     At that point it will touch the sur
face of the earth;  and if it continues to ascend, a contour-line
will be formed surrounding this bottom (or Immit, as it is called
by Professor Cayley) and enclosing a region of depression.      As
the level surface continues to ascend, it will reach the next deep
est bottom of the sea; and as it ascends it will form another con
tour-line, surrounding this point, and enclosing another region
of depression below the level surface. As the level surface rises
these regions of depression will continually expand, and new ones
will be formed corresponding to the different lowest points of
the earth’s surface.

  unstable in others.
                           On Lines  of Slope.
     Lines drawn so as to be everywhere at right angles to the con
 tour-lines are called lines of slope.    At every point of such a line
 there is an upward and a downward direction.         If  we follow the
 upward direction we shall in general reach a summit, and if we
 follow the downward direction we shall in general reach a bot
 tom. In particular cases, however, we may reach a pass or a bar.
                          On Hills and Dales.
     Hence each point of the earth's surface has a line of slope,
 which begins at a certain summit and ends in a certain bottom.
 Districts whose lines of slope run to the same bottom are called
 Basins or Dales. Those whose lines of slope come from the same
 summit may be called, for want of a better name, Hills.
    Hence the whole earth may be naturally divided into Basins
 or Dales, and also, by an independent division, into hills, each
point of the surface belonging to a certain dale and also to a
certain hill.
                   On Watersheds and Watercourses.
    Dales are divided from each other by Watersheds, and Hills
 by Watercourses.
    To draw these lines, begin at a pass or a bar. Here the
 ground is level, so that we cannot begin to draw a line of slope;
 but if we draw a very small closed curve round this point, it will
 have highest and lowest points, the number of maxima being
 equal to the number of minima, and each one more than the
index number of the pass or bar.         From each maximum point
 draw    a line of slope upwards till it reaches a summit.        This
will   be a line of watershed.   From each minimum point draw a
line   of slope downwards till it reaches a bottom.     This will be a
line of Watercourse.       Lines of Watershed are the only lines of
 slope which do not reach a bottom, and lines of Watercourse are
the only lines of slope which do not reach a summit. All other
lines of slope diverge from some summit and converge to some
bottom, remaining throughout their course in the district be
longing to that summit and that bottom, which is bounded by
two watersheds and two watercourses.
    In the pure theory of surfaces there is no method of determi
ning a line of watershed or of watercourse, except by first find
ing a pass or a bar and drawing the line of slope from that
point.     In nature, water actually trickles down the lines of slope,
which    generally converge towards the mathematical watercourses,

though they do not actually join them; but when the streams
increase in quantity, they join and excavate courses for them
selves; and these actually run into the main watercourse which
bounds the district, and so cut out a river-bed, which, whether full
or empty, forms a visible mark on the earth's surface.       No such
action takes place at a watershed, which therefore generally re
mains invisible.
   There is another difficulty in the application of the mathema
tical theory, on account of the principal regions of depression
 being covered with water, so that very little is known about the
positions of the singular points from which the lines of water
 shed must be drawn to the summits of hills near the coast.         A
 complete division of the dry land into districts, therefore, requires
 some knowledge of the form of the bottom of the sea and of lakes.

The number of watercourses will be the same.

   The magnitude of the solar image in the refractor, or, in other
words, the focal length of the object-glass employed, plays a very
prominent part in the entire method of observing the protube
rances.   It follows directly from the theory developed in a former
part of this paper, that with one and the same spectroscope the
contrast between the protuberance and the general ground is
dependent upon the width of the slit alone. But now, as with a
constant width of the aperture a so much greater part of the pro
tuberance is seen at once the smaller the image of the sun                                                                       is,

pressure upon the piston, whatever it may be. That this opi
nion, however, is wrong is evident from this, that if the pressure
of the gas were always equal to the external pressure put upon
it by the piston, the gas would never yield and be condensed by
the descent of the piston, but would continue to sustain                                            it.    It

                             as it supplies a means of ascertain
ing resistances for a wide range without using a set of resistance
coils, it being necessary to have only one resistance-coil of known
value.
   A condenser, charged from a constant battery, is discharged
through a galvanometer of known resistance, shunted with an
unknown resistance w; a known resistance a is then added to
the shunt, and the discharge again taken. Assuming the de
flections of the needle to be proportional to the quantities of cur
rent, it is required to determine the value of the resistance w, and
also   its
         shunt-power.

      As this method  does not involve direct completion of the bat
tery-circuit, it is adapted to the determination, more especially, of
the resistances of liquids which are subject to electrolysis.
      If
      the galvanometer-needle be deflected when the terminals
are immersed in a liquid, it may be brought to zero in the ordi
nary way.     Such a current will not interfere with the results, so
long as it acts without interruption.
   In these cases, and also for the measurement of the internal
resistance of batteries, a +a, together with the liquid should be
inserted as a shunt, and a afterwards varied by a known quantity.
   When measuring the internal resistance of a battery-cell, it
may be necessary to insert a small but known resistance between
 its
   poles,        so
                  diminish the action

the cable   core are available for simultaneous operation. With

be put to earth, when        required, by an attendant stationed      at
that end.
   The coil or shunt of known value should be, preferably, equal
to that of the conductor of the cable.         The battery-power re
quired must depend on the resistances of the fault and conductor
of the cable. The resistance of the conductor must be carefully
ascertained.
   In  the case of iron-covered cables, it will be difficult to connect
the ends of the cable to the galvanometer terminals without          in
terfering with the zero-position of the needles.           The needles
may be deflected by a current set up between the copper con
ductor and the iron sheathing of the cable, or even by the tanks
themselves.
   When the resistance of the fault is low, the deflected position
of the needle may be taken as zero, or the needle may be set to
zero by the aid of other magnets.        Care must be taken that the
electromotive force of this current shall be insignificant when
compared with that of the testing-battery.
   Supposing the resistances of the galvanometer and conductor
to be known, and the two ends of the cable to be led into the
testing-room, the connexions will be made alternately as shown
in figs. 1 and 2.

Tert-books     of Science.—The      Elements of Mechanism.      By T. M.
   Goodeve, M.A.,         Lecturer on    Applied  Mechanics at the Royal
   School of Mines.        London :   Longmans,   Green, and Co.    1870.

Thismerely is the first published of a series of Text-books designed not
                 as school books, but as elementary treatises which,
while strictly scientific, shall exhibit the practical applications of the
theories they expound.         The Series will comprise about sixteen
volumes; and though several are announced as “nearly ready,” some
time will probably elapse before the whole is completed.
   It is rather unfortunate that the first published of the series, how
ever excellent in itself, should be a new edition, and not a completely
new work, as we understand the remaining volumes of the series are
to be. But though a new edition of a work first published in the year
1860, it is by no means a mere reprint, but has been rewritten and
greatly enlarged. In fact it contains nearly twice as much matter as
the first edition.      The general arrangement and scope of the two
are the same, the enlargement being effected by the expansion of
some articles, and the insertion of additional articles here and there.
Thus:–The introduction has been expanded from seven to eighteen
pages. In the first edition there is an article (156) on Hooke's joint;
this is given almost unchanged in art. 171; but there is added an
article of nearly equal length (172) on the effect of interposing a
double joint between the axes. The articles on the parallel motion are
nearly the same in the two editions; but in the present an additional
article (130) gives a brief account of the modification required to
adapt the parallel motion to an engine worked by both a high- and
a low-pressure cylinder; and so on in other cases.
   It need scarcely be added that great improvements are hereby         in
troduced.      The work is written with great clearness and a thorough
knowledge of the subject; and though essentially a treatise on a
particular branch of Geometry, it will be readily intelligible to a
reader possessing no more than a very moderate acquaintance with
abstract mathematics.        Its purely elementary character has rendered
necessary a certain want of system in the arrangement; but a reader
who has mastered its contents will find it an excellent guide for
making out the complicated arrangements of machinery actually in
use. Should the succeeding volumes of the series preserve the same
practical and elementary character, they will be most useful aids to
scientific education.

        “On the Theory of Continuous Beams.”        By John Mortimer
Heppel, M. Inst. C.E.                                                -
   In venturing to  present  to the Royal Society a paper on a subject
which has engaged the attention, more especially in France, of some
of the most eminent engineers and writers on Mechanical Philosophy,
the author feels it to be incumbent on him to state the nature of the
claim to their attention which he hopes it may be found to possess
in point of originality or improvement on the method of treatment.
   To do this clearly, however, it will be necessary to advert to the
principal steps by which progress in the knowledge of this subject has
been made, both in France and in this country.
   The theory of continuous beams appears to have first attracted at
tention in France about 1825, when a method of determining                                                        all

                                            by
fectly exact for the assumed conditions, was objectionable from the

these equations a second set of unknown quantities (“inconnues auri
liaires”), being the inclinations of the deflection-curve at the points
of support, and, not having arrived at a general method of eliminating
these latter, was obliged to operate in each case on a number of
equations equal to twice the number of spans.        M. Clapeyron does
not appear, as yet, to have made any formal publication of his method,
but to have used it in his own practice, and communicated it freely
to those with whom he came into contact.
    In 1856, M. Bertot, Ingénieur Civil, appears to have found the
means of eliminating this second set of unknown quantities n+1 in
number for a bridge of n spans, and thus reducing the number of
equations to n—l.
    Each of these equations involved as unknown quantities the bend
ing-moments over three consecutive supports, and was considered,
from    itsremarkable symmetry and simplicity,        merit    distinctive         to                    a
name, that       “The Theorem

    The next important advance was made           1861, when M. Bresse,    in

to investigate the nature       the curves which are the envelopes

 an Imperial Commission was formed,              which        was   ofmember,         he                 a

of the structure.

his work entitled ‘Théorie de la Résistance et de la Flexion Plane
des Solides &c.,’ Paris, 1862, gives a very complete demonstration—
resulting in an equation which in one point of view is slightly more
general than that of M. Bresse, as it takes in variation of the moment
of inertia of the section from one span to another. In another point
of view      its
              generality      slightly less, is       deals only with loads as   it
distributed over each separate span uniformly, whereas M. Bresse
replaces the simple algebraical terms expressing these                  definite                             by
integrals expressing the load            function

   Prof. Moseley’s work was altogether           most valuable contribution

                                                            as        as    con                                    is
cerned,      no
              doubt furnished the     groundwork         the method applied           of

                                                       of
difficult    cases.
      The first    case which engaged the attention      Mr. Pole appears             of                                 to
 have been that         the of
                             bridge  over the Trent      Torksey, consisting          at
of   two  spans         of
                      continuous tubular beams,        resting      abutments                           on
 and    acentral pier.      For special reasons       had become necessary       it
 that the real conditions         equilibrium      this bridge should
                                                  of                       ofin                                     be
 vestigated with more than ordinary precision; and this Mr. Pole did
 by   amethod virtually identical with that           M. Navier, though          of                                      it
 does not appear that         had any previous knowledge
                                        he                       that method,                      of

 uniformly over             its
                        entire length, whereas Mr. Pole had           deal with                          to
 the case    of
              different loads                       on
                                    the two spans, and,         doubt, had                        no                     to
 devise the method                 of
                             analysis necessary for         treatment.      Mr.            its

   As far       this went, however,

Pole had to investigate the case of a much larger work, the Britan
nia Bridge, where he had to deal with some new conditions, which,
as far as the writer is aware, were then for the first time successfully
treated.
   These were that, besides variation of load on the different spans,
their cross sections also varied, and there was imperfect continuity
over the centre pier—that is to say, the points of support being
supposed to range in a straight line, the beam if relieved from                                                                all

these new circumstances; and                                  by    its
                                          means results were obtained
certainly true within    very small limit, and

   It therefore appears that the amount of variation in the section
and load which occurs in each span of the Britannia Bridge, when
taken strictly into account, produces scarcely any effect on the
values of the bending-moments and deflections, which are practically
the same as those resulting from their mean values considered as
constant; and it may be considered demonstrated that, for most
ordinary cases of large bridges, calculations founded on equation
(26) may be confidently relied on.       It need scarcely be remarked
that these are much more   simple  and  easy than those founded on the
more exact but complex equations above given.
   In smaller bridges, however, the error of the approximate process
will be more considerable, and the process above given may be ap
plied with advantage to     correction.               its

Mr. Heppel's method.
   The cross section of the whole girder and the load on a given
span being uniform, the definite integrals of the formulae (1) take the
following values:—

section).   Taking the same unit as a basis, the electromotive force
of a Bunsen's element is equal to 21, and of a Daniell's equal to 12.
Hence the electromotive force of a Leclanché's element is only 0.896
that of a Daniell’s, while from Leclanché's determinations * it is said
to be l'38 as great as that of a Daniell's.
   This difference (1.38 against 0-896) may be easily explained. With
out galvanic polarization the electromotive force of such an element
should be equal to that of a Bunsen's cell (compare my Lehrbuch der

 ON THE MELTING OF LEADEN                                      PROJECTILES BY THEIR IMPACT
      UPON AN IRON PLATE.                                      BY EDUARD HAGENBACH.
   At the commencement of the present year experiments were made
at Basle with the view of using targets of iron instead of wood in
practice with firearms.   Strong plates of iron were, on this oc
casion, fired at from the short distance of 100 paces. Conical
bullets by their impact against the iron plate produced a scarcely
perceptible indentation, and fell down near the target; at the same
time the lead projectile was melted to a very considerable extent.
This could be recognized by the fact that, around the point where the
ball had struck, the plate was spattered with lead in the form of
a white star, that, moreover, the melted lead was found in the vici
nity, and that, of the original bullet, which weighed 40 grammes,
only the comparatively small portion of 13 grammes remained. This
residual part exhibited a very peculiar kind of deformation and inver
sion, as may be seen in figs. 1 and 2. Fig. 1 gives the section of
