      HE diffraction of a circular a erture has for a long time
         attracted the attention of piiysicists, on account of its
intimate connexion with the theory of optical instruments.
 For a point source of light, the problem was treated by Air '1'.
 Schwerd I, and Lommel§ ; the last-mentioned author has
 brought our knowledge of the subject to the highest state of
 perfection, both with regard to Fraunhofer's and Fresnel’s
diffraction phenomena. For practical purposes, however, it
 is necessary to modify the problem slightly, and investigate
 the diffraction due to a. <U+FB01>nite source of light. In connexion
with the resolving power, or for the explanation of drop
formation during the transit of inferior planets, the problem
was treated by Lord Rayleigh I], André 1i, Struve "", and
 Strehl T‘I'. In the present paper I give, in the <U+FB01>rst place, a

2    Prof. H. Nagaoka on the Difraction Phenomena in the
general discussion of Fraunhofer’s diffraction-phenomena of a
circular aperture for a <U+FB01>nite source of light, and show how
the intensity of illumination in the focal plane can be mecha
nically evaluated for a luminous source having any given
shape. I then pass to the consideration of the intensity both
inside and outside of a circular image ; further, it will be shown
how, by the superposition of two systems of lines of equal
intensity we can explain the formation of a ligament during
the ingress or egress of a dark disk from a luminous source,
as veri<U+FB01>ed by the experiments of Andre and Angot *.
             1. General Ewpression for the Intensity.
   It is well known that a circular aperture gives rise to a
diffraction pattern which, for a point source of light, consists
of concentric rings surrounding the image of the luminous
point.    If, instead of a luminous point, we have a <U+FB01>nite
source of light, each element of the source will produce
similar phenomena ; the illumination in the focal plane of the
telescope is thus the integral effect of the source of light
extending over a given geometrical area. The intensity of
the image of a uniform source is not of a simple character,
but, as observed in the focal plane of the telescope, will be
 distributed according to a certain law depending on the
 shape of the source and the size of the aperture.
    Let the circular opening of the telescope be taken for the
 plane of my, and denote the cosines of the angles which the
 incident ray makes with avg-axes by a, 18, and those for the
 diffracted ray by a', ,8'; then, putting R=radius of the
 telescope-aperture, 7t=wave-length of light,
                 T: 2»
we know that the intensity of the di<U+FB01>’racted light in the focal
 plane of the telescope is proportional to
                              Jlgt")
                                 ’37
 where J1(r) is a Bessel function of the <U+FB01>rst kind and of order 1.
 If the source of light be not a geometrical point, we must
 consider a, B as variable in <U+FB01>nding the illumination at points
 corresponding to a', B', and sum the effects due to all the

and the diffracted ray.            It is to be remarked that for
7t=0'589 a, r=l, and A=l", R=1'93 centims. Thus, ex
pressed in polar coordinates, 1', t9, the present problem reverts
to the evaluation of

the integration extending over the whole luminous source.
The intensity of illumination at 01', B' in the focal plane is
consequently given by

K being a constant to be afterwards determined.

    Before entering into further discussion, it will be worth
 while to examine the term J09(r)+J1’(r), which enters into
 the expressions for the intensity of the diffracted light.
 Although the values of J0*(r) and J19(r) are in themselves
 oscillating, the sum of these two functions presents a remark
 able aspect, as will be easily seen by representing it as a
 curve,

    In the <U+FB01>rst place, the curve is con<U+FB01>ned to the positive part
 of the ordinate ; further, the relation
               J09(.z') + 2J1’(.r) + 2.129(w) + . . . = 1
 shows that y cannot be greater than 1, which it will attain
only for 02:0.

   From the nature of the roots of J1(.z) =0, we see that these
points occur at nearly equal intervals of the abscissae little
greater than n.
   In addition to these, we <U+FB01>nd another series of in<U+FB02>exion
points given by the equation                                    '

of the second set. The above considerations show that the
in<U+FB01>exion-points of the second set lie nearly midway between
those of the <U+FB01>rst set, the approximation becoming closer
for increasing values of w. Further, we conclude that the
curve has neither maximum nor minimum (excepting the
point .z'=0, y: 1), but has an in<U+FB01>nite number of in<U+FB01>exion
points (of the <U+FB01>rst set) where the tangents are parallel to

simplest manner. It shows that the curve is to the '<U+FB01>rst
approximation a rectangular hyperbola,
                                    “_‘,   0   .~ .   .   .           I

if a: be not small.    To the second approximation, we have to
                        cos 2.2:
introduce the term W, which gives the curve an undu
lating appearance ; the e<U+FB02>'ect of the third and fourth terms is
still smaller, so that for practical purposes it is suf<U+FB01>cient to
assume the mean curve to be an hyperbola, as it is very
tedious to push the calculation to the fourth decimal place.
To show the difference in 3],, calculated from (B) and (D), I
give the following table :—
   ¢1= 3-832,      y1=0'1622 by (B),      y1=0-1661 by D).       vuuA
   $2: 7-016,      y2=0'0921 ,,           y2=0'0907         “~54
   w3=10'l73,      y3=0'0624 ,,           93:0'0626
   m,=l3'324,      y,=0-0477 ,,           y4=0‘04725
Thus the coincidence becomes closer with increasing values
of .z'.
         4. Intensity at the Centre of a Circular Image.
    Equation (II. a) shows that the intensity of light at the centre
of a luminous disk as seen through a telescope is given by
                      1(1‘) = 1—J02(")—J12(1‘)
                            = 1—y.
    If the disk be divided by a series of concentric circles of
radius an into a number of zones, whose breadth is equal to
the difference between the successive roots of J1(.z~)=0, we
<U+FB01>nd that the illumination at the centre due to each of these
zones is given by the height of the corresponding step in
the curve y=J02(m)+J1’(:/v). The diminution in the height
of these steps, with increasing x, shows that the effect of the
zone of nearly the same breadth varies almost inversely pro
portional to its distance from the centre. The same reasoning
will apply to a circular sector.
    The following table gives the intensity at the centre of the
luminous disk whose radius is equal to the root of Jl(r)=() :—

   It will be seen from the table that the effect of the <U+FB01>rst
zone is <U+FB01>ve times greater than all the rest combined. Thus
the illumination at the centre of a disk of small radius will
not sensibly differ from that of in<U+FB01>nite extent. For values
of r less than r, we have the following table :—

    These two tables enable us to integrate mechanically the
 expression (IL),
            I = 2%!(81020‘0) +Jl?(7‘0) —J02(r1) —J12(r1))1l9,
for a source of any given shape.                        About a point at which the
intensity is sought, describe a number of concentric circles
dividing the region of integration into a series of zones
whose breadths are equal to the differences between the
successive roots of J1(r)=0. If the angle subtended at the
point by these zones be kn0wn, we can, by summation of
these separate e<U+FB02>'ects, <U+FB01>nd the intensity at the required point.
If the luminous source subtend several seconds of arc, the

10   Prof. H. Nagaoka on the Di<U+FB01>'raction Phenmnena in the
value of r will be a large quantity. Thus, if the boundary
does not show great irregularities, we can approximately
assume the bounding edge to be straight for contiguous
zones. If the mean angle an subtended by the zone at the
given point be found, the intensity

   We notice that for the <U+FB01>rst zone, I('rl)—I('r0)=0'8378,
while for all the rest 1(rw) —-I(rl) =O'1622 ; it is thus neces
sary to subdivide the <U+FB01>rst zone into a series of subsidiary
zones and sum their effect as for the other zones, for which
the second table will be of use. In addition to this, we shall
have to add a small correction for a few zones near the given
point, inasmuch as we multiply the height of the step by the
arithmetical mean of the bounding angles of zones, instead of
taking some other proper value of an, which will leave no
error during the mechanical integration. The calculation of
the correction will be simpli<U+FB01>ed by assuming the zones in
the manner above described.
           5. Intensity at the Rim of a circular Disk.
   We have already seen how the intensity at the centre of' a
circular disk can be calculated ; we shall now proceed to the
discussion of the intensity at the rim of the disk, and then
obtain the result for a general case, when the point lies inside
or outside the disk.
   Let the radius of the circular source be a; then the dis
tance of a point on the periphery of the circle will be
                              1': 2a cos 9.
   The intensity at the rim r=0 is given by

integral under the form

 The above integral shows that the intensity at the rim
 approaches the value 1}, as the radius of the disk is inde<U+FB01>nitely
  increased.
      We have already seen how J02(r) +J12(r) can be expanded
  in ascending as well as descending powers of r. For values
  of 1' smaller than w, the semiconvergent series cannot be
  used, while for values of r somewhat greater than at, it is
  disadvantageous to use the the ascending series. We shall,
  therefore, have to divide the integral into two parts : namely,
 one extending from O to $1, for which the expansion in
 ascending powers of r should be used; and from x, to 2a, for
 which the semiconvergent series should be employed.
      It is to be noticed that the variation of J02(r) +J1’('r) is
 very small in the neighbourhood of r=.z'1, so that it would be
 advantageous to <U+FB01>x the limit ofintegration at 1'=w1(= 3'8317),
 in order to diminish the error in integration.

   The formula given above applies only to points far from
the rim of the circular image. The most interesting case
connected with the present problem is the investigation of the
intensity in the very neighbourhood of the rim, where the
well-known phenomenon of drop-formation makes its ap
pearance. As the semiconvergent expansion for J09(p)
 +J12(p) is no longer allowable in the vicinity of the rim, we
must have recourse to another method of integration for that
portion of the region, where J09(p) +J1’(p) must be expanded
according to ascending powers of p.
   We shall divide the region of integration into two parts by
describing a circle with radius a, about the point 0 <U+FB01>gs. 5

procedure.

  the rim towards the centre ; and from that for I,, the decrease
  takes place very rapidly as we pass from the rim outwards.
  Thus the variation of intensity is greatest near the rim, but
  the change does not take place abruptly; the intensity fades
  away gradually in the neighbourhood of the rim, as illustrated
  in the accompanying diagram " (<U+FB01>g. 9).             The full line is for
  a=w , and the dotted line for a=4().
     The image of a luminous disk, as seen through a telescope,
  is thus not sharply de<U+FB01>ned at the geometrical rim, where the
  change of intensity takes place continuously. It' the intensit
  for the limit of visibility be less than 13, the image of the disk
  will appear to a slight extent broadened.
                       7. Lines of Equal Intensity.
     For practical purposes it is sometimes convenient to draw
  the lines of equal intensity. For a circular source of light
  they consist of a series of concentric circles, which, if drawn
  for equal difference of intensity, crowd together near the
 geometrical edge.
     When there are di<U+FB02>'erent sources of light we can superpose
  the separate e<U+FB02>'ects and graphically represent the distribution
  of illumination in the following manner :—
     Draw the lines of equal intensity for the image of each
  source; at the point of intersection of any two lines the
  intensity will be the sum of the two. We thus obtain a
  system of points of equal intensity. By drawing the lines at
  small intervals we can obtain a su<U+FB01>icient number of points to
  draw curves of equal intensity, which will represent the
  distribution of illumination due to different sources. In
 fact, the process of drawing the lines of equal intensity is
 analogous to that of drawing equipotential lines.
     Suppose that the luminous source is a circular disk, on
 which there is a small dark circular space touching the rim of
 the disk. The image, as seen through a telescope, will form
 a drop, as the following consideration of the lines of equal
 intensity will show.
     We can imagine such a source to be produced by the super
 position ot' two different sources, one of which consists of a
 circular disk of uniform intensity without any dark space,
 while the other consists of a circular disk occupying the place
 of the dark space, and of such an intensity that it is equal but
of opposite sign.        This consideration immediately gives the

   For the latter purpose we draw the concentric circles
representing lines of equal intensity for the luminous source,
and similar lines of equal negative intensity for the imaginary

described we get a series of lines of equal intensity due
to these sources. In the annexed diagrams (<U+FB01>gs. 10 and 11)

                              is, however, a little elongated, and
                              assumes a pear-shaped appearance;
                              while the external dark space bulges
                              out towards the luminous source.
                              The change is only transient; with

                              the external dark space vanishes.

          II. Relative Motion of the Earth and Ether.
                    By WILLIAM SUTHERLAND‘.
r ‘HE experiment of Michelson and Morley, described in
      the Philosophical Magazine [5] xxiv. p. 449, has created
quite a dilemma in the physics of the aether; for while the
great body of general evidence tends to show complete inde-_
  endence of the aether near the earth on the earth’s mot1on,
this celebrated experiment has been supposed to prove de<U+FB01>
                   * Communicated by the Author.

24              Mr. W. Sutherland 0n the Relative
nitely that the earth’s surface and the adjacent azther have no
relative motion. I propose now to show how a slight altera
tion in the point of view of the theory of that experiment will
make it appear that, until a special adjustment for sensitive
ness of the optical apparatus has been made, it is not com
petent to decide as to the relative rest or motion of earth and
aether.
   For the sake of clearness let us brie<U+FB02>y repeat the authors’
account of the theory of their experiment along with their
diagram. b and c are two mirrors at right angles to one
another (<U+FB01>g. 1), and at equal distances D from a a piece of
                                               Fig. 1.

 glass inclined at 7r/4 to them, and intended to divide a beam
 of light sa into re<U+FB02>ected and transmitted parts goingto b and
 0 respectively.   SuppOSe the whole apparatus to be moving
 in the direction so with velocity 2; relative to the eether in
 which the beam of light is moving with velocity V; then
 while the re<U+FB02>ected beam is going to b and back a is moving
 to a,, so that the path of the re<U+FB02>ected part is abal, while that
 of the transmitted part is acalz at al the former is partly
 transmitted and the latter partly re<U+FB02>ected to the telescope
 under conditions favourable to the occurrence of interference.
    Along ac the beam moves with velocity V— 1: relative to 0,
 so that the time of traversing ac is D/(V—v) ; similarly the
 time for cal is D/(V +0), and hence
                                             I         1   2D
         ac+ca1-DV (v_v + V +1)                          1—0237?
 The path of the other beam is taken to be abal, whose length

                 Motion of the Earth and Ether.                25
is evidently 2D(1+v9/V*)t, so that with omission of the third
and higher powers of v/V the difference between acal and aim,
can be set down as Deg/V9. If v is the velocity of the earth
in its orbit, then if the whole apparatus is turned through 7r/2
 the longer path becomes the shorter, and vice versd : so that
 the difference of path which occasioned the interference-fringes
in the <U+FB01>rst position is altered in the second by 2DvQ/V2, which
 ought to produce a di<U+FB02>'erence in the position of the fringes in
 the telescope. And this motion of the fringes is what Michel
 son and Morley found not to occur, even after they had given
 the apparatus a sensitiveness which they supposed to be quite
 adequate to its accurate measurement, minute as is vQ/VQ,
 namely about 10‘“. Hence the startling conclusion that the
 relative motion of earth and tether must be small compared to
 the earth’s orbital velocity, in short that the earth drags the
 eether with it.
    In the supplement to their paper Michelson and Morley
 (p. 460) show that the angle which ab makes with the mirror
 at b is more strictly v/V-t-vg/2Vi, while ca, after re<U+FB02>exion
 makes an angle with the normal to b which is more strictly
 'v/V—‘l’e/2V2, so that the two rays which are to interfere after
 passing a, are inclined at an angle vQ/VQ to one another. This
 is of no importance in the actual experiments, because to get
 interference-bands of a convenient width it is necessary to
 have the rays inclined at a much larger angle than this,
 though still at a very small angle, which is obtained by slight
 derangements of the mirrors and plate from the ideal ma
 thematical positions assigned to them in the theory of the
 experiment.
    To ascertain what really happens with the two interfering
 rays, let us take a small area of plane wave equal to the area
 of the pupil of the observer’s eye, and take its image in b as
 it appears immediately after re<U+FB01>exiou at a, and let us take the
 image of its transmitted part after re<U+FB02>exion at c and a1 ; then
 if the whole apparatus and aether were at rest, and the angles
 were all exactly as supposed, we should have the two images
 coincident as represented in section at AB (<U+FB01>g. 2).
    Now suppose that by slight derangement the images are
 separated as in OD and EF. Fringes now appear whose
 width depends on the angle COE. When the images coin
 cided they represented coincident trains of waves with double
 illumination along their path. If the derangement, which
 separated the image AB into tWQ, left them still parallel,
 there would be only circular fringes visible in any plane
parallel to them, and only a uniform resultant central illumi
nation to an in<U+FB01>nitely small eye moving along a normal,

 between the separated images is equal to half a wave-length

                            Q    P     R
 of the light employed. Thus, then, while the images are
 parallel no straight fringes can be seen, and the effect of
 varying the distance between the images is to cause motion
 among the circular fringes. Returning now to the case of
 a symmetrical angular separation of the images as at CD and
 EF, we see that the central bright fringe (really dark in the
 actual experiments because of the opposite conditions of re
 <U+FB01>exion of the two beams) will be seen anywhere along OP;
~and the next may be said to be approximately along the line
 GH (and only approximately straight), at such a distance
 from O that GH is equal to X, the wave-length. Thus the
 interval between the fringes PQ is approximately given by the
 equation
                       PQ=7t/2 tan COA.
 For brevity we will con<U+FB01>ne the discussion to two-dimensioned
space, that is, to straight-line waves travelling in a plane.
   Next let the relative motion of the aether and the apparatus
cause the separation of the images contemplated b Michelson
and Morley, namely by a distance s=Dv’/V2, w ich is also
accompanied by the angular rotation of the two images through
og/2V’ in opposite directions; but when COA is large com
pared to vQ/V2 this last effect can be neglected. Suppose,
then, that CD is moved to C’D’ so that OO’=s, and let (J’D’
cut EF in L. It seems to be assumed by Michelson and
 Morley that the locus of the central fringe moves along to
LB, so that
OM=PR=LM/tan 00A=./2 tan GOA, and                  PR=PQs/7t;
and therefore that the whole system of fringes is moved late
rally by the same fraction of the width of a fringe as s is of 7t.

 Now this can be true only if the images are symmetrical with
 respect to L, or it' each wave-front is absolutel uniform in
 character. But in dealing with wave-fronts of ight in con
  nexion with interference we must be careful to conjoin the
  eti'ects of parts only of identical origin, as, for instance, that

      But in the actual experiments it is practically impossible to
  secure that the two images intersect in a point that corre
  sponds to itself as L does. In general we must assume that
 the two images C’D’ and EF intersect under the conditions
 represented in the next diagram (<U+FB01>g. 3), where O in EF and
 O’ in C’D’ are images of the same point in the original wave
 front.
     Let OO'=c; then if T is any point at distance x from 0

 value of a: which determines a pair of corresponding points
 so that they are e uidistant from a point whose polar coordi
 nates relative to ((1) and OB are r and 9. Denote the angle

In this equation <U+FB01>rst suppose that

 28             Mr. W. Sutherland on the Relative
 either p=0 or a=0. The case of 12:0 is of no interest, and
 with 0:0, a=O we have the case of absolutely coincident
 images with no fringes at all. Thus the case with c—2pa=0
 and 0:0 can be dismissed, and we have to consider next
 c—2pa20 and 9:0, which amounts to this, that at the pars
 ticular position of P given by p=c/2a and 9:0, both of each
 pair of corresponding points are nearly equidistant from P, so
 that both of each pair of corresponding disturbances reach
 this position of P in the same phase. In this case there is
 one point p=c/2a and g=0 which stands nearly in the same
 sort of symmetry with respect to the two images as 0 does
 when 0' and O are identical. \Ve will return to this as a
 special case after we have studied the general case in which
 0—2pm is not equal to zero. Here we have

Let the state of ali'airs we have been discussing so far be that
in which there is no relative motion of the apparatus and the
aether, so that the want of coincidence of the two images is
due entirely to experimental imperfection ; and now suppose
the apparatus to acquire its velocity a relative to the eether,
the e<U+FB01>'ect of which is to shift C'D' relatively to EF in the
manner contemplated by Michelson and Morley. Let us
suppose the shift to be the simplest possible, namely, that of
C’D’ parallel to itself to GH through a distance OK :8 = Dvz/Vi'
along the normal to AB, and let GH intersect Eb‘ in L, which
is now to be regarded as a new origin. a has not been
altered by the shift, p has been increased by OY=s/2, and g
has been diminished by YL=s/2 tau a=s/2a. nearly; thus then

Therefore if c is large compared to 212a the shift of corre
sponding points is only a small fraction of that (er/20:) con
templated by Michelson and Morley for the fringes. Now to
see how the consideration of corresponding points bears upon
the problem we have only to remember that each wave-front
propagates itself normal to itself, and that therefore the best
interference effects are to be sought along the normal to AB
which is equally inclined to the normals to the two image
waves ; if we <U+FB01>x our attention on two small elements of the
image waves around two corresponding points, we see that
their most vivid interference effects will be along the normal
to AB which is at distance (.z-+ 0/2) cos a, or nearly .r+c/2
along AB from O. In order that 9, which is .z‘(c—2pa)/c
 + (c—2pa)/2, should be nearly this .r+c/2, the fraction 2pa/c
is to be small, or c is to be large compared to 2,101, which is
the condition just found in order that the shift of corresponding
points should be small compared to that of the fringes sought
by Michelson and Morley. If the eye of the observer is
placed in OZ (<U+FB01>g. 3), that is if q=0, then x: -c/2, and in
the whole system of possible fringes there is along OZ a
peculiar central region characterized by a certain symmetry;
but at the same time to an eye placed anywhere the central
band in its <U+FB01>eld may be characterized by maximum clearness,
yet it will have none of the peculiar character of the one abso
lute symmetrical central one. To an eye placed anywhere the
central band in its <U+FB01>eld is at such a point that the mean dis
tance from equal corresponding areas of the two images is the
same; and according to what we have just seen if the one
image is shifted through a distance s along the normal to the
mean position of the two images, then the position of corre
sponding points is only changed by the small fraction
2pa/(c—2pa) or 2pa/c of s/2a, and therefore the fringes will
    seen in the eye to move approximately only the small
fraction 2pa/o of the expected s/2a. If things were adjusted
so that the absolutely central region of the fringes appeared
in the eye, then just as in <U+FB01>g. 3 0 moves to L, the complete
shift s/2a of the central region would be observed ; but this
adjustment would be a tedious business.
   In the <U+FB01>nal experimental arrangements the simplicity of the
scheme given in <U+FB01>g. 1 was somewhat departed from, because
each half of the ,divided beam was re<U+FB02>ected backwards and
forwards four times along its initial path in order to increase
the effective value of D ; the images were brought into
apparent coincidence and so adjusted that 2a was such as
gave fringes of convenient width; but 0 was quite unknown
and might be large compared to 2pa, or say 2Da, without

  30         Relative Zlfotion of the Earth and Ether.
 detection, because while a was adjusted for by reason of the
necessity of making the fringes of convenient width, there
 was no adjustment for making 0 zero, beyond the comparatively
 rough one of causing images of an object to coincide apparently,
 and therefore on the average a may be assumed to be large
 compared to 2pm. The case in which 0 becomes not very
 different from 2pa has already been partly discussed in the
extreme form when c=2pa, a relation which we saw makes
.1 indeterminate. When c—2pa is small but not zero, since
 :0: -c/2+_qc/(c—-2pa) we can, by keeping q small, also keep
 .1: as near —c/2 as we please, so that the central region of the
 fringes is still peculiar and characteristic.   In this case the
approximation given for .21'—.r in (5) is no longer of use;
and we must reason in the following way, that before the
 shift (<U+FB01>g. 3), the central region will lie along OZ, and after
the shift along a parallel to Z through L, so that the system
 of fringes shifts as expected by Michelson and Morley; in
short, when q is small we are observing near the central fringe
which moves the full s/2a.       Thus we see that while an im
proper use of the formula (6) might make it seem as if we
could get in<U+FB01>nite magni<U+FB01>cation of the effect looked for in the
experiment, in reality the shift s/2a of the fringes is the largest
practically obtainable, and can be secured only by making
either 9 nearly equal to 0, or as we saw before (<U+FB01>g. 2) 0:0 ;
while if c is allowed to be larger than 2;»: the shift may be
any fraction of this maximum. In other words, the shift
expected by the experimenters can be obtained in only two
cases: <U+FB01>rst when the intersection of the two images corresponds
to itself, in which case the eye may observe anywhere; and
second, when there is a lateral shift of one image relative to
the other, and the eye is in the axis of quasi-symmetry OZ.
If the contention here advanced is sound, it appears that the
failure of Michelson and Morley to get evidence of the
relative motion of earth and aether is due to the absence of a
certain adjustment required to give their method the sensitive
ness aimed at, and not to any real defect in the theory of the
experiment. Their method has been since applied to other
attempts to measure motion of the aether, as in Lodge’s
experiment with the whirling steel disks (Phil. Trans. clxxxiv.
1893), Threlfall and Pollock’s on the Effect of Routgen Hays
(Phil. Mag. [5] xlii.), and Henderson and Henry’s (Phil.
Mag. [5] xliv.) on the Motion of Ether in an Electromagnetic
Field; in all these experiments only negative results have
been obtained. But it is to be remembered that in the last
three the two parts of the divided beam are sent in opposite
directions round the same path, whereas in Michelson and
Morley’s experiment the two beams travel in independent

              '1‘1'unsmission of Radiant Heat by Gases.             31
 paths: now in the former case if the two beams travel D
 between separating and meeting, and meet again at an angle
 20:, then the linear separation of corresponding points may be
 taken as 2aD, which amounts to the same as our 2ap, and hence
 the conditions are such as favour the degree of sensitiveness
 expected by Michelson and Morley; while in their own experi
 ment, as each of the separated beams is re<U+FB02>ected <U+FB01>fteen times
 in its own independent path there is opportunity for a con
 siderable lateral shift of the one beam relative to the other
 when they meet, although both are adjusted as nearly to
 parallelism as is necessary, that is to say that cis independent
 of 201p, and the sensitiveness of the system of fringes is
 unknown, but in all probability small compared to that
 expected. In their celebrated repetition of Fizeau’s great
 experiment on the effect of running water on the aether
 Michelson and Morley got their well- known positive result,
 but in this case the divided beams were sent in opposite
 directions round the same path, so that the optical arrange
 ment had the sensitiveness expected. It is the use of multiple
 re<U+FB02>exion along di<U+FB01>'erent paths in the experiment on the
 relative motion of earth and aether that introduces the possi
 bility of comparatively large lateral shift.
     1f the argument in this paper is correct it ought to be
 possible by careful adjustment for the requisite smallness of
 c, or for getting the absolute central band into the <U+FB01>eld
 of view, to give the Michelson and Morley apparatus the
 sensitiveness desired for measurement of the relative motion
 of earth and aether; and in any case an experimental examina
 tion of the e<U+FB01>'ect of lateral shift seems desirable.

   III. The Transmission of Radiant Heat by Gases at Vm-ying

       EFORE describing my own investigations on the trans
         mission of heat by gases, I shall refer brie<U+FB02>y to the
 classical work of a somewhat similar nature by MM. Dulong
 and Petit early in the resent century. Their memoir
 entitled “Researches on t 0 Measure of Temperatures, and
 on the Laws of the Communication of Heat,” gained the
 prize voted by the Academy of Sciences in 1818. A trans_
lation of this important paper may be found in the ‘ Annals
of Philosophy,’ for February, March, April, and May, 1819.
   1* Communicated by the Author, having been read before the American
Association for the Advancement of Science, August 10, 1897.
                 \

 32          Mr. C. F. Brush on the Transmission of
    In their researches on the “Communication of Heat,”
 Dulong and Petit used as the cooling body a very large
 thermometer bulb <U+FB01>lled with mercury ; and as the recipient
 of the heat, a large copper bulb 0r “balloon” about three
 decimetres in diameter, in the centre of which the ther
 mometer bulb was placed. The copper balloon was coated
 with lamp-black on the inside, and kept at any desired con
 stant temperature by means of a water-bath or melting ice.
 The thermometer tube was of such length as to bring the
 zero of the scale outside the balloon; and the thermometer
 was adapted to be removed, heated, and quickly replaced,
air-tight. The balloon was connected with an air-pump
 capable of rapidly exhausting itdown to about two millimetres
pressure ; and also with a gas-holder from which it could be
quickly <U+FB01>lled with the gas whose cooling properties were to
be determined. The rate or “velocity” of cooling of the
thermometer bulb was, deduced from observations of the
falling temperature at equal intervals of time.
   \Vith this apparatus Dulong and Petit made many carefully
conducted experiments at differences of temperature between
the thermometer and balloon ranging as high as 300 degrees;
and with several different gases besides air, ranging in
pressure from atmospheric to two millimetres. From the
results of" these experiments they deduced several laws of
cooling which they held to be general in their application.
They sharply divided the cooling into two parts; that due to
convection—~the actual contact of the surrounding cooler gas
renewed by its own currents,and that due purely to radiation—
the same as would occur in an “absolute vacuum.” They
derived a constant value for the latter, and values for the
former varying with different gases and different pressures.
They generally used the thermometer bulb naked, with its
natural vitreous surface, but sometimes they silvered it.
While this radical change in the character of surface greatly
changed the loss of heat due to radiation, it apparently had
no effect on that due to convection. They also tried ther
mometers with different-sized bulbs; and again, various
shaped vessels, <U+FB01>lled with various liquids surrounding a small
thermometer bulb, were tried as the cooling body.     None of
these changes affected the general laws of cooling which they
had deduced. But they did not try a smaller copper balloon.
Had they tried a very small one they would have found some
of their generaldeductions untenable.
   MM. Dulong and Petit devoted a lengthy chapter to the
discussion of the cooling of bodies in vacuo. But they fell
into the grave error of deducing the behaviour of the last few

         Radiant Heat by Gases at Varying Pressures.           33
millimetres of gas from that of the rest. In this way they
arrived at the following “Sixth Law : "—
   “ The cooling power of a fluid diminishes in a geometrical
progression when its tension itself diminishes in a geometrical
progression. If the ratio of this second progression is 2, the
ratio of the <U+FB01>rst is 1'366 for air ; 1'301 for hydrogen ; 1431
for carbonic acid; and 1'415 for ole<U+FB01>ant gas.”
   My own observations show that this law can be approxi
mately true only in the case of a large balloon; and at
pressures from a few millimetres upward. There is no
suggestion of it when a small balloon is used ; and at small
pressures it does not obtain with either large or small balloons.
   I <U+FB01>nd that in a small balloon the cooling e<U+FB01>'ect of the last
millimetre of air is nearly ten times as great as that of all the
rest, up to atmos heric pressure, combined.
   It was through misplaced con<U+FB01>dence in their Sixth Law
that Dulong and Petit were led to place a value on the rate
or velocity of cooling in vacuo, something like a hundred per
cent. too high, as I‘ shall show later; and as they derived
the cooling values of gases by deducting the cooling effect
of a vacuum from the total cooling observed, all their values
for cases are much too low. These large errors vitiate
much of their otherwise excellent work, and render the
numerical values of the ratios given in the Second and Third
Laws extremely doubtful.
   Other experimentalists also have studied the transfer of
heat by air and other gases at various pressures. Kundt and
Warburg (Pogg. Ann. 1874-5) and Winkelmann (Pogg.
Ann. 1875—6) observed that the rate of heat transmission
remained substantially constant through a long range of
diminishing pressure; and then decreased with further ex
haustion.     But as they made no measurements of pressure
below one millimetre (1316 millionths of atmospheric pres
sure), their results have no quantitative value for low pressures.
    Crookes, in his paper “On Heat Conduction in Highly
Rare<U+FB01>ed Air (Proc. Roy. Soc. 1880), described a similar
 experiment in which he carried the pressure measurements as
low as 2M. (two millionths). From the fall in the rate of
heat loss which occurred between the pressures of 760 milli
metres and l millimetre, and 5 M. and 2 M., he concludes:
“ We may legitimately infer that each additional diminution
 of a. millionth would produce a still greater retardation of
 cooling, so that in such high vacua as exist in planetary space
 the loss of heat—which in that case would only take place by
 radiation—would he exceedingly slow.”

    In this conclusion Sir Wm. Crookes was, I think, wrong.
.[ <U+FB01>nd that the curve representing the rate of cooling does
not break down materially at pressures as low as a twentieth
of a millionth.
    My own investigations on “The Transmission of Radiant
Heat by Gases at Varying Pressures” form a part of a
general study of the properties of high vacua, in which I
have long been engaged, and which is yet far from being
 completed.
 ' In the course of my work it became necessary to know
 how much of the heat communicated b a good radiating
 bod at ordinary temperatures, to a neig 'bouring body at a
slightly lower temperature, through an intervening gas, is
 transmitted by the so-called aetller, and how much by the gas;
 and whether any of that transmitted by the gas is com
 municated otherwise than by the process of convection. Also
 why, and to what extent, do the gases di<U+FB02>'er from each other
 in their heat transmitting capacities.
     In the drawings herewith, Plate I. is a diagram of the
  apparatus used in my experiments. A is the thermometer
  whose cooling was observed. It has a very open scale
 divided into two-tenths degrees C. The zero-point is placed
 a long distance (about 170 millimetres) above the bulb, for
  obvious reasons. The bulb is cylindrical, about 20 millim.
 long and about 7 millim. in diameter, and is coated with
  lampblack applied witha very thin alcoholic solution of shellac.
  After several hours’ baking at 100 degrees in a good vacuum,
  this bulb ave constant radiation results. The thermometer
  is suspen ed by a platinum wire, with its bulb in the centre
  of the large pear-shaped glass bulb B, about 112 millim.
  in diameter. The stem of the thermometer hangs freely
  in the long neck of the large bulb.       I shall hereafter call
  the glass bulb B, the “large radiation bulb,” or simply the
  “large bulb,” to distinguish it from a smaller one used later.
  The bulb B is surroun ed by a copper tank 0, lagged with
  woollen cloth, and <U+FB01>lled with crushed ice and distilled water.
  A wire netting 0' serves to keep some of the ice always
  below the lowest point of B. The tank 0 is movable on
  vertical guides, whereby it may        uickly be raised to, or
  lowered from, the position shown, t us exposing the bulb B
  alternately to the ice-hath and the atmosphere of the labo
  ratory. The bulb B communicates freely with the large
  barometer-tube D, which is used for measuring all but very
  small pressures. E is a standard boiled barometer, dipping
  into the mercury-cistern F, common to both barometers.
  G is a McLeod gauge giving very accurate measurements of

          Radiant Heat by Gases at Varying Pressures.          35
 small pressures, and H is a drying-bulb containing phosphorus
 pentoxide.     The glass stopcock I serves to admit other gases
 than air, and is of course made absolutely tight when closed.
 The mercury valve K prevents any leakage backward from
the pump when the latter is stopped 'during observations.
Exhaustion is effected by an automatic Sprengel pump
having <U+FB01>ve fall tubes. L is a <U+FB01>ne cathetometer placed in
axis isofadapted
front      the whole  apparatus,
                  to read                        on barometers,
                                 and b rotationboth
                           the McLeodygauge,         its vertical
and the thermometer. It has a vertically divided scale with
vernier and microscope, for reading the barometers, and a
micrometer for reading the gauge. A watch N is mounted
close beside the thermometer on a sliding frame, so as to be
easily kept in the <U+FB01>eld of view of the cathetometcr telescope
when the latter is used to observe the falling temperature.
   Before using this apparatus I always exhausted to a good
vacuum, and heated the bulb B by means of a water-bath, and
all other vacuous parts by means of an air-bath, to 100 degrees
for several hours.      This was found necessary in the <U+FB01>rst
instance with air, in order to divest the inner glass surfaces
of that portion of their coating of adherent as most easily
given off in a vacuum. This gas was pumpef out ; and not
being rincipally air, was not largely re-absorbed when air
was a mitted. Without this precaution I was unable to
obtain constant results at very low pressures. When other
gases were tried successively, the preliminary heating pre
vented gas from one operation attaching itself to the glass
and remaining to contaminate the succeeding gas at very
low pressures.
   I next introduced the proper gas up to atmospheric pres
sure, and made a preliminary cooling of the thermometer by
raising the ice-tank O.     This preliminary cooling was found
to have a slight effect on the readings next following, and
was done to make the <U+FB01>rst set of readings on any day
entirely comparable with the others. I then lowered the
ice-tank, and when the temperature had risen to 18 degrees,
stirred the ice and water thoroughly, raised the tank again,
and observed the thermometer through the telescope—noting
by the watch N the instant when the falling mercury passed
each degree of the scale. Then, with the ice-tank still up, I
noted the pressure by measuring with the cathetometer the
difference in height of the barometer columns in D and E.
The barometer D showed that the gas in the radiation bulb
cooled nearly to zero with very great rapidity when the ice
tank was raised.       I always measured pressures with the
radiation bulb cold.       It was usual to repeat the whole

36           Mr. C. F. Brush on the Transmission of
operation to con<U+FB01>rm results before reducing the pressure by
the pump.
    Observations were thus made at pressures varying from
atmospheric down to the best vacuum obtainable. In some
instances many series of observations were made at varying
pressures all within the last millionth.    The gauge could be
 relied upon to measure these small pressures with very great
accuracy. But it was dif<U+FB01>cult to maintain them long at any
 exactly constant value on account of the continual, though
 slight, evolution of gas from the glass of the apparatus.
    As I desired only comparative results, no correction was
 made for the probable slight inequalities in the callibration
 of the thermometer ; nor for heat conducted to or from the
 bulb by the stem; nor for the change of zero-point due to
 changing external pressure. The mercury fell exactly to
 zero at atmospheric pressure, and about one-<U+FB01>ftieth of a
 degree lower at no pressure. The pressure error due to
 differences of capillary depression in the two barometers was
 ascertained at high exhaustions, and found nearly constant.
  It was always corrected. The different gases used were care
 fully prepared and dried, and were introduced quite free from
 any admixture with air.
     My observations have extended over a long period, and
 are far too voluminous to be recorded here in detail. But I
 have embodied their most salient features in a series of
 curves which render them readily apparent to the eye. In
 these curves the abscissae represent the pressure, and the
  ordinates represent the rate of heat transmission through the
  gas, from the thermometer bulb to the ice-cold envelope.
  The rate of transmission at any particular pressure is expressed
  by the reciprocal of the number of seconds required for the
  temperature to fall through a given number of degrees. For
  convenience of scale all the reciprocals are multiplied by 500.
     Pl. II. shows the curve for air. The heavy line represents
  the rate of coolin   from 15 degrees to 10 degrees.      It is in
  three sections, A, , and C. Section A embraces the whole
  range of pressure from nothing to atmospheric; section B
  embraces the range of pressure from nothing to ‘01 of atmo
  spheric ; and section C embraces the range of pressure from
  nothing to “0001 of atmospheric, 2'. e. 100 M. (one hundred
  millionths). Atmospheric pressure is taken at 760 millim.
  Thus it will be seen that section B is the last hundredth of A,
  magni<U+FB01>ed a hundred times;         and   section 0 is    the last
  hundredth of B, magni<U+FB01>ed a hundred times. The cross
  section paper on which these curves are drawn is 50 centi
  metres wide ; hence if the curve were completed on the scale

         Radiant Heat by Gases at Varying Pressures.          37
of B, it would be 50 metres long; and if completed on the
scale of C, it would be <U+FB01>ve kilometres long.    This magnifica
tion of the abscissae without change of the ordinates enables
us to study every part of the curve with ease. The small
circles represent the points in the curve established by ob
servation. These points are shown exactly as found, without
any attempt to smooth out rough places in the curve. The
same is true of the curves of other gases. The heavy dotted
line parallel with the base represents that portion of the total
heat transmission due to the tether ; while all above it repre
sents that due to the air.
   Starting at the left-hand end of section A, representing
the rate of heat transmission at atmospheric pressure, we
observe that the curve drops regularly at a rate faster than
the diminution of pressure, during 95 per cent. of the whole
range of pressure from atmospheric to zero. Beyond this
point the rate of heat transmission remains substantially
constant, as shown by section B and the latter part of A,
down to a pressure of about '0003—a range of nearly ninety
nine and a half per cent. of that remaining. Here the curve
suddenly begins to drop again, and falls steadily, as shown
by section C and the latter part of B, until it meets the act-her
line at the zero of pressure.
   Under the curve A I have drawn curves with <U+FB01>ner lines
representing the rate of heat transmission at smaller differ
ences of temperature between the thermometer and ice-bath.
As before stated,A represents the cooling from 15 degrees to
10 degrees.     On the same scale a represents the cooling
from 9 degrees to 6 degrees; aa from 6 degrees to 4 degrees;
and aaa from 3 degrees to 2 degrees. Now, Newton’s law
of cooling requires that the rate shall vary directly with the
difference of temperature between the cooling body and the
surrounding medium. While this law is known to be incor—
rect for large differences of temperature, it is generally
accepted for very small differences. If it were correct under
the conditions of the present experiment, then the ratios of
the times required for the temperature to fall through the
several ranges above indicated, would all equal unity, and the
curves A, a, aa, aaa would coalesce. But they are ver
far from doing this.     It will be observed that all of these
curves preserve their relative values very closely indeed,
until they approach the point of pressure where the curve A
reverses itself; then they begin to bunch themselves very
much closer together, especially the lower ones, and shortly
reach a greatly reduced, as well as varied ratio of values
which they retain substantially unchanged to the end, as

             Mr. O.    Brush on H)? Transmission of
shown in connexion with section 0. To avoid confusion of
lines I have omitted the secondary curves corresponding with
section B.
    Pl. 111. shows the curves for carbon monoxide. This gas
was chosen for com arisen with air, because its absorptive
power for radiant eat is ninety times greater, while its
speci<U+FB01>c heat is almost exactly the same. The principal curve,
representing the rate of heat transmission from 15 degrees
to 10 degrees, di<U+FB01>ers very little from that of air. It s ows
a slightly better rate than air at very small pressures; not
quite so good a rate as air at intermediate pressures ; and the
same rate at atmospheric pressure. But the curves a, aa,
aaa, representing equivalent amounts of cooling at smaller
temperature di<U+FB01>'erences, are materially unlike those of air.
At high pressures they have about the same ratio values as
with air; but the ratio diminishes much less at intermediate
and low pressures ; that is to say, the curves remain further
 apart. It is equally noticeable that the curves aa, aaa
retain their full relative ratio values at low pressures, while
 with air they nearly coalesce.
    Pl. IV. shows the curve for ethylene. It was thought that
 this gas might transmit heat more rapidly than air, because
 of its much higher speci<U+FB01>c heat. But it does not do so.
 Its curve has the same form as those of air and carbon
 monoxide. It transmits heat nearly as well as air at atmo
 spheric pressure. but not nearly so well at intermediate
 pressures. At a very few millionths, however, it conducts a
 tri<U+FB02>e better than air. The curves a, aa, and aaa have the
 same characteristics, and about the same ratios, as those of
 carbon monoxide.
     Hydrogen was next tried, on account of its very low co
 ef<U+FB01>cient of viscosity, as well as its very high speci<U+FB01>c heat.
 Pl. V. illustrates the hydrogen curve on the same scale as
 the others. While in general form it resembles the air curve,
 all the ordinates are immensely increased. It is noticeable
 that the intermediate section B of the curve lies much nearer
 A than (J, quite different from its relative position in the
 curves of the other gases. This section of the curve shows
 that hydrogen retains about two-thirds of its initial heat
 transmitting power at a pressure nearly two hundred times
 smaller than does air. The curves A, a, aa, and aaa have
  something like the same ratios as they have in the cases of
 carbon monoxide and ethylene. In general, it may be said
  of hydrogen in the large radiation bulb, that it transmits heat
  nearlv four times as fast as air at atmospheric pressure ; more
  than LWIOG as fast at a very few millionths, and more than

          Radiant Heat by Gases at Varying Pressures.            39
seven times as fast through a long range of intermediate
pressures.
    As evidence of the accuracy of the observations on which
 the curves thus far described are based, it is gratifying to
 note that the vacuum, or aether line, locates itself exactly the
 same in all.
    In making the above-described observations I looked for
 some change in the whenomena when the exhaustion reached
 the point at which t 0 mean free path of the gas molecules
 equalled the distance between the thermometer bulb and the
 cold walls of the enclosing globe. This should have been at
 a pressure of about two millionths. No such change was
 observable, however, in any case.     Partly in pursuance of the
 same idea, I resolved to repeat some of my exueriments,
 using a very much smaller radiation bulb. This I expected
 would also reduce that portion of the total cooling effect due
 to convection currents. I accordingly employed the bulb or
 tube P (Pl. I.) in my further experiments. This is made
 from a thin glass tube slightly less than 20 millimetres internal
 diameter, and in it hangs the same thermometer A which
 was used before.      In transferring the thermometer, great
 care was taken to avoid any disturbance of the coating of
 lampblack on its bulb. At b is a contraction of the tube P
 to prevent
 of          the thermometer
     the tube.                 bulbbswin
                 The contraction             ing against
                                       is, l(however,    the larger
                                                      much   inside
 than the thermometer stem, so that normally the latter does
 not touch it. The thermometer bulb hangs exactly in
 the centre of P, near its bottom, and is separated from it by
 a space of a tri<U+FB02>e more than six millimetres—almost exactly
a quarter of an inch ; instead of two inches, as in the case of the
“large bulb.” The tube or bulb P, I shall hereafter designate
the “small radiation bulb,” or simply “small bulb,” to dis
 tinguish it from the large one.
    Pl. VI. shows the curve for hydrogen, with the small bulb.
 It differs radically in size and form from that obtained with
 the large bulb: Section A, instead of drooping rapidly with
 decreasing pressure, maintains almost its full value through
 out. Section B starts with nearly double its old value, but
breaks down much earlier. Section (3 starts with a little
higher value, but is much straighter, and consequently has a
lower value throughout most of its length. The curves
a, aa, aaa are very peculiar. They start at atmospheric
pressure with much smaller total, and very different relative
ratios than in P1. V., and are successively absorbed into A.
They reappear later, however, as shown in section 0, but
with smaller ratios than in Pl. V.

40          Mr. C. F. Brush on the 'J’ransmz'ssion of
   1’]. VII. gives the curve for air, with the small bulb.    It
differs from that with the large bulb quite as much as did the
hydrogen curve. Section A droops slightly, and then regains
almost its full atmospheric value at one per cent. pressure.
Section B has the same form as with the large bulb (Pl. II.),
but more than double its value; and section C also has a
much higher value throughout. The curves a, a a, a a a have
small ratio values at the beginning, and are absorbed into
section A the same as with hydrogen. But aa and aaa
coalesce when they reappear, and coincide to the end ; while
the ratio between a and aa remains constant at a very small
value.
   Pl. VIII. is the curve for carbon dioxide, with the small
bulb. It closely resembles the air-curve in form, but has a
very much smaller value throughout.        While the curves aa
and a a a are soon united, and remain so to the end, a and a a
never disappear as they did in the cases of hydrogen and air.
   With the small bulb, as with the large, no change in the
character of the phenomena was observable when the ex
haustion had reached the point at which the mean free ath
of the molecules equalled the space through which the heat
was conducted.      This point was reached in the small bulb at
a pressure of about fourteen millionths.
   It seems reasonable to assume that the radical difference
between sections A of the curves obtained with the large and
small bulbs respectively was due to an almost complete sup
pression of convection-currents in the latter case. In the
absence of convection-currents, that part of the heat trans
mitted by the gas was probably carried by a process analogous
to conduction in solids. The shortness of conductor in the
case of the small bulb may account for the greatly increased
rate of conduction.       But why the conductivity of a gas
remains nearly constant through a very wide range of pres
 sure is not clear. Sir \Vm. Crookes’s explanation of this
phenomenon seems to me very unsatisfactory.
   It will be noticed that the “ aether-line ” is about four per
cent. lower with the small bulb than with the large one. This
may be due to the greatly decreased amount of surface pre
sented by the small bulb for absorption of the radiant heat.
   The enormous heat-conducting capacity of gases at very
small pressures is strikingly shown in all the curves. But
hydrogen is preeminent in this respect. Thus, in the large
bulb, hydrogen at a pressure of only twenty-six millionths of
an atmosphere transmits heat as rapidly as the aetherl At
seventy-six millionths it equals air at atmospheric pressure;
that is to say, it does the work of nearly two hundred thousand
times its weight of air!

          Radiant Heat by Gases at Varying Pressures.          41
   It is remarkable that at pressures up to a few milliontlis all
of the curves are nearly straight lines. This is especially
noticeable in the small-bulb curves, showing that at these
small pressures the heat-transmitting power of a as varies
directly with its amount. Hence it seems reasonab y certain
that           ve remained
       if thewhidlii
examined,                      at theofend
                     small fraction     a millionth   of the gas
                                            of each experiment,
could have been entirely removed, the heat-transmitting
power of the vacuum would not have been materially dimi
nished. It was customary at the end of the experiments with
each gas to close the gauge permanently when the pressure
had fallen to a tenth of a millionth or so, and with the capacity
of the whole apparatus thus reduced run the pum con
tinuously from one to two hours. Several sets of observa
tions were always made during this extreme exhaustion, and
 while the change in the rate of cooling of the thermometer
 was generally appreciable it was always very small indeed.
 In my earlier experiments I took the greatest care to ensure
the absence of mercury-vapour in the <U+FB01>nal vacuum. But the
presence or absence of mercury-vapour made no difference
distinguishable from the errors of observation.
    Of course the best vacuum producible by a Sprengel-pump
still contains many thousands of millions of gas-molecules per
cubic centimetre. This may be regarded as a prodigiously large
or exceedingly small quantity of gas, according to our point of
view. While it has no apparent e<U+FB02>'ect on the general heat
transmittin capacity of the vacuum, it does seem to interfere
with or me ify some function of the aether. This is the only
explanation of certain phenomena that I can offer. I refer
to the different behaviour of the vacua with different residual
gases, and in dili'erent-sized bulbs, in the matter of adherence
to, or departure from, Newton’s simple law of cooling.       The
curves a, aa, a aa illustrate these differences in the several
cases at the extreme end of section C of the principal curves.
These differences are too large to be attributed to errors of
 observation. This is one of several reasons which lead me to
 suspect that at higher pressures all the gases examined inter
fere materially with and retard the transmission of heat b
the aether. In other words, I suspect that the dotted tether
line of my curve sheets should not be drawn parallel with the
 base, and have a constant value at all gaseous pressures as
 shown, but should have a decreasing value as the gas pressure
 rises from zero. On this interesting phase of my subject I
 hope to have more to say at a future date.
    Before closing I will call attention to two more curve
 sheets. Pl. 1X. is an air-curve plotted from <U+FB01>gures given in
Dulong and Petit’s paper.        It is drawn to such a scale that

42             Mr. W. H. Macaulay 0n the Stresses
the rate of heat-conduction at atmospheric pressure is the
same as in my own experiment with air in the large bulb, and
illustrated in Pl. II. The <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>ve stations in the curve are
the ones from which they deduced their “Sixth Law” of
cooling. The rest of the curve is drawn in accordance with
that law, and the vacuum line represents exactly the value
they assigned to the cooling power of an absolute vacuum.
Comparison with P1. II. shows how much they erred in their
deductions.
    Pl. X. embodies the results obtained with a mixture of
three volumes of hydrogen and <U+FB01>ve volumes of carbon dioxide
in the small bulb.      A study of this curve in connexion with
P1. VI. shows that the carbon dioxide interfered very greatly
with the performance of the hydrogen. Before any exhaustion
was made, the hydrogen alone would have done more than
three times the work of both gases.           It was not 'until the
pressure had fallen to about one hundred millionths that both
gases combined did as well as the hydrogen would have done
alone. Below this pressure both gases contributed to the
result.
    This interference of mixed gases is a very interesting phe
nomenon, and seems to warrant the careful investigation
which it is my intention to give it.
       IV. The Stresses and De<U+FB02>ection 0f Braced Girders. -
                      By W. H. MACAULAY *.
A STRUCTURE consisting of a number of bars hinged
         together (or pin-jointed) at their ends is called a frame.
 The points at which hinges occur are called joints. A
frame is said to be stq'<U+FB01>" if the number and arrangement of
 bars are such that the frame cannot be distorted without
 stretching one or more of them. If this is not the case it is
 said to be loose. A frame is said to be just sttf, if it is stiff
 and the removal of any one bar could make it loose. If a
 frame is stiff, but not just stiff, it is possible, by removing a
 set of one or more bars, to make it just stiff without depriving
 it of any joints ; such bars are called redundant bars. , A frame
 may have more than one set of redundant bars, that is to say
it may be possible to reduce it to being just stiff, without loss
 of joints, in more than one way. The same terminology may
 be applied to a frame in one plane; it is then assumed that
 no distortion is admissible except in that plane, and that any
forces applied to the frame are in its plane.
                    * Communicated by the Author.

                and De<U+FB02>ection of .Braced Girders.                  43
    The problem of determining the tensions of the members
of a sti<U+FB02>' frame with redundant bars, and its deformation
 (assumed to be small) in any direction under the action of
given forces applied at the joints, was completely solved by
 Clerk Maxwell. His solution was published in the Philo
 sophical Magazine in '1864, series 4, vol; xxvii., and is
 reprinted at the end of vol. i. of his collected papers. The
 only step in this direction previously published was due to
 Clapeyron, and dealt only with the deformation ot a frame
 without redundant bars.      The method employed is sometimes
 referred to as Mohr’s, although Mohr made his earliest con
 tributions t0' the subject some years after the publication of
 Maxwell’s solution, and then only attempted some particular
 examples of very simple character.
     The application of Maxwell’s solution to any practical case
 involves no dif<U+FB01>culty, though the calculations may be rather
 long. Several examples of such applications have been given
 from time to time by Mr. Max am Ende in the ‘ Engineer.’
 The primary practical use of the method is for such applica
 tions to examples with particular numerical data, and in this
 connexion it deserves rather more attention than it has received.
  General results, suf<U+FB01>ciently concise to be of interest, can only
 be obtained for frames of rather simple and s mmetrical types
 with simple arrangements of loading. T 1e object of the
 present investigation is to obtain from Maxwell’s equations
 some general results for one or two simple types of girders.
     It may be convenient to begin with a statement of Maxwell’s
 solution of the problem. The question which he proposes is
  this:-——Let K, L, M, N be four joints of a stiff frame, and let the
  forces applied to it consist of a tension F between K and L,
  in consequence of which the points M and N approach each
  other through a small distance x; to <U+FB01>nd a: and the tensions
  of all the bars of the frame, assuming that the strains are all
,very small, and that Hooke’s law is applicable. And the
 answer is as follows z—Select out of the bars of the frame a set
  which form a just stiff frame, connecting all the joints of the
 given frame; let the extensibilities of these be e1, e2, &c.,
 extensibility being the ratio of extension to tension, or, for a
 uniform bar, length -:— (area of section x Young’s modulus);
 let their tensions be T1, T._., &c. ; let 61, 6,, &c. be the extensi
 bilities and R1, R2, &c. the tensions of the remaining or re- I
  dundant bars; let 171,102, &c. be the tensions of the selected
  bars, taken alone as a just stiff frame, due to a unit tension
 between K and L, 91, g, &c. their tensions due to a unit
  tension between M and N, 1'1’, n”, &c. their tensions due to
 a unit tension in the line of the <U+FB01>rst redundant bar, 13', 7"”, &c.

  redundant bar, and so on; then R1, R,, &c. are given by the

     To apply this solution to the case of a girder on two rigid
 supports with a load at one of the joints K, we may suppose
 that a base connecting the supports with the necessary rigidity
 forms part of the frame, and that a force equal to the load
 acts vertically between K and a point of this base ; the formulae
 given by Maxwell then apply, and, if we take N to be a point
 of this base vertically below M, the value we get for a: will be
 the de<U+FB02>ection of the joint M.         If there are several loads, we
 must investigate their effects separately and compound the
 results.
    Let us apply these equations to the case of a pin-jointed
 girder of the type
                                        O
                                                 B
 with N panels, with all the horizontal members of equal ex
 tensibility 7t, all the sloping members of equal extensibility p,
all the N —1 intermediate vertical members of equal extensi
bility v, and the two end vertical members of equal exte Zil
 bilit-y 1". Suppose the sloping bars not to be pinned together
 at their intersections. Let 9 be the inclination to the vertical
 of each of the sloping bars, and let us write 8 and t for sec 19
and tan 0 respectively.                  '
    Let the ends (lower joints) of the girders rest on rigid
supports A, B, and a load W be applied at one of the lower
joints 0, and let the weight of the girder be neglected. Let
m be the number of panels between A and C, and n the
number between C and B.
    Distinguish the vertical bar at A by the suf<U+FB01>x 0, and the
panels from A to B each consisting of the bars X] by the
suf<U+FB01>xes l, 2, . . . . N. Select for a just stiff frame that
obtained by rejecting all the vertical bars except the one at A,
then the tensions of these vertical bars are R1 R2 . . . . RN

                       and De<U+FB02>ection of Braced Girders.                 45
       respectively.    Distinguish the four bars of a panel X of the
       just stiff frame by the letters a, b, c, d; a belonging to the top
       bar, b to the bottom bar, 0 to the one which slopes upwards
       from left to right, and d to the one which slopes downwards
       from left to ri ht. The tension of a bar of the just sti<U+FB01>' frame
       being denote      by T with a suitable suf<U+FB01>x, T01 is written for
       the tension of the bar a in the panel 1.      The p’s of Maxwell’s
       equation can be distin uished by the same double suf<U+FB01>xes,
       and the r’s by triple su xes, of which the <U+FB01>rst indicates the
       redundant bar referred to, the second the position in the
       panel, while the third is the suf<U+FB01>x of the panel. The bar 0 is
       of course an exceptional case, requiring only the single
       suf‘lix 0.
           A number of relations among the tensions can be written
       down without reference to the strengths of the bars; in fact
       the whole number of bars being 5N + 1, we can <U+FB01>nd 4N+ 1
       such relations independent of one another.

    Accordingly, if we take the p— 1th, pth, and p+ 1th of
 Maxwell’s equations and add them together after multiplying
 the pth by 2, all the R’s will be eliminated except three, the
 resulting equation being

   We get A' and B' by interchanging m and n in these
results, or we can use equations (19).
   Thus the solution of Maxwell’s equations for the tensions of
the redundant bars of our frame has been obtained in a fairly
simple and concise form.

p—m is negative.                 ‘
   This expression is equal to aTO when p=0, and to aRN when
p=N.      It should be noted that the result involves the ex
tensibilities of the bars and the inclinations of the sloping
ones only in the form in which these quantities occur in a
and ,8. 'When v‘=v, qb and 1]" are each unity.        Now —u is
a positive proper fraction (except in the limit when w is
in<U+FB01>nite) ; and it‘is clear that if the intermediate vertical
bars are not very slender compared with both horizontal
and diagonal. bars, all will be small, and good approximate
results of a simple form will be obtained by neglecting
this, and possibly some other powers of u, in comparison
with unity.

    The remaining tensions may be found either from Max
 well’s equation (2) or from the equations (4) to (7). As

 equations (2) to <U+FB01>nd Ta and Te.

   the tensions of the bars and the de<U+FB02>ection at any point for the
    case of uniform loading, a weight W being attached to each

    seen that the results in this case are, in consequence of the
    symmetry of the loading, somewhat simpler than those
    obtained for the case of a single load. To obtain B,I for this

 Here, as before, the expression (39), when w=0 and y=N,

    These results appear to be suf<U+FB01>ciently simple and concise.
 The numerical values of u and m can readily be‘ calculated
 for a given girder.      Referring to the quadratic equation

     The data of the question, admitting only four different
  sections of members of the frame, do not permit the sections
 to be all proportioned to the tensions. The results obtained
 can, however, be compared with those given by other less
  accurate methods.
     Let us regard the girder as a uniform, beam, loaded with
  N—l weights, each equal to W, at equal intervals along it,
  and apply the ordinary Bernoulli-Euler method for deter
  mining the de<U+FB02>ection at any point. If, in calculating the
  moment of inertia of a section of the beam, we take account
  only of the two horizontal booms, neglecting the web, we
  readily <U+FB01>nd that the de<U+FB02>ection at a point at a distance a: from

58             Mr. W. H. Macaulay on the Stresses

   In comparing this result with the expression (40), we must
suppose that .z' and y can only have integral values frOm 1 to
N—l ; thus the value of my ranges from N—l to {N2 or to
1(N’—1) according as N is even or odd.                Accordingly (41)
comprises what may be expected to be generally the most
im ortant part of (40).
      owever, if, as will naturally be the case, ast> §MQ, the
remaining terms of (40), which may be by no means insig
ni<U+FB01>cant, will certainly be positive ; whereas the terms omitted
in (41) by neglecting the moment of inertia of the web will
be negative.
    Let us take a numerical example. Let the cross-sections
 be 8§for horizontal bars, 2; for diagonals, 44‘ for end verticals,
 and C for intermediate verticals; let N=9 and 0:45°, so

   It is clear that we ought not to correct (41) by introducing
a value for moment of inertia of web, for this would be an

    Thus, when N=9 and u=—'205, —T0 will be equal to a

6 times the strength of the intermediate ones; when N =9
and u=——'39 the same result will be secured if the end
verticals are about 9 times the strength of the intermediate
ones. By means of such results as these, we may form an
estimate of the conditions under which the method, sometimes
employed, of calculating the tensions of the bars of a re
dundant frame by considering it as the result of the super
position of two just stiff frames, can be regarded as in any
degree trustworthy.
    Certain results for the girder l>:/\:/><\::; \2/     can, as
we remarked above, be deduced from the ease already con
sidered by making the extensibilities of the intermediate
vertical bars all in<U+FB01>nite. But. as we have in this_frame
only one redundant member, we, can, without inconvenience,
take a more general case than we have hitherto dealt with
with regard to the sections or extensibilities of the bars, or
even suppose these to be all different.     Let us use the same
notation as before for distinguishing the bars of the frame,
and take as our redundant bar the vertical bar which bounds
the Nth panel, its extensibility being e and its tension R.

  and R having been determined, all the other tensions can be
  written down at once by resolving the forces at each joint,
  and'by summing we can deduce results for any system of
  loadin    .
      Althgough  no case presents any dif<U+FB01>culty, it is well to assume
  some symmetry of structure in order to obtain results which
   are concise enough to be of interest. It will be noticed that
  if N is even and the structure and loading are both symme
   trical about the vertical line through the centre of the girder
   (the loading being wholly on the lower boom), Tow and
   TQNH must both be zero; accordingly, the bars c, %N and
   d, §N + 1 may be removed without any e<U+FB02>'ect upon the tensions
   of the other bars. But this removal reduces the frame to the
   State of bein just stiff, so all the tensions are independent of
   the distributlon of extensibilities, and can be found by re
   solving the forces at the joints.
      Let us suppose that the girder is symmetrical about the
   horizontal line through its centre and in its plane. With
   this assumption very simple expressions can be found for the
   tensions. We will also suppose that it is symmetrical about
   the vertical line through its centre, since all actual girders
   have this property. We have then ew=ebm let us call each

     These expressions for the tensions do not depend upon the

  equal, and to suppose them to be unequal would not introduce
  any complication.
      If v is not too great compared with the A’s and p’s, that is
  to say if the vertical bars are strong enough, we may expect
  '7 to be of a magnitude lessimportant than N ; and so we can
  choose the sections of bars roughly proportional to the ten

   exact values of the tensions, and so decide whether it is

 desirable to make any corrections in the assumed sections, the
 process being repeated with corrected values of sections if
 necessary. In the limiting case in which the vertical
 members are very strong y will certainly be small, and To
 will be nearly equal to 1NW.
     The case of the common type of girder
                      /l/l/l/-l>< \\l\|\l\\
 is very simple, since Maxwell’s problem has only to be applied
 to the centre panel, and the results are hardly worth writing
 down.                                                            ,
     In practice the joints of a girder are generally rivetted
 and sti<U+FB01>'ened with gussets, and the horizontal booms are
_continuous. The effect of stiffness of the angles is doubtless
 a matter of secondary importance, but the effect of continuity
 of the horizontal booms and their resistance to bending, when
 they are no longer regarded as lines, seems to deserve more
 attention.     Accordingly, let us see how the comparison of
 results (40) and (4]) is modi<U+FB01>ed by this consideration.
     Let the lines which we have hitherto taken for the horizontal
 members in our original girder be replaced by the neutral
 lines of continuous booms. Let r be the area of cross-section
 of each, and k the radius of gyration of the area about the
 horizontal line in its plane through its centre of gravity.
 Then to obtain the Bernoulli-Euler de<U+FB02>ection, neglecting the
 web as before, we must multiply the expression (41) by
   g   .    Z
 [t2  ___ (Th2 + §k2) ,. thus we v
                                   get
                    1-1? W Mza'y (N2 + my) 1 + 49/02) '1, . .   (45)
 here 2tlc is certainly less than the ratio of the depth of a boom
 to the depth of the girder between the neutral lines.
     Now consider the girder as a frame, but with the bottom
 boom continuous, and let us aim at adding such loading to
  the bottom boom, at the joints, as shall give it at those points
  the de<U+FB02>ection (40). Write 8 for the de<U+FB02>ection (41), 8+8
  for the de<U+FB02>ection (40), and 81, 31’ for the greatest values of 8
  and ‘3’. First add a uniform loading 2t2/c2W, this by the
  Bernoulli-Euler theory will give the boom by itself the de
  <U+FB02>ection 8.     Now we want to add a loading which will give
 the boom by itself a de<U+FB02>ection 8’ ; this will not be a uniform
 loading, but a uniform loading 2t2/c2W88—l/ which gives the
                                                  l           I
 central de<U+FB02>ection correctly will give nearly the de<U+FB02>ection 8’

                   and De<U+FB02>ection of Braced Girders.                  65
elsewhere. Thus for the girder considered as a frame, with
the . bottom boom only continuous, and a uniform loading
                 _      ,
W{1+2t2k2§1_8i—81},            we have a deflection agreeing with
                     1
8+8’ at the centre and very nearly equal to it elsewhere.
Now 46%2 is a small fraction, squares of which cannot be
worth keeping, sothe reduction in de<U+FB02>ection under loading 1V,
due to the bottom boom being continuous, is very nearly
mange (8+3’).             And if we suppose the effect of con
tinuity of the top boom to be about the same as for the bottom
one (it is probably less and hardly can be greater), the whole
reduction 0f de<U+FB02>ection due to continuity of both booms is
about 4tzlc2 Sig—81/ (3 + 5’) .
                  1
    Now the reduction in the result (41) already found (45) is
4621:28, and the difference between these reductions is
                                        /
                        4t2k2{8’+%(8+8’)}. _
So we see that the effect of taking account of the area of
section and continuity of booms in both calculations is to
reduce the divergence between the results (40) and (41) by
                                          C

 of the girder as a frame with continuous booms, and compare
 the result with that given by the Bernoulli-Euler theory
 (leaving out the web in the moment of inertia of the section),
we still have substantially the divergence already noted,
though it is reduced by a small percentage. Moreover, the
remark made above as to the omission of the web still applies.
    The reduction in the divergence between the two results,
 since it can be roughly estimated, may as well be taken account
 of. Thus, if the depth of boom is 116 of the depth of the
 girder between the neutral lines, the reduction will be about
 2 per cent. or a little more.

                          [Plate XIX.]
THE electrical quantities pertaining to an electric current
        which it is usually necessary to measure, in addition to
 current, electromotive force, watts, &c., are resistances, self
and mutual inductances, and capacities. I propose to treat
 of the measurement of alternating currents, electromotive
 force, and watts in a separate paper. Resistances are ordi
 narily best dealt with by continuous currents, except liquid
resistances. I propose to treat in this paper, however, mainly
of inductances, self and mutual, and of capacities together
with their ratios and values in absolute measure as obtained
 by alternating currents.     I also give a few methods of re
 sistance measurement more accurate than usually given by
 means of telephones or electrodynamometer as commonly used
 and specially suitable for resistances of electrolytic liquids.
    I have introduced many new and some old methods de
 pending upon making the whole current through a given
 branch circuit equal to zero. These always require two ad
justments and they must often be made simultaneously.
 However, some of them admit of the adjustments being made
independently of each other, and these, of course, are the
most convenient. But none of these zero methods admit
 of any great accuracy unless very heavy currents are passed
 through the resistances.     The reason of this is that an electro
 dynamometer cannot be made nearly as sensitive for small
 currents as a magnetic galvanometer. The de<U+FB02>exion of an
 electrodynamometer is as the square of the current. To make
 it doubly sensitive requires double the number of turns in
 both the coils. Hence we quickly reach a limit of sensitive.
 ness. It is easy to measure an alternating current of “0001
 ampere and dif<U+FB01>cult for “00001 ampere. A telephone is more
 sensitive and an instrument made by suspending a piece of
 soft iron at an angle of 45°, as invented by Lord Rayleigh,
 is also probably more sensitive.
     For this reason I have introduced here many new methods
 depending upon adjusting two currents to a phase-difference
 of 90°, which I believe to be a new principle. This I do by
 passing one current through the <U+FB01>xed and the other through
 the suspended coil of an electrodynamometer. By this means
 a heavy current can be passed through the <U+FB01>xed coils and a

             Measurement by Alternating Currents.              67
minute current through the movable coil, thus multiplying
the sensitiveness possibly 1000 times over the zero current
method.
   I have also found that many of the methods become very
simple if we use mutual inductances made of wires twisted
together and wound into coils. In this way the self-induc
tances of the coils are all practically equal and the mutual
inductances of pairs of coils also equal. Hence we have only
to measure the minute di<U+FB02>'erence of these two to reduce the
constants of the coil to one constant, and yet by proper con
nexions we can vary the inductances in many ratios.        Three
wires is a good number to use.        However, the electrostatic
induction between the wires must be carefully allowed for or
corrected if much greater accuracy than T0,», is desired.
    By these various methods the measurement of capacities
 and inductances has been made as easy as the measurement
of resistances, while the accuracy has been vastly improved
and many sources of error suggested.
   Relative results are more accurate than absolute as the
period of an alternating current is di<U+FB02>icult to determine, and
its wave-form may depart from a true sine-curve.
   Let self-inductances, mutual inductances, capacities, and
resistances be designated by L 01' l, M or m, C or c, and R or
r with the same suf<U+FB01>xes when they apply to the same circuit,
 the mutual inductance having two su<U+FB02>ixes. Let b be 2w
times the number of complete periods per second, or b=21rn.
The quantities bL, 11M or T are of the dimensions of resist
ance and thus 1%, 62LC or b2MC have no dimensions. b’LM,
 L
 6 or Ghave dimensions of the square of resistances.
   Where we have a mutual inductance M12, we have also the
 two self-inductances of the coils I q and L2.   \Vhen these coils
 are joined in the two possible manners, the self-inductance of
 the whole is
                111+ L2 + 2MB 01‘ L1 + L2_2M12.
 In case of a twisted wire coil the last is very small. Likewise
 LlLg—MZ’I, will be very small for a twisted wire coil, as is
 found by multiplying the <U+FB01>rst two equations together.
    If there are more coils we can write similar equations.
 For three coils we have

    There are many advantages in twisting the wires of the
 standard inductance together, but it certainly increases the
electrostatic action between the coils. This latter source of'
 error must be constantly in mind, however, and, for great
 accuracy. calculated and corrected for. But by proper choice
 of method we may sometimes eliminate it.
    For the most accurate standards, I am rather doubtful
 about the use of twisted wire coils, at least without great
 caution. But for many purposes it certainly is a great con
 venience, especially where only an accuracy of one per
 cent. is desired. In some calculations I have made, I have
 obtained corrections of from one to one-tenth per cent. from
 this cause.
    For twisted wires the above results reduce to 3L+6M,
 3L—2M. Similar equations can be obtained for a larger
 number of wires.         For twisted wire coils, n wires joined
                                L+(n—1)M
 abreast, the self-induction is              , which is practically
                                      n
 equal to L or M. The resistance is R/n.
    When we have n=10+m wires twisted and wound in a
 coil and we connect them p direct and m reverse, the resist
 ance and self-induction will be

 where R is the resistance of one coil and

                          C=nL + (4mp—n)M.
 This gives self-inductances and resistances equal to or less than
 L and R. The correction for electrostatic induction remains
 to be put in. For the general case, the equation is very
 complicated for coils abreast, with mutual inductances.
    The number of mutual inductances to be obtained is M for
 two wires, 0, M, 2M for three wires, 0, M, 2M, 3M for four
 wires, &0. From these results we see that we are always
 able to reduce mutual to self-inductance. Measuring the
 self—inductance of a coil connected in di<U+FB02>’erent ways, we can
 always determine the mutual inductances in terms of the
 self-inductances.

               Measurement by Alternating Currents.            69
    Thus we need not search for methods of directly comparing
mutual inductances with each other, although I have given
two of these, but we can content ourselves with measuring
self-inductances and capacities. Fortunately most of the
methods are specially adapted to the latter, the ratio of self
inductance to capacity being capable of being determined
with great exactness by many methods.
    In the use of condensers I have met with great dif<U+FB01>culty
from the presence of electric absorption. I have found that
this can be represented by a resistance placed in the circuit
of the condenser, which resistance is a function of current
period.

in this manner. Correcting his equations for a small error,
I have developed the resistance and capacity of a condenser

     The <U+FB01>rst value of the capacity seems to be in error, possibly
 one of calculation. However, the result seems to show a
 nearly constant capacity but a resistance increasing rapidly
 with decrease of period, as Maxwell’s formula shows. The
 constant value of the capacity remains to be explained.
     Mr. Penniman will continue the investigation with other
 condensers, liquid and solid, as well as plates in electrolytic
 liquids.
    The results in the other measurements have been fairly
 satisfactory, but many of the better methods have only been
 recently discovered and are thus untried. But we must
 acknowledge at once that work of the nature here described
 is most liable to error. Every alternating current has,
 not only its fundamental period, but also its harmonics, so
 that very accurate absolute values are almost impossible to
 obtain without great care. To eliminate them, I propose to
 use an arrangement of two parallel circuits, one containing
 a condenser and the other a self-inductance, each with ver
 little resistance. The long-period waves will pass through
 the second side and the short ones through the condenser
 side.    By shunting offsomeof the current from the second
 side, it will be more free from harmonics than the <U+FB01>rst one.
    However, in a multipolar dynamo, especially one containing
 iron, there is danger of long-period waves also, which this
method might intensify. A second arrangement, using the
 condenser side, might eliminate them. However, many
dynamos without iron and without too many poles and
properly wound produce a very good curve without harmonics,
especially if the resistance in the circuit is replaced by a self
inductance having no iron. These remarks apply only to
absolute determinations. Ratios of inductance, self and
mutual, and capacity are independent of the period, and thus
it can always be eliminated. Measurements of resistances
also are independent.
    But there are other errors which one who has worked with
continuous currents may fall into. Nearly all alternating

              Measurement by Alternating Currents.              71
currents generate electromagnetic waves which are so strong
that currents exist in every closed circuit with any opening
between conductors in the vicinity.
    We eliminate this source of error by twisting wires to o'ether
and other expedients. But in avoiding one error, we plunge
into another.     For, by twisting wires we introduce electro
static capacity between them, which may vitiate our results.
Thus, in methods 23 or 24 for comparing mutual inductances,
if there is electrostatic capacity between the wires, a current
will <U+FB02>ow through the electrodynamometer in the testing
circuit and destroy the balance.
    Various expedients suggest themselves to eliminate this
trouble, as, for instance, the variation of the resistance A in
the above; but I shall reserve them for a future paper.          I
 may say, however, that it is sometimes possible, as in method
 12 for instance, to choose a method in which the error does
not exist.
    However, with the very best method, much rests with the
 experimenter, as errors from electromagnetic and electrostatic
 induction are added to errors from defective insulation when
 we use alternating currents.
    These errors are generally less than one per cent., however,
 and intelligent and careful work reduces them to less than this.
    The folloning methods generally refer by number to Plate
 XIX., on which the resistances &c. are generally marked.
 One large circle with a small one inside represents an electro
 dynamometer. Of course the circuit of the small coil can be
 interchanged with the large one.       Generally we make the
 smaller current 0 through the hanging coil.
    By the methogs l to 14, we adjust the electrodynamometer
 to zero by making the phase-difference in the two coils 90°.
 For greatest sensitiveness, the currents through the two coils
 must be the greatest possible, heating being the limit. This
 current should be <U+FB01>rst calculated from the impedance of the
 circuit, as there is danger of making it too reat.
    In the second series of methods, 15—26,t e branch circuit
 in which the current is to be 0 is indicated by 0.
    Resistances in the separate circuits are represented by R R’
  R, &c., and r a" r, &c. Corresponding self-inductances and
 capacities in the same circuits are L L L, &c., and l l’ l, &c.,
  or C C' O, &c., and c c’ c, &c. b=2vm, where n is the
 number of complete current waves per second.
    The currents must be as heavy as possible, 116 ampere or
  more, and it is well to make those that require a current of
  more than “1,6 ampere of larger wire freely suspended in oil.
  A larger current can, however, be passed through an ordinary

72             Prof. H. A. Rowland on Electrical
resistance-box for a second or two without danger. A few
<U+FB01>xed coarse resistances of large wire in air or oil with ordinary
resistance-boxes for <U+FB01>ne adjustment, are generally all that
are required. Special boxes avoiding electrostatic induction
are, however, the best, but are not now generally obtainable.
    In some methods, such as 8, .9, 10, &c., we can eliminate
undesirable terms containing the current period by using a
key which suddenly changes the connexions before the period
 has time to change much.
    In using twisted-wire mutual inductances, methods 7 and 12
are about or entirely free from error due to electrostatic action
between the wires. In all the methods this error is less when
the resistance of the coils is least, and in 23 and 24 when A
is least. In method 8 the error is very small when the coil
 resistances and R are small and 1" great. In this method with
 l henry and l microfarad, the error need not exceed 1 in
 1000. Probably the same remarks apply to 9, 10, 11 also.
 By suitable adjustment of resistances in the other method,
 the error may be reduced to a minimum. It can, of course,
 be calculated and corrected for.
    An electrodynamometer can be made to detect '0001 ampere
 without making the self-inductance of the suspended coil more
 than “0007 henry or that of the stationary coils more than '0006
 henry, the latter coil readily sustaining a current of 110» ampere
 without much heating.
    An error may creep in by methods 1—14 if the current
 through the suspension is too great, thus heating it and
 possibly twisting it. This should be tested by short-circuiting
 the suspended coil or varying the current. This error can be
 eliminated by always observing by reversing the current in
 one coil.
 \ Inductances containing iron introduce harmonics and vary
 with current strength. Thus they have no <U+FB01>xed value.
     Closed circuits or masses of metal near a self-inductance
 diminish it, and increase the apparent resistance, which effects
 vary with the period. Short circuits in coils are thus detected~
    Electrolytic cells act as capacities which, as well as the
 apparent resistance, vary with the current period. They also
 introduce harmonics. The same may be said of an electric are.
    An incandescent lamp or hot wire introduces harmonics
 into the circuit.
     Hysteresis in an iron inductance acts as an apparent re
  sistance in the wire almost independent of the current period,
 and does not, of itself, introduce harmonics. The harmonics
 are due to the variation of the magnetic permeability with
 the amount of magnetization.

                Measurement by Alternating Currents.            73
    Electric absorption in a condenser acts as a resistance
varying with the square of the period, the capacity also
var 'ng, as I have shown above.
       [1 general any circuit containing resistances, inductances,
and capacities combined acts as a resistance and inductance or
capacity, both of which vary with the current period, the
square of the current period alone entering.        For symmetry
the square of the current period can alone enter in all these
 cases and those above.
      Hence only inductances containing no iron or not near any
 closed metallic circuits have a <U+FB01>xed value. The same may be
 said of condensers, as they must be free from electric absorp
 tion or electrolytic action to have constants independent of the
 period. There is no apparent hysteresis in condensers and the
 constants do not apparently vary with the electrostatic force.
      In Plate XIX. I have drawn the diagrams for the various
 methods, which are nearly self-explanatory. In methods 1 to
 14 inclusive, the concentric circles are the coils of the electro
 dynamometer.       Either one is the <U+FB01>xed coil and the other the
 hanging coil. Oblong <U+FB01>gures are inductances, and when near
 each other are mutual inductances. A pair of cross-lines is
 a condenser. When a condenser and inductance are on the
 same circuit, we may, in general, leave out one or the other.
  _ The following numbers indicate both the number of the
 method and the <U+FB01>gures in Plate XIX.

For a condenser we can make R” =0 provided there is no

we can adjust to find                   However, two slmultaneous
adjustments are required.
   But I have shown that the presence of electric absorption
in a condenser causes the same effect as a resistance in its
circuit, the resistance, however, varying with the period of
the current. Hence It” must include this resistance. How
ever, the value of It” will not affect the <U+FB01>rst adjustment much
and so the method is easy to work. If it is sensitive enough
it will be useful in measuring the electric absorption of con
densers in terms of resistance.
   It has the advantage of being practically independent of
the current period for g, as it should be.
   For comparison of capacities the same simpli<U+FB01>cation does
not occur.
   Indeed, the method is of very little value in this case, being

   In <U+FB01>g. 6 remove the shunt R’ and self-induction L.
   This method then depends upon the measurement of the
angular de<U+FB01>exion when a self-induction or a capacity is put
in the circuit of the small coil of the electrodynamometer, and
comparing this with the de<U+FB02>exion when the circuit only
contains resistance.
   The resistance of the circuit, 1', is supposed to be so great
compared with R that the current in the main circuit remains
practically unaltered during the change.
   There is also an error due to the mutual induction of the
electrodynamometer-coils which vanishes when r is great.

   These can be further simpli<U+FB01>ed by making R”=R,”.
   The method thus becomes very easy to apply and capable
of considerable accuracy. As the absolute determination
depends on the current period, however, no great accuracy
can be expected for absolute values except where this period
is known and constant, a condition almost impossible to be
obtained. The comparison of condensers or of inductances is,
however, independent of the period and can be carried out,
however variable the period, by means of a key to make the
change instantaneously.
                              Method 26.
   Similar results can be obtained by putting the condenser
or inductance in R” instead of 1', but the current through the
electrodynamometer suspension is usually too great in this
case unless ris enormous.        \Ve have in this case for equal

84      Electrical Measurement by Alternating Currents.
   For using 25 and 26, a key to make instantaneous change
of connexions is almost necessary.
                           Method 27.
   To measure resistance by alternating currents, a Wheat
stone bridge is often used with a telephone.
   I propose to increase the sensitiveness of the method by
using my method of passing a strong current through the
<U+FB01>xed coils of an electrodynamometer while the weaker testing
current goes through the suspended system.
   Using non-inductive resistances, methods 10, 13 A, B, C,
and 14 all reduce to proper ones.    10 or 14 is specially good
and I have no doubt will be of great value for liquid resist
ances.    The liquid resistances must, h0\\'ever, be properly
designed to avoid polarization errors. The increase of ac
curacy over using the electrodynamometer in the usual
manner is of the order of magnitude of 1000 times.
   By this method, a resistance of 10,000,000 ohms can be
measured to 1 part in 1000 or even more. This method
should play a great part in future work on liquid resistances.
   Since writing the above I have tried some of the methods,
especiall 6 and 12.     By the method 12, results to l in 1000
can be 0 tained. Replacing L' by an equal coil, the ratio of
the two, all other errors being eliminated, can be obtained to
 1 in 10,000, or even more accurately.
   The main error to be guarded against in method 12, or any
other where large inductances or resistances are included,
arises from twisting the wires leading tothese. The electro
static action of the leads or the twisted wire coils of an
ordinary resistance-box, may cause errors of several per cent.
Using short small wire leads far apart, the error becomes
very small.
    Method 6 is also very accurate, but the electric absorption
of the condensers makes much accuracy impossible unless a
series of experiments is made to determine the apparent
 resistance due to this cause.
    In method 12 I have not yet detected any error due to
 twisting the wires of coils l. However, the electrostatic
 action of twisted wire coils is immense, and the warning
 against their use which I have given above has been well
 substantiated by experiment. Only in case of low resistances
 and low inductances, or in cases like that just mentioned, is
 it to be tolerated for a moment. Connecting two twisted
 wires in a coil in series with a resistance between I have

                     A New Harmonic Analyser.                  85
   almost neutralized the self-inductance, which was one henry
  for each coil, or four henrys for them in series.
      Altogether the results of experiment justify me in claiming
  that these methods will take a prominent place in electrical
  measurement, especially where <U+FB02>uid resistances, inductances,
  and capacities are to be measured.      They also seem to me to
   settle the question as to standard inductances or capacities,
  as inductances have a real constant which can now be com
  pared to 1 in 10,000 at least.
      It is to be noted that all the methods 15 to 24 can be
  modi<U+FB01>ed by passing the main current through one coil of the
  electrodynamometer and the branch current through the other.
  The de<U+FB02>exion will then be zero for a more complicated re
  lation than the ones given. If; however, one adjustment is
  known and made, the method gives the other equation.
      Thus method 18 requires R,R”—R'R”=0. Hence, when
  this is satis<U+FB01>ed we must have the other condition alone to be
 satis<U+FB01>ed. Also in method 22, when we know the ratio of
 the self and mutual inductances in the coil, the resistances
 can be adjusted to satisfy one equation, while the experiment
 will give the other, and hence the capacity in terms of the
 inductance. Again, pass a current whose phase can be varied
 through one coil of the electrodynamometer, and connect the
 circuit to be tested through the other. Vary the adjustments
 of resistances until the deflexion is zero, however the phase
 of current through the <U+FB01>rst coil may be varied.
     The best methods to apply the <U+FB01>rst modi<U+FB01>cation to are
 15A, 16 A and B, 18, 20, 21, 22, and 24. In these either a
Wheatstone bridge can be adjusted or the ratio of the self
and mutual inductances in a given coil can be assumed
 known and the resistance adjusted thereby.
     The value of this addition is in the increased accuracy and
sensitiveness of the method, an increase of more than one
 hundredfold being assured.
     As a standard I recommend two or three coils laid together
with their inductances determined, and not a condenser, even
 an air condenser.

accumulated errors due to these causes would soon neutralize
the advantages of the increased number of terms in the series.
   It occurred to one of us some years ago that the quantity
to be operated upon might be varied almost inde<U+FB01>nitely, and
that most of the imperfections in existing machines might be
practically eliminated.        Among the methods which appeared
most promising were the followin :—-addition of <U+FB02>uid pres
sures, elastic and other forces, and e ectric currents. Of these
the simplest in practice is doubtless the addition of the forces
of spiral springs.
   The principle upon which the use of springs depends may
be demonstrated as follows :—
   Let a (<U+FB01>g. 1) = lever-arm of small springs (but one of
           which is shown in the <U+FB01>gure),
        I) = lever-arm of large counter-spring S,
       [0 = natural length of small springs,
       L0 =        ,,     ,,        large spring,
    l+z' = stretched length of small springs,
    L+Z/ =          n      :1         large Spring,
         e = constant of small springs,
        E =         ,,       large spring,
         12.: number of small springs,
         p: force due to one of the small springs,
         P:     ,, ,,         large spring;
then

                                           by),

                        a2p=bP,

                               n (FL + ba
   From this it follows that the resultant motion is propor
tional to the algebraic sum of the components, at least to the
same order of accuracy as the increment of force of every
spring is proportional to the increment of length.
   To obtain the greatest amplitude for a given number of
elements the ratios l/L and a/b should be as small as possible,
but of course a limit is soon reached when other considerations
enter.

88             Messrs. Michelson and Stratton on
   About a year ago a machine was constructed on this prin
ciple with twenty elements, and the results obtained* were so
encouraging that it was decided to apply to the Bache Fund
for assistance. The present machine of eighty elements was
constructed with the aid of a grant from this fund.
   Fig. 1 shows the essential parts of a single element. s is
one of the eighty small springs attached side by side to the
lever C, which for greater rigidity has the form of a hollow
 cylinder, pivoted on knife-edges at its centre. S is the large
 counter-spring. The harmonic motion produced by the
 eccentric A is communicated to a: by the rod R and lever B,
 the amplitude of the motion at .r depending on the adjustable
distance d. The resultant motion is recorded by a pen con
 nected with u by a <U+FB01>ne wire; under the pen a slide moves
with a speed proportional to the angular motion of the cone D
 (Plate XL).
   To represent the succession of terms of a Fourier series the
eccentrics have periods increasing in regular succession from
one to eighty. This is accomplished by gearing to each
eccentric a wheel the number of whose teeth is in the proper
ratio. These last are all fastened together on the same axis
and form the cone D (Pl. XL).
   Turning the cone will produce at the point .r motions cor
responding to cos 9, cos 29, cos 30, &c., up to cos 800, with
amplitudes depending on the distances d.            The motion of
the elements may also be changed from sine to cosine by dis
engaging the cone and turning all of the eccentrics through
90° by means of a long pinion, which can be thrown in gear
with all of the eccentric wheels at once.
   The e<U+FB02>iciency and accuracy of the machine is well illus
trated by an inspection of the summations of Fourier series
shown by curves 1 to 12 (Pls. XII. to XIV.).
   Curves 13 to 24 (Plates XIV. to XVI.) are added to
illustrate the use of the machine in constructing curves repre
senting functions which scarcely admit of other analytical
expresslon.
   Pl. XVII. shows well the dependence of the accuracy of
the representation of a particular function on the number of
terms of the series.
   The machine is capable not only of summing up any given
trigonometric series, but can also perform the inverse process
of <U+FB01>nding for any given function the coef<U+FB01>cients of the corre
sponding Fourier series. Thus if

moved along the lovers B to distances proportional to the
ordinates of the curve y =f(nx).
   The curve thus obtained for a], is a continuous function of Ir,
which approximates to the value of the integral as the number
of elements increases. To obtain the values corres ending
to the coef<U+FB01>cients of the Fourier series, the angle =1r, or
the corresponding distance on the curve, is divided into m
 equal parts.         The required coef<U+FB01>cients are then proportional
to the ordinates erected at these divisions.

   Here the average error is somewhat greater, being 1'5
per cent. of the value of the greatest term, but by a suitable
selection of the constant it may be made less than 1 per cent.
   It appears, therefore, that the machine is capable of e<U+FB02>'ecting
the integration                       cos kw dx with an accuracy comparable
with that of other integrating machines; and while it is
scarcely hoped that it will be used for this purpose where

          A Telemetrical Spherometer and Focometer.               91
great accuracy is required, it certainly saves an enormous
amount of labour in cases where an error of l or 2 per cent.
is unimportant.
    The experience gained in the construction of the present
instrument shows that it would be quite feasible to increase
the number of elements to several hundred, or even to a
thousand, with a proportional increase in the accuracy of the
 integrations.
    Finally, it is well to note that the principle of summation
here employed is so general that it may be used for series of
any functions by giving to the points ,1; the motions corre
sponding to the required functions, instead of the simple
 harmonic motion furnished by the eccentrics. A simple
 method of effecting this change would be to cut metal tem
plates of the required forms and mount them on a common
axis. In fact, the harmonic motion of the original machine
 was thus produced.
        VII. A Telemetrieal Spherometer and F0cometer.
               By Prof. W. S'raoun, D.Se., M.A.*
       AVING been en aged for the past eight years in con
         junction with rof. Barr in the construction and
 perfecting of naval range-<U+FB01>nders, it was natural that I should
 turn my attention to the possible application of telemetrical
 principles to physical measurement.
    One very obvious application is to the determination of (1)
 the radius of curvature of a concave and especially of a convex
 surface, and (2) the focal length of a convex and especially
 of a concave lens. The problem of <U+FB01>nding the position of
 the image of an object in a convex mirror or a concave lens
 is essentially a range-<U+FB01>nding problem.
    For the particu ar purpose in view the most suitable form
 of range-<U+FB01>nder is a constant-range instrument, i. e. an instru
 ment (whose optical parts are rigidly <U+FB01>xed) which can be
 translated along an o tical bank and will indicate when an
 object or image is at the specified range. The mode of action
 of the instrument will thus be very like that of an ordinary
 short-focus telescope as commonly used on optical banks, but
 a short-focus telescope is essentially bad as a range-<U+FB01>nder,
 and that for the following reasons :—
    (1) As is well known, when using such a. telescope it
 is advisable to cover up the middle portion of the objective
      * Communicated by the Physical Society: read Oct. 29, 1897.

92              Prof. W. Stroud on a Telemem'cal
so that only the extreme beams are used to form the image.
In this way a crude range-<U+FB01>nder is formed, which suffers from
a radical defect, arising from the fact that the beams enter the
eye in different directions, so that any alteration in the accom
modation of the eye produces a duplication of the image.
An attempt is made to avoid error from this cause by
 keeping the eye focussed all the time on cross-wires <U+FB01>xed in
the focal plane of the eyepiece.            (2) The short-focus
telescope has not usually base enough for accurate telemetry
 (the maximum available base being the diameter of the
objective), or if it should have base enough, the minimum
 range which it can measure is too great.
    Looked at from the range-<U+FB01>nding point of view the problem
of optical spherometry and focometry is one of excessive
Simplicity. What is required is a range-<U+FB01>nder whose prime
 reflectors can be <U+FB01>xed at any distance apart (to furnish the
 adjustable base) and at any angle to that base (to furnish the
 adjustable range).
                               Fig. 1.
   One arrangement is shown in plan in <U+FB01>g. 1 and in
perspective in <U+FB01>g. 2. A, A' are two triangular re<U+FB02>ecting

                  Splierometer and Focometer.                 93
prisms forming the prime re<U+FB02>ectors sup orted on stands
provided with levelling-screws. Slots S, Sl) are provided in
the frame-piece D through which pass stout pins P, 1" pro
vided with clampin -screws below. B, B’ are <U+FB01>xed re<U+FB02>ectors
opposite A and A respectively. C is an extra re<U+FB02>ector
(made into one block with B and B’) so as to re<U+FB02>ect the two
beams upward to the eye. If new the prime re<U+FB02>ectors be
adjusted for a particular range, the two portions of the object
viewed will appear in coincidence in the <U+FB01>eld of view
furnished by C.    If the two portions are not in coincidence
they may be brought into coincidence by translating the
range-<U+FB01>nder to or from the object or image. The instrument
works in fact just like a short-focus telescope, the only
difference being that the correctness of the range is deter
mined by observing whether or not the two portions of the
object viewed are in alignment.
    The instrument was used to determine the radius of curva
ture of a convex mirror by the ordinary method. It is clear
that u should be made as large as possible so as to make 2:
large.
    The object (a thin rod or slit well illuminated at the back)
 was placed at the extremity of the bank, and the mirror at the
 other extremity ; the RF. (range-<U+FB01>nder) was brought up to
 read (1) the image of the rod, (2) the surface of the mirror,
 (3) the position of the object. Measurement (1) is <U+FB01>rst done
 because the R.F. should be adjusted on the image so as to have
 maximum available base-length and minimum range (the
 conditions for maximum accuracy).          The portion of the
 mirror used was restricted to 10 cm. diameter, so as to make
 the measurements comparable with direct measurements
 made with our spherometer, which has its adjustable point
 5 cm. distant from each of the <U+FB01>xed legs. The RF. is then
 brought up to within a few cms. of the mirror and the prime
 re<U+FB02>ectors are angled until the images appear nearly in
 coincidence, the prime re<U+FB02>ectors are then rigidly <U+FB01>xed and
 the RF. is moved to and fro along the bank until exact coin
 cidence has been obtained, when the reading on the bank is
 taken. If the base-length is 10 cm. and the image about
  70 cm. away, the extreme variations cannot amount to 1 mm.
 and should not amount to more than % mm. From <U+FB01>g. 1 it
 will be seen that the RF. is so constructed that it does not
 itself obstruct the beams forming the two separate images
 provided its distance from the mirror is suf<U+FB01>cient (say 8 or
 10 cm.).
    Measurement (2) is e<U+FB01>'ected by suspending a weight by a
 very <U+FB01>ne wire so that the wire rests in contact with the

  91                Prof. W. Stroud on a Telemetrical
  convex surface.       Our mirror was silvered at the back, the
  wire resting against the front glass surface.            Under these
  circumstances an image of the wire will be formed by re
  <U+FB02>exion in the surface. The RF. is adjusted (a) on the wire,
  (12) on its image.     If t is the thickness of the glass, i—t is the
  difference between these readings, from which t can be calcu
  lated with suf<U+FB01>cient accuracy.
      Measurement (3) is effected most conVeniently by shifting
  the rod or slit a measured large distance (say 100 cm.)
  towards the mirror, so that the RF. can be brought to bear
  upon it.
      The following results were obtained :—
            i     u.     \      a.    l     -r.   r (corrected).

           {l   119-12        25-67       65-44       65-31
      The last column gives the value for the radius corrected for
  aberration. The radius of the same mirror measured by our
  spherometer gave 65-31 and 6537 cm. It should be re
  marked (1) that our spherometer has received a good deal of
  rou h usage, (2) that the spherometer measures the curvature
  of t e external surface, while the telemeter was used to
  measure (the curvature of the silvered surface. Still the
  results show that this telemetrical method is nearly as

g     The constants of a concave lens were next determined.
  One face was obviously concave, the other looked nearly <U+FB02>at.
  The radius of the concave face was <U+FB01>rst got in this way :~—
  the rod, suitably and strongly illuminated, was placed between
  the RF. and the concave surface, and roughly adjusted
  so that it and its image were in close proximity near the
  centre of curvature. In other words u and a were made
  nearly equal and the value of each determined. In this case
  we are dealing with a real image and can bring our RF. as
  near as we please to the image.

<U+FB01>xed ('=_ 1 minute of are for snapshot naked-eye work and
'=. l; minute when great care is taken), dR will be a minimum
when R is a minimum. To determine the range of a real
 image as accurately as possible, we must then take the
 minimum base and minimum range for maximum accuracy.
 In this case it may be advisable to place on the face of the
 prism a convex lens whose focal length is equal to the range
 required.
    In the case of the lens used 8 =8 cm. p l__— 16 cm.; so that

                             rlR=T(l,-O- mm.
 In order to compete in accuracy with this a spherometer
 would require to indicate to 3-0160 mm. In short, as a RF.
 could be constructed to work at much shorter ranges than
 even 5 cm., there can be no question that for concave sphe
 rical surfaces the telemetrical method is more accurate than the
 spherometer.
    In this way (though not with a very restricted base, for I
 did not realize at the time that the accuracy would be much
 increased by restricting the base and diminishing the range)
 the radius of curvature was found to be 1581. A small
  spherometer gave 15°87 cm.—the lens face was too small for
 the large spherometer previously mentioned ; the radius of
 the circle of contact of the small spherometer was only 1'5 cm.,
 and as the instrument was home-made and only ordinary care
  had been bestowed on cutting the screw, I attribute the dis
  crepancy to errors in the spherometer.
     The second face when measured telemetrically turned out to
  be very slightly concave, the mean of several measurements
  giving a radius of 3300 cm.
     The thickness of the lens can be readily got on the optical
  bank in this way:—The RF. stand is so constructed that it
  can be turned through 180° about a vertical axis. A <U+FB01>ne
  wire carrying a weight at its lower end is supported about the
  middle of the bank and readings of its position are taken with
  the RF. from both sides.                                    '

   The wire is now replaced by the lens and the operation
repeated with the RE, the readings for the one face being
taken from the one side, the readings for the second face from
the other.
   The di<U+FB01>'erences between the sets of readings for the wire
and the corresponding sets for the lens gives the thickness
required.
   The principal points, the focal length, and the refractive
index can now be obtained in the ordinary way.

   turned edge upwards, as shown in the plan. As it stands,
   this instrument would not be a range-<U+FB01>nder at all, but an
  azimuth indicator. A right-angled glass prism P is, however,
  mounted on the stage supporting the re<U+FB02>ector A’, so that the
  beam of light is reversed right for left before falling on A’.
  This converts the instrument into a range-<U+FB01>nder. The kind
  of appearance that is presented in the instrument before
  correct alignment has been attained is shown by the lines l, I’,
  as seen in the prism 0’. Here the object being observed is a
  line perpendicular to the plane of the <U+FB01>gure at some distance
 away in the direction of the arrow. A moment’s re<U+FB02>ection
 will show that the RF. is too near the object. To produce
 alignment we should require to move the instrument in the
 opposite direction to that of the arrow. The advantage
 which this arrangement presents over the preceding is that
 the speculum~prism (J' obstructs very little of the beams.
 Experiment shows that the accuracy obtainable with it is not
 appreciably different from that obtainable with the instrument
 <U+FB01>rst described.
                            Conclusions.
     1. The telemetrical method described is not much inferior
 to a spherometer for measuring the radii of curvature of
convex and approximately plane surfaces.
     2. The method is superior in accuracy (though not of
 course in convenience) to the spherometer for measuring the
radii of curvature of concave surfaces.
     3. The method is available for determining all the geo
 metrical or optical constants of either a convex or a concave
lens on the optical bank alone.
                            APPENDIX.
    In connexion with this subject there remains to be described
a simple apparatus for measuring optically the radius of cur
vature of a convex mirror or the focal length of a concave
lens.
     I venture to think that it will be found as useful in ele
mentary teaching in other laboratories as it has been found at
the Yorkshire College.
     M is the convex mirror, P is a slip of silvered plate-glass
 (assumed plane), S is a pin well illuminated or narrow slit
 of light. The plate-glass P is arranged so that its upper

 S or P is shifted nearer to or further from M, until the image
of S in P coincides with the image of S in M, whether viewed

v=a—-b, whence 1- can be obtained. As the image formed
by re<U+FB01>exion in M is smaller than that formed in P, it is
advisable to use a very narrow slit at S.
   To determine the focal length of a concave lens, the mirror
is removed, the concave lens is placed so that its face touches
the silvered back of P, and is half covered by it. A stout
vertical rod is placed at some considerable distance behind the
mirror on the prolongation of the axis of the lens, and the pin
 S is shifted to or from the mirror until the image of the pin
seen by re<U+FB02>exion in the plane mirror coincides with the
image of the rod as seen directly through the lens, whether
we look from E or from E’. This gives the position of the
virtual image of the rod, whence the focal length can be
calculated.
    The pin or rod can with advantage be replaced by a vertical
straight edge well illuminated.
    Both these methods will be found very satisfactory for
elementary students. The apparatus is very simple, and the
method seems to me instructive in illustrating the subject of
parallax.
 VIII. High Electromoti've Force.      By JOHN TROWBRIDGE *.
LORD KELVIN, in a paper dated April 12, 18601', entitled
        “Measurement of Electromotive Force Required to
Produce a Spark,” states that “there is amuch less rapid

    variation with distance, of the electrostatic force preceding a
    spark at the greater than at the smaller distance. It seems
    most probable that at still greater distances the electrostatic
    force will be found to be sensibly constant, as it was certainly
   expected to be at all distances.
       Having at my command a very much improved Planté rheo
   static machine with sixty condensers of 15 x 80 inches coated
   surface, I have been enabled to greatly extend my studies of
   high electromotive force, and to investigate the conditions
   necessary to produce sparks of great bod forty-eight to <U+FB01>fty
   inches in length. The accumulator whic was used to charge
   the rheostatic machine in parallel had a voltage of 20,000,
   and the machine could then give me 1,200,000 volts. The
   length of spark which corresponds to this voltage is very
   closely forty-eight inches. Professor Elihu Thomson, by
   means of transformers, has obtained sparks of <U+FB01>fty to sixty
   inches in length, and has estimated the necessary voltage to
   produce a spark of 80 centim. at 500,000.
      This estimate A. Heydweiler‘ thinks is very much too great,
   and he believes that 100,000 would be nearer the truth.       My
  investigations show conclusively that the estimate of Professor
   Thomson is far nearer the truth than that of Heydweiler ; and
   instead of being lessened it should be increased.
.     In a recent paper on the tension at the poles of induction
   apparatus, A. Oberbeck‘l' states that a potential-difference of
   60,000 volts under given conditions can produce a spark of
   more than 10 centim. in length. It is dif<U+FB01>cult to obtain con
   sistent results b means of induction-coils and transformers.
      My results s ow that Lord Kelvin’s conjecture that the
   electrostatic force necessary to produce a spark in air remains
   sensibly constant for all distances beyond the limit he de
   scribes, is correct; for when lengths of spark are plotted as
   abscissas, and the corresponding electromotive forces as ordi
   nates, astraight line is obtained. Planté calls attention to the
  fact that the loss of energy resulting from the transformation
  of dynamic into static electricity is, in the case of his appa
  ratus, much less than in induction apparatus.          This remark
  a plies with great force to the modern use of transformers for
  tfie production of high-tension effects. With the improved
   form of rheostatic machine which I have constructed, one
   third of a horse-power will produce the effects which have
   hitherto required the employment of from thirty to forty horse
   power. The condensers in this apparatus are very uniform

in thickness, and the charging and discharging method is a
complete departure from that adopted by Planté. All forms
of rotating cylinders carrying contact-pieces were abandoned,
and two lever-arms were used to charge the condensers in
parallel, and then to discharge in series. Great uniformity
of action was thus secured.
   The sparks produced by the apparatus have great disruptive
effects, and produce reports like the discharge of a pistol.
The electrostatic <U+FB01>eld in the neighbourhood of the terminals
is very intense, and the wires leading to the spark-gap emit
brush-discharges which extend at least 12 inches from the
surface of the wire. I was interested to observe the effect
of such powerful discharges through Crookes-tubes, and
therefore set up a tube which had been exhausted to such a
degree that sparks of 8 inches in length preferred to pass
through the air from terminal to terminal of the tube rather
than to pass through the rare<U+FB01>ed space.            The disruptive
 discharge produced by the machine passed readily through
 such a tube, and showed the .z-rays with great brilliancy:
moreover, the degree of rare<U+FB01>cation of the tube was not
sensibly altered by single discharges of such high electro
motive force.
   The results so far obtained by the employment of this
apparatus prove (I) that the length of spark is proportional
to the electromotive force; (2) rare<U+FB01>ed spaces hitherto con
sidered too high vacua to conduct electricity cease to act like
such vacua to very high electromotive force.

        IX. Phosphorescence produced by Electri<U+FB01>cation.
        By JOHN TROWBRIDGE and JOHN E. BUBBANK“.
VARIOUS investigators have stated that the w-rays can
         communicate an electrical charge to bodies. We were
interested to discover whether this statement could be veri<U+FB01>ed
by means of the phenomenon of phosphorescence. When
<U+FB02>uorite, in the state of a comparatively coarse powder, is
heated to a low red heat for about an hour, it loses completely
its power of phosphorescing under the effect of a low red heat;
if it is then electri<U+FB01>ed by means of the brush-discharge of an
electrical machine and then submitted to a low red heat it
suddenly phosphoresces. In this connexion it is interesting

           Phosphorescence produced by Electrification.      101
to note a statement of E. Becquerel upon the e<U+FB02>'ect of
electric sparks on phosphorescent bodies. In his work en
titled La Lumiere, res Causes et ses Efets“, he says:—“ In
 order to submit the substances to the action of electric
discharges they were placed directly upon an insulated stand
 if they were in fragments, or in tubes if they were in the
 state of powder, in sucha manner that the discharge-terminals
.were two or three centimetres apart. One or many electrical
discharges were then passed from leyden-jars between the
terminals. One then <U+FB01>nds that not only the bodies in question
become phosphorescent after the passage of the discharge, but
also, as one sees later, they are made phosphorescent by these
electrical discharges when subjected to heat, even if before
having been submitted to the action of the discharges, they
had been calcined so long as to be entirely deprived of the
power of phosphorescence by elevation of temperature. The
electric light acts, therefore, like sunlight, but with greater
energy by reason of its greater intensity on account of the
position of the bodies; and it is capable of making bodies
acquire phosphorescence which did not previousl possess it.
There is no necessity for submitting <U+FB02>uorspar or t 0 diamond
to heat immediately after having been exposed to the dis
charges. The elevation of temperature can take place even
after the lapse of some months.”
    Becquerel evidently attributed the effects observed to the
light of the discharge; for he says, further (p. 55, ibid.),
“The electric spark acts only by its light, but its action is
more energetic than that of sunlight by reason of its great
intensity and the proximity of the source.”
    In an article on luminescence by E. VViedemann and
G. O. Schmidt 1' the conclusion is reached that the violet light
alone of electrical discharges does not cause phosphorescence;
but the phosphorescence is due to peculiar discharge-rays
analogous to cathode rays.       M. W. Hoffman 12 has con<U+FB01>rmed
Wiedemann’s work. The latter states, “ no entladungsstralzlen
could be detected in the brush-discharge.”
    With the preparation of <U+FB02>uorite we have mentioned above
no effect was produced by the light of the electrical discharge.
It was submitted according to the method of Becquerel to
the light of the spark; and it was also exposed to the light
of burning magnesium and to that of the voltaic arc, and no
phosphorescent effects could be produced, nor by subsequent

heating. It phosphoresced, however, on heating after having
been electri tied by the brush-discharge. The phosphorescence
was evidently an expression of the electrical energy which
was communicated to the substance, and this ener y was
suddenly converted into light by the action of the eat in
dispelling the electricity. The substance was next subjected
to the action of the .r-rays, in a brass box closed by an
aluminium window. The box was also connected to the ground.
When the substance was taken from the metallic box it
showed no phosphorescence, but on being heated it exhibited
a bright phosphorescence which quickly disappeared.
   The action of the :v-rays on this mineral was exactly
similar to that of electri<U+FB01>cation; and we cannot but regard
our experiments as an evidence of the electrical nature of
the action of the w-rays. By them an electrical charge is
communicated to <U+FB02>uorescent and phosphorescent substances.
The resulting electrical energy in being dissipated reduces
the secretion of light. By heating crystals which have been
electrified we produce a sudden dissipation of the electrical
energy which has been communicated to the particles of the
phosphorescent substance, either by direct electri<U+FB01>cation or
by the electri<U+FB01>cation produced by the ar-rays.
    Most phosphorescent substances, after having been sub
mitted to sunlight or daylight, glow more strongly when
heated. The phosphorescence, however, dies out more quickly
after the process of heating, which seems to cause the energy
communicated to the substance by light to become dissipated
more quickly.        The same thing is true of the state of phos~
phorescence communicated by the :v-rays. Can we therefore
conclude that the phosphorescence excited by sunlight or
daylight is due to an electrical condition which is dissipated
by heat ? This supposition seems to us not inconsistent with
the electromagnetic theory of light, and phosphorescence may
be an evidence of the electrical stresses which produce the
phenomena of ultra-violet light.

X. On the Isot/zermals of Ether.       By J. ROSE-INNES, MA.,
    B.Sc.*
    N a paper “On the Isothermals of Isopentane,” read
       before the Physical Society last MayT, I gave an account
 of some results obtained by investigating Prof. Young’s
   ’* Communicated by the Physical Society : read Nov. 12, 1897.
   + Phil. Mag. [5] xliv. p. 76.

        Mr. J. Rose-Innes on the Isothermals of Ether.        103
experimental work 011 Isopentane.         The main conclusions
arrived at were as follows :—
   (i.) The study of a diagram constructed by plotting
W against v_§‘, where a is the internal pressure and v is the
volume of a gram, suggests that there is a discontinuity in
the slope of         Even if there is not discontinuity in the
exact sense of the word, there is an extremely rapid change
of behaviour, amounting practically to the same thing.
   (ii.) The temperature for which the pressure is accurately
given by the laws of a perfect gas at a given volume, remains
practically constant for all large volumes, until we approach
the neighbourhood of the critical volume. At the critical
volume this temperature has diminished somewhat from its
value for large volumes, but the diminution is only slight.
   These conclusions were embodied in a formula giving the
pressure in terms of the temperature and volume, and a com
parison between calculation and experiment was effected by
means of a diagram. It is not suggested that this formula
is incapable of further improvement, but the close correspon
dence between calculation and experiment seems to show that
the main conclusions on which the formula was founded are
correct.
   A natural extension of the above investigation is to try
how far these general conclusions are true of some other
substance. For this purpose I resolved to employ the experi
mental results obtained by Profs. Ramsay and Young with
ether, as it appears that the linear law connecting temperature
and pressure at constant volume holds accurately in this case.
[Phih Trans. vol. 178 A, pp. 57—93; and Phil. Mag. vol. xxiii.
pp. 435—458.]
   Profs. Ramsay and Young have given the values of a for
a large number of volumes (Phil. Mag. vol. xxiii. p. 441),
so that it was easy to calculate the values of      , and to plot
                                                av2
them against 22-11 The resulting diagram is given on p. 104,
and it suggests very strongly that there is a discontinuity of
slope at about vol. 3'3. In this respect, accordingly, the
other results show a striking likeness to those of isopentane,
the discontinuity in the case of the last substance occurring
at about the same volume.
   It was shown in my former paper that when Ramsay and '
Young’s linear law holds, there is one and only one tempera

    An examination of the table shows that 1- remains nearly
constant for all large volumes down to about vol. 3; its
numerical value throughout this range is roughly 800. The
 only exception occurs in the case of vol. 300, but the value
of r is here so erratic that it is clearly subject to a large
experimental error.
    We have still to try how far the formula found for isopentane
can be made by alterations of the constants to suit the experi
 mental results with ether. For isopentane it was found that
 fairly good concordance with experiment could be secured by
the use of the formula

   The formula was tested by drawing a system of continuous
isothermals giving 101; plotted against v-t, and then the
experimental values were put in as dots; there is on the
whole a fair agreement between calculation and experiment,
as may be seen on inspection of the diagram. It is generally
dif<U+FB01>cult in these investigations to know how much may be
reasonably allowed for experimental errors. Fortunately in
this instance we have a clue to guide us, as Messrs. Ramsay
and Young in testing their linear law published tables com
paring pressures found with pressures calculated (loc. cit.
pp. 438—440 and pp. 442—445), and from these it is seen that
they were willing to allow over 1 per cent. as a possible
experimental error. In this connexion they remark: “It is
to be noticed that the greatest divergence is at the temperatures
250° and 280°, but the deviations are in opposite directions
and must therefore be ascribed to experimental error” (loo.
cit. p. 444).                       _
    I likewise found in testing my formula that the greatest
divergence is at temperatures 280°‘35 G. and 250° (1., and
that the deviations are in opposite directions, and therefore
consider it justi<U+FB01>able to attribute them mainly to the same
cause. For the remaining temperatures discrepancies occur
fairly often of over 1 per cent., but none so great as 2 per cent.,
so that they still seem to lie within the limits of experimental
error.
   Finally we may infer that both the general conclusions
obtained in the former paper with regard to isopontane hold
good also in the case of ether.
 XI. The Wave-Resistance of a Ship. By J. H. MICHELL.*
THE object of this paper is to give a general solution of the
       problem of the waves produced by a ship of given form
moving with uniform velocity in an inviscid liquid, and to
determine the consequent wave-resistance to the motion of the
ship. The only assumption made as to the form of the ship is
that the inclination of the tangent plane at any point of its
surface to the vertical median plane is small. This condition
is not satis<U+FB01>ed near the bottom of the middle body of a
modern ship, but it seems probable that this will not much
affect either the waves produced or the resistance, for the
waves arise rather from the parts at the bow and stern at
which the tangent to the surface is inclined to the direction
of the ship’s motion, than from the approximately cylindrical
                  * Communicated by the Author.

                      Wave-Resistance of a Ship.              107
middle body. The neglect of friction is probably of little
consequence. The eddying water close to the side will no
doubt slightly alter the virtual shape of the ship, but the
change in the inclination of the virtual tangent plane, on
which the wave-makin depends, will, almost certainly, be
very small. Further, t 0 effect of viscosity in destroying
the waves produced by the bow will modify to some extent
the interaction of bow and stem waves; but, seeing that it
is the waves of length comparable with that of the ship which
chie<U+FB02>y give rise to the resistance, the e<U+FB02>'ect must be small.
 The conclusion is, therefore, that the course followed by
W. Froude, of considering frictional resistance and wave
 resistance separately and adding the two, will probably give
 a close approximation to the truth.
    A summary of the experimental work on this question, as
 well as a sketch of the theoretical work of Russell, Rankine,
and the two Frondes, is given in White’s interesting ‘ Manual
 of Naval Architecture ’ (1894), chap. xi. Recent mathe
 matics on the subject has been devoted chie<U+FB02>y to explaining,
 in a general way, the interesting wave~patterns observed, but
 exception must be made of the papers of Sir W. Thomson
 (Lord Kelvin), Phil. Mag. (1886—7), in which the critical
 speed of a canal boat, examined experimentally long before
 by Russell, was mathematically discussed. Reference may
 be made to Lamb’s ‘ Hydrodynamics ’ t 1895) , chap. ix., and to
 Sir \V. Thomson’s ‘ Popular Lectures on Navigation ’ (1891) ,
 p. 450, for the discussion of wave-patterns.
    None of these writers has, however, considered the waves
 produced by an actual ship,and the present paper is intended
 to supply the necessary investigation. The formula obtained
 for the wave-disturbance is rather complex, but that for the
 resistance is much simpler, as the most complicated term
 in the former represents a local disturbance not leading to
 any resistance in an inviscid liquid. There will therefore be no
 dit<U+FB01>culty to those who have the necessary apparatus in making
 comparisons with experiment. As to general results, for
  deep water the theory leads to a resistance which increases
  with the velocity, in an oscillating manner, to a maximum
  and then decreases to zero as the velocity is inde<U+FB01>nitely in
  creased.    That the resistance is an oscillating function of the
  velocity has been experimentally found by Mr. W. Froude
  and his son *, to whom also we owe the general explanation
  in terms of the interference of bow and stern waves. But the
    * “On the Leading Phenomena. of the VVnve-making Resistance of
  Ships,” Trans. Inst. Naval Architects, 1881.

 108                Mr. J. H. Michell on the
ultimate vanishing of the resistance has not, so far as I know,
been anticipated. From general considerations it is clear
that, so far as the wave-form is concerned, the effect of
increasing the velocity is the same as that of decreasing the
acceleration of gravity, and, if gravity vanishes, there is no
propagation of waves; but this is not quite the theorem to
be obtained.

    We now consider the solution for qt, in the part of the

at z=0, z=h, y=O.
    The typical term in the solution is
             a cos n (z—h) cos (ma:+ 0:) cos (pg +8),
 where m2+n2+p2=0. Here m must be taken real as the
 water extends from .z'=—oo to x=+oo; n and 17 may be
 either real or imaginary, but if p is imaginary [=1'p’] the
 last factor must take the form e—P'J.
    This term satis<U+FB01>es d¢/dz=0 at 2:11, and it also satis<U+FB01>es

 pure imaginary root given by

 We shall see that the imaginary root is alone responsible
 for the wave-making resistance.            As for p it is always
 imaginary for the real roots of n, and is so for the imaginary
 root if m>n'.

   The result receives some con<U+FB01>rmation from what has been
observed with torpedo-boats at high speeds. It has been
found that the total resistance varies asa )ower of the velocity
which at <U+FB01>rst is nearly the second, but w ich, increasing to a
maximum, ultimately becomes less than the second *. A
very simple investigation, given below, shows that in shallow
water, if we neglect all but the long waves, the wave-resist
ance varies ultimately as the <U+FB01>rst power of the velocity.
   I may mention that somewhat similar work to that of the
present paper gives a theory of the damping of the oscilla
tions of ships due to wave-making.          This I hope to give in a
subsequent paper.

     in the second integral. This form is not required to satisfy
     the boundary conditions formulated above; and it is evident
     that the solution is to a certain extent indeterminate with
     those conditions, for we may superpose any system of free
     waves symmetrical with respect to y=0 on a particular
     solution satisfying them. The form of the factor in question
     is chosen in order to make the elementary diverging waves
     trail aft; in other words, to satisfy the condition that the ship
     advances into still water.
          Leaving the reduction of the integrals on one side, for the
     present, we proceed to calculate the wave-resistance (R).

         As an illustration of the process of calculating the resist
    ance of a given ship at any speed, we may consider one of
    simple analytical form which is fairly ship-shape and easily
    realisable. Experimental con<U+FB01>rmation of the result was not
    practicable, and the matter must be left in the hands of those
    who have the necessary apparatus at command.

then the integral is found to be '620, and the resistance is
                    R = 940 lbs. wt. about.
   This seems to be about what one would expect from the
experimental results available; but I know of no formula with
which to compare it, and experiment alone can decide whether
the theory has numerical value. Of course the method of
successive approximations can be applied if necessary.
   To examine the case of the ship in shallow water in which
all but the long waves are neglected, we may proceed as
follows :—We make the motion steady as before and use the
same set of axes. The pressure-equation gives at the surface
                    g§+vgg =0, as before ;
while the equation of continuity for long waves gives
      if, { (h—§)(—v+ 1%)} + diy { (Ii-g                =0,
 where h is the depth of the water, and this is
                  d;        d2         d2
   Differentiating with respect to m and substituting for ¢
 from the pressure-equation, we obtain

       The form of solution (10) is employed in order to make the
   diverging waves trail aft.
       The disturbance therefore consists of two bands at an
   angle tan“'(c/ VvQ—ce) with the line of the ship’s motion,
   the front of each band being a hump above the mean level
   and its back part a hollow, which is similar to the hump if
   the ship is similarly shaped fore and aft.

      The table of the values of the quotient Kw/K, shows distinctly
  that such a relation does not hold in the case of carbon; further, that
  carbon cannot be at all compared with metals, for While in the
  latter the ratio Kw/Ke varies between 0'07 x 10'5 and 0-12 x 10“, in

  thermal conductivity is 15 to 20 times as much as would be
  deduced from the above ratio by means of the speci<U+FB01>c heat and
  the electrical conductivity. This relation between the two con

                THE GENESIS OF DALTON’S ATOMIC THEORY. ’
                           BY H. DEBUS, PH.D., F.R.S.
      Sir H. Roscoe and Mr. A. Harden have published in the
  Phil. Mag. (March 1897) a paper on the Genesis of Dalton’s
  Atomic Theory, wherein several statements are made against the
  views held by me. These statements of Messrs. Roscoe and
§ Harden are, in my opinion, erroneous. I have fully answered
  them in a paper published in the Zeitschrift                     physikalische

XIII. Electrical Properties of Newly Prepared Gases.
   By JOHN S. TOWNSEND, MA., Cavendish Laboratory,
   Cambridge *.
1. VI‘HE experiments which are described in this paper
           form a continuation to those which have alread
been published in the ‘ Proceedin s of the Cambridge Philo_
sophical Society,’ vol. ix. pt. v. t was there shown that the
gases given off by the electrolysis of sulphuric acid or caustic
potash carry with them an electric char e, a large percentage
of which remains in the gas after it has een bubbled through
a liquid, and passed through glass wool to remove the spray.
Another property of these gases is their power of condensin
moisture to form a cloud. N0 such cloud could be observe<U+FB01>
in newly prepared gases unless they were charged, and,
further, the weight of the cloud was found to be proportional
to the charge on the gas. These results go to show that the
condensation of the moisture is connected with the charge ;
and the experiments described in Section 16 of the above
paper and in Section 19 of this paper prove that when the
cloud is formed in a charged gas the electri<U+FB01>cation resides on
the drops forming the cloud. So that we have de<U+FB01>nite proof
of the fact that the drops are formed round the carriers of
the electric char 0.
   2. These results were used to <U+FB01>nd the charge on each
carrier, and it was found to coincide with what we can

calculate as being the atomic charge, on the supposition that
at ordinary temperature and pressure there are 1020 mole
cules in each cubic centimetre of a gas.      The experiments
giving the weight of the cloud correspondin to the charge
bein of importance were repeated by the f0 lowing method,
whic gave the same proportionalities, in the different gases,
between the charge per 0.0. and weight of cloud per 0.0. as
were reviously obtained.
    3. he apparatus which was used is shown in <U+FB01>g. 1. The
positively-charged oxygen and hydrogen given off from a
                              Fig. 1.
 dilute sulphuric-acid cell were <U+FB01>rst bubbled through a solution
 of potassium iodide in the small <U+FB02>ask A, and then through
 distilled water in B. Both A and B were immersed in a
 trough of water C, so that they should remain at'a <U+FB01>xed
 temperature while an experiment was being conducted. The
 charged gas thus formed a cloud and carried it along the
 delivery-tube D, which led into the paraf<U+FB01>n block P inside a
 large metallic screen S. The block P was arran ed as shown
 in the <U+FB01>gure, in order that the moisture shou d not break
 down the insulation by settling on the paraf<U+FB01>n. By this
 means the moist gas entered the lar er tube '1‘ connected to
 three sulphuric-acid bulbs, F, set uggetween the two paraf<U+FB01>n
 tunnels P and Q. After the gas ad bubbled through the
  acid it was not only cleared of the moisture which under
  ordinary conditions it would have carried from B, but the
  cloud was also completely removed. The increase of weight

                Properties qf Newly Prepared Gases.            127
  in the bulbs thus arises from two causes; and when the
  weight of the moisture necessary to saturate the volume
  of the as which passes through F is subtracted from the
  total, t e weight of the cloud is obtained.         The gas on
  leaving F entered one of the insulated inductors—the smaller
  one G being used for oxygen, and the larger one I for
  hydrogen. The inductor and the bulbs were both covered
  with tinfoil and connected to mercury cups in the paraf<U+FB01>n
  block R, so that either of them could be readily connected
  to the insulated quadrants of the electrometer.
     The ex eriments were conducted in the following manner :—
  The sulphuric-acid bulbs were carefully weighed, and then
  connected by indiarubber tubing to the glass tubes, which
  were imbedded in the paraf<U+FB01>n blocks, as shown in the <U+FB01>gure.
  The current through the cell was switched on for a few
  minutes before joinin the bulbs into the series, so as to drive
  the air out of A and . As soon as the gas began to bubble
  through the acid in F, a stop-watch was started. By con
  necting the conductors F and G alternately to the quadrants
  of the electrometer, the rate at which each was acquiring a
  charge was found. The sum of the charges acquired b
  F and G denotes the total charge passing out of B, and that
  acquired by F divided by the total is the discharging-power
' of the bulbs. After the stream of gas from the cell had been
  running through the apparatus for a suf<U+FB01>cient time, the bulbs
  were removed and dry air was drawn through them before
  weighing them a second time. In each experiment a current
  of 14 amperes was used, which was kept constant by having
  an ammeter and an adjustable resistance in the circuit.
     In order to reduce the readings on the electrometer-scale to
  absolute units, it was found that when F was connected to the
  quadrants, and the other conductors to earth, each scale
  division represented '0040 electrostatic unit of quantity, and
  when G was connected to the quadrants the scale-divisions
  each represented '0036 electrostatic unit. The inductor I,
  which was used with hydrogen, had a larger capacity than
  either .of the other two inductors, and when it was connected
  to the quadrants it re uired '0042 electrostatic unit to make
  the spot of light on t e electrometer-scale move through a
  division.
     The following tables (p. 128) give the results of the experi
  ments which were made with the different gases. 0 is the

the course of the experiment,
per c.c., and p the charge per 0.0. on the gas. The volume v
is easily calculated, as the gas is evolved by a known current.
    Table I. gives the results obtained with positive oxygen.
        In each experiment a current of 14 amperes was
         used, and the stream of the evolved gas passed through
         F for 20 minutes.
    Table II. gives similar results for positively-charged
         hydrogen.
    Table III. refers to negatively-charged oxygen from a
         caustic potash cell, the stream of gas being passed
         through F for 15 minutes in each experiment.
   The experiments were performed with widely di<U+FB02>'erent
densities of electri<U+FB01>cation p, in order to <U+FB01>nd how the weight
of the cloud varied with the electri<U+FB01>cation. The ratio of the
weight of the cloud to the electri<U+FB01>cation, Wzw, is given in
the last column for each experiment. The variations in p were
obtained by varying the temperature of the cell from which
the gas was given o<U+FB01>'. Both in the case of a sulphuric-acid
electrolyte and a caustic-potash electrolyte the charge on the
gas which is evolved by a given current increases as the
 temperature of the electrolyte is raised.
    4. The numbers given in the tables show that in each case
 the weight of the cloud is proportional to the charge, and that
 this proportionality does not vary with the temperature of the
 water from which the cloud is formed, at least within the limits
 of 0° and 14° C. The ratio is not so exact in the case of the
 negative oxygen as it is for the other gases. The only
 chemical difference that was detected was that the former was
 alkaline and the latter slightly acid in its reaction. Since
 the vapour rising from hot caustic potash does not change red
 litmus to blue, the alkalinity of the gas must be due to small
 particles of caustic potash which are carried with the gas from
 the electrolyte and give it an alkaline reaction even after
 bubbling through sulphuric acid ; this could easily be
 detected at all temperatures of the cell by letting the oxygen
 or hydrogen pass along a tube with red litmus.
    The oxygen given 011' by the electrolysis of caustic potash
 has no appreciable charge till the temperature of the cell is up
 to about 20° 0., and the cloud begins to appear at the same
 time as the charge on the gas; so that the presence of the

130             Mr. John S. Townsend on Electrical
alkaline spray can have only a very small effect, as no cloud
 is observed in the oxy en coming from the cell at a tem
perature 10° (1., althoug the presence in the spray of caustic
potash can be easily detected.
    5. The following simple experiments show how intimately
connected the charge on the gas is with the formation of the
cloud :—
    The apparatus used is shown in <U+FB01>g. 2. The oxygen iven off,

speci<U+FB01>c gravity 1'3 was bubbled through a solution of
  otassium iodide in the <U+FB02>ask A, to remove any traces of ozone.
   efore entering the inductor I, the gas bubbled through water
in B. The inductor I was insulated and connected to the
quadrants of the electrometer so that the charge on the gas
that entered it could be read off on the electrometer-scale.
The gas was not passed through any glass wool before entering
I, so that as much spray as possible should be carried from
the cell.
    The cell was at a low temperature (11°) to start with, and a
current of 10 amperes was switched on, which gradually
warmed the electrolyte. During the <U+FB01>rst nine minutes that
the current was on and the gas entering the inductor, no elec
tri<U+FB01>cation whatsoever was detected, and no cloud could be
observed over the water in B. During these nine minutes the
temperature of the cell rose from 11° to 18°.
    During the next <U+FB01>ve minutes a de<U+FB02>exion, nine divisions
negative, was obtained, and the temperature of the cell had
risen to 21°‘5.                                            '

               Properties of Newly Prepared Gases.           131
    At a temperature between 22° and 23° a thin cloud began
 to appear over the water in B, and the spot of light was then
 moving at the rate of four divisions per minute, so that before
 the cloud becomes distinctly visible a small electri<U+FB01>cation of
 about 2 x 10—4 electrostatic units per 0.0. is necessary. When
 the current is continued and the cell becomes hotter, the
electri<U+FB01>cation on the gas increases and the cloud becomes
denser.
    6. In order to show that the cloud disappears when the
charge on the gas is removed, the temperature of the cell was
raised to 48°, and, with the same apparatus as was used for
the last experiment, the three following results were ob
tained :—
    (a) When the gas passes from the cell to the inductor
         without <U+FB01>ltering through glass wool, a dense cloud
         was observed over the water in B, and a de<U+FB02>exion of
         twenty-nine divisions negative per minute was obtained
         as the gas entered I.
    (b) The tube connecting A and B was removed, and a tube
         containing glass wool was substituted. With the same
         current through the cell a slight cloud was seen over
         the water in B, and the de<U+FB02>exion was reduced to six
         divisions per minute.   The electri<U+FB01>cation of the gas
         was thus'reduced to one-<U+FB01>fth of its original value by
         passing through <U+FB01>fteen centimetres of glass wool. The
         amount of spray carried through this length of wool
         must have been extremely small, but the cloud was
         distinctly visible.
   (0) The tube containing the glass wool was heated with a
         Bunsen burner, and its discharging-power was con
         siderably increased, as the spot of light then gave
         only two divisions per minute, and no cloud was
         observed over the water in B.
   It is thus evident that the formation of the cloud and the
presence of the charge are phenomena which accompany one
another.
   7. The clouds which are formed are slightly different in
appearance, and for equal electri<U+FB01>cations those formed in
oxygen are whiter than those formed in hydrogen. A dif
ference is also to be noticed between the positive and negative
oxygen clouds, that formed in the latter being the whiter.
This would point to the fact that the drops formed in the
negative oxygen are larger than those in the positive, and that
those formed in either positive or negative oxygen are larger
than those in the hydrogen. A fairly approximate value for
the radius of the drop may be obtained by observing the rate

1312          Mr. John S. Townsend an Electrical
at which the cloud falls in a vessel. The velocity of the drop
through the gas was obtained by taking two photographs of
the cloud, allowing some minutes to elapse between the two
exposures. Fig. 3 represents two such photographs taken
                              Fig. 3.
 of a cloud formed by bubbling the charged oxygen from a .
 sulphuric-acid electrolyte through water.         Three minutes
 were allowed to elapse between the two exposures, and the
 scale shows that in that time the cloud had fallen between
  nine and ten millimetres. Similar experiments were made
  with the other gases, but in the case of the hydrogen the
  outline of the cloud never became so distinct as it did in the
  oxygen.
     The sizes of the drops were obtained from the formula
  6HpaV=§1raag (Lamb, ‘ Motion of Fluids,’ p. 229).
     This gives for the radius of the drop in the positive oxygen
  6'8x 10‘s, the rate of fall being ten millimetres in three
  minutes, and the radius of the drop in negative oxygen
  7'9 x 104, the rate of fall being eighteen millimetres in four
  minutes.
     We thus know the weight of each drop, and dividing this

              Properties of Newly Prepared Gases.             133
into the weight of the corresponding cloud, we obtain the
number of drops per cubic centimetre.
   When the number of drops is divided into the charge per
cubic centimetre the charge on each is obtained.
   The charge on the positive carrier was thus found to be
2'4 x 10‘“), and that on the negative carrier to be 2'9 x 104°.
When we take into account all the experimental errors, these
two charges may be considered equal and approximately
3x]0_‘°. The charge on the hydrogen was found to be
between one-third and two-thirds of this value, but could not
be arrived at very accurately owing to the dif<U+FB01>culty of <U+FB01>nding
the size of the drop. For present purposes this charge will
be taken as gx 10*”.
   Velocity of the Carrier when acted on by an Electric Force.
   8. It has been shown that the radius of the drop forming
the cloud is in the case of negatively charged oxygen
8 x 10—5, so that its weight is 2 x 10"12 grammes, and when
acted on by gravity it moves at the rate of eighteen milli
metres in four minutes. The force acting on the drop is
practically 2x124, so that it would require an electric
           2 x 10—
force of 3——X  urn, absolute units to produce an equal velo
city, or 2000 volts per centimetre. As we are only dealing
with small electromotive forces it is evident that we may
disregard the effect of mutual repulsion of the carriers when
the gas is carrying a cloud. When the gas is bubbled
through sulphuric acid the radius of the carrier is so much
reduced that the effect of the mutual repulsion of the par
ticles carrying the charge is easily detected.
   9. The following is a general method of investigating the
motion of a gas in a vessel of any shape, the initial distri
bution being uniform. Let_ p be the density of electri<U+FB01>cation
in any part of the gas, u, v, and w the velocities of the carriers
along t e axes of w, y, and z.

where p0 is the initial density, which is uniform throughout
the space considered.
   Equation (2) shows that the motion takes place in such a
way that the density p is a function of the time only, and
does not vary from point to point in the gas ; on this account
no variation in the pressure of the charged gas takes place,
and the terms 3%, 5—5, 3—5 , which have in general to be taken
account of when dealing with the motion of gases, can be
omitted in equations (1) since p does not vary from point to
P Oint.
   When the gas is in a closed vessel the mutual repulsion of
the carriers of the electricity drives them to the sides, where
they either remain so close to the walls that they cannot be
blown out, or else get discharged against the sides. The
charged gas remaining in the vessel has a uniform density given
by equation (2), and if the vessel which contains it is an in
sulated conductor connected to .a pair of quadrants of an
electrometer the de<U+FB02>exion on the electrometer-scale will be
proportional to p when the charged gas is blown out of the
vessel.                   ._
   10. In order to investigate experimentally the rate at which
the gas loses its charge to the sides of an inductor, or in other
words to <U+FB01>nd how the density p will vary with the time, a
metal cylinder 0 (<U+FB01>g. 4), 30'2 centimetres long and 1'6 centi
metres in diameter, was used. The two ends of the cylinder
<U+FB01>tted into paraf<U+FB01>n blocks, P1 and P2, into which were also
<U+FB01>xed the glass tubes T1 and T2. The tube T1, through which
the cylinder was <U+FB01>lled, had several layers of <U+FB01>ne copper
gauze across the broad end, which tended to distribute the

136            Mr. John S. Townsend an Electrical
more than <U+FB01>ve minutes at a time, when a. number of experi
ments have to be performed requiring the same electri<U+FB01>cation
in each case.
   The gases were <U+FB01>rst bubbled through potassium iodide and
then through strong sul huric acid, so that they should enter
the tube D perfectly diy. The cylinder and tubing con
nected with it were thoroughly dried by heating them with
a Bunsen-burner and then blowing dry air through them.
This precaution is absolutely necessary as it only requires
a very slight amount of moisture to form a cloud, and this
would impede the motion of the carriers.
   12. A series of experiments of the following type were
then performed. The cylinder was connected to a pair of
qliliadrants of the electrometer, which were kept to earth while
t e cylinder was being <U+FB01>lled and insulated before blowing
out the as, so as to get the readings on the same part of the
scale.      he tube A was closed, and D connected to the
delivery-tube of the sulphuric-acid wash-bottle, and a current
of fourteen amperes sent through the cell. It only required
the current to run for about <U+FB01>ve minutes to completely <U+FB01>ll C
with the charged gas.       The circuit was then broken and the
tube B closed. At the same time a stop-watch was started.
After the lapse of t minutes the ends A and B are opened,
and dry unelectri<U+FB01>ed air blown through C to expel the
charged gas.       This caused the spot of light on the electro
meter-scale to move n divisions, which is proportional to p
the density of the electri<U+FB01>cation after the gas has remained
in the cylinder for a time t.
   The numbers thus obtained for n and t are given in
Tables IV. and V., the <U+FB01>rst being for charged hydrogen and
the second for charged oxygen.

an electric force can be found from the above numbers.
The electrometer having been standardized it was found that

From the equation kV=Fe, which is similar to the equa
tions (1) (§ 9), V being the velocity due to an electromotive
force F, we obtain for the motion of the charged carrier in
hydrogen V: 1:2, and for the motion of the charged carrier
in oxygen V=           Hence under an electromotive force of
one volt per centimetre, the hydrogen carrier travels at the
             l            .
rate of W centimetrris per second, and the oxygen
carrier at the rate of      x 1—50entimetres per second. These
results do not require a knowledge of e.
   The conclusions arrived at from the above investi ations
are based on the assumption that in each case we are gealing
with a gas containing carriers all charged with the same
sign, either positive or negative. Experiments on conduc
tivity have been carried out in order to test this point, and it
has been found that we are in reality dealing with mixtures.
Thus in the case of oxygen, or hydrogen, from a sulphuric
acid cell havin a positive charge equal to 3 e, it is possible
to obtain from t e gas a positive charge of 4 e and a negative
charge of e. If we suppose the positive and negative to act
independently the charge on the oxygen carrier would be
5 . lO“1° instead of 3 . 10—“), also the velocities under a volt
per centimetre would be smaller in the ratio of 3: 4 than
those given above.
   We can arrive at an approximate value for the size of the
carrier if we assume that the viscosity of a gas a<U+FB01>'ects'the
motion of a small sphere and a large one according to the
same law 67”“; V=P (Lamb, loc. cit.) ; substituting

we get for the radius, a, of the hydrogen carrier 4'5 . 10—7.
Similar substitutions give the radius of the oxygen carrier

             Properties of Newly Prepared Gases.            139
12 . 10".    Hence the carriers are large compared with mole
cular dimensions.
   The velocities obtained for the carriers in the conductivity
due to Rontgen rays are far greater than the above. Thus
for oxygen and hydrogen Mr. Rutherford obtains velocities
of 5'2 and 1'4 centimetres per second under a, volt per
centimetre (Phil. Mag. Nov. 1897).
   If we assume that the charges on the carriers are of the
same order as those obtained in Section 7, we see that the
dimensions of the carriers are smaller than those with which
we are here dealing.
                The Discharging Power of Tubes.
    14. It has been shown that if a gas with a uniform charge
120 per 0. c. be left in a tube for a time t, the density
 of the electri<U+FB01>cation falls to a uniform value p, given by
 the equation p: 1 fZPOt where a is a constant.      Now, if we
 suppose that the velocity of a gas as it passes along a tube
be perfectly uniform, and that no discharging takes place
 due to accidental circumstances, the values of t, p, and p0
would be connected by the same equation, where now t
 denotes the time that any portion of the gas takes to traverse
 the tube, p0 and p being the densities of electri<U+FB01>cation on
 entering and escaping from the tube. When the gas is given
 off by a current through an electrolyte, the volume q “hich
 enters the tube per second is known when the current is
 known; so that t= X where V is the volume of the tube,
                        9
 and the above equation becomes Po-P= (WW The values of
                                     P     , 9
 p0 and p are easily found and satisfy thls equation roughly,
 so that a can be determined; its value, however, is greater
 than gar—e found already.   This is due to accidental discharg
 ing, as it can be shown that, even when the carrier is so
 large that the small E.M.F. driving it to the side of the
 tube could have no appreciable effect, still a measurable
 discharge takes place (see Section 21).
    15. If the gas be run into an insulated inductor after
 traversing the tube, Po—P is the ratio of the charge gained
 per minute by the tube to the charge gaineddper minute by
 the inductor. These charges can be easily foun by connecting
 the tube and inductor alternately to the insulated quadrants

140            Mr. John S. Townsend on Electrical
of an electrometer. The tube C insulated in the manner
described in Section 10 was used in these experiments, the
gas examined being the hydrogen given off by a current of
fourteen amperes from a dilute sulphuric-acid electrolyte.
The following de<U+FB02>exions n, and n, were obtained, n1 being
the de<U+FB02>exion per minute when the tube is connected to the
insulated quadrants, and n, the de<U+FB01>exion per minute when
the inductor is connected to the insulated quadrants:—
                           nl.          n2.   5

                           9'5          36
   The relative value of n1 and 11;, in absolute units of quantity
was 12 : 13'5, so that <U+FB02> =%_
                                   13'5ng'
   We thus obtain the following numbers showing the con
nexion between Alp—p and p0 :—
                   w P             .0.      {is

so that POLE is (within 5 per cent.) proportional to the
 densities of the electri<U+FB01>cation.
    16. Similar values were obtained for po— p and p for the
 oxygen given off from the same electrolyte by a current of
 fourteen amperes. A different method was used in this case,
 which did not require an inductor. When the tube 0
 (experiment, Section 10) was being <U+FB01>lled with a charged
 gas, which enters with an electri<U+FB01>cation p0 and escapes with
an electri<U+FB01>cation p, the quantity pO—p can be obtained by
observing the rate (111 per minute) at which the spot of light
 moves on the electrometer-scale, when the tube is full of
 the charged gas and the stream kept running through it.
 The mean density of electri<U+FB01>cation in the tube is practically

and observing the de<U+FB02>exiou 11,, which is proportional to

    The rate g at which the gas is supplied to the tube is '85
cubic centimetres per second; so that (po—p)x51 is the
charge given to the tube per minute as the gas passes through
it and is proportional to n1, and P0 + P x V is proportional to
                                          2
11,, where V, the volume of the tube, is 60'4 cubic centi
metres.
    Thus we get the following values for pgplg and p0 :—
                    urr             p,        Pol

    17. The ratio plig was also found to increase when the
 current through the electrolyte diminished, thus showing
 that the ratio depended upon the rate at which the as is
 supplied to the tube. Another tube of equal length an 1'12
 centimetres in diameter was examined by similar methods,
 and it was found to have a far less discharging- ower than
 the larger tube, so that, when the supply 9 an density p0
 are given, the smaller the bore of the tubing that is used to
 convey the gas from one vessel to another, the less will be
 the loss of the charge.         The above results showing the
 dependence of P0_P on p0 are important, as we see from the
    Phil. Zlfag. S. 5. Vol. 45. No. 273. Feb. 1898.     M

142           Mr. John S. Townsend an Electrical
formula              XM    that the increase in the charge due
                  k
to heating the cell arises from an increase in the number of
carriers with the same charge, and not from an increase of
the charge on the carriers already present; for, if the
increase in density were due to an increase in e, we should
have found po—p to be proportional to the square of po.
   18. It would be almost impossible to arran e to pass the
gas along a tube in such a way that the discharging-power
would be as small as the theoretical value, calculated from
the numbers given for In (Section 13). Small differences in
temperature between the gas and the sides of the tube, and
other effects which would give rise to currents in the gas,
considerably increase the discharging-power, but here a com
paratively small effect on the loss of charge when the gas is
allowed to stand in the tube. The velocity of the carrier
towards the sides of the tube, due to an electromotive force,
will on this account he too large when calculated from the
formula w= p        k x
                  472
   Thus, when we substitute the values given in Sections 15
16 for Fog-p and pO, we obtain for k the values: kH=3eH, and
k0 =    eo
        C'auses which In<U+FB02>uence the Discharging Power.
   19. In the above experiments the gases were always
treated in the same way before entering the tube 0, being
bubbled <U+FB01>rst through a solution of' potassium iodide, and then
through strong sulphuric acid. When the gases are bubbled
through water instead of sulphuric acid, they will enter 0
carrying with them a cloud, the effect of gravity upon which
makes itself very apparent by comparing the charges acquired
per minute by the tube when in the vertical and horizontal
positions.   Thus in the case of a stream of highly charged
hydrogen, which bubbled through water before entering C,
it was found that the charge acquired wa fourteen scale
divisions per minute as the gas passed through 0 in the
vertical position ; and forty-seven divisions per minute with
C in the horizontal position. The electric capacity of the
conductor, consisting of C and the quadrants, was not altered
by more than three per cent. by turning the tube round, so
that the large increase in the discharging-power must have

              Properties of Newly Prepared Gases.               143
 been caused nearly entirely by the force of gravity acting on
 the drops forming the cloud. The experiment shows that the
 charge resides on the drops forming the cloud.
    A similar result was obtained in the case of charged oxygen
carrying a cloud; the corresponding numbers of divisions of
 the scale being 4 and 20, showed that <U+FB01>ve times the charge
is removed by the tube when it is turned from the vertical to
 the horizontal position.
   ,Rough values for the size of the drop might be deduced
from these numbers ; but the variations in density per 0. 0.
 (due to the cloud) are so great, that it would be impossible to
arrive at satisfactory values, especially in the case of hydrogen,
where the weight of the cloud can be as great as 4th of the
weight of the gas in the same volume.
   20. Even when the gas has been bubbled throu h sul
phuric acid before entering C, a slight effect of this iind is
still to be found. Thus, when the tube is turned from a
vertical to a horizontal position, the charge acquired by
it per minute increases from 16 to 19 divisions of the elec
trometer-scale per minute. If the coei<U+FB01>cient of viscosity
can, even roughly, be applied as in Section 13 to determine
the size of the carrier, the effect of gravity could not exert
on a carrier a force that would cause it to move through the
gas surrounding it with a velocity of the same order as 33);,
centimetre per second.      In fact, if we take the density of
the carrier to be unity, its radius should be as big as 3 . 10-5
in order that the force of gravity should make it move with
a velocity 56—6 centimetre per second, in hydrogen; whereas
we have found that its radius is of the order 5. 10—7 (Sec
tion 13).
   But if, instead of considering a single carrier, we take
the case of a <U+FB01>nite quantity of gas (occupying unit volume
say) as differing from the surrounding gas by '05 per cent.
in density, which could arise from various causes, a vertical
motion far greater than the above would ensue, which would
affect the discharging-power of a horizontal tube.
   The gases can be sent through a tube containing phos
phorus pentoxide, after bubbling through sulphuric acid, so
as to remove all traces of moisture, and if the powder is
placed loosely in a horizontal tube about 8 centimetres long,
with glass wool at the ends to prevent dust being carried
alon , not more than half the charge on the gas will be lost.‘
TheIiydrogen when dried in this manner loses more of its
charge, in passin along the vertical tube C, than if it had
been dried by su huric acid alone ; but the loss of charge
was not found to be increased by turning the tube from they
vertical to the horizontal position.

   21. The discharging-power of a tube in a vertical position
is, as we should expect, greatly diminished by having the gas
moist, as the electric force is then too small to have any
appreciable effect in causing the drops to move towards the
sides. Thus, in an experiment similar to that explained in
Section 15, the hydrogen, instead of being bubbled through
sulphuric acid before entering C, was bubbled through water,
and it was found that when G acquired a charge of fourteen
per minute, the inductor acquired seventy-<U+FB01>ve per minute;
Whereas if a similarly charged dry gas had been used, C would
have acquired a charge at the rate of twenty-eight per
minute, and the inductor at the rate of sixty-two.
   The same property holds in the case of charged oxygen.
Thus when the gas carries a cloud, only four divisions per
minute were acquired by C, whereas a similarly char ed dry
gas would have given seven divisions per minute.       he loss
of charge of the clouded gas in passing throu h a vertical
tube is due to the unevenness in the motion and t e accidental
contact of the cloud with the sides.
                           Di<U+FB01>'usion.
   22. Experiments were performed on the di<U+FB02>'usion of charged
gases in order to <U+FB01>nd out whether any of the charge can pass
through porous earthenware. The apparatus which was used
in these experiments is shown in <U+FB01>g. 5. It consists of
two cylinders, the outer Q was of tin, and the inner P was
a porous porcelain vessel <U+FB01>xed by means of corks (C) to the
tin cylinder. The porous vessel had one aperture which was
<U+FB01>tted with an indiarubber stopper carryin two tubes pro
jecting through the sides of Q at D1 an D2. The tube
T was broken, and <U+FB01>tted with a para<U+FB02>'in tunnel for purposes
of insulation, and the tube U dipped into a sulphuric-acid
bottle, and so acted as a manometer. The outer cylinder had
two apertures at E and F; the tube R from E led into a
large insulated inductor; and the tube from F was connected
through a paraf<U+FB01>n tunnel to the delivery-tube of a sulphuric
acid bottle.
   Before performing an experiment it is necessary to
thoroughly dry the whole apparatus ; this was done by blow
ing dry air through T and F.      The charged hydrogen from
a sulphuric-acid electrol to was dried and allowed to enter
the cylinder P through
    The bellows are connected to the tube S, and a gentle
current of air is blown into the c linder through F.      The
cylinder Q is connected to earth, an the inductor into which

inductor. The sulphuric acid in U during the course of the
ex eriment rose in the tube, showing that the hydrogen
diffused as quickly as the tube T supplied it.
    Onlya very small fraction of the original charge was found
to be on the gas after di<U+FB02>'usion, as the de<U+FB02>exion per minute,
as the di<U+FB01>'used as enters I, was found to be less than 2 per
cent. of the de exion obtained by allowing the gas to enter
I directly.
    23. Having seen that the hydrogen in diffusing carries
with it no appreciable charge, it is interesting to know
whether the electricity is carried to the sides and gets

146              Mr. John S. Townsend on Electrical
caught in the pores of the porcelain, or whether the carriers
remain distributed throughout their original volume sur
rounded by the air which di<U+FB02>'uses in to take the place of the
hydrogen.                                             .
   In order to test this the whole apparatus was insulated
and experiments were conducted as follows :—
   The outside cylinder Q was connected to the insulated
quadrants of the electrometer and the hydrogen from the
cell, after bubbling through strong sulphuric acid, was ad
mitted into P by means of the tube T.         The draught of air
between P and Q was maintained in order to make the
diffusion as rapid as possible ; no inductor was used, so that
the hydrogen after diffusion was carried into the atmosphere
of the room through F. As the charged gas entered P, the
conducting cylinder Q being connected to the quadrants, the
de<U+FB02>exion on the electrometer-scale registered the total charge
that entered P.
   When a su<U+FB02>icient charge had entered P, the tube T was
closed and the sulphuric acid in the manometer U rose rapidly
and showed a maximum difference of pressure between the
atmosphere inside and outside P of about three centimetres
of acid. As the blowing into E was continued the sulphuric
acid in U began to fall gradually, and in a few minutes
the difference of pressure was reduced to one or two milli
metres, which showed that practically all the hydrogen had
diffused out.
   The question was then decided by observing what charge
could be blown out of P by blowing through T, and it was
 found that a large fraction of the original charge could be
thus removed from inside P. The charge which is thus
blown out does not'represent quite all the electricity left in
the atmosphere in P after the hydrogen had diffused out, as
about ten per cent. got discharged in bubbling through the
 sulphuric acid before escaping through U.
   The numbers obtained in three experiments which were
 performed in the above manner are given in the following
 table : n, is the charge (in divisions of the scale) put into P ;

 t, the time in minutes required to admit the charge; h, the
 maximum height in centimetres that the sulphuric acid rises
in U after the tube T is closed ; t2 the time that elapses while the
 manometer falls from h, to h2; and n, the charge that is
blown out of P. The current through the electrolyte was in
each case fourteen amperes.
    In the last experiment the charge on the gas was reduced
by passing it through a tube of phosphorus pentoxide before
it entered T.
    \Ve thus see that the carriers of the electricity in the
 charged hydrogen can with case be transferred to an atmo
sphere of any other gas by diffusion. Also, by continuing
the stream of hydrogen into P, the density of the charge in
P increases, so that diffusion not only affords a method of
removing a charge from a gas, but also gives us a means of
increasing the electri<U+FB01>cation per unit volume.
              Experinun‘s with Ilydrochloric Acid.
    24. When gases are given off by electrolysis both the
quantity and sign of the electricity which they carry are
affected by various causes. These changes which the charge
undergoes are well illustrated by a series of experiments which
were performed with a twenty-per-cent. solution of hydro
chloric acid.
    The electric state of the gases was examined by leading
them into an insulated inductor, connected to one pair of
   uadrants of an electrometer.      The other pair of quadrants,
the case of the electrometer, and the screen inside which the
inductor was placed, were connected to earth.
    The hydrogen was bubbled through a strong solution of
caustic potash and the chlorine through water, before entering
the inductor.
    25. The charge carried by the hydrogen evolved from
a hydrochloric-acid electrolyte varies in a very peculiar
manner. When new carbon electrodes are used and the
current turned on, the electrometer shows that the gas, at
<U+FB01>rst, has a positive charge, but although the current is
kept constant, this charge diminishes gradually, and after
some minutes becomes negative ; it soon reaches its maximum
negative value, and the charge then remains constant, except
for a small variation due to temperature. When the electro
1 to is cooled, and the same current again sent through
the acid, the hydrogen begins to come off with a negative
charge.
    26. The chlorine which has been evolved from the positive

148            Mr. John S. Townsend on Electrical
electrode will be seen to have dissolved in the acid not only
round the positive electrode, but also round the negative,
before the change of sign is observed in the hydrogen. If
new this acid be removed from G and the electrodes well
washed, and a fresh quantity of acid used, it will be found
that the electrometer will indicate charges on the hydrogen
exactly similar to those at <U+FB01>rst observed, except that the
positive char es are not so large.
    After was ing the electrodes a second time, and experi
 menting again with a fresh quantity of acid, the same effect
 will be observed without any further diminution in the positive
charges.
    The number of divisions of the scale obtained in an experi
ment of this kind are :—
                 1st minute, 14 divisions positive.
                 2nd     ,,   11     ,,       97
                 3rd    ,,     5     ,,       77
 After a few minutes the hydrogen came off with a negative
 charge, corresplonding to <U+FB01>ve divisions per minute. The
 current throu      the electrolyte being ten amperes, and the
 value of divisions on the electrometer-scale in absolute units
 of uantity being obtained by multipling them by '003.
       hen the chlorine was similarly examined it was found
 to have a small negative charge, correspondin to four
 divisions of the electrometer-scale per minute. It did not
 vary in sign like the charge on the hydrogen.
    27. It is probable that the remarkable change of sign
 that occurs in the charge carried by the hydrogen is due
 more to the absorption of chlorine gas by the carbon elec
 trode, than to the presence of chlorine gas in the electrolyte;
 for when platinum electrodes were used the hydrogen was
 given off with a large positive charge and did not change
 when the chlorine got dissolved in the electrolyte.
    It is improbable that the effect is due merely to the change
 from platinum to carbon, as there was no corresponding
 change when similar experiments were performed with sul
   huric acid; the positive charge on the hydrogen evolved
 <U+FB01>eing large whether platinum or carbon terminals were used ;
 and no change occurred by running the current for half-an
 hour, except a gradual increase in the charge, which can be
 shown to be due to a rise in temperature.       It was also found
 that the charge on the hydrogen was increased by usin a
 new carbon electrode, instead of that used with the hydgm
 chloric acid.

              Properties of Newly Prepared Gases.             149
    28. In this case of' direct electrol sis where no secondary
action takes place, or other chemical}, effects at the electrode
considerations of polarization would lead us to expect that
gases would come off carrying with them a charge of the
same sign as that which they carry in the electrolyte. Thus
in the case of polarization due to a layer of' hydrogen with
a positive charge surrounding the electrode, it is conceivable
that, when the evolution of hydrogen takes place, some of
the gas composing this layer would come off without losing
its charge.
    29. In seeking to explain the changes of sign that occur,
as in the case of' the hydro en evolved from hydrochloric acid,
 it must be remembered t at, once the gas has acquired a
 charge, only a small quantity of' electricity is lost by bubbling
 through liquids, so that causes which in<U+FB02>uence the sign of
 the charge should most naturally be sought for at the place
 where the gas is being evolved, and may be due to the state
 of the electrode or to impurities in the electrolyte in the
immediate vicinity of the electrode.             .
    30. There are some well-known phenomena which point to
 an explanation of the results obtained with hydrochloric acid,
 namely, the electri<U+FB01>cation of' gases by glowing metals
  (J. J. Thomson, Phil. Mag. Dec. 1896).       The typical effects
 of this kind are, the positive electri<U+FB01>cation of oxy en wh<n
 a metal is being oxidized, and the negative electri<U+FB01>cation of
 hydrogen when blown past a hot oxidized metal; the metal
 in the former case uniting more readily with the negative
 oxygen atoms, and the oxygen in the latter uniting more
 readily with the positive hydrogen atoms. The only necessity
 for the high temperature of the metal is to break up some of'
 the molecules of the gas into atoms, but in the cases we are
 dealing with the gases at the electrode are already in the
 atomic state. We should therefore expect somewhat similar
 effects to take place when the gases which are evolved can
 form chemical compounds with the electrode, or with bodies
 either dissolved in it or in its immediate vicinity.
     31. If' the above principles are applied to the case of
 hydrochloric acid, we should expect when the gases are
 evolved b electrolysis, that the hydrogen would carry a
 positive charge, and the chlorine a negative charge. The
  subsequent change from positive to negative, in the case of
 the hydro en, can be explained by supposing a small quantity
  of hydroc loric acid to be formed at the negative electrode,
  due to the action of' the nascent hydrogen on the chlorine,
  and that the positive hydrogen atom is more active in forming
 a compound with chlorine than the negative. A similar

 150     On Electrical Properties q)" Newly Prepared Gases.
 explanation would apply to the change which occurs from
 negative to positive in the charge carried by the chlorine
 when platinum is used instead of carbon for an electrode,
 since a chloride of platinum is formed.
   32. The charged hydrogen given off from a platinum elec
trode, in the electrolysis of hydrochloric acid, has the same
property of forming a cloud when bubbled through water as
the highly charged gases obtained by other methods. The
chlorine, however, has only a small charge, and, moreover,
contains a quantity of hydrochloric-acid vapour which would
be dif<U+FB01>cult to remove without making the charge too small
to form a visible cloud. The hydrogen was treated in the
following manner, in order to get rid of the acid vapour
which would form a cloud when bubbled through water :-The
delivery-tube from the cell was connected to the tube T,
which dipped into a strong solution of caustic potash con
tained in the <U+FB02>ask H1, and the gas then passed along a tube
containin glass wool soaked in caustic potash before it
bubbled t rough the water in the <U+FB02>ask H2. The hydrogen
which was evolved from the platinum electrode, after passing
through this apparatus, was led into an insulated inductor
connected to the electrometer, and, with ten amperes through
the electrolyte, the spot of light on the electrometer-scale
was de<U+FB02>ected thirty-seven divisions per minute, and with
fourteen amperes, sixty-two divisions per minute, the tem
perature of the cell being 36°. In both cases a dense cloud
was observed above the water in H2.
   In order to test the ef<U+FB01>ciency of the apparatus for removing
the acid vapour, and at the same time to show that newly
prepared hydrogen does not form a visible cloud unless it has
a considerable charge, the gas evolved from the carbon
electrode was led into H2. It was found that the electrometer
was giving only three divisions per minute, and no cloud
could be seen over the surface of the water in H2, althou h
the temperature of the cell and current through it were tIie
same as when thirty-seven divisions per minute were obtained
by using a platinum electrode.
   No weighing experiments were done with this cloud, but
from its appearance it could be easily seen to be less dense
than that which was obtained by bubbling hydrogen prepared
from a sulphuric-acid electrolyte through water, although the
electri<U+FB01>cation was in each case the same.
   In addition to the above experiments, the effect of
Rbntgen rays in discharging the gas has been examined. It
is hoped that the results of this investigation, and the experi

  ments on conductivity alluded to in Section 13, will be ready

      In conclusion, I desire to express m thanks to Professor
  Thomson for the valuable assistance his suggestions have
  atforded .
  XIV. On the Calculation of the Conductivity of Aqueous
      Solutions containing Two Electrolytes with no Common Ion.
      By Prof. J. G. MACGREGOR and Mr. E. H. ARCHIBALD,
      Dalhousie College, Ilalifaz', .N.S.*
  ACCORDING to the dissociation theory of electrolysis the
         - speci<U+FB01>c conductivity of a complex solution, volume v of
  which contains N1, N2, N3, &c., gramme-equivalents of the
  electrolytes 1, 2, 3, 810., respectively, is given by the expression
               1
              v— (“1N1l1'w1 +“2N2/bw2 +a3N3/Ima + &c.),
  where the a’s are the coef<U+FB01>cients of ionization of the electro
  lytes and the um’s their speci<U+FB01>c conductivities per gramme
  equivalent at in<U+FB01>nite dilution. If the quantities involved in
  this expression can be determined in the case of any solution,
  its conductivity can be calculated.
      Since but little change in the ionic velocities of one electro
  lyte in a solution can be produced by small quantities of
  others, the value of a, for an electrolyte in a complex solution
  may be taken to be the same as in a simple solution, provided
  the complex solution be su<U+FB01>iciently dilute. Hence for such
  solutions, the ua’s of the above expression may be determined
  by observations of conductivity made on suf<U+FB01>ciently extended
  series of simple solutions of 1, 2, 3, 8:0.
      In a former paper by one of us'l' it has been shown that
  equations suf<U+FB01>cient for the determination of the a’s and the
  N’s may be obtained, provided the following assum )tlODS be
  admissible, viz., (1) that any dissolved electrolyte, w ich is in
  dissociational e uilibrium, may be regarded as being in this
_ state not only t oughout the whole volume of the solution,
  but also throughout any <U+FB01>nite part of it, and (2) that each
  electrolyte in a complex solution, with its undissociated and
  its dissociated parts, though disseminated throughout the
  whole volume, may be re arded as occupying a de<U+FB01>nite
  portion of the volume, whic may be spoken of as its region.
  It would follow from these assumptions that the law of
  equilibrium may be applied either to one such region or to

152         Messrs. MacGregor and Archibald on the
the regions of two or more electrolytes which have common
ions.
    We restrict ourselves here to solutions containing two
electrolytes with no common ion, which therefore will in
general contain also two other electrolytes formed from the
former by double decomposition. We may refer to the
former electrolytes as l and 2, and to the latter as 3 and 4.
 1 and 2 will have no common ion ; nor therefore will 3 and 4.
    The application of the law of equilibrium to electrolyte 1
throughout its own region and throughout the regions occu
pied by it and 3, and by it and 4, gives the equations :—
                 “1/V1=“2/V2=“s/Va=a4/V4a - - - - (a)
where the a’s are the ionization coef<U+FB01>cients of the respective
 electrolytes, and the V’s their regional dilutions, i. e., the
volumes of their regions divided by their content in gramme
equivalents of electrolyte. These equations are obtained b
the same reasoning, mutatis mutandis, as that by which
Arrhenius* showed that equality in the concentration of ions
is the condition which must be ful<U+FB01>lled in order that two
dilute simple solutions of electrolytes with a common ion may
undergo no change of ionization on being mixed. They need
not therefore be deduced here.
   Another equation may be obtained by applying the law of
equilibrium, in addition, to each electrolyte throughout the
whole solution, viz., the equation
                              1711’ =vav4;
where the 0’s are the volumes of the regions of the respective
electrolytes. This equation may also be written

of dissociational equilibrium we have also one expressing the
equality of the volume v of the solution to the sum of the
volumes of the regions occupied by the electrolytes, viz.,
                Nlvl + N2V2 + N3V3 + N4         4: 'U. n    n
   We have also equations stating that the ionic concentra
tions at a given temperature depend only upon the regional
dilutions, viz.,
  a1/V1= 1(Vllr “2/V2= 2072), “3/V3=f3(v3)7 a4/V4= 4(V4),                 o (d)

by means of conductivity observations on simple solutions
of the respective electrolytes, provided we may assume that

  the relation between ionization and regional dilution in a
  complex solution is the same as between ionization and
. dilution in a simple solution.                        -
      Finally, from the nature of the process of double decom
    osition, if n1 and n, are the numbers of gramme-equivalents
  of 1 and 2 added to water in preparing the solution, we have
  the equations :
             71l=N1+N3, n9=Ng+N4, andN3=N,. . . (e)
      We have thus twelve equations for determining the four
  a’s, the four V’s, and the four N’s involved in them.
      The functions, f, are too complex to admit of an algebraical
  solution of these equations. Were it possible to measure con
  ductivity with suf<U+FB01>cient exactness, however, it would be
  possible to solve them by a partially graphical process. For
  this purpose, reducing equations (b), (e), and (e) to two, we
  should have
             N3=(v—V1n1—V2ng)/(v3+V4—Vl—V2),
             N32(V3V4/V1V2—1)+N3(n1+n9)=nlng. .           - . . .
  We may apply equations (d) by drawing curves which give
  the relation of concentration of ions to dilution for simple
  solutions of the electrolytes. We may then apply equations
   (a) by reading off from these curves the dilutions (V1, V,, &c.)
  of simple solutions having what we may guess at as being the
  concentration of ions of the complex solution. We may then
  determine N, from (1) and see if this value is, <U+FB01>rst, a possible
  value, and, if so, secondly, one that will satisfy (2). If,
  though a possible value, it will not satisfy (2), we must make
  another, and this time a more intelligent, guess, and so on,
  until a value of the concentration of ions has been selected
  giving values of V1, V,, &c. which will satisfy both ( l) and
   (2), when, N, bein thus determined, N1, N2, and N4 may be
  found, and all the data required for calculation are known.
      We have tried this method but without a satisfactory
  result. The denominator in expression (1) is a small quantity,
  and even when the curves referred to above are drawn with
  the best available data as to conductivity, it is affected by too
  large an error.
      It is possible, however, by the aid of the above equations
  to determine the constitution of a complex solution with a
  known concentration of ions and therefore a calculable con
  ductivity, to prepare the solution, and measure its conductivity,
  and thus to apply a somewhat severe test to the dissociation
  theory as a working hypothesis.
      For this purpose select a low value of the concentration of

154         Messrs. MacGregor and Archibald on the.
ions (that the solution may be dilute) and read off from the
experimental curves referred to above, the values of the
dilutions, V1, V2, &c., of simple solutions of l, 2, &c., which
will have this concentration of ions. If these solutions be
prepared and mixed in proper proportions as to volume, no
change in ionization or composition will occur.            To <U+FB01>nd the
proper proportions, select arbitrarily any value of 2:4, the
volume of the solution of 4 which is to be mixed with the
others.    It will contain N4=v,/V4 gramme-equivalents of 4.
From equations (e)'we must have N3=N,. Hence the
volume of the solution of 3 to be mixed with the others will
be 03=V3v4/V4. Next select arbitrarily any value of 1),.
Then since by (b) we must have vlv,=v3v,,
                       0]. = lava/1’2 = Val’42/V4v2
These volumes being mixed, we have a complex solution in
which the a’s and N’s are known, the conductivity of which is
therefore calculable by the dissociation theory.
    A series of observations and calculations of the conductivity
of solutidns containing sodium and potassium chlorides and
sulphates has been made by the second of us with the object
of testing the calculability of the conductivity in such cases.
As a full account" of these experiments is to be published
elsewhere it will be unnecessary here to enter into detail.
They were made by Kohlrausch’s method, with fairly good
though not the best appliances, and full use was made of the
experience of other observers as to precautions against error.
Taking account of all sources of error, the measurements of
conductivity may probably be regarded as accurate to about
0'25 per cent.
    The following tables give the observations made on simple
solutions of the salts mentioned for the purpose of obtaining
data for drawing the curves referred to above. Dilutions are
expressed in litres per gramme-equivalent. The conductivities
are speci<U+FB01>c molecular conductivities (i. e. per gramme-equiva
lent), and are expressed in terms of 10‘8 times the conductivity
of mercury at 0° C. All solutions were prepared and all
observations made at 18° C. The values of the ionization
coe<U+FB01>i‘cient used in calculating the concentration of ions are
quotients of the speci<U+FB01>c molecular conductivity observed by
Kohlrausch’s valuesT of the speci<U+FB01>c molecular conductivity
at in<U+FB01>nite dilution.

        It will be seen that the differences between observed and
    calculated values range from 0'7 to 0'2 per cent.; that the
    larger differences occur in the case of the more concentrated
    solutions and for the most part have the same sign, and that
    in the case of the more dilute solutions the differences are
    either within or but little beyond the limit of error of the
    observed values and are about equally distributed as to
    sign. For the stronger solutions it was to be expected that
    the differences would be beyond the limit of observational
    error; because (1) the ratios of the speci<U+FB01>c molecular con
    ductivity to the speci<U+FB01>c molecular conductivity at in<U+FB01>nite
     dilution, which were taken to be equal to the ionization

(2) the     value of the speci<U+FB01>c molecular conductivity at
in<U+FB01>nite dilution for an electrolyte in a mixture may be
taken to be the same as the value determined by experi
ments on a simple solution, only at in<U+FB01>nite dilution. It was
to be expected also that, except for the accumulation of acci
dental errors, the differences in the case of the stronger solu'
tions would have the same sign ; for the errors in the values
of the a’s and the am’s would have the same signs for different
solutions. When we consider the large number of sources of
error involved in the determination of the constituent solu-l
tions, the preparation of the mixtures, and the <U+FB01>nding of their
conductivity, the agreement between the observed and the
calculated values in the case of the weaker solutions must be
regarded as quite satisfactory, and as warranting the conclu
sion that it is possible by the aid of the dissociation theory to
calculate the conductivrty of dilute aqueous solutions contain?
ing sodium chloride and potassium sulphate, and therefore
also sodium sulphate and potassium chloride, within the limit
of observational error.
   XV. T/re Failure of German Silver and Platinoid Wires.
                     By ROLLO APPLEYARD *.
THE object of the present paper is to direct attention to
        the serious mechanical defectiveness of certain alloys
used for electrical wires. The question is the more important
because mechanical weakness implies electrical instability. In
what follows I endeavour to bring together facts enough to
indicate the general behaviour of german-silver and platinoid,
 and especially to settle the case as regards the conditions
external to the wires.
    It is necessary to remember that great differences exist
between different samples of the same nominal quality of
alloy; so that, of a hundred pounds’ weight of wire, ninety-nine
 may be proof against all ordinary climates and conditions to
all time, while the remaining pound may become fragile
under the same treatment in a few weeks.
    Many suggestions have been made to me, and are yet
current, as to the cause of the failure of these wires. A well
known expert in electrical matters attributes it to sulphur in
the ebonite of the electrical apparatus. It will, however, be
 shown that failure occurs apart from all ebonite and sulphur.
 Paraf<U+FB01>n-wax has been mentioned b another authority as the
 probable cause of these defects.        nstances will be given to

158         Mr. Rollo Appleyard 0n the Failure of
prove that paraf<U+FB01>n-wax is an absorbent of moisture, and con
sequently useless for purposes of protection against climate;
but I have no evidence that it is aggressively harmful to the
wires. Chemists have variously attributed the failure to the
presence of zinc, copper, antimony, arsenic, sulphur, phos
phorus, and tungsten in the wires: the chemistry of the
question must therefore be regarded as sub judz'ce.
   Tropical heat and- moisture accelerate failure, but not in all
cases. Moisture has been proved by Brereton Baker to be
essential to certain chemical combinations; and there is
evidence enough in what follows that the same agency is
effective in bringing about changes in the constitution of
alloys. The deteriorating effect of heat and moisture is not
limited to mixed metals; for I have recently examined alarge
tube made of electrolytic copper which, under the in<U+FB02>uence
of steam, quickly became very seriously “ pitted.” Another
tube, of the same electrolytic copper, became similarly “pitted ”
when used for conveying seapwater. When these were replaced
by tubes of ordinary copper, there was no further trouble.
    During the past six years some very remarkable instances
of the failure of alloys have come to my notice, particularly
with regard to wires of german-silver and platinoid used in
the construction of resistance-coils. Specimens of these wires,
insulated with white silk, were submitted to various conditions
of climate ; they were sent respectively to India, Brazil, Chile,
 Peru, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Mexico, and Texas. For com
parison and reference, similar wires were in some instances
kept in England.       Several thousands of bobbins were thus
 distributed in widely different latitudes, i. e., to Valparaiso,
 Iquique, Chorillos, Santa Elena, Panama, San Juan del Sur,
 Salina Cruz, Coatzacoalcos, Vera Cruz, Galveston, Per
 nambuco, Bahia, Bio Janeiro, Monte Video, and Calcutta.
    A few years after this distribution faulty bobbins were
 reported from San Juan del Sur, Santa Elena, Panama,
 Vera Cruz, Bahia, and Calcutta. These six towns all lie on
 or near sea-coasts, and they are nearly on the same terrestrial
 isotherm, 2'. e. the isotherm including the area of high ter
 restrial mean temperature, 25° C.
    In all cases of failure the alloy had become brittle and the
 wires had broken, not only at the outer layers, but also within
 the coils. The following is a short history of the wires that
 failed :—
     (1) In April 1891 some german-silver wire, 16 mils dia
 meter, doubly covered with silk, was wound on small boxwood
 bobbins and then treated with paraffin-wax. Each bobbin
 was afterwards lapped with a strip of leather. They were all

               German-Silver and Platinoid Wires.             159
  packed in tin-lined soldered cases containing straw, and were
  shipped to Vera Cruz, on the Mexican (least—a voyage of
  twenty-six days.   A month after leaving England the cases
  were unpacked. It was then noticed that the leather lappings
  of the bobbins had deteriorated, the silk coverings were dis
  coloured, the german-silver had become brittle, and breaks
  had occurred in the wire.     The packing-straw showed signs
  of dampness.    The case had been stowed in the hold with
  other cargo in rather a hot part of the ship. N0 current was
  ever sent throu h this wire except the small fraction of a
  milliampere used momentarily while testing the resistance
 before shipment.
     (2) In February 1891 similar bobbins, of nominally the
 same german-silver wire, were shipped to Valparaiso and
 Iquique. These were not treated with paraf<U+FB01>n-wax, they
 were merely lapped with leather. During the Chilian war
 the apparatus was dismantled. I have had no information as
 to the state of these bobbins since January 1893, when the
 wire was reported to be in good condition. The mean tem
 perature of Valparaiso is lower by about 10° C. than the mean
 temperature of Vera Cruz.
     (3) In June 1895 bobbins of platinoid were shipped to the
 town of Bahia, on the Brazilian coast. The wire was silk
 covered and treated with paraf<U+FB01>n-wax. No leather or ebonite
 was used in connexion with this apparatus. An outer box of
 mahogany protected the bobbins from insects. At the end of
 a very wet and stormy season the wire failed. It was reported
 “ faulty ” in January 1896, about six months after its arrival
 in Brazil. When unwound, the wire showed several fractures;
it had become “short” locally. Bahia lies almost on the
 same isotherm as Vera Cruz, 25° C.
    (4) Between the months of June and August 1893 bobbins
 of platinoid were shipped to Valparaiso, Iquique, and Chorillos.
 The wire was silk-covered and treated with paraf<U+FB01>n-wax.
 Each bobbin had an outer tube of ebonite. There have been
no reports of failure from any of these towns. This goes to
prove that the presence of ebonite is not itself suf<U+FB01>cient to
account for the fracture of platinoid wires.
    (5) In November .1893 similar bobbins Were shipped to
Galveston and Coatzacoalcos: no faults have, so far, developed
in them. Here, again, ebonite has done no evident harm.
Coatzacoalcos is nearer to the equator than is Vera Cruz.
    (6) In December 1894 similar bobbins were shipped to
Santa Elena, on the coast of Ecuador, and to San Juan del Sur,
in Nicaragua. Two years later two of the Santa Elena bobbins
were reported “ faulty,” anlg the same number failed at
                                  2

160           Mr. Rollo Appleyard on the Failure of
San Juan del Sur during the same time. Both towns are
 within about 10 degrees of latitude of the equator.
    (7) In September 1895 similar bobbins were shipped
to Panama. The wire of one was reported “broken ” in
November 1896.
   (8) Between October 1894 and September 1895 about a
thousand bobbins of platinoid wire, made and protected as
above described, treated with paraf<U+FB01>n-wax and sheathed with
ebonite, were shipped to Pernambuco, Rio Janeiro, and
 Salina Cruz. No reports of failure have, so far, been received
from these towns. They are all within the tropics.
    (9) In March 1895 a voltmeter, wound with silk-covered
german-silver wire, was shipped to Calcutta. The wire was
not treated with para<U+FB01>in-wax, and no ebonite was used in
connexion with it. In February 1.897 every inch of the wire
was rotten. As the coil was unwound, the wire fell to pieces.
Slight electrical heating had possibly accelerated the structural
change of the alloy.
   (10) The specimens of various german-silver and platinoid
wires on bobbins kept in England are still quite good. This
applies to the wire such as was used for the voltmeter, as well
as to the platinoid such as was used for the resistance-coils.
This autumn I selected some of these home-specimens and
formed them into small coils. They were then exposed just
above the surface of a tank of water that was boiled all day
and allowed to cool all night. This process was continued
for six weeks with no apparent deteriorating effect upon any
of the coils.                                    '               .
   (11) A piece of bare platinoid wire kept for some years in
the laboratory has become discoloured, and there are several
black spots in it; but I can <U+FB01>nd no “ short” places and no
 mechanical weakness anywhere.
   (12) Some suspended helices of bare german-silver wire
have broken in several places ; these have had current through
them from time to time. One of the fractures occurred at or
very near a brazed joint. The helices were under slight
torsional stress. There were no fractures in the short hori
zontal german-silvar wires connecting these helices.
   The constitution of german-silver is stated to vary as
follows :—
           Copper . . . . . . . 50—66 parts.
           Zinc. . . . . . . . 19—31 ,,
           Nickel . . . . . . . 13—18 ,,
Platinoid is generally described as german-silver with two per
cent. of tungsten.   According to Brannt, the tungsten, in the

                  German-Silver and Platinoid I’Vires.          161
  form of phosphor-tungsten, is <U+FB01>rst melted with a certain
  quantity of copper. The nickel is next added, then the zinc,
  and <U+FB01>nally the remainder of the copper. In order to remove
  phosphorus and a portion of the tungsten, both of which
  separate as dross, the resulting compound is several times
  remelted. It is probable that traces of arsenic and phophorus
 are present in the alloy.
      If nickel is in too reat proportion in nickel-copper alloys,
 oxygen is absorbed uring fusion, and liberated on cooling.
 The result is a porous metal. Again, if the temperature of
 casting is too high, or if the cooling is irregular, cavities may
 be expected in the <U+FB01>nal alloy.
      The surprising diminution in tensile strength produced by
 traces of impurities, for some alloys, has been studied by Prof.
  Roberts-Austen and other metallurgists. A very small per
 centage of arsenic in nickel-copper-zinc compounds causes
 extreme brittleness. So also does a small addition of lead or
 iron. And as arsenical nickel ore is the source of much of
 the nickel of commerce, the failure of german-silver and
 platinoid may possibly be due to traces of arsenic.
     At this point, however, I propose to discriminate between
 two kinds of brittleness, my object being to simplify the dis
 cussion of the problem.      That such a distinction is necessary
 will perhaps be best illustrated by an example. Prof. Roberts
 Austen demonstrated that the addition of 1 per cent. of lead
 reduces the tensile strength of gold by more than two-thirds.
 Similarly, he observed that arsenic renders gold very fragile,
 and that 0'2 per cent. of bismuth instantly converts gold into
 an alloy that crumbles under the die. In all these cases,
brittleness is characteristic of the alloy from the moment of
solidi<U+FB01>cation ; it may, in fact, be regarded as a de<U+FB01>nite function
of the atomic volumes of the constituent elements. I propose
to call this “primary” brittleness.
     But the brittleness of german-silver and platinoid is of a
di<U+FB01>'erent order. It is a subsequent phenomenon. For example :
the alloys from which electrical wires are made are necessarily
strong in the <U+FB01>rst instance; if they were mechanically weak,
2'. e., if they possessed “ primary ” brittleness, they would fail
in the process of “drawing” through the die. Hence, the
distinction between “ primary ” and “ secondary ” brittleness.
The one is an accident of birth, the other is a disease that
develops with age and circumstance.
     The fracture of platinoid, as seen under the microscope,
is granular or crystalline. In new and good specimens the
colour is silver- grey, and uniform except for a few well
de<U+FB01>ned patches of brown.         Occasional specimens of brittle

 162     On the Failure of German-Silver and Platinoz'd Wires.
 wire retain, in parts, the silver-grey fracture. As a rule,
 however, had specimens have, encroaching on the silver-grey
 area, patches of purple, yellow, copper-colour, and brown,
  with frequent cracks and <U+FB01>ssures that communicate more or
  less with the surface of the wire. Very bad specimens have,
  at times, scarcely any of the silver-grey colour at the fracture.
  The patches of dark-purple, yellow, and copper-colour are
  clearly de<U+FB01>ned, as though each of them represented a distinct
 alloy, or a separate mass of “liquated” metal.         On a par
 ticular bobbin, brittleness is olten restricted to a foot or two
  of the wire.   Similar remarks apply to the appearance of the
 fractures of german-sil-ver.
     The crevices and <U+FB01>ssures in bad specimens are easy to
observe with a microscope. They are probably developed
.during wire-drawing, as the result of pores in the cast
  metal. Another explanation of them may be looked for in
 the “ liquation” of some of the metals constituting the alloy.
  By this action, the portion of the alloy that <U+FB01>rst solidi<U+FB01>es
  rejects the yet molten portions, as ice rejects foreign matter.
 As cooling continues, the various constituents become isolated,
 homogeneity is lost, and I think we may fairly assume that,
vin consequence, the strength of the material varies from point
 to point of its mass, so that in passing afterwards through the
 die, the weaker constituents give way, and the general
 structure is loosened. Crystallization and internal electrical
 actions may also result in local weakness, crevices, and
 <U+FB01>ssures.
     Keeping in mind the existence of these <U+FB01>ssures it is a
 simple matter to account for the fact that wires deteriorate
 more quickly under a small stress than when they are sub
 mitted to no stress. Apart from the mechanical weakening,
 it is evident that any extending force opens the crevices and
 makes way for air and moisture—it may also facilitate crys
 tallization. And clearly, if the wires are being used for
electric currents, as is the case with resistance-coils on are
light circuits, great local heating occurs at these weakened
 sections, and fracture is inevitable. This was probably the
fate of the voltmeter-wire mentioned in example (9) above.
 It was almost certainly the fate of the suspended helices (12).
    From what precedes, there is plenty of evidence that
secondary brittleness is fostered by tropical heat and moisture.
A good wire, free from incipient cracks, may last for years,
or may be proof against heat and moisture, as were the wires
in example (10). But if there are any <U+FB01>ssures, there is no
doubt that moisture intrudes upon the alloy through these
capillary channels, with destructive effect.

  Analogy between the Cathodic Rays and those of Rontgen.     163
    There is a kind of tradition that paraf<U+FB01>n-wax is a perfect
 safeguard against moisture; as a matter of fact it is highly
 absorbent. The wax on the bobbins returned from the tropics
 is completely choked with moisture. Shellac, or the old
 fashioned sealin -wax varnish, resists much better. There is
 no evidence to s ow that ebonite is harmful to german-silver
 or platinoid, but it may be well to keep the metal out of
 actual contact with ebonite.
    Can metallurgists tell us the difference, in constitution
 and structure, between a german-silver wire that decays in
 four weeks, and another that under similar conditions never
 fails?   Or, what is even more important, can they make us
 platinoid that shall never fail? If they cannot, it becomes
necessary to surrender those cheaper and better electrical
materials, and fall back upon the more expensive alloys,
beginning at platinum-silver.       If suf<U+FB01>cient time and means
were at the disposal of metallurgists they might discover the
secret of permanence in alloys.       Germany, with the advan
tages of a National Laboratory, has already attacked the
 question, and “ manganin” is the result. Its adoption there
as a satisfactory alloy is directly due to work done upon it by
the Reichsanstalt. But it has yet to be proved that manganin
 will endure the conditions imposed by the tropics.    Moreover,
the doubt arises as to whether it is desirable to obtain from
abroad material that ought to be produced by our own country.
 British cable-manufacturers are already importing thousands
 of tons annually of sheathing-wire from Germany; and it
 seems probable that, for the want of a National Laboratory,
 instrument-makers will now get their resistance-wire from that
 same adventurous foreign source.
XVI. Analogy between the Cathodic Rays and those ofRontgen.
        By Prof. A. BATTELLI, of the Pisa Unirersitg*.
   N the ‘Eleclrician’ of the 8th of January, 1897, Prof.
      Silvanus Thompson describes a very simple ex eriment
which induces him to admit that there exists within (grookes’s
tubesa special kind of rays, which differ from the cathode rays
and from those of Rontgen. He observes that on bringing a
magnet near the focus-tube, as was already known, the <U+FB02>uor
escence on the side of the tube facing the small reflectors
changes its position ; whereas, on the other hand, if a
<U+FB02>uorescent plate be placed before the tube, the luminous
stain on it does not shift its position through the effect of'
the magnet.
                  * Communicated by the Author.

164             Prof. A. Battelli on the Analogy between
    From this he concludes that there must exist internally
the above-said special rays (those deviated through the effect
of the magnet), which, according to the author, are of a
di<U+FB01>'erent nature not only from those of Rontgen but also
from the cathode rays, only as they do not follow the regular
laws of re<U+FB01>exion.                  ‘
    Now Thompson’s experiment as regards the ra s eman
ating from the focus-tube is perfectly similar to w at I had
already had occasion to observe in 1896 in conjunction with
Prof. G‘rarbasso’t respecting the cathode ra s.                    We were
thereby led to admit, as most probable, that t e Rontgen and
cathodic rays were of an identical nature, with this difference,
however, that the <U+FB01>rst only constitute a part of the latter.
    It seems to me that Thompson’s experiment may agree
with this hypothesis without the necessity of recurring to a
third species of rays of a different nature. In fact, re<U+FB02>exion
 of cathodic rays cannot be spoken of, if we admit that when
 they strike against any kind of <U+FB02>uorescent plate they are
 converted into other sorts of radiation. Whilst on the other
 hand, if such re<U+FB01>exion be admitted it cannot indeed be said
 that in its complex action it follows the laws of regular re
 <U+FB02>exion. We can instead observe in the focus-tubes other
 facts which I shall forthwith describe, and which are more in
 harmony with our hypothesis than with Prof. Thompson’s.
     For the study of these facts I have made use of “ focus-”
 tubes or bulbs, in the inside of which we could place, in
 various positions, photographic <U+FB01>lms covered with black paper
 impenetrable to light, folded (as I had done in preceding
 experiments) round small metallic cylinders.
     The bulbs were of spherical form (<U+FB01>g. 1) ; from the hori
 zontal tubes A and B enetrated the anode_and cathode,
 from the vertical tube 8 a small glass rod supporting the
 small re<U+FB02>ector.
     Through the same tube C one of the small photographic
  cylinders projected into the spherical bulb ; and through the
  other vertical tube D one or more similar cylinders were
  introduced into the bulb.
      The reflector and the small cylinders were supported by
  appropriate framing joined to the respective supports by means
  of small hinges, so that one could easily give to the re<U+FB02>ector
  and to the cylinders any desired position and inclination.

    Finally, the tube D was kept in permanent communication
with the air-pump.
    By means of this arrangement the conditions of the
 apparatus could rapidly be changed, and on the other hand
 the closure of the tube C and the communication of the tube
 D with the air-pump were established in a perfect manner
 and with much rapidity, by means of joints surrounded with
 mercury, as indicated in the <U+FB01>gure. With these tubes I
 performed the following series of experiments :—
     lst Experiment—The small re<U+FB02>ector was a plate of pla
 tinum, and besides the two small cylinders c and c’ situated
 in front and at the back of the same small re<U+FB02>ector, other
 three were placed in front laterally to c distributed at equal
 intervals between a and the surface of the re<U+FB02>ector, all at
  nearly the same distance from the point struck by the small
 pencil of cathodic rays.          The experiment was conducted
 under the in<U+FB02>uence of both high and medium rarefaction,
 and an impression was invariably obtained on all the <U+FB01>lms
 placed in front of the platinum re<U+FB02>ector, which impression
 gradually diminished in strength from the <U+FB01>lm 0 towards
 the one placed in the plane of the re<U+FB02>ector *.            In this last
    ‘ Whenever I speak of a photographic impression on a <U+FB01>lm placed in
 front or at the back of the re<U+FB02>ector of a focus-tube, I mean to indicate
 the impression on that part of the <U+FB01>lm that was facing the re<U+FB02>ector,
 because in any other part of the same <U+FB01>lm the impression was always
 very faint or small.

 166         Prof. A. Battelli on the Analogy between
 impression a sharp demarcation is generally observed between
 the part acted upon (corresponding to the region above the
 re<U+FB02>ector) and the part which remained unaltered (corre
 sponding to the region beneath).
     Observing then the interior of the bulb, one could easily
 perceive, so long as the rarefaction Was not very high, the
 luminous pencil of the re<U+FB02>ected cathodic rays forming with
 the re<U+FB02>ector an angle, which, by the way, could not be
 reckoned as equal to that of the incident pencil ; but mean
 while the <U+FB02>uorescence, though sli ht, spread over all the
 inner side of the tube placed above t e plane of the re<U+FB02>ector.
    WVhilst by de recs the rarefaction was gradually being
 increased, the re<U+FB02>ected pencil of rays became less and less
 distinct; and near the surface of the re<U+FB02>ector there could
 then be noted, especially by means of an opaque surface
 provided with a small opening, a feeble halo (rays expanding
 in all directions), whilst the demarcation-line betWeen the
 inner and outer part of the tube grew more and more distinct.
    2nd Experiment—The cathode of the bulb used in this
 experiment was a plane disk, and the re<U+FB02>ector had a spherical
 surface. The luminous cathodic rays striking on the spherical
 re<U+FB02>ector were not re<U+FB02>ected in a convergent pencil, but in a
 diminishing and rather divergent one, which, as the rare
 faction increased, reduced itself into a halo near the surface,
 with an aspect not very dissimilar to the one it assumed when
 the re<U+FB02>ector was formed by a plane surface.
    Besides this the <U+FB02>uorescence expanded on the inner sides
 of the tube in a manner similar to the case of a plane re
 <U+FB02>ector with a line of demarcation corresponding to the edge
 of the spherical re<U+FB02>ector.
    These <U+FB01>rst two experiments prove that it is quite out of
the question to speak of a completely regular re<U+FB02>exion of the
cathodic rays.
    3rd Experiment—On the direction taken by the small
luminous pencil of the cathodic ray s, re<U+FB02>ected by the ordinary
re<U+FB02>ector of the focus-bulb, a second plane re<U+FB02>ector was
placed with an inclination of about 45° to the pencil.
    This second re<U+FB02>ector sent back the rays that fell on it
in a less condensed pencil than when these same rays reached
it, but yet its action was similar to that of the <U+FB01>rst re<U+FB02>ector,
with this difference, that the halo round its surface had a
certain preponderance over the short re<U+FB02>ected pencil, which
appeared faint and fading, and was often 1nv1srble.
    4th Experiment—In the bulb of <U+FB01>g. 1 instead of the
photographic cylinder 0, a spherical re<U+FB02>ector S' was placed
with its axis in a horizontal position, and the cylinder 0' was

            the Cathodic Rays and those of Rontgen.          167
 <U+FB01>xed in the posterior part of the tube, but high up in front of
 the spherical re<U+FB02>ector S' and at some distance from the axis.
 of this same re<U+FB02>ector.
    The cathodic rays re<U+FB02>ected by the plane re<U+FB02>ector on the
 spherical one S', were by this thrown back with the same
 luminous appearances as surrounded the spherical reflector
 exposed to the direct cathodic rays in the 2nd experiment ;
 but the small pencil which showed suf<U+FB01>ciently in said 2nd
 experiment was scarcely visible in front of S’ and could only
 be followed up to a very limited distance from the re<U+FB02>ector.
    The photographic cylinder received then a much more
 vivid impression on the part facing the re<U+FB02>ector than on any
 other portion of it.
    The two experiments, 3rd and 4th, show that the cathode
 rays re<U+FB02>ected by the reflector of a focus-tube can subsequently
 undergo a new anomalous re<U+FB02>exion similar to the <U+FB01>rst re
 <U+FB02>exion of the same rays.
    5th Ewperiment.—-In this experiment two bulbs of equal
 size, with the re<U+FB02>ector and the small cylinder disposed as in
<U+FB01>g. 1, were placed in simultaneous communication with the
air-pump.
    In the <U+FB01>rst bulb, however, the re<U+FB02>ector was a sheet of
platinum of the thickness of 116 of a millimetre, and in the
second bulb a. sheet of aluminium of the same thickness.
    The electrical discharge was sent alternately in the two
bulbs minute after minute.
    On the two <U+FB01>lms which faced respectively the two re
<U+FB02>ectors, strong impressions were always received and of the
same intensity. To a feeble impression obtained at the back of
the sheet of aluminium, no impression whatever corresponded
on the <U+FB01>lm placed at the back of the sheet of platinum. But
to a suf<U+FB01>ciently marked impression on the <U+FB01>rst, a very feeble
impression showed on the second.
    6th Experiment—The same arrangement was maintained
as in the preceding experiment; but in the <U+FB01>rst bulb the
re<U+FB02>ector was now of aluminium of the thickness of 160— of a
millimetre, and in the second the re<U+FB02>ector was also of
aluminium, but of the thickness of but 1% of a millimetre.
    The impressions on the <U+FB01>lms in front were, as usual, of the
same intensity. And as for the posterior <U+FB01>lms, a stronger
impression was obtained on the one situated behind the thinner
sheet.
   7th Experiment—The same disposition as in the preceding
experiment. The re<U+FB02>ector of one of the bulbs was of black
paper of the thickness of 186 of a millimetre, and that of the
other was a sheet of aluminium of the same thickness.

 168           Prof. A. Battelli on the Analogy between
    The impression on the photographic cylinder in front of
 the sheet of aluminium was very slightly more intense than
 on the cylinder placed in front of the sheet of black paper.
 Whereas in the cylinder placed behind the <U+FB01>rst re<U+FB02>ector the
 impression appeared sensibly weaker than that at the back of
 the second.
    8th E.cperinwnt.—Still the same arrangement as in the
 preceding experiments. The re<U+FB02>ector of one of the bulbs
 was of sheet aluminium of T16— of a millimetre, and the
 other was also of sheet aluminium of 10366 to 16406 of a
 millimetre.
   The electrical discharge was sent alternately in the two
 bulbs with intervals of two seconds each time.
    Of the <U+FB01>lms in front, the one that was the more strongly
acted on was the one facing the thicker sheet, and the reverse
effect was obtained on the <U+FB01>lms on the back.
    Besides this, the two impressions in front and behind the
 very thin sheet of aluminium were very nearly of the same
intensity.    And, lastly, at the back of the thin sheet the usual
shadow projected in the focus-tube by the re<U+FB02>ector was no
longer discernible.
    Shortly after the action of the bulb, the sheet of aluminium
was pierced through by the cathode rays, but we still had
suf<U+FB01>cient time to complete the experiment.
   The same experiment with similar results was performed
with two bulbs, the <U+FB01>rst of which had 'as re<U+FB02>ector a sheet
of black paper of the thickness of 136 of a millimetre, and the
other a small sheet of black paper even thinner than “1,6 of a
millimetre.
   9th Experiment—In one of the bulbs, with the preceding
arrangement, a reflector of black wove-paper was placed of the
thinness of less than T55 of a millimetre, and in the other a re
<U+FB02>ector of sheet platinum covered with the same thin wove paper.
   In front of the two surfaces facing the cathode an impres
sion was received slightly more intense on the <U+FB01>lm facing
the sheet of platinum, whereas in front of the opposed surfaces
a much stronger impression was naturally received on the
other <U+FB01>lm belonging to the sheet of the thin wove paper.
   The experiments from 5th to 9th included prove, not only
that the photographic action on the sheet struck by cathodic
ravs is much more intense on the side facing the cathode than
or; the contrary one (which was already known), but they
demonstrate, moreover, that the agent to which such an effect
is due is the more fully transmitted from the <U+FB01>rst face to the
second the thinner the stratum is which is to be penetrated,
and the less dense the substance.

              the Cathodic Rays and those of Rontgen.           169
      This last fact would prove in harmony with the hypothesis
  that the photographic action is due to the cathodic re s them
  selves forced back by the obstacle or piercing through it.
      And next, what could not easily be foreseen, is the other
  conclusion suggested by these experiments, namely, that the
  action of the surface facing the cathode is the more feeble the
  less the thickness of the sheet.   It would be dif<U+FB01>cult to place
  this result in harmony with the hypothesis that the Riintgen
  rays emanating from any substance whatever are generated
' by the cathodic rays which strike that same substance.
      10th Evperiment.—Two bulbs of equal size were placed
  simultaneously in communication with the air-pump, each
  bulb containing the platinum re<U+FB02>ector, and also several
   photographic cylinders disposed as in the 1st experiment.
      One of these re<U+FB02>ectors was, however, surrounded by a
  spherical covering of thin black wove aper of the thinness
  of 1%,, of a millimetre. This covering ad a small aperture
  in front of the cathode, through which the small pencil of
  cathodic rays penetrated so as to strike direct on the re<U+FB02>ector.
      The results obtained with both bulbs were identical, with,
   perhaps, a very slight difference in the intensity of the
   impression. Besides which, in the bulb with the spherical
   covering of black thin wove-paper the <U+FB02>uorescence on the
   inner side of the tube was not altered in its distribution nor
   sensibly so in its intensity; similarly, the shadow projected
   by the re<U+FB02>ector on the aforesaid inner side of the tube remained
   unaltered.
      Therefore an object surrounding the re<U+FB02>ector does not in
   the least way cause any deviation in the action which may be
   obtained within the tube through the effect of the cathodic
   rays re<U+FB02>ected by the re<U+FB02>ector itself.
       11th Experimeut.——'l‘wo bulbs were used in this experi
   ment prepared in the same way as in the <U+FB01>rst, both having a
   re<U+FB02>ector of aluminium of from three to four thousandth parts of
   a. millimetre in thickness. To one of these an electromagnet
   was applied behind the re<U+FB02>ector in such a way that the lumi
   nous mark, which was visible in the direction of the incidental
   cathodic encil, should strongly shift its position.
     In the p otographic cylinders placed behind the two re<U+FB02>ectors,
   impressions were obtained of very nearly the same intensity.
  1 I then placed, in the next experiment, two more photo
   graphic cylinders respectively behind the two small re<U+FB02>ectors,
  but in a lateral position.   So soon as the <U+FB01>rst bulb was excited
   I re idly pushed, by means of the electromagnet, the centre
  of tie luminous mark at the back on the line which joined
  the re<U+FB02>ector to the small cylinder.

170         Prof. A. Battelli on the Analogy between
   In this manner I only obtained a very slight variation in
the photographic impression.
   This experiment goes to prove that the radiation emanating
from the posterior surface of a sheet struck by the cathodic
rays, acts in the same manner as the radiation emitted by the
front surface of the sheet. This shows that the power, ob
served by Thompson as possessed by the rays emanating from
the re<U+FB02>ector of a focus-tube, could also be noted in the rays
emanating from the anticathodic surface of an ordinary
Crookes’s tube, if this surface be suf<U+FB01>ciently thin.
   12th Experiment—In a bulb similar to that of<U+FB01> . 1 the
two photographic cylinders were composed, each of t em, of
three small cylinders placed in a line and respectively covered
with black paper, with a sheet of aluminium and one of pla
tinum, all of the thickness of 37,- of a millimetre.
   In the small cylinder covered with aluminium an impression
was obtained weaker than the one noted in the small cylinder
covered with paper; and on the small cylinder covered with
platinum, a still weaker one than on the one covered with
aluminium, both in front and at the back of the re<U+FB02>ector.
   13th Experiment—Three small cylinders prepared respec
tivelyin the same manner as in the 12th experiment were placed
at the same moment on the direct line followed by the cathodic
rays in an ordinary Crookes’s tube.
   The same results were obtained as in the preceding experi
ment with the same relations between the respective photo
graphic impressions.        Fig. 2.
   14th Experiment—For this experiment a bulb was con
structed slightly differing from the preceding ones. This
also was spherical, and the two electrodes entered it through
the two horizontal tubes A and B (<U+FB01>g. 2), and the re<U+FB02>ector

             the Cathodic Rays and those of Rontgen.           171
penetrated in it likewise through the vertical tube C. But
on the part of the bulb facing the said re<U+FB02>ector was soldered
a large tube M closed by a bimetallic disk, composed,
namely, half of an aluminium sheet of the thickness of half
a millimetre, and the other half also of a sheet of aluminium
of the thickness of one millimetre. On the diameter along
which the two sheets <U+FB01>tted together a thick sheet of zinc was
soldered perpendicularly to the plane of the disk.
    In front of both the two sheets that formed the disk a small
photographic cylinder was placed, on the extremities of which
two <U+FB01>gures were respectively <U+FB01>xed : one made with the thinner
aluminium sheet (é millimetre) and the other with the thicker
sheet (1 millimetre).
    Naturally the two sides of the cylindrical surfaces, wherein
the <U+FB01>gures showed, were turned towards the disk.
    In the region of the <U+FB01>lm which stood opposite the two thin
sheets the thin disk and <U+FB01>gure of the thin sheet) a strong
impression was received; whereas on the points placed in a
line with the two thicker sheets a rather feeble one was
obtained. But the parts where the <U+FB01>gure of the thin sheet
fronted the thicker half-disk were impressed in an equal
degree to the parts placed under the <U+FB01>gure of the thicker
 sheet and the thinner half-disk.
    The same results were obtained when the tube M. of the
bulb was closed by disks formed (a) half of aluminium and
half of glass of the same thickness, (0) consisting half of
magnesium and half of glass still of the same thickness.
    1 also tried to use aluminium and zinc ; but the difference
 between the impressions derived from the rays emanating from
 both the one and the other metal (of equal thickness) was so
great that no decisive result was obtainable.
    15th Ewperimenl.—The preceding experiment was repeated,
the cathodic rays striking directly on the metallic disk.
    The result was the same.
    These four last experiments show at any rate very approxi
 mately that the transparencies of those substances which are
pjiotographically ef<U+FB01>cacious for the cathodic rays and the
   ontgen rays have the same value.
                            Conclusions.
    From the bulk of the experiments above described it seems
 to me that the following deductions can principally be drawn :—
     (a) It cannot be asserted that the cathodic rays are re<U+FB02>ected,
 as a whole, according to the laws of regular re<U+FB01>exion.
    (bi The rays thrown back from the re<U+FB02>ector of a focus-tube

172    Prof. J. J. Thomson on a Theory of the Connexion
we may con<U+FB01>dently assume to possess the same properties as
the direct cathodic rays.
   (0) The rays emanating from the posterior part of a very
thin sheet, the anterior part of which is struck by the cathodic
rays, also possess the same properties as these.
   (d) A pencil of cathodic rays appears as made up of various
rays of different natures. When they strike on a substance
of a very small thickness they seem to possess the power of
passing through it, but in the same way as if they passed
through a <U+FB01>lter, which would allow a passage more or less
easy to some of them than to the others.
XVII. A Theory ofthe Connexion between Cathode and Rontyen
   Rays.    By J. J. THOMSON, 111.11., F.R.S., Cavendish Pro
   fessor of Experimental Physics, Cambridge'.
A MOVING electri<U+FB01>ed particle is surrounded by a mag
        netic <U+FB01>eld, the lines of magnetic force being circles
havin the line of motion of the particle for axis. If the
partice he suddenly stopped, there will, in consequence of
electromagnetic induction, be no instantaneous change in the
magnetic <U+FB01>eld ; the induction gives rise to a magnetic <U+FB01>eld,
which for a moment compensates for that destroyed by the
stopping of the particle. The new <U+FB01>eld thus introduced is
not, however, in equilibrium, but moves off through the
dielectric as an electric pulse. In this paper we calculate the
magnetic force and electric intensity carried by the pulse to
any point in the dielectric.
   The distribution of magnetic force and electric intensity
around the moving particle depends greatly on the velocity
of the particle, if this velocity is so small that the square of
its ratio to the velocity of light can be neglected, then the
electric intensity is symmetrically distributed round the
particle, and at a distance r from it is equal to e/r’, where e
is the charge on the particle ; the lines of magnetic force are
circles with the line of motion of the particle for axis; the
magnitude of the magnetic force at a point P is wesin 0/112,
where w is the velocity of the particle, and 0 the angle a
radius from the particle to P makes with the direction of
motion.
   WVhen, however, the velocity of the particle is so great
that we can no longer neglect the square of its ratio to the
velocity of light, the distribution of electric intensity is no
longer uniform, the electric intensity, along with the magnetic
force, tends to concentrate in the equatorial plane, that is, the
                   * Communicated by the Author,

                between Cathode and Rontgen Rays.                173
  plane through the centre of the particle at right angles to its
  direction of motion ; this tendency increases with the velocity
  of the particle until, when this is equal to the velocity of light,
  both the magnetic force and the electric intensity vanish at
  all parts of the <U+FB01>eld except the equatorial plane, and in this
  plane they are in<U+FB01>nite.
     The pulses started by the stopping of the charged particle
 are, as might be expected, different when the ratio of the
 velocity of the particle to that of light is small, and when it
 is nearly unity. But even when the velocityis small, the
 pulse started by stopping the particle carries to an external
 point a disturbance in which the magnetic force is enormously
 greater than it was at the same point before the particle was
 stopped. The time the pulse takes to pass over a point P is, if
 the charged particle be spherical, equal to the time light
 takes to pass over a distance equal to the diameter of this
 sphere ; the thickness of this pulse is excessively small com
 pared with the wave-length of visible light. When the
 velocity of the particle approaches that of light two pulses
 are started when it is stopped. One of these is a thin plane
 sheet whose thickness is equal to the diameter of the charged
 particle ; this wave is propagated in the direction in which
 the particle was moving ; there is no corresponding wave
 propagated backwards : the other is a spherical pulse spreading
 outwards in all directions, whose thickness is again equal to
 the diameter of the charged particle, and thus, if this particle
 is of molecular dimensions, or perhaps even smaller, very
 small compared with the wave-length of ordinary light. The
 theory 1 wish to put forward is that the Riintgen rays are
 these thin pulses of electric and magnetic disturbance which
 are started when the small negatively charged particles which
 constitute the cathode rays are stopped.
    We shall now proceed to calculate the disturbance propa
 gated through the dielectric when a charged particle is
 suddenly stopped.                                                 Y

 Poisson’s method to integrate the values just given over the
surfaces of certain s heres ; in the general case this integration
leads to complicated) elliptic integrals. We shall get a clearer
idea of the physical nature of the disturbance if we consider
two special cases, (1) when we can neglect the square and
higher powers of w/V; (2) when w/V is very nearly unity.
    In the first case, when we neglect wQ/Vg, a, ,8, doc/(it, dB/dt
when t=0 all satisfy Laplace’s equation, hence the mean
value of any of these quantities over the surface of a sphere
which does not enclose the origin, nor cut through any part
 of the electri<U+FB01>ed sphere, is equal to the value of this quantity
 at the centre of the sphere; we can easily see, too, that when
 the sphere entirely surrounds the electri<U+FB01>ed sphere the mean
value of any of these quantities over its surface is zero.
Thus we have, by Poisson’s solution, the following values for
the components of the magnetic force after a time t from the
stoppage of the electri<U+FB01>ed sphere,

    We must now allow for the absence of magnetic force

may be now supposed to hold from t=0 to t=1-/V, while,
when t>r/V, a1, ,8, both vanish; a2, 18., are the magnetic
forces arising from the disturbance given initially by (3).
This disturbance will begin to be felt at a point P at a time
(OP—a)/V, and will cease after a time (OP+a)/V; O is the
centre of the charged sphere. Thus the thickness of the
pulse due to this distribution is equal to the diameter of the
sphere.

   We have now the complete solution of the problem, and
we see that after the sphere is stopped, the ma netic force at
a point P remains unaltered until t=(r—a)/ , when a very
thin pulse of intense negative magnetic force arrives, the
intensity of the <U+FB01>eld being ew sin 0/211. OP, where 0 is the
angle between OP and the axis of 2; the magnetic force pre
viously at P was in the opposite direction, and equal to
ew sin 9/01”. This very intense pulse only lasts for a very
short time ; and the view I wish to put forward is that this
pulse constitutes one kind of Btintgen radiation. The reasons
for this view will be given after we have considered the case
of a sphere moving with the velocity of light. We may,
however, point out that since the state represented by 04,31
lasts for the time r/V, while that for the state a2, ,8, only for
the time 2a/ V,
                       f... dt=jsdt=a
   This must evidently be the case, for the line inte ral of the
magnetic force round a circuit is equal to 4'” times the current
through the circuit ; in this case the currents are dielectric
currents, and equal the rate of increase of the electric dis
placement through the circuit, so that the time integral of

                between Cathode and Rdntgen Rays.               177
the line integral is equal to the change in the displacement;
 but when we neglect 202/ V”, the distribution of the displace
 ment is the same when the sphere is moving as when in the
 steady state at rest: thus the time integral must vanish.
    Let us now consider the case when the velocity of the
 particles is nearly equal to that of light. In the limiting case
 when w=V we see, from the expressions given for a, B, that
 they vanish unless z=0, when they become in<U+FB01>nite ; in this
 case the original magnetic <U+FB01>eld is con<U+FB01>ned to a plane through
 the centre of the sphere at right angles to its direction of
motion. When 10 is nearly but not quite equal to V, the dis
 turbance is practically con<U+FB01>ned between the two cones whose
 semi-vertical angles are g—S and 5 +5, where 8 is a small
 angle. To simplify the analysis and yet retain the essential
physical features of the case, we shall suppose that the initial
 disturbance, instead of being con<U+FB01>ned between these two
 cones, is con<U+FB01>ned between the planes z=== + d and z: —d, where
 d is a small quantity; and that both the magnetic force and
the electric intensity are parallel to the planes, the lines of
 electric intensity being radial at right angles to the axis of z,
 and the lines of magnetic force circles with their centres on
the axis of z. Let E be the electric intensity at a point distant
p from this axis; then the total normal induction over the
surface of a cylinder passing through this point and with
the axis of z for its axis is equal to
                              E X 21rp x 2d,
this must equal 41m; hence

     hese equations give the initial state of the <U+FB01>eld outside the
charged particle ; inside this particle, which we shall take to

178    Prof. J. J. Thomson on a Theory of the Connexion
be a sphere of radius d, we shall suppose that the electric
intensity and the magnetic force both vanish.
   Thus the original distribution of the <U+FB01>eld is con<U+FB01>ned
between two parallel planes ; and from this space we must
exclude that inside the sphere as this is free from magnetic
force.
   Let us now consider how this distribution will spread through
space. Consider what will happen at a point P. There will
be no effect at P until a sphere of radius Vt and centre P
cuts the space between the planes. This will not hap en until
t= (0— (1)/V, Where e is the distance of P from t e plane
through the centre of the sphere perpendicular to the direction
in which the sphere was moving before it was stopped. When
t is greater than this value, the sphere will cut the space
between the planes ; and to apply Poisson’s solution we have
to <U+FB01>nd the mean value of the magnetic force over the surface
of this sphere. Take the plane of we to pass through P. Let
Q be a point on the surface of the sphere, (is an element of
the area of this surface, it the angle the plane through Q and
the axis of 2 makes with the plane of me, p the distance of Q
from the axis of z, and 6 the angle between ,2 and the normal
to the sphere at Q; then the element of the surface included
between 2 and z+ dz, it and <j>+d¢ is given by the equation

    In <U+FB01>nding the mean value of ,8 over the sphere we must
 double this value, for to each value of ¢ and z there correspond
 two elements of the surface of the sphere which contribute
 equally to the integral ; hence

    Now the limits of z depend upon whether the sphere does
 not or does cut right through the slab between the two parallel
 planes; in the former case Vt is less than 0+d, and the limits
of z are c—Vt and d; then
                               Va
                  SBdS=21red—b(d—0+Vt);
in the latter case Vt is greater than c+d, and the limits of z
are —d and +d; hence in this case

   This value of gt (twl) is the same whether the point P is in

When the sphere cuts both 2:01 and := —-(I, then
                           j-‘gd8=0.
   Thus (02, the mean value of the initial value of dB/dt over
the surface of the sphere, is given by the equation
    tm2= % 2—06, when the sphere cuts z=d and not z= —d,
       = -—       when the sphere cuts 2: — d and not z=d,
       =0 when the sphere cuts both.
Hence by Poisson’s formula

        :0 when the sphere cuts z=d and also z: -d.
    Thus the distribution of magnetic force between the planes
,2: id is propagated forwards unchanged with the velocity V,
there is no corresponding pulse propagated in the negative
 direction.
    In addition to the plane pulse there will also, as in the
 previous case, he a spherical one, whose thickness is 2d ; we
 can calculate the magnetic force at any point in this pulse as
 followsz—Let H be the magnetic force at a point in this
 pulse at a distance I) from the axis of z, then the line integral
 of this magnetic force round the circle whose radius is b and
 whose axis is the axis of z is 21rbH ; the magnetic force lasts
 for a time 2d/V, so that the time integral of the line integral
 is 41rbdH/V.
    At any point in front of the particle the time integral
 of the magnetic force due to the plane pulse round the same
 circuit is
                            eV    2d
                        27b m X TV? —-47T6.
 Hence the time integral of the whole magnetic force round

               between Cathode and Rontgen Rays.            181
this circuit is equal to
                                 d

                                  V
   This is equal to 4w times the change in the electrostatic
polarization through the same circuit : now when the particle
was sto ped, this polarization was zero, and when the <U+FB01>eld has
reache a steady state, the electric intensity is uniformly
distributed, so that the polarization through the circle is
                            e .

where 6 is the acute angle between OP and the axis of z, P
being a point on the circumference of the circle ; hence
                   47rbH    + 47m: 21re(1-cos 0),

 hence if 0 is the angle between OP and the positive direc
 tion of the axis of z, the magnetic force at any point in the
 spherical wave is given by
    Thus we see that the stoppage of a charged particle will
 give rise to very thin pulses of intense magnetic force and
 electric intensity; when the velocity of the particle is small
 there will be one spherical pulse; when the velocity is nearly
 equal to that of light there will in addition to the spherical
 pulse be a plane one propagated only in the direction in

 182    On the Connet'ion between Cathode and Rontgen Rays.
 which the particle was originally moving. It is these pulses
 which I believe constitute the Rtintgen rays. As they con
 sist of electric and magnetic disturbances, they might be
 expected to produce some effects analogous to those of light.
 If they were so thin that the time taken by them to pass over
 a molecule of a substance were small compared with the time
 of vibration of the molecule, there would be no refraction,
 and the thinness of the pulse would also account for the
 absence of diffraction.
    In the preceding investigation we have supposed that the
 stoppage of the particle is instantaneous ; if the impact lasts
 for a <U+FB01>nite time T the negative pulse will be broadened out, so
 that its thickness, instead of being 2a, will be 2a+VT, where
 V is the velocity of light. The intensity of the magnetic
 force in the pulse will vary inversely as the thickness of the
 pulse, so that when the collision lasts for the time T, the
 magnetic force in the negative pulse will be 2a/(2a+VT) of
 the value given above. The more sudden the collision, the
 thinner the pulse and the greater the magnetic force and the
 energy in the pulse ; the pulse will, however, possess the pro
 perties of the Rontgen rays until T is comparable to one of
 the times of vibration of a substance through which it has to
 pass. In the case of the cathode rays all the circumstances
 seem favourable to a very sudden collision, as the mass of the
 moving particles is very small and their velocity exceedingly
 great. In some experiments which I described in the Philo
sophical Magazine for Oct. 1897 on cathode rays, the velocity
 of the negative particles was about one third of that of light,
 and in some more recent experiments made on the Lenard rays,
with the apparatus described by Des Coudres, considerably
higher velocities were found. A change in the time of the
collision will alter the thickness of the pulse and so change
the nature of the ray.
   If we suppose that part of the absorption of the rays is due
to the communication of energy to charged ions in their path,
we <U+FB01>nd that the thicker the pulse the greater the absorption.
For suppose that E is the electric intensity in the pulse, m the
mass, and e the charge on an ion ; then if u is the velocity
communicated to the ion when the pulse passes over it, t the
time taken by the pulse to pass over it,
                           mu=Ee . t,
or if d is the thickness of the pulse
                          mu=Ee . %;

thus the energy ému” communicated to the ion is equal to

                               2 V2 '
   Now the energy in the pulse is proportional to Egd/V”, so
that the ratio of the energy communicated to the ion to the
energy in the pulse is proportional to d. Thus the broader
the pulse, the reater the absorption and the less the penetrat
ing power. T e energy in the pulse is inversely proportional
to its thickness.
   If we return to the expression for the intensity of the mag
netic force in case (1), we see that it is proportional to sin 6,
so that the disturbance is greatest at right angles to the
cathode rays : thus, if the cathode particles are stopped attheir
<U+FB01>rst encounter, the Rtintgen ra s would be brightest at right
angles to the cathode rays; if, however, as would seem most
probable, the cathode particles had to make several encounters
before they were reduced to rest, changing their direction
between each encounter, the distribution of the cathode rays
would be much more uniform. Experiments on the distri
bution of Rontgen rays produced by the impact of the cathode
particles directly against the walls of the discharge-tube are,
as Sir George Stokes has pointed out, affected by the much
greater absorption of the oblique rays produced by the greater
thickness of glass traversed by them. Experiments on rays
produced by focus-tubes would give results more easily
interpreted.
    The result to which we have been led from the considera
tion of the effects produced by the sudden stoppage of an
electri<U+FB01>ed 1particle, viz. : that the Rontgen effects are produced
byaveryt in pulse of intense electromagnetic disturbance, is
in agreement with the view expressed by Sir George Stokes
in the Wilde Lecture (‘ Proceedings of Manchester Literary
and Philosophical Society,’ 1897), that the Riintgen rays are
not waves of very short wave-length, but impulses.

 are known. Thus, suppose E to denote the HP transmitted,
 N the number of rotations of the shaft per minute, the work
 done per minute in inch-lbs. is 12 x 33000 x E; and this equals
 the twisting moment T in statical inch-lbs., multiplied by the
 angular motion of the shaft 27rN per minute, i. e.
                     27rNT=12 x 33000 x E,

 To <U+FB01>nd E, N and T must be known. When variation in
 rotation is but slight, N may be found by means of a counter
 such as that of Harding, T then remains to be determined.
 In 1894, May 2nd, the writer of this paper exhibited at the
 Royal Society several models of ergometers, which showed
 how the torsion of a rotating shaft might be measured by
 mechanical and optical methods, and a description was given
 in a pamphlet entitled “A Torsion Ergometer or Work
 Measuring Machine ;” a rotostat was also exhibited, in which
 an inverting prism rotated in front of the index of the
 ergometer, brought it to rest, and made an easy reading
 possible although the shaft of the machine might be
 making any number of revolutions per minute. The author
has been subsequently informed that a similar device was
used by Lord Rayleigh for blending colours. [Reprint of
some Optical Papers. Lord Rayleigh, 1883.] At the time
of devising the rotostat the author did not know that a
rotated inverting prism had been so used for blending colours
or similar purpose.
    Since 1894 the problem of measuring the torsion of a very
long shaft arose, the shaft being used to drive a dynamo,
and also the torsion of a solenoidal spiral spring used as a
<U+FB02>exible shaft to drive screw-propellers of different forms, in
water, at different depths.
   While the apparatus required is of a simple character the
results obtained are suf<U+FB01>cient and reliable.             -
   The method is as follows (see diagram) z—Two disks of insu
lating material A, C are <U+FB01>xed at the ends of the shaft, the bear
ings of which are not shown, narrow slips of copper H, K are
attached to the disks at their circumferences, and to the shaft.
Two brushes D, E (single <U+FB02>at wires answer well), press on the
edge of the disks, the brushes are connected to an electric
circuit, including a battery B, and a telephone T. Then
when H and K are in the same plane, at each revolution of
the shaft a click is heard in the telephone; but if while the
shaft is rotating the disk 0 has an angular advance on the

                 On the Source of the x-Rays.                185
 disk A, due to torsion, no click will be heard, since D and E
 do not touch the conductors H and K at the same instant.
                                                         c
          o                                        E   _

                                                         3
 Now, in order to hear the click again, the brush-holder F
 must be moved through an angle equal to that of the angle of
.advance of C on A, and this is the angle of torsion which is
 found. It is shown on a divided scale G.
    The author has applied the method to <U+FB01>nd the torsional
 angle of an ergometer in which a solenoidal spiral spring is
 used instead of a shaft as shown in the figure.
    The couple due to any angle is found by <U+FB01>xing A and
 suspending known weights from a thin steel tape attached to
 a pulley of known radius keyed on to the shaft close to the
 disk C.
                XIX. The Source of the x-Rays.
        By JOHN Tnowanmcn and JOHN E. BURBANK*.
 THE experiments described in this paper were conducted
       with Crookes tubes containing no interval between
 the anode and the cathode: and no discharge, therefore,
 in the usual sense occurred in the tubes. A continuous
 conductor was led through the rare<U+FB01>ed tube, and it was dis
 covered that the m-rays were given off from every element of
 this conductor at right angles to its surface when a disruptive
 discharge occurred in the circuit of which the tube formed a
 part. This remarkable result was obtained by means of the
 very high electromotive force furnished by a Planté rheostatic
 machine which was charged by ten thousand storage-cells.
 We shall describe our experiments with the various tubes we
 employed, and in conclusion state our results.

wire tube and the Crookes tube, and a beam of light passed
across the Crookes tube and formed a <U+FB02>uorescent spot on its
bulb.

                  the Source of the x-Rays.                  187
   Photographic plates were exposed opposite to the thin bulb
on the straight-wire tube. These plates were carefully insu
lated from the ground, and were covered in one case with a
sheet of hard rubber {; of an inch in thickness, and in another
case by a sheet of lass about 5 an inch in thickness. A
 owerful brush-discharge was seen in the dark room to pass
from the thin bulb of the tube to the insulator which covered
the plates ; and on developing the plates, they were found to
be covered with star-like clusters surrounded by nebulous
patches. It was evident that the brush-discharge had pro
duced discharges at the surface of the dryNplates, even through
plates of glass an inch in thickness.       oreover, there was a
general darkening of the surface of the plate which indicated
the action of w-rays. No metallic objects could be placed
upon the dry plates, for a powerful spark immediately passed
to them and punctured the tubes.     The darkening, however,
was apparently diminished under strips of glass, although the
effect of the brush-discharge masked the effect of the x-rays.
Before the straight tube was exhausted powerful brush
discharges were given off at the ends of the tube. When
the tube was exhausted, these brushes were much diminished,
and were replaced by a powerful brush which came off from
the straight wire through the thin bulb of the tube, and
speedily punctured the latter when any object, even an
insulator, was brought within six inches of the bulb. The
most interesting result obtained with this form of tube was
the production of the so-called w-ray burn, by means of the
brush-discharge from its bulb. When the back of the hand
was exposed to the brush-discharge, which assumed a peculiar
forked nature in the dark room, a peculiar prickling sensation
was experienced, and all the symptoms of the well-known w-ray
burn developed. The skin, when examined under a micro
scope, exhibited an appearance similar to that shown by the
photographic plate. There were centres of in<U+FB02>ammation
surrounded by regions of lesser degrees of burn. It seems
evident that the so-called .s-ray burn is due to an electri
<U+FB01>cation—a discharge at the surface of the skin—and this
electri<U+FB01>cation may or may not be accompanied by the .z-ra s.
This <U+FB01>rst form of tube was then abandoned, and a straig t
wire tube alone (fig. 2) was employed. Similar results were
obtained with this tube. It was signi<U+FB01>cant that the whole
interior of this tube <U+FB01>uoresced brilliantly when it formed part
of a circuit through which a disruptive discharge passed.
This latter form of tube was replaced by the form represented
in <U+FB01>g. 3.    A side tube ending in a thin bulb was added to the
straightwvire tube. The same phenomenon was exhibited by this

188            Messrs. Trowbridge and Burbank on
tube ; in addition, a brilliant <U+FB02>uorescence <U+FB01>lled the side tube,
which appeared to <U+FB02>ow in or <U+FB02>ow out of the narrow tube which
ended in the small bulb. We were reminded by this phe
nomenon of Poynting’s hypothesis of the <U+FB02>ow of energy into a
wire. This form of tube was replaced by a straight-wire tube
which is represented in <U+FB01>g. 4 and <U+FB01>g. 5 (side view). A straight
wire passed completely through the tube, and was in circuit
 with a line on which there was a rapid change of potential.
 At one end of this tube opposite a thin bulb blown on the
tube was a piece of platinum foil inclined like the ordinary
focus-plane in a focus-tube. At <U+FB01>rst we connected this focus
plane with the ground, and having ascertained that .z-rays
were given off very strongly from this platinum, we removed
the ground connexion and substituted for it a sheet of zinc.
The tube still gave off m-rays. We then removed the sheet
of zinc and found that x-rays were given off with undiminished
strength. This tube was then modi<U+FB01>ed into the form repre
sented in <U+FB01>g. 6, <U+FB01>g. 7 (side View). The straight wire occupied
the middle of a tube ; in one end of this tube was placed a
focus~p1ane of platinum, and at the other there was a long
narrow tube which ended in a thin bulb. In this bulb was a
crystal of calcite, which was con<U+FB01>ned in the tube by the
narrowness of the bore of the connecting tube. The tube
showed that x-rays were given off at right angles to the
straight wire, for the calcite <U+FB02>uoresced a brilliant red, and
the <U+FB02>uoroscope showed w-rays proceeding from the inclined
piece of platinum.    This form of tube, moreover, showed that
the w-rays are re<U+FB02>ected, so to speak, from the interior surface
of the glass, for there were multiple shadows of the wire on
the sides of the tube which were produced by the z-rays of
varying intensity which were developed on the surface of the
glass, and which in turn proceeding from this surface at
different angles produced elongated shadows.       In the next
form of tube the wire passing through the tube was no longer
straight, but was bent in the manner represented in <U+FB01>g. 8. In
this form of tube there was a brilliant caustic formed on the
side of the tube opposite the concave side of the wire, and
this brilliant caustic threw distorted shadows of the bent wire
on the opposite side of the tube. It was evident that the
w-rays were given off at right angles to the surface of this
wire, and therefore coincided in direction with the lines of
electrostatic force.
   We next experimented with the form of tube represented
in <U+FB01>g. 9. This consisted of a large thin bulb 5 inches in
diameter, enclosing a continuous conductor, the centre of
which consisted of an aluminium mirror. When this tube

                    the Source of the x-Rays.                 189
was exhausted to a very high degree, the mirror formed a
 bright <U+FB02>uorescent spot on the bulb, the position of which
could be readily changed by means of a magnet. When the
exhaustion was carried to a very high degree, reversing the
current from a Ruhmkorf coil through the tube caused no
 marked difference in the appearances in the tube; at a lower
degree, however, a marked difference resulted. With the
 employment of a powerful Ruhmkorf Coil giving sparks of at
least 8 inches x-rays could be detected in this tube; and when
the tube was connected to the Planté machine, the m-rays
gave strong effects in the <U+FB02>uoroscope.
    In order to test the question whether the so-called cathode
rays and the w-rays are generated primarily only at the
cathode, a very large resistance of distilled water was inter
posed in the circuit with the continuous wire tube (<U+FB01>g. 9), in
order to damp any oscillations which might arise. The
circuit thus consisted of the tube, the water-resistance, a
spark-gap, and the secondary coil of a large Ruhmkorf. The
tube was connected at <U+FB01>rst permanently to the air-pump. As
the exhaustion advanced a beam of rays proceeded from the
mirror on the continuous conductor, which was focussed on
the wall of the tube. This beam was more brilliant and pro—
duced a stronger <U+FB02>uorescence on the tube when the wire
was negative than when it was positive. At a higher stage of
the vacuum, however, very little, if any, difference could be
detected in the appearance of the tube, and x-rays‘could be
detected outside the tube opposite the <U+FB02>uorescent spot caused
by the mirror. That is, the w-rays were given off both when
the wire constituted the cathode of the circuit and also when
it formed the anode.
    It seems, therefore, that the term cathode-rays is not
a general one. It would seem that electric rays might
be a more comprehensive one for both cathode-rays and
w-ra s.
   Fiirthermore, the phenomenon of electrostatic induction
plays an important part in the phenomena of the so-called
w-rays. When the tube represented in <U+FB01>g. 9 had reached a
certain stage of exhaustion, a bit of tinfoil connected to a zinc
plate 20 x25 cm. and 1 mm. thick was stuck upon the
outside of the tube where the mirror formed the <U+FB02>uorescent
spot.   This zinc plate was carefully insulated from the ground.
It was seen that a bundle of rays was re<U+FB02>ected by the tinfoil
to the opposite wall of the tube, throwing a well-de<U+FB01>ned
shadow of the mirror and the continuous conductor on this
wall. The direction of this shadow could be changed at will
by changing the position of the tinfoil. This phenomenon

 was produced both when the wire was the cathode and when
 it was the anode. It can be explained on the hypothesis that
 a layer of electri<U+FB01>ed particles is held by a condenser-action on
  the wall of the tube, and that the fresh-coming particles are
  strongly repelled by those that have accumulated at the
    ot. behaviour of aluminium toward the w-rays is so re
  spThe
  markable that it merits especial investigation. Can it be
  that it manifests a remarkable condenser action toward the
  high electromotive forces which produce the .r-rays, similar
  to the action which has been observed at lower voltages? *
     We connected to the air-pump at the same time two
  exactly similar tubes, one of which had two pointed terminals
  of platinum, the other two pointed terminals also; but one
  consisted of aluminium and the other of platinum. The
  discharge from a Ruhmkorf coil was sent through these tubes,
  which were in multiple circuit. At a certain stage of the
  exhaustion it was seen that the discharge passed more easily
  when the aluminium wire was made a cathode than when it
  constituted the anode. When the wire terminals in both
  tubes were made of thin disks the difference was less marked.
This might have been surmised from previous investigations
  on the effect of form of electrodes on resulting polarization 1'.
  It may be that the anomalous action of aluminium in respect
 to the w-rays is due to a species of' dielectric polarization on
 the surface of the platinum, and that thus the surface becomes
 a new source of electrostatic stress similar to that which was
 observed by connecting a bit of tinfoil and a capacity to the
 tube. Since we are dealing with very high differences of
 potential, and with high charges on the ions, the instantaneous
 exhibition of electrical energy is very great, and might
 probably explain the diffusion of this energy through the air.
 According to this hypothesis the light manifestations of the
 w-rays arise only at the <U+FB02>uorescent screens, or at other
suitable surfaces.
                             Conclusions.

 every element of a continuous conductor at a high stage of
 the vacuum in a Crookes tube, both when this conductor
 constitutes the cathode and when it forms the anode of the

polarization, would appear to be more comprehensive than
the terms cathode-rays and .r-rays.

     XX. On the Photography of Ripples—Second Paper.
                By J. H. VINCENT, B.Sc., A.R.C.Sc.*
                            [Plates XX.-XXII.]
    N a former paper T, an apparatus was described b which
        the photo raphs accompanying the paper were 0 tained.
In continuing t e photographic method of recording experi
ments on ripples, the same principles have been employed.
That is to say, the light which fell on the mercury surface
was rendered parallel before incidence, and only that light
which was reflected in a parallel beam was allowed to fall on
the sensitive plate.
   But in order more faithfully to reproduce the phenomena,
it appeared that light of practically normal incidence should
be employed. This was brought about by using only one
large condensing lens, and by placing the <U+FB01>rst spark- ap
(i. e. the one which furnishes the light to take the photograp )
close to the brass mounting of the camera lens.            The camera
was thus pointing vertically downwards, and was so placed
that the vertical projection of the lens-stop and the <U+FB01>rst
spark-gap fell equidistant from, and on opposite sides of, the
centre of the condensing lens.
   The camera lens was provided with an iris diaphragm.
The stop used was F 64 except where otherwise stated.
    It was found that the time of duration of the spark was not
unduly increased by the use of magnesium terminals.               The
focal lengths of the front achromatic lens of the camera
combination and of the condensing lens were determined for
blue light, and the large lens was placed at a calculated
distance from the camera, so that the light from the spark-gap
was brought to a focus on the centre of the lens-stop.
    In selecting a position in the laboratory to set up the
apparatus the desirable conditions are those of steadiness and

giving trouble, owing to the damp, was amply compensated
by the advantage of having a steady roof. This allowed
of the suspension of the trough from the roof by a string;
the annoyance due to the gradual stretching of a rubber cord
was thus avoided.
                   Description of Photographs.
   The <U+FB01>gures are about 15 natural size, with the exception of
<U+FB01>gs. 6 and 7 which are g natural size.
   A number of photographs were taken to test whether it
was possible to avoid suspending the trough. Even when
the motor and induction-machine were placed upon soft
rubber bungs, the vibration was still so strong as to cause the
surface of the mercury to appear furrowed in directions
parallel to the sides of the trough ; this was not much remedied
by placing the trough on soft felt pads.         When the motor
was driven slowly, and the table on which the trough stood
was agitated by the vibration of a fork, the phenomena became
regular as shown in <U+FB01>g. 1.
   Fig. 1.-Frequency 236.
   The ripples due to the sides of the trough are of two kinds.
The small ones are those caused by the fork and the large
ones are caused by the shaking of the table by the motor and
induction-machine.
   Fig. 2.—The disturbance is here caused by stamping with
the foot on the concrete <U+FB02>oor on which the table stands.
   Fig. 3.—Frequency 60.
   The trough having been suspended, the mercury surface is
now free from waves due to adventitious causes. The <U+FB01>gure
shows a point source and its image equidistant from the
circular mirror.
   The production of conjugate foci with ripples is a matter
of some dif<U+FB01>culty. (No example of conjugate foci was given
in the <U+FB01>rst paper.) This is owing to a phenomenon which
often accompanies the re<U+FB02>exion of ripples ; a focus may
appear in a position not in accordance with the laws of
re<U+FB02>exion, or a normal focus may be accompanied by a number
of points having the appearance of foci. This would occur
if the waves on re<U+FB02>exion were split up into several sets of
different wave-length, one set having the wave-length of the
incident waves.
   Fig. 4.-——Frequency 60.
   This illustrates the abnormal foci referred to above. There
are two or perhaps three of these to the left of the normal
focus.   That the focus which is the most obvious is really the

194                  Mr. J. H. Vincent on the
normal one is proved by its obeying the formula
                               1     1   l
                                v + u _ F'
   The calculated length of v on the negative was 3 99 cm.
It actually measured 4'05 cm.
    Fig. 5.—Frequency 120.
    This is from a negative taken with the <U+FB01>rst form of apparatus.
The source is placed at the centre of curvature of the circular
mirror and we should expect to <U+FB01>nd no focus conjugate to
the source. But there is a well-de<U+FB01>ned centre of a series of
 concentric circles ; this centre is distant from the mirror less
 than half the radius of curvature; no real source can have
 such a conjugate focus if the ripples obey the ordinary laws
 of reflexion. For a normal focus to be formed in this
 position it would be necessary to allow a series of circular
 ripples to impinge on the re<U+FB02>ector in such a way that the
 centre of the contracting circles should be behind the mirror.
 The sides of the trough are rectilinear, and the virtual images
 of the source due to the sides of the vessel are outside the
 trough.
    From <U+FB01>gs._ 1 and 2 we see that no casual trepidation is
 likely to cause curvilinear waves. Perhaps these spurious
 foci are positions of maximum disturbance consequent upon
 the interference of the ripples from all the real and virtual
 sources.
    Fig. 6.—Frequency 236.
    This is another illustration of conjugate foci.     The re<U+FB02>ector
 was accurate]      elliptical.    It does not look so in the <U+FB01>gure,
 owing to the whole of the enclosed area not being photographed,
 due to slight curvature of the surface near the boundary.
 The re<U+FB02>ector was cut out of thin ebonite. The plate was
 <U+FB02>oated in the mercury and was then buoyed up by under
 lying chips of wood until the mercury surface was as plane
 as could be arranged. If this is not attended to, little
 re<U+FB02>exion occurs at the edge.
     The source can be distinguished by the style of glass, which
 shows as a black mark on the print. The image is approxi
 mately at the other focus of the ellipse.     This is an interesting
 case of conjugate foci and reminds us that the principle of
 least time is really the principle of maximum or minimum
 time.
     Fig. 7.-—Frequency 236.
     If the source is placed at the centre of the ellipse, the
 surface of the mercury becomes so furrowed by the large
 number of ripples going in different directions that it is,
  regarded as a whole, almost dark on the ground glass of the

   camera. The phenomena were also so complicated that no
  regularity was observable. By opening the lens-stop we may
  in effect smooth down the less violent ripples, and thus
  obtain a photograph which shows a regular ditfraction-pattern.
   (Stop F 16 was used.)
     The bright bands are lines of minimum disturbance pro
  duced by the interference between the direct waves from the
   centre and the re<U+FB02>ected waves from the ends of the ellipse.
     Two foci conjugate to the centre are seen near each end of
  the ellipse.   Let us assume that the portions of the ellipse
  which are most concerned in deciding the osition of these
  foci, are closely adjacent to the extremities ofPthe major axis,
  and calculate the distance of the foci from the centre on this
  assumption. This distance is

                             a _ 2?:19’
  using the ordinary notation. From the known dimensions of
  the ellipse and the scale of reduction of the photograph ("765)
  this distance becomes 1'3l5 centim. On measuring the ne
  gative the value 1'30 centim. was obtained.
     Fig. 8.—-Frequency 236.
     A comb of ten teeth was used to agitate the surface.      The
  points were in the same straight line and equally spaced. The
  distance between the centres of the teeth at each end was
  3'18 centim.
     The print shows that such a comb behaves like a diffraction
  grating. The length of a bar and slit on the negative is
                      3'18 x '7 65
                                   ='27 centim.
                           9
 The wave-length (on the negative) is '105 centim. Thus the
 direction of normals to the rectilinear waves due to refraction
 is given by
                          '105n= '27 sin 61.,
 or
                               n: 2'57 sin 9",
 where n is the order of the spectrum.         Thus the greatest
 value n can have is 2; and we could not expect to <U+FB01>nd
 evidence of more than <U+FB01>ve sets of linear waves on the photo
 graph. At a distance from the comb the central band can be
 made out. This corresponds to the undiffracted image one
 sees when looking through an ordinary grating. On either
side of this band the <U+FB01>rst diffracted band is seen. The angle
between the linear waves in these bands was measured with a
protractor and found to be 49°.        Thus 6,:24'5.    This is in
fair accord with theory, which gives 01: 23°.

   In this <U+FB01>gure we have the analogue of a zone-plate in optics.

section of a circular zone-plate. The central portion was
2 centim. long. This was bounded on each side by a_ space
 v§_ J1—_     Then followed a length of uncut edge J3— J2
centim. long, and so on.     It need hardly be remarked that
the effect at the focus is not twice that of the uncut edge, as
it would be if we were dealing with areal sources, as in light.

5'5 centim., and A. measures '115 centim. The half-periods

   In attempting to produce refraction of ripples many methods
naturally suggest themselves. One of the most obvious is
that of sending ripples from a deep to a shallow portion of
liquid. But in order to considerably affect the velocity of
propagation, it is necessary to have the depth of the shallow
portion only a small fraction of the wave-length. Now
mercury will not allow itself to be spread out on a surface it
does not wet to a less depth than about 3 millim. This dif<U+FB01>
culty can be overcome by amalgamating the surface of a piece
of metal and <U+FB01>xing it in the trough.
   Experiments by this method have been unsuccessful. The
ripples move onwards into the shallow region up to a certain
depth without change of wave-length ; then they are apparently
quenched, and the very shallow parts appear quite unaffected
by the disturbance in the rest of the liquid.
   The <U+FB01>gure shows another method of refracting ripples.
The kinematic surface-tension and the effective value of
gravity are both lowered when the surface is covered with
water. A triangle of water was made on the mercury and
kept in position with glass styles at the corners. The glass
styles were attached to the sides of the trough.
   Rectilinear waves are sent through the triangle and are
bent towards the base on entrance and emergence. The
effect is analogous to but very much less marked than in the
case of light passing through a glass prism.

placed on the mercury near together, and such that their
centres are on a normal to the waves, which are rectilinear
before passing under the drops ; but the portions of the waves
which pass under the water are delayed, and on’emergence a
distinct bendin is produced.
     There is a w ite mark on each of the photographs of the
drops. These are photographs of the virtual image of the
spark in the convex water surfaces. This shows that the
ripples pass only on the mercury, and do not disturb the
water surface.

XXI. Measurements concerning Radiation-Phenomena in the
            Magnetic Field—(L) By Dr. P. ZEEMAN*.
 1.      N § 12 of my paper on “ Doublets and Triplets ”l' I
            mentioned already that I was occupied in photo
graphing the spectrum of' a source of light placed in a mag
netic <U+FB01>eld. However, it was not until October last that good
photographs of the characteristic henomena were obtained ;
some specimens were shown at t e October meeting of the
Amsterdam Academyi. In order to study further quantita
tively the radiation-phenomena in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld I have
made the following measurements. For purposes of measure
 ment there are several advantages in photographing the outer
components of the magnetic triplets, quenching the light of
the middle line by means of a nicol. By this latter device§ we
also are enabled to measure accurately the magnetic effect in
lines not entirely separated into triplets.

the    characteristic phenomena is shown by a aper 1n ‘ Nature ’ (vol. lvi.
p. 420).     The authors obtained only negative results.          Mr. Preston,
working apparently with the same grating, has quite recently succeeded
in actually photographing all the appearances I have described. (‘ Nature,’
vol. lvii. p. 173.)

(Wied. Ann. Bd. lxii. p. 240, 1897).

 198        Dr. P. Zceman on rifeasurements concerning
    1 have measured negatives, obtained by means of a Rowland
 grating, using electrodes of various metals and a very strong
 <U+FB01>eld. The measurements, however, only refer to a relatively
 small part of the spectrum. I regret that it is not greater.
 Much time was lost because the grating was not mounted in
 the manner of Rowland, the various parts of the apparatus
 not being ready in time. Grating and camera-box were
 placed upon separate stands; it was now necessary to <U+FB01>nd
 the position of slit, grating, and camera-box for each part
 of the spectrum by a laborious process of error and trial. The
 dimensions of the camera-box permitted only the use of plates
 13 or 18 centim. long. The results of this paper are hence
 to be regarded only as preliminary. I intend to go over the
 measurements once more and to make negatives of the whole
 spectrum, using a larger grating and the new apparatus, just
 now <U+FB01>nished.
    2. Measurements of the distance between the outer compo
 nents of the triplet will also put to test the possible hypothesis,
 that it is only one kind of ions, having charges proportional to
their effective masses, that are free to vibrate in the atom or
molecule. On such an hypothesis, in a de<U+FB01>nite <U+FB01>eld the inter
vals between the outside components of the triplets should be
 (measured in change of wave-length) proportional to the
square of the wave-length or (measured in difference of fre
 quency) the same for all lines of the spectra of all substances*.
 The measurements communicated prove that for different
 substances the magnetic change is at least of the same order
of magnitude, and certainly not directly dependent upon the
atomic weight. The variation of the phenomenon with wave
 length, however, seems more complicated than follows from
the hypothesis mentioned, and in fact in Lorentz’s theory
there is no it priori reason to be given for its probability‘l.
    3. The Rowland grating used was one of radius 6 feet
and 14,438 lines to the inch. The second spectrum was used
in most cases. With a medium-sized induction-coil and one
large leyden-jar twenty minutes exposure was suf<U+FB01>cient in the
most sensitive part of the spectrum. Pure metals were used
as electrodes.     In each position of the apparatus always two
(and often several) negatives were taken, one with and one
without the magnetic <U+FB01>eld. The plates used were Cadett and
Neal and Marion instantaneous; they were developed with
hyd roquinone. In some photochemical dif<U+FB01>culties Dr. Ernst
Uohen was kind enough to give me his assistance.

   The lines on the plates were identi<U+FB01>ed by comparison with
the solar spectrum. The negatives were measured on an
ordinary dividing-engine, with a microscope reading directly
to TQM of a millimetre, or by estimating the tenths of divisions
on the head to 10166 of a millimetre. The accuracy of the
measurement of the interval between the components of
course largel varies with the metal used as electrode. In a
spectrum with sharp lines, for instance that of zinc or cad
mium, this interval can be measured with an accuracy
exceeding that of the magnetic measurements in our case.
In the case of other substances, for instance copper or tin, the
lines are so hazy, or of so small intensity, that it is only
possible to make an estimation.
    As an example of the accuracy obtained when magnetic
triplets resulting from bright sharp lines are measured by
means of the microscope of the dividing-engine, I will give
some measurements concerning the line 4722 of the spectrum
of zinc. The numbers in the following table are the readings
 (“to- of a millimetre) on the head of a micrometer-screw when
the <U+FB01>rst and the second component respectively was under the

   It appears, as is also indicated in the table, that some lines
are not changed under the in<U+FB02>uence of the <U+FB01>eld, or at least so
little that the magnetic change, if it exists, is extremely '
small*. It deserves to be noted that between the <U+FB01>rst three
lines in the table clearly showing the magnetic change, and
the last three not showing it, there exists also another inter
esting difference. Indeed, the <U+FB01>rst are the group of three
lines resulting from Kayser and Bunge’s second subor
 dinate series for the value 3 of the coe<U+FB02>icient n in their
formula'I'. The second group of three lines follows from the
<U+FB01>rst subordinate series, 11 being 4. Further inquiry must
decide whether all lines of the <U+FB01>rst series are not in<U+FB02>uenced,
 only those of the second being changed.

    The lines of the tin spectrum are very feeble. With the
magnetic <U+FB01>eld off, the lines indicated in the table all clearly
appeared on the negative after an exposure of 15 minutes.
Exposing, however, with the <U+FB01>eld on, only the <U+FB01>rst two lines
were on the plate, notwithstanding that the time of exposure
was prolonged to 23 minutes, the other circumstances being the
same as before. Apparently the <U+FB01>rst and the last two lines
undergo a magnetic change ; the last lines (being the feeblest)
did not impress their components on the plate. The com
ponents of 4585 were so feeble that they disappeared if looked
at through the microscope.         For this reason I have made a
scratch at each of the components by means of a needle, and
have measured the distance of these scratches.

   Analytical Table, by JOHN HENRY BRIDGES (vol. i. pp. 188+404,
   v01. ii. pp. 568). Oxford: Clarendon Press.
“      OGER BACON, l’un des plus puissants génies du Moyen
           age, occupe le premier rang parmi les promoteurs de la
renaissance générale dos lettres et des sciences.        Il contribua
particulierement aux progrés des Mathématiques en montrant,
dans plusieurs de ses ouvrages (Op. Maj: quatrieme, cinquiéme et
sixiéme parties), 1e rang qu’elles tiennent dans l’ensemble des cou
naissances humaines, et les secours qu’elles peuvent procurer dans
toutes les recherches scienti<U+FB01>ques, dont elles sont le fondement.
Son Optique contient, comme tout le monde 1e sait, de savants
apergus et des découvertes réelles en thc'orie, et l’invention de plu
sieurs instruments devenus de la plus haute utilité. Ses connais
sauces en Astronomie lui <U+FB01>rent reconnaitre les erreurs du calen
drier, dont i1 congut la reformation. Le calendrier qu’il calcula, et
qui est resté manuscrit, se distingue par sa correction et par
l’usage des chiifres arabes, qui sont les mémes que ceux de Sacro
Bosco.” So writes Chasles in his Apercu (p. 517), and the same
verdict is pronounced by Hallam and other writers whom we have
consulted.
   “ The 13th century, an age peculiarly rich in great men, pro
duced few, if any, who can take higher rank than Roger Bacon.
He is in every way worthy to be placed beside such thinkers as
Albertus Magnus, Bonaventure, and Thomas Aquinas ” (Encyc.
Britannica).     The same writer quotes Diihring to the e<U+FB01>ect that
Bacon was not appreciated by his age because he was so completely
in advance of it; he is a. 16th or 17th century philosopher, whose
lot has been by some accident cast in the 13th century; he is no
schoolman, but a. modern thinker, whose conceptions of science
are more just and clear than are even those of his more celebrated

  202               ll'otz'ces respecting New Boo/cs.
  namesake.       With this agrees Hallam’s remark, “ the mind of
  Roger Bacon was strangely compounded of almost prophetic
  gleams of the future course of science, and the best principles of
  the inductive philosophy, with a more than usual credulity in the
  superstitions of his own time ” (‘ Literary History,’ pt. i. cap. ii.).
     The present editor adduces the extreme rarity of Jebbs’s edition
  (1733)—which was reprinted seventeen years subsequently in
  Venice—as a suf<U+FB01>cient reason for this new edition. The Introduc
 tion contains a life of Bacon (pp. xxi—xxxvi), a discussion of Bacon’s
 position in the metaphysical controversies of the 13th century
  (pp. xxxvi-xliii), an account of his “Scriptum principale” (pp. xliii—
 xlviii), of his Philology (pp. xlviii-liv), and of his Mathematics
 (pp. lv—lix). “ It would seem that Bacon had made himself
 acquainted with the highest mathematics of his time; though no
 evidence is forthcoming to show that be contributed personally to
 the advance of the science, otherwise than by strongly insisting on its
 culture, and by pointing out new <U+FB01>elds for its practical application,
 in the better government of the Church, and in the development of
 industry. His interest, like that of Galileo, lay in applied rather
 than in abstract mathematics.” Bacon says “ Scientiarum ports. et
 clavis est Mathematics.” The introduction further gives an account
 of Bacon’s Astrology (pp. lix—lxv), of his views of the Propagation
 of Force (pp. lxv-lxix), of his Optics (pp. lxix—lxxiv), of his
 Alchemy, of his views on experimental science and on Moral Phi—
 losophy (pp. lxxix—lxxxviii), concluding with an account of the
 general characteristics of the Opus Majus (pp. lxxxviii-xcii). “ It
 appears on the surface that Bacon belongs to the order of thinkers,
 typi<U+FB01>ed by Pythagoras rather than by Aristotle, who engage in
 speculation, not for its own sake alone, but for social or ethical
 results, that are to follow. . . .1n wealth of words, in brilliancy of
 imagination, Francis Bacon was immeasurably superior.              But
Roger Bacon had the sounder estimate and the <U+FB01>rmer grasp of that
 combination of deductive with inductive method which mark the
 scienti<U+FB01>c discoverer. Finally, Francis Bacon was of his time ; with
 Roger Bacon it was far otherwise.”-—Before the text, an account of
 which is given in the preface (pp. vii—xix), comes an excellent
 analysis of the Opus llIajus (pp. xciii—clxxxvii.) This is of great
 utility for a. study of the work. The editor’s suf<U+FB01>cient reason
 is stated above, he adduces as a more cogent reason the fact that
Jebbs's edition is incomplete. Here we regret to <U+FB01>nd that re—
 viewers who have had access to the MSS., some additional to those
 consulted by our author, join issue with him, and so far from
pronouncing it to be the de<U+FB01>nitive edition which has been looked
for, pronounce it to be “full of gross errors.” We close with
stating another good point, viz., that there is an Index at the end.
Applied Mechanics.           By JOHN     PERRY,  M.E., D.Sc., F.R.S.,
    Professor of Mechanics and Mathematics in the Royal College
    of Science, London. London: Cassell & Co., 1897.
IT may safely be said that no teacher of engineering is more
anxious that the subject should be properly taught, and has given.

                    Notices respecting New Books.                203
more attention to discovering better methods of instruction, than
Professor Perry. The present treatise is therefore the result of
great experience and much experiment in educational method, and
as such it is addressed to the teacher as well as to the student of
the subject. According to the author—and every teacher of any
experimental science will, doubtless, agree with him—n0 course of
instruction in applied mechanics can be considered complete or
men satisfactory, which does not include a considerable amount of
laboratory practice. Laboratory work will, however, have a far
greater educational value if it be performed with apparatus
possessing such imperfections as are present in actual machinery.
The student should not only learn the simple laws of mechaniCs,
but he ought to investigate for himself how, why, and to what
extent these simple laws are departed from in practical con
trivances. For example, the familiar Atwood’s machine should
be devoid of friction-wheels, and its pulley should be a heavy
one; the student will then be able to study and allow for the
effects of friction, and he will learn much concerning the dynamics
of rotation. To teachers of physics this may appear at <U+FB01>rst sight
quite heterodox, but it must be borne in mind that physical and
 engineering laboratories perform different functions; in the
former natural laws are learned and veri<U+FB01>ed, and the physical
properties of substances are measured, while in the latter the
student is taught the application of these laws and substances
to the requirements of everyday life. The engineer may therefore
assume the truth of his formulae; it is the duty of the physicist
and the mathematician to establish and prove them.
   The author experienced difficulties in teaching applied mechanics
on account of his students’ ignorance of the rudiments of
differential and integral calculus, and eventually was obliged to
include these among the subjects of his course of lectures. ‘Ve
know of one college where the same dif<U+FB01>culty is felt in connexion
_with the physics course, and doubtless there are other cases.
Having regard to the increasing importance of science subjects
and of applied mathematics, it appears very desirable that the
teachers of mathematics in schools should be asked and encouraged
to alter the order in which their subject is taught, so as to give
an earlier and more prominent place to the elements of the
calculus. The Science and Art Department might possibly assist
matters by introducing the calculus into the syllabus of their
examinations at some stage earlier than the sixth; the difficulty
will, however, not be completely removed until those who direct
school education recognize to a much greater extent the necessity for
increasing the amount of time devoted by the scholars to mathe
matical studies.
   The subjects treated in the volume cover a wide range, and
it is full of suggestion both to teacher and student, while the
characteristic manner in which the author gives ad vice and caution
seems to bring the reader into personal contact with him, and
completely distinguishes his treatise from any of the ordinary
text-books.              ‘                                J. L. H.

 IN 1895 the author delivered a course of lectures in the University
 of Turin, on light considered as an electromagnetic phenomenon.
 The book before us contains an account of the experimental

 form in which they were repeated by the author in his lectures.
 The volume contains over 100 illustrations, the majority of which
 are of very poor quality and several almost unintelligible. The
 experiments are fairly well described, but the work suffers greatly
 by the omission of the non—experimental parts of the subject.

§l. OF late years much has been done, especially in
                France and Germany, to increase the accuracy of
the measurement of temperatures by means of mercury
thermometers. An excellent account, with illustrations, of
some of the more important practical results is 'ven in
Chap. II. of Waldo’s ‘Modern Meteorology’ ; but t e scope
of this work hardly allows of the subject being treated in
detail except where meteorological questions are directly
concerned.         “’ith this partial exception, I know of no

English text-book where particulars of recent work may be
found. The following discussion is intended partly to supply
this want. Few of the subjects it deals with are novel,
except in details; and several are discussed at much greater
length in Dr. Guillaume’s admirable work ‘ Thermome't'rz'e
de Précz'sz'on,’ in the publications of the Bureau International,
and in those of the Phys. tech. Reichsanstalt at Charlotten- '
burg. I am indebted to these sources for many of the
details mentioned here.          I have, however, adopted an
independent standpoint, and have further considered the
bearing of recent work on the methods in general use in this
country.
   The ideal mercury-thermometer is one which accommodates
itself at once and completely to the temperature it is for the
time being exposed to, and which when exposed to a given
temperature supplies an invariable reading.
    The departures from this ideal will be discussed presently,
after we have considered the nature of the temperature-scale
of an imaginary glass-mercury thermometer free from all the
de<U+FB01>ciencies.
    §2. For the laws of thermal expansion of mercury and
 glass we may assume provisionally
                     V=V0(1+A1t+A2t’+ ..), .‘ . . . (1)
                     'U=Uo(1+a1t+a2te+     - -)- - . -  o  .
    Here t denotes temperature on a standard scale, which we
 may suppose that of the hydrogen-thermometer of the Bureau
International ; V0 is the volume at 0° 0., and V at t° C. of a
given mass of mercury, A1, A2, &c., constants de<U+FB01>ning its
expansion; co is the volume at 0° 0., and v at t° C. of a
‘given mass of glass, a1, a2, &c. expansion-constants for the
particular kind of glass.
    The natural scale of the thermometer corresponds to the
case when its stem between the divisions 0 and 100—which
 answer to the freezing- and boiling-points of pure water
 under a standard pressure—is subdivided into 100 equal
volumes. Degree divisions below 0° C. or above 100° C.
should equal in volume those of the fundamental interval
 0° to 100°.     Suppose that t and t+a: are corresponding tem
 peratures 0n the hydrogen and glass-mercury scales. At
 0° C. the volume of the mercury is equal to the internal
volume V0 of the thermometer bulb, including the stem up
to the zero mark. At temperature t° C. the volume of the
 mercury is equal to that of the bulb and of t+w stem

            The preceding formulae are not of course legitimate for all
       values of t. The freezing- and boiling-points of mercury
       assign limits to the application of (3), and in the immediate
       neighbourhood of these points—especially of the boiling
       point—its accuracy is somewhat uncertain. At ordinary
       temperatures the series on the right of (1) converges rapidly,
       Alt being much the most important term. The glass of our
       present problem is ideal. There is perhaps no actual glass of
       whose expansion we know enough to judge whether it is
       expedient to retain any term higher than aptQ in (2) . In all
       ordinary kinds of glass al/Al is of the order 1/7, and so e1
       may be assumed necessarily positive. The sign of e, is more
       uncertain, and as regards es and e, nothing is known except
       that the terms depending on them appear to be of little
       importance.
            Supposing our ideal glass to resemble ordinary glass in
       the general laws of its expansion, (1+a1t+a,t’i+...)—1 is
       nearly unity and replaceable by a factor (1—a1t. . .), pro
       ceeding in ascending powers of t. Thus (6) may be regarded
       as of the general type ‘*

  where the B coef<U+FB01>cients vary with the nature of the glass.
   Doubtless (7) is convergent forthe restricted values of t
  occurring in our problem; but it would not be safe to assume
  that B0 is always the most important term. For instance, if
  we neglect all constants with su<U+FB01>ixes greater than 2, we
  reduce (6) to
  x=t(100—t)(1+a1t+a2t9)_1{%g       e a 100a —e +a2t}, (8)
  and conceivably e1(a1 + 100a,) —e2 might be very small.
      It is important to notice that even if mercury and glass
  had both a linear law of expansion, on the hydrogen scale, a:
  would not vanish, but would be given as a <U+FB01>rst approximation
  by                       w=a1t(lOO—t). .      .  .  .  .  .  (9)
  This is a relation of the same form as that proposed by
   Callendar for the difference between the platinum-resistance
  and air-thermometer scales.
      The divergences between actual glass-mercury and hy
   drogen scales depend partly on the departures of glass from
  our ideal; their discussion is thus postponed until the
  properties of glass have been dealt with.
                      Properties of Real Glass.
      § 3. The principal departure of real glass from our ideal is
  that its volume at a given temperature is not invariable. It
  is well known that if a mercury-thermometer employed at
   ordinary temperatures be tested at intervals in ice it usually
   reads higher as time progresses, i. e. its zero rises. Its
  behaviour is explicable on the hypothesis of a secular con
  traction of the bulb, becoming gradually slower as time
   elapses. By properly annealing the tubes, and storing them
   for several years before dividing them, this defect may be
   very largely if not entirely got rid of ; and it can in any but
   a very new thermometer be easily allowed for in reducing
   observations. This change of zero, be it noticed, is believed
  to occur however uniform be the temperature at which a
  thermometer is kept.
      When we expose a thermometer to changes of temperature
  a further defect presents itself, which for thermometry of the
  highest accuracy is much more troublesome. Within certain
  limits, the increase of volume in glass accompanying rise of
  temperature from, say,t to t’ does not wholly disappear at
  once when the temperature is rapidly reduced to t. A
  thermometer taken through such a cycle reads lower on the
   second exposure to the lower temperature. This phenomenon

              Dr. C. Chree’s Notes on Thermometry.          209
 is conspicuous when we compare ice-readings taken immedi
 ately before and after exposure to temperatures between
 50° C. and 100° C. ; the “depression of zero,” as it is called,
 is greater the higher the previous temperature. Exposure
 for only a minute or two to a high temperature is only
 partially e<U+FB01>'ective; but 20 or 25 minutes exposure usually
 produces practically the full effect. On the other hand, the
 depression takes a considerable time to disappear; it is a
question of days or even weeks if the high temperature has
ap roached 100° C.
      itherto at the Bureau International attention has been
 mainly directed to a standard glass, French verre dur, at
temperatures between -—30° C. and 100° C. At the Beichs
anstalt certain Jena glasses, notably 16‘" and 59‘“, have
been examined in similar detail. The conclusion reached for
these glasses throughout at least this range, is that the
di<U+FB02>iculty can be met by treating a reading zt in ice immedi
ately after the measurement of any temperature t as the zero
of the thermometer for the preceding observation. This is
equivalent to the conclusion that the residual or after-e<U+FB02>'ect,
whose existence is made manifest by the depression of zero,
remains practically unchanged during the brief interval
required to observe both t and 2;. If t as been preceded by
a higher temperature, the residual effect is in reality larger,
but it depresses equally the readings t and zt. This method
of a “movable zero ’ requires that in determining the
fundamental interval the boiling-point 100° C. be <U+FB01>rst
determined, and that the ice-reading 2100 be taken immediately
after.
   The ordinary practice in this country proceeds on the
hypothesis of a “<U+FB01>xed zero.” In determining the funda
mental interval the observation of the ice-point precedes that
of the boiling-point; and in ordinary use the observed
departure from 0° in a preliminary observation in ice is
applied as a constant correction at all points of the scale.
The relative merits of the movable zero and <U+FB01>xed zero
methods will be discussed later; in the mean time let us
consider what modi<U+FB01>cations are required in the theory
developed for the ideal thermometer.
    §4. In ordinary investigations of thermal expansion the
temperature is gradually raised, and the volume compared at
intervals with that originally possessed by the material at
0° C.    This is a <U+FB01>xed zero method; thus supposing a1, (1,,
&c. to have the values obtained in ordinary experiments, (6)
is immediately applicable in ordinary British thermometry,
provided readings be always taken with the temperature

slowly rising,_ and the zero employed answer really to
prolonged exposure to the temperature 0° C.               _         .
    The movable zero method is analogous to experiments 1n
which the volume v of glass at temperature t is compared
with a volume 0’“) obtained after suddenly cooling the glass
to 0° 0. Instead of attempting to modify (6) to suit these
 circumstances, I shall develop the theory independently.
     §5. If the changes in temperature are slow, as is really
 assumed in the movable zero method, except in zero deter
 minations, then so long as t is increasing we may regard '0’“)
 as a continuous function of t, which for ordinary values of t
 di<U+FB01>'ers little from a constant. We may thus provisionally
 assume
                 v'¢,0=v0(1+bl't+b2’t2+b3't3+...);        .   .   (10)
 where vozv'm is the volume answering to prolonged exposure
 to 0° C., while bl’, 62’, &c., are absolute constants for the
 particular glass.
     Though not essential for our present purpose, we may
  notice that combining (2) and (10) we deduce a relation of
  the type
                   v=v’t,o(l+b1t+b2t2+b3t3+...) ;           .  .   (11)
  where        a1=b1+l)1l,   02=ll2+bgl+ bibll- . . &C- ;       .
  or, in general, to a <U+FB01>rst approximation
                      111=a1—l)1l, bg=a2—bgl.
      Let S represent the volume at 100° C. of the bulb and tube
  up to the division 100, and at the same temperature let 100s
  denote the volume of the fundamental interval. Then the
  mercury at 100° C. has a volume S, and at any other tem
  perature t (on the hydrogen scale) it has by (1) a volume
         S(1+A1t+A,t"-+. ..)-:- (1+100A1+1002A2+. . .).
   The volume of the bulb, including the stem up to the
   division 0, when the glass has been suddenly cooled to
   0° C. after exposure to 100° 0., is equal to the volume
   S-I—(1+ 100A1+ 1009A2+. .       of the mercury at 0° C. Thus
   its volume at temperature 6 under the conditions supposed

        Strictly speaking, the terms in bl'a2 and liglag in the <U+FB01>rst
        line of (16) should be omitted, as others of the same order
        have been neglected. Their retention, however, can do no

           read must emerge from the ice, the temperature to which 8'
           corresponds is uncertain. In ordinary glass, however, the
           volume at 100° C. exceeds that at 0° C.           only about 1 part
           in 400, and y’M ~l-z/100,0 is seldom as much as 0°"3 C.       Thus,
           at least within the range 0° to 100° 0., we can hardly
           introduce an error so large as 0°‘001 C. by supposing 8'
           in (17) to answer to the temperature t.
              Doing so, neglecting 10061' + 100211;: 1, and using (15),
           we get

           Thus the second line in the expression (16) for y’ is simply
           {10, and hence for the difference y between the glass and

            Comparing (19) and (6), we see that to the degree of ap

            Thus (19) might have been arrived at by using (11) instead
            of (2) and following a method more analogous to that by
            which (6) was obtained.
               §6. To see more exactly what we are doing it is con
            venient at this stage to consider the order of magnitude of
            the several constants. For this purpose verre dur may be
            selected as an example, taking the <U+FB01>rst approximations to the
            constants, which are quoted by Guillaume *, viz. :—
                           A1: 182 X 10‘“,      A2: 3 x10’”,
                            a1: 22 X 10_6,       a2: 24 X 10_9,
            and hence       ex: 160 X 10‘“,      e2: —21 x 104.
               These <U+FB01>gures make 100 eg/el= —1/80 approximately,
                             100 a1+ 1009 a2:       1/400        ,,

               To arrive at an idea of the size of b1’ &0. we utilize the
            fact that in verre dur the depressed zero after 100° C. is

Thus from (18)

             e1+100e2+...+(bl’+100b,’+...)                    =10'
Having regard to the small value found above for
100 a, + 1002a,, we thence deduce as a close approximation
          (b1’+100b,’+. . .)/(e1 +100 e,+ . . .)=1/1000,
and so, from above, bl’ + 100 b,’ + . . .= l/@300,000 roughly.
    The size of a1 seems fairly uniform in different kinds of
glass, so that e1 never differs much from the value 160 X 10—6
found above. The size of a, and e; is probably much more
variable, but 100 ez/el is, doubtless, in all cases a small fraction.
Similarly the size of (bl'+100 b2’+. . .)/(e1+ 100 02+ . . is
certainly somewhat variable; it may be as large in some
kinds of glass as 1/300, but we are unlikely to commit an
serious error if we treat it as a quantity of the order 1/1000
in English glass.
    § 7. Thus in neglecting b,’+ 100 b,’+ . . . in the denominator
of(19) we should only make an error ofthe order 1/1000 in the
value of 3/.    Now between 0° C. and 100° C. the largest value
of y seldom approaches 0°‘5 (1., so throughout at least this
range the neglect is abundantly justi<U+FB01>ed, even when accuracy
of the order 0°'OOl C. is aimed at. At temperatures much
above 100° C. the neglect of b1’+ 100 b2’+. . . would require
 more consideration.     Neglecting it provisionally, we deduce
 from (6) and (19)
              _    _    t(100-t){b,’—albl’...}
             'z—y_(1+a1t+...)(e1+100e2+...)"                    '    (2°)
    As we have already seen, aI is of the order 2 x 10—5, and
 b<U+FB02>/e, appears seldom to approach 1/400. Thus for values of
t between 0° and 100°
                               +a1t - o -) (31+     eg . - -)
is a quantity of the order 0°‘0001 C., and so may be neglected.
 For the same range of temperature w—y is a small              fraction
of a degree, and we may thus write 1 for 1 +a1t+. ..           in (20).
Thus we conclude that for practical purposes—so                long at
 least as t is not considerably in excess of 100—we            may re
place (20) by
            w-y=t(100—t)b,’+(e1+100e,+...). . . (21)
 Our reasoning does not necessarily imply that b,'/a1b1’ is

large. There may be cases where it is not large; only for
them w—y is negligible.
   §8. As our treatment of the movable zero method rests
on (10), it is desirable to indicate the experimental basis for
this formula, especially as by doing so we shall see more
clearly how to obtain numerical results for 61', b2], and w—y.
   The experimental basis is simply that in ordinary thermo
meters used in a de<U+FB01>nite way the depression D, in the zero
reading, after exposure to moderate temperature t, is given
satisfactorily by a formula of the type
                         Dt=d1t+d2t2+- - 0,         . -   I  e  .
where d,, d, are constants for the particular thermometer.
   If vo' be the volume of a scale-division, and V0 that of the
bulb up to the <U+FB01>xed zero mark after prolonged exposure to
0° C., we have
                           l’o'Dt = Vto _ V0,
where Vtyo is the volume of the bulb after sudden cooling
from t° to 0°. Hence by
           Vt,O=V0{ l + (dIUOI/v0)t + (devol/VO) ta + - -         ' (23)
This is a formula of the assumed type (10), with
               dl'llol/VO = [)1],   dgvol/Vo = b2’,    &0.  n  u
   In practice, as explained above, vo’ may differ from co, the
value corresponding to prolonged exposure to 0° C. The
divergence is, however, negligible in (23) for values of t not
exceeding 100°.      Neglecting it also in (24), we clearly have
b1’ and b2/ determined in terms of vO/VO, a quantity known
when the glass is known, and of dI and d2, constants deter
mined by experiments on the depressed zero readings after a
series of temperatures.
   In deducing (21) from (20) we neglected (a|t+a2t°)/l.
Thus to this degree of accuracy we may also neglect
100 a1 _+ 100%,, + . . . ; and when we do so we have from (4)
                       vo/V0=e,+ 100 e; +. . .
Hence, referring to (24), we see that (21) is equivalent to
                         w—y=t(100—t)d2.            . .   .  .  .   (25)

    Obviously in the case of French crystal the distinction
between the <U+FB01>xed and movable zero scales must be taken
into account, even for accuracy of the order 0°‘1 0.
    Generally speaking, English thermometer glass resembles
 more nearly French crystal than the other two glasses, in so
 far as at temperatures above 50° C. the term dgt” tends to
 predominate.
    Some experiments, however, at Kew Observatory, still
 incomplete, show notable di<U+FB02>’erences in the behaviour of
 different English thermometers, all nominally of the same
 glass. In some the depression of zero after exposure to
 100° C. is only a shade larger than in Jena glass 16‘“, in
 others'the depression is twice, or even thrice, as great.               If
 the cause is difference as regards annealing or in treatment,
 one would expect to hear of like differences in verre du'r and
 Jena glass thermometers.
    In all the English glass thermometers I have met with, d2
 was positive. This implies, it will be noticed, that they would
 read lower at —38° C. on the <U+FB01>xed zero than on the movable
 zero scale.

 The <U+FB01>rst-mentioned page gives details as to the degree of
 variability of composition in di<U+FB02>'erent samples of ver're dur.
    The relations to one another of the natural scales of verre
dur (movable zero), hydrogen, and nitrogen thermometers
have been examined experimentally at the Bureau Inter
national.      From the observations formulae of the type (7)
have then been calculated.           For instance, the formula* found
to connect t, temperature on the hydrogen scale, and t’, tem
  erature on the verre dur scale, throughout the range 0° to
 100° C. is
    t’— t=t(100 —t) x 10‘°(62'296 —0'48946t + '0012805t’) .
These formulae—which accord very closely with the actual
observations—are <U+FB01>nally employed to calculate tables‘l' of
differences between the several scales.
   At the Reichsanstalti the scales of 16‘“, 59‘", and other
Jena glasses have been compared with that of name dur, and
formulae of the Uallendar type have then been calculated to
suit the observed differences ; such, for instance, as

where 1516 is temperature on the scale of 16‘“, and t is the
mean for the scales of 1611‘ and verre dur. From these
formulae are deduced di<U+FB02>'erences between the several scales,
proceeding apparently to 0°'0001 C.               Particulars of“ a com
parison of the natural scales of verre dur and English crystal
by Wiebe*—proceeding to 0°'01 C. only—are quoted in
Guillaume’s ‘ Thermométrie,’ p. 214.
    Combining these data I have compiled the table on p. 218,
which refers all the scales to that of the hydrogen thermometer
at the Bureau International.
     § 12. As most of the data in the table depend on the com
parison of the verre (120' and hydrogen scales, it is only proper
to mention that a more recent comparison has been made at
the Bureau International ever part of the fundamental interval.
Full particulars do not appear to have been given as yet, but
the following preliminary details are contained in a recent
publication of the Bureau 1' :—

     The new determination was made by M. Chappuis, using a
 hydrogen thermometer having its reservoir of glass instead
 of, as previously, platinum-iridium.
      The close agreement of the two determinations at 40°,
 where the di<U+FB01>'erence between the scales is greatest, is empha
 sized in the text; but the very appreciable discrepancies at
 10° C. and 20° C. seem to me hardly in harmony with the
 conclusion “ Ainsi les anciennes mesures . . . sont complete
 ment con<U+FB01>rmées par les nouvelles . . .”
      § 13. At the Reichsanstalt comparisons have been made of
 thermometers of various kinds of glass and the air-thermo
 meter. Formulae have then been calculated to <U+FB01>t the observed
 differences between the natural scales as well as possible.
:These formulae, though really of the type (7), are arranged
 somewhat differently. For instance, over the range —20° C

to 100° C. the difference 8 between the natural scale of the
air-thermometer and Jena glass 59"I is represented by
        3 = t(100 —t) {'00000487 — '000,000,2638(100—t)
This appears to be the algebraic excess of the reading on the
air-thermometer, though I do not see an explicit statement to
that effect. At least it makes
        8=-0°'021 at 500 C., and +0°'064 at ~20° C.
                    Iligh- Temperature Results.
   § 14. At temperatures above 100° C. the most exact method of
comparing thermometers is probably to use the boiling-points
of a series of liquids. By modifying the pressure under which
the liquid boils, a single liquid may suf<U+FB01>ce for comparisons
over a very considerable range. Thus Crafts 1', in 1882,
covered a range of 70° C. with water-vapour alone. According
to Crafts, the method was suggested primarily by Regnault.
A liquid bath has certain advantages from its simplicity ; but
the stirring must be very 00d, and the whole of the mercury
in the thermometer-stem s ould, if possible, be immersed.
    In addition to instrumental dif<U+FB01>culties, troubles are apt to
arise from the behaviour of the thermometer-glass. A ther
mometer exposed for some hours, or even minutes, to a high
temperature, in excess of what it has been exposed to since its
construction, usually experiences a permanent rise in zero.
This is more especially true of tem eratures of 300° C. and
upwards. In some experiments by (Izuillaume 1', exposure for
ten hours to a temperature of between 360° and 380° C.
raised the zeros of three thermometers of verre dur, Jena
glass, and French crystal by 1°'8, 3°‘0, and 7°'0 C. respec
tively. Further heating for periods of twelve and ten hours
at the same temperature produced a considerable further rise.
Probably the most complete experiments on this subject have
been those by Crafts nearly twenty years ago. In 1879-80
he exposed eight thermometers, four of French crystal and
four of a German soda-glass, to a variety of temperatures,
the highest being 355° C.§ The exposures were of various
durations, from 20 minutes to several months. The rise in
the zero varied from 10° to 18°—0r, including rise under
preliminary treatment, even 26° C. The conclusions drawn
by Crafts were that the rise is much most rapid at the begin
  a “ Thatigkeit der Phys. Tech. Reichs.” (Zeits. f. Instr. 1894, p. 305).

ning of the exposure to a <U+FB01>xed temperature, that it tends
probably to a. maximum with prolonged exposure, and that it
is greatest in glasses containing lead.                 Together with the
permanent rise of zero there may exist a temporary depres
sion, and as the latter wears o<U+FB02>‘, on the thermometer’s being
exposed to a normal temperature, the permanent rise appa
rently increases.
     Owing to the permanent rise of zero, wholly erroneous
conclusions would be drawn as to the natural scale of a ther
mometer unless it had previously been exposed to a course of
treatment tending to reduce to a minimum the permanent
effect of exposure to any temperature within the range to which
the comparison is to be extended *. Generally speaking,
 the treatment consists in exposing the thermometer for some
time, preferably on more than one occasion, to a temperature
 higher than any at which the comparison is to be made, and
 allowing it to cool slowly 1'.

    As the “ Proces-_Verbaux ” remarks, “ cette fonction ne se
raccorde pas tres bien avec celle qui exprime la ditférence de
marche entre 0° et 100°”               § 11).
     The Bureau do not regard the results as very satisfactory,
owing to the fact that the differences between different verre
du'r thermometers “ peuvent a 200° atteindre 5 a 6 centiéines
de degré, quantité du lnéme ordre de grandeur que la di<U+FB02>‘ér
ence de marche par rapport au thermométrc a hydrogéne”
 (l. c. p. 45). For practical purposes, however, it is interesting
to know that even up to 200° C. the (movable zero) tempera
ture-reading from a were dur thermometer is likely to differ
from the hydrogen scale by less than O°'2 C.
     At the Reichsanstalt* comparisons of Jena-glass thermo
meters with the air-thermometer in an oil-bath over the range
100° to 300° C. are assigned an accuracy of 0°02 O. Even at
 500° C. the comparison of thermometers of Jena glass 59‘"—
 with the mercury prevented from boiling by gaseous pres
 sure—is apparently assigned an accuracy of the order 0°‘1 (1.,
 when auxiliary thermometers (Faden-thermometer) of a
special pattern are used to supply a correction for the emer
 gent column (see § 38).
     For the difference 8 between the natural scale of 59m and
that of the air-thermometer over the range 1000 to 300° C. the
 formula proposed is
       8=t(100 -t){ - '000007233—'0000004259(100—t) },
 This di<U+FB02>'er‘s somewhat conspicuously from the corresponding
 formula for the range —20° to 100° C. quoted in § 13.
     According to the formula, the two scales di<U+FB01>er by 07° C. at
 200° 0., and by 4°‘7 U. at 300° 0.
      § 16. Of earlier comparisons the best known are those of
 Regnault, whose results are quoted in several English works
 (e. g. Balfour Stewart’s ‘ Heat,’ Lord Kelvin’s ‘Mathematical
 and Physical Papers,’ vol. iii., Smithsonian ‘ Physical Tables,’
 1896). Two useful warnings with respect to these data are
 given by Crafts 1'. Firstly, Regnault used a <U+FB01>xed zero
 method ; secondly, French crystal glass for thermometers has
 been considerably altered since his time.            The Choisy-le-Roi
 crystal glass used by Regnault in particular contained nearly
twice as much lead as moderh French crystal. Crafts himself,
 in 1882, compared a number of thermometers of modern
French crystal glass, from two different makers, and likewise

   Crafts’s table really gives the corrections for every 10°.         It
steps at 330°, but I have obtained the data under 340° from
the other sources mentioned.         [n Crat'ts’s opinion the ordinary
French, German, and English thermometers ot' <U+FB01>lteen years
ago possessed fairly similar natural scales. It is important
to notice that even when, as in' line C of the table, the de
parture from a gas scale is small up to 250° 0., it may be
very considerable at temperatures over 300° C.

met with the recognition it merits.
                       Low- Temperature Results.
    §17. At temperatures below 0° C. the natural scales of
 mercury thermometers show much larger departures from
 the hydrogen scale than are met with between 0° and 100° C.
 Thus, according to the determinations of the Bureau Inter
 national, “ eerre dur reading less hydrogen reading”
               = —0°'170 at —20° 0.,
               = —O°'426 at the freezing-point of mercury.
     For this latter point the Bureau has found, “ avec une ap
 proximation de 2 centiémes dc degré ” 1',
                  ~38°'80 C. on the hydrogen scale,
                  ~39°'22 C. on the scale of oerre dur.
     As to the scale of English glass at temperatures below 0° C.,
  the only published result I know of is a determination of the
  freezing-point of mercury on the natural (<U+FB01>xed zero) scale
  of a Kew Standard, No. 45, by Balfour Stewart 1. The mean
  of three separate experiments—giving an extreme difference
  of 0°‘1 F.—was
                          —38°'2 F. (—39°'O 0.).
  This comes much nearer the hydrogen scale than does the
  vet-re dur reading.
      Results from a single thermometer are, however, at best
   somewhat inconclusive, and some doubt might reasonably be
   entertained as to the closeness of the temperature produced
   by freezing mercury in Balfour Stewart’s apparatus to that
   produced in the Bureau International’s experiments.
      As to the latter point some collateral evidence exists. The
   experiments on the Kew Standard, No. 45, are mentioned in
   Balfour Stewart’s paper on the determination of the freezing
   point of mercury on the scale of the air-thermometer, and
   seem to have been carried out under fairly similar conditions
   to those of the main object of the research.
       The hydrogen and air scales are unlikely to differ much

at —39° 0., and Balfour Stewart’s‘ determination of the
freezing-point of mercury on the scale of the air-thermometer,
viz. —37°'93 F. (or —38°'85 0.), differs by only O°'O5 0.
from the Bureau’s determination on the hydrogen scale.
This collateral evidence is, however, somewhat weakened by
the fact that Balfour Stewart states that the mercury used in
the experiments on thermometer N0. 45 was not the same as
that used with the air-thermometer.
   § 18. Since Balfour Stewart’s investigation there have
been numerous observations of the freezing-point of mercury
on calibrated Kew standard thermometers of English glass.
The results deduced at Kew Observatory for the freezing
point of mercury on the natural (<U+FB01>xed zero) scales of twenty
of these thermometers are as follows :—
              highest —38°'l5 F. (—38°'97 0.),
             mean —38°'35 F. (—39°'O8 0.),
              lowest —38°'50 F. (—39°'17 0.).
The thermometers were read to the nearest O°'O5 F. only.
   In sixteen out of the twenty thermometers the reading lay
between—38°25 F. and —38°'45 F., and as errors of reading
of 0°'O5 F. might easily arise, there can be little doubt that the
Inlean found above is fairly representative for ordinary English
g ass.
   To test the accuracy of the method, and obtain a connexion
with the hydrogen scale, I had three of the twenty thermo
meters—which had remained at the Observatory— artially
recalibrated and retried together in the mercury bat , while
two independent observations were made in the bath with a
Tonnelot thermometer standardized at the Bureau Inter
national. The results obtained with the three Kew standards,
after allowing for the secular change of zero, were practically
identical with those found on separate occasions many years
ago.   While the results obtained on the two occasions with
the Tonnelot thermometer, read to O°'01 0. by the unaided
eye, differed by only O°'O2 0., and gave for the freezing-point
of mercury
              --39°'286 0. on the verre dur scale,
or, applying the Bureau’s table,
              —38°'86 0. on the hydrogen scale.
   The reading with the Tonnelot thermometer is 0°‘06 0.
lower than that accepted by the Bureau, and 1 am not certain

that the determination of the zero corresponding to the
temperature —39° C. was carried out exactly in the way
approved by the Bureau, but any failure in this respect
would, I think, he more likely to increase than reduce the
apparent difference.
   Thus the experiments with the Tonnelot thermometer
show that if the Kew apparatus gives a different result from
that of the Bureau, this difference tends to exaggerate the
apparent departure of the natural English glass scale from
that of the hydrogen thermometer. It has also to be borne
in mind that, as stated in § 10, an English glass thermometer
treated like the verre dur thermometer on a movable zero
method would give a reading algebraically higher, and so
nearer that of the hydrogen thermometer, than when treated
as at Kew Observatory.
   § 19. It may appear that undue space has been given to
the question 01" the temperature answering to the freezing
point of mercury, and the corresponding reading of English
glass thermometers. Since Balfour Stewart’s determination,
however, very considerable importance has attached to this
point. For many years it was not unusual to treat the
freezing-point of mercury as a third <U+FB01>xed point (taken as
——37°'9 F.) on the scale of mercury thermometers, sub
dividing the tube below 32° F. by reference to the observed
readings in freezing ice and freezing mercury.                This pro
duced a thermometer in which the degree volumes below
32° F. were equal amongst themselves but unequal to those
above 32° F.
   The object, of course, was to produce a mercury thermo
mometer whose readings should lie nearer those of the air
thermometer than if it were divided into identically equal
volumes throughout ; and so would give better results when
no corrections were applied, other than for observed change
of ice reading. This practice, no doubt, may be regarded
with far from silent contempt by the present generation of
physicists; but to our ruder ancestors, who thought an
accuracy of from 0°‘l to 0°‘2 F. at temperatures below 32° F.
something on which to congratulate themselves, the idea
seemed an ingenious one. However bad, or the reverse, the
idea was, the fact remains that a good many mercury-thermo
meters divided in this way have been used in this country
and its colder dependencies. >              =
   Even at the present day it is the practice of English
opticians to take —37°'9 F. as a <U+FB01>xed point in the con
struction of spirit thermometers‘“ used for low-temperature
        “ Qf. Balfour Stewart's ‘Heat,’ 1st edition, Art. 26.

         Absolute Method of Graduating a Thermometer.              227
 meteorological investigations; and many, perhaps most, low
 Canadian temperatures have been observed on these instru
ments.
    My own belief is that for ordinar          meteorological uses
the idea was by no means bad, and tli’at it might, for very
low temperatures, when accuracy of 0°‘1 or 0°"2 F. is good
enough, he carried farther.
   Instead of trying to make the scale of the mercury or
spirit thermometer coincide with that of a gas thermometer
at three points only, one might, if one knew the natural scale
well enough, make it coincide ata considerably larger number
of points. The calculated alterations to make to the data
supplied by calibration would not entail any very serious
trouble.
   The other reason for dwelling on the facts is that they are
at least strongly suggestive that the glass employed in this
country for making thermometers is not quite so uniform as
one would like it to be. The <U+FB01>gures given in § 18 for the
freezing-point of mercury 011 the natural scales of twent
English lass thermometers showed a. difference of 0°‘35Fl:
between t as extremes. I was inclined to attribute the greater
part of this to possible errors of reading, or impurity of the
mercury used on one or two occasions in the bath. A direct
comparison, however, of the two extreme thermometers,.
freshly recalibrated, in the same bath of' freezing mercury
fairly con<U+FB01>rmed the previously observed difference.               The
result is perhaps not absolutely conclusive, because the
purity of the mercury inside thermometers has to be taken
for granted ; and if this con<U+FB01>dence is misplaced, the point at
which the consequences would be most serious would likely
be the freezing-point of mercury itself.                    '

XXV. On Lord Kelzrin’s Absolute Met/rod of Graduating a
            Thermometer.    By J. ROSE-INNES, B.Sc.*
IN a paper “ On the Thermal Effects of Fluids in Motion ”
       Lord Kelvin has given the cooling effects exhibited by
various gases in passing through a porous plug; and he
found that the effects for any one gas kept at the same
initial temperature were proportional to the difference of
pressure on the two sides of the plug (Reprinted Papers, vol. 1. '

228           Mr. J. Rose-Innes on Lord Kelvin’s Absolute
very well in the case of air.                For carbonic acid, however,
the results furnished by this rule are not so satisfactory, as
may be seen by inspecting the table given by him comparing
the actual with the theoretical cooling effect (loc. cit. p. 429).
Moreover in the case of hydrogen it is found that there is a
heating effect, which increases, if anything, when the tempe
rature rises, so that here the law of the inverse square of the
temperature is wholly inapplicable. It seemed to me that it
might be possible to hit upon some simple algebraic expres
 sion which should reproduce the experimental results rather
 better than Lord Kelvin’s rule does; and in fact it was found
that a satisfactory agreement between observation and calcu
lation might be obtained by putting
                           cooling effect: % —,8,
 where a and B are constants characteristic of the gas, and T
 is the absolute temperature.

than Lord Kelvin’s; there is nothing astonishing in this as
it contains two dispOsable constants instead of only one.
But it has the following further advantages :—
    (i.) It includes the three cases of air, hydrogen, and
carbonic acid under one form, and therefore enables us to treat
them all in one common investigation.
    (ii.) It renders more manageable the differential equation
concerned in the thermodynamic scale of temperature, and
leads to simpler algebraic results after integration.
   This last proposition we must now proceed to prove. It
is shown by Lord Kelvin that when a gas passes through a
porous plug we must have

correction necessary owing to the deviation of the substance
from a perfect gas.      It is this quantity which is calculated
and tabulated so as to give us the means of arriving at the
absolute scale. We notice that in order to calculate this
term, we require to know the value of t, the very quantity
we are seeking to <U+FB01>nd. Suf<U+FB01>ciently accurate, however, for
the purpose of calculating this small term, will be the value

        Thermodynamic Correction for Constant-volume

   We will now compare the indications of a gas-thermometer
kept at constant volume with the thermodynamic scale of
temperature.

 Integrate this between the limits t and 00 and we have
where P is the value of 2’, as v and t are made to grow
 inde<U+FB01>nitely large with p constant. To determine the form of
 P we must appeal to experiment. We know that when a
gas is made to expand to larger and larger volumes it obeys
Boyle’s law more and more closely; hence we infer that
 when 1; and t are made inde<U+FB01>nitely large, the value of it) must
 vary inversely as the pressure.    We may therefore write
                                    Y

    To the degree of approximation to which we are working,
  therefore, there is no thermodynamic correction needed for a
  constant-volume gas thermometer. There may be a correc
  tion involving squares of small quantities, which would
  appear on a nearer approximation. Such a correction,
  however, would not be worth taking into account in the
  case of a thermometer constructed with air or hydrogen, as
  the unavoidable errors of experiment would certainly be
  much larger than the correction. It is satisfactory to know
  that for all practical purposes absolute temperature is to be
  obtained with very great accuracy from Regnault’s thermo
  metric system by simply adding the value of to to his numbers
  for temperature on the centigrade scale.

 of a new expression, at least as good as Lord Kelvin’s, for

 XXVl. 0n the Simple Isomm'plu'sms qfu Subsiitulion- Group
               to itself. By G. A. MILLER, I’h.D.‘
       OST of the dif<U+FB01>culties connected with the study of
         groups reside either in the simple groups or in the
 general problem of isomorphisms.            One of the fundamental
 elements of this problem consists of the simple isomorphisms
 of a group to itself. It is our object to givea general outline
 of this element, together with a few details which appear new
 and of considerable importance in the study of the intransitive
 substitution-groups.
    The simplest method of making a group (G) simply iso
 morphic to itself is that by which we write after each one of
its substitutions‘l' the transform with respect to some substi
tution that is commutative to G. That we obtain a simple
isomorphism in this way, follows directly from the equation
                      s_1t1s . s“1f2s = s-‘tltzs.
 From this equation it also follows that we oblain a simple
isomorphism when the transforming substitution is not com
mutative to G.         In this case it would, however, not be a
simple isomorphism of G to itself.
    Instead of transforming every substitution of G by the
same substitution, we may employ different transformers for
the different substitutions. It is necessary and su<U+FB02>icient that
all such transformers have the same effect upon the sub
stitutions to which they are applied, regarded as operators, as
a given transforming operator has upon the corresponding
operators of the simply isomorphic operation-group.
    Suppose that a regular group (it) is made simply iso
morphic to itself in any one of the possible ways. We mav
suppose that all the substitutions, except identity, begin with
 '* Communicated by the Author; having been read at the Detroit
Meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science,
1897.

the same element. The second elements in each of the cor
responding substitutions may be made identical by trans
forming one of the two constituent groups by means of a
substitution which does not contain the <U+FB01>rst element of all the
substitutions. As the groups remain simply isomorphic, and
their corresponding substitutions coincide with respect to
their <U+FB01>rst two elements, they must coincide throughout.
Hence, every simple isomorphism of R to itself may be
obtained by writing after each substitution of R its transform
with respect to a given substitution which does not contain an
arbitrary element of R.
     All the substitutions which transform B into itself, and
contain only elements of R, form a transitive group of
degree n, n being the order of R. A subgroup of this
group, which contains all its substitutions which do not
contain a given one of its n elements, cannot contain any
substitution besides identity that is commutative to every
substitution of R. Hence, no two substitutions of this
subgroup can transform all the substitutions of R in the
same manner. From the preceding paragraph it follows
that this subgroup transforms R into itself in every possible

     Since the order of the given subgroup is equal to the
order of the entire group divided by n, the latter must
contain just 11 substitutions that are commutative to every
substitution of B. These form a regular group, which coin
cides with B only when R is commutative. Each one of
these two regular groups is said to be the associate* of the
other. Before proceeding further in the consideration of
the simple isomorphisms of R to itself, it seems well to give
some de<U+FB01>nitions which apply to the general substitution
group.
           § 1. De<U+FB01>nitions and General Considerations.
     If we regard the substitutions of G as elements, we observe
that a substitution of these elements corresponds to every
simple isomorphism of G to itself and a substitution-group to
all the possible isomorphisms. This substitution-group (I)
has been called the group of isomorphisms of G. Its degree
is the order of G diminished by the number of its substi
tutions that correspond to themselves in every simple iso

number of substitutions that are commutative to every substitution of a
given regular group. Cf. Traité des Substitutions, p. 60.

236          Dr. G. A. Miller on the Simple Isomorphisms
morphism of G to itself. Hence it cannot exceed the order
 of G diminished by unity.
      If an isomorphism of G to itself can be obtained by trans
forming it with respect to one of its own substitutions, it is
said to be cogredient. All the other simple isomorphisms
 of G to itself are said to be contragredient. Two simple iso
morphisms of G to itself which cannot be transformed into
each other may be called distinct. Hence, the number of
distinct isomorphisms of G is equal to the number of different
intransitive groups of twice the degree of G that may be
formed by making G simple isomorphic to itself.
     When two isomorphisms are not distinct, they may be said
to be transform with respect to each other. All the cogredient
isomorphisms of G are transforms of the identical, but they
do not necessarily form a complete system of transforms.
The cogredient isomorphisms correspond to a self-conjugate
subgroup in the group of isomorphisms.                 The subgroup of
this group, which corresponds to the transforms of the
identical isomorphism, includes this self-conjugate subgroup ;
but it is not necessarily self-conjugate. From the fact that
the transforms of the identical isomorphism correspond to a
subgroup of the group of isomorphisms, it follows that the
total number of the simple isomorphisms of G to itself is
divisible by the number of the transforms of the identical
isomorphism.
     It may happen that a subgroup of G corresponds to itself
in all the possible simple isomorphisms of G to itself.               Fro
benius has called such a subgroup characteristic *. Subgroups
which correspond to each other in any of these isomorphisms
may be called isomorphic, and those which correspond in any
of the transforms of the identical isomorphism may be called
transform. Hence, the isomorphic subgroups include the
transform and the latter include the conjugate.
     If a subgroup corresponds to itself in all the transforms of
the identical isomorphism it may be called self-transform.
Hence the sell-conjugate subgroups include the self-transfo rm,
and the latter include the characteristic. The last might be
called self-isomorphic, in harmony with the other notation.
While no special attention is called to these names, yet it is
very important to observe the special properties of these six
types of subgroups.
     When a group, like the symmetric groups whose order is
not 720 T and all the metacyclic groups, admits only co

                  of a Substitution- Group to itself.          237
gredient simple isomorphisms to itself, these six types of
subgroups reduce to two, since the characteristic, self
transform, and self-conjugate subgroups become identical, as
well as the isomorphic, transform, and conjugate subgroups.
With respect to groups like the operation or abstract groups
and the regular substitution—groups, which admit only trans
form simple isomorphisms to themselves, they reduce to four
types, since the characteristic subgroups and the self-transform
become identical, as well as the isomorphic and the transform.
   There is a special type of characteristic subgroups to which
attention should be called, viz. that formed by all the commu
tators of G.    It has been called by Dedekind the commutator
subgroup of G. As G has only one such subgroup, it must
correspond to itself in all the simple isomorphisms of G
to itself. In fact, a subgroup belonging to any one of the
seven types that have been de<U+FB01>ned must correspond to one of
the same type in every simple isomorphism.
   As the cogredient isomorphisms correspond to a self
conjugate subgroup of I, this group must have an a, 1
isomorphism to some other group (I’), a being the order of
the given self-conjugate subgroup of I. Those 4 isomorphisms
which correspond to the same operator of 1' are said to be of
the same class *. All of them may be obtained from any
one by transforming it with respect to substitutions of G;
for the substitution of I which corresponds to the transform
of a given isomorphism is obtained by multiplying the sub
stitution which corresponds to the isomorphism into that
which corresponds to the transforming operator.
            § 2. Simple Isomorphisms of R to itself.
   Sup ose that all the substitutions of R except identity begin
with t e same element (a1), and that each one of them is
denoted by its second element. No two substitutions will
thus be denoted by the same element. Each substitution of
the subgroup, which contains all the substitutions that do not
involve al, of the largest group of degree n that transforms B.
into itself transforms the substitutions of R in exactly the
same manner as its own elements. Hence this subgroup may
be considered the group of isomorphisms of B. By changing
the notation of the substitutions of R we may obtain any one
of the conjugates of this subgroup for the I of R.
   Since a transformer must permute at least half of the sub
stitutions of a group it' it permutes one, it followa directly
from the preceding paragraph that the class of the group of

          Dr. G. A. Miller on the Simple Isomorphisms
degree n which transforms B into all its simple isomorphisms
to itself cannot be less than n+2. In other words, a substi
tution which transforms a regular group of degree n into
itself must be of degree §n+2, if it is not identity. We
proceed to determine this degree somewhat more accurately.
   Suppose that m is the order of the largest maximal sub
group of R, and that some substitution that is commutative
to every substitution of this subgroup transforms B into itself;
then will the class of the group that transforms B. into all-its
simple isomorphisms to itself be 11—11:. This number cannot
be less than M) , 1) being the smallest prime number which
is a factor of the order of R. VVhenp=2, we have the limit
at which we arrived in the preceding paragraph.
 ' The largest group of degree n that transforms B into all
its simple isomorphisms to itself has a n, l isomorphism to the
I of B. To identity in I we may let either R or its associate
correspond. The average degree of the n substitutions which
correspond to any substitution of I is n—l. Hence, some of
these must be of degree n, in case at least one of them is of a
lower degree than n—l.
   When It contains no substitution besides identity that is
commutative to all its substitutions, it and its associate have
only one common substitution. The largest group of
degree n which transforms R into all its cogredient iso
morphisms is of order n2. Its subgroup which contains all
its substitutions that do not involve a given element, is
simply isomorphic to R as well as to its associate. Hence
at least such an R must be the transform of its associate.
   In general, the substitutions that are common to R and
its associate form a characteristic subgroup of both. The
quotient group of R and its associate with respect to this
subgroup must be of a composite order. The largest group
of degree n that transforms It only according to its cogredient
isomorphisms is of order n°+m, m being the order of the
given characteristic subgroup. The subgroup of order n+m
which contains all the substitutions of this group that do not
 involve a given element is the group of cogredient iso
 morphisms of R and its associate.      When m=n, R is com
 mutative, and vice versd.
    By multiplying all the substitutions of R, <U+FB01>rst on the right
 and then on the left, by each one of them we obtain two
 squares containing n2 substitutions, each substitution occurring
 n times in each square. The substitutions by means of which
 we obtain all the lines of a square from any one of them form

                  of a Substz'tution- Group to itself.         239
a group which is simply isomorphic to B. Each of these
substitutions of one square is commutative to every one of
those of the other square. If a substitution is commutative
to every substitution of R, it must clearly be of degree n.
This proof of the given theorem of Jordan is due to Frattini.
It follows directly from this method of proof that every R is
the transform of its associate.
   Since all the simple isomorphisms of R to itself can be
obtained by transforming the identical isomorphism, we need
to transform only one of the two constituent groups in any
one such isomorphism in order to obtain all the others. We
shall see in the next section that it is not generally possible
to obtain all the transforms of a given isomorphism of a general
substitution-group in this manner.
             § 3. Simple Isomorphisms of G to itself.
   Let                    s,, .92, as, . . . s”.
be m substitutions of order two such that no two of them
contain any common element, and that the degree of each
exceeds the sum of the degrees of all those which precede it.
The group of order 2“ which is generated by any a of these
substitutions contains no two substitutions of the same degree.
This group has
         (2“-1)(2“-2)(2“-22)(2“-23) . . . (2“-2“—‘)
simple isomorphisms to itself.            None of these except the
identical can be obtained by transforming the identical.       The
transforms of the others will, in general, lead to different
isomorphisms.
   The G which we have just given is an extreme case. It is
generally possible to obtain a number of different iso
morphisms by transforming the identical. If the G which
is made simple isomorphic to itself is transitive, and its order
exceeds 2, this is always possible. For when it is not com
mutative, we may obtain such isomorphisms by transforming
it by its own substitutions. When it is commutative it must
be regular and must have different simple isomorphisms to
itself unless it has only one substitution of a given order. In
this case it must be the transitive group of order 2.
   When the transforms of the identical isomorphism of G do
not give the total number of its simple isomorphisms to
itself, G has more than one distinct isomorphism. It is
important to <U+FB01>nd the numbers of the substitutions of I which
belong to each distinct isomor hism of G. We have ob
served that the substitutions of which belong to the distinct

isomorphism represented by any transform of the identical
form a subgroup of I. We shall represent the substitutions
of this subgroup by s1, s2, 83, . . . 8,.
    Let t be a substitution of 1 that belongs to any other
distinct isomorphism.                 Then will
                                  tsl, £82, ts3, . . . t5,
belong to the same distinct isomorphism. Since the inverse
 of each one of these corresponds to the interchange of the two
constituents in the corresponding isomorphism it must belong
to the same distinct isomorphism. If one of these (tan-'1 is
not included in the given line, the following substitutions of
 I must belong to the same distinct isomorphism,
                                             -1 -1 s3,. ..,sat
                 s,l_1 t _1 81,84-1 t _1 s2,smt             -1 _1 8,.
 All of these are evidently different from the preceding sub
 stitutions. If these two lines do not contain all the inverses
 of their 2)» substitutions, we add a new line by multiplying
 such an inverse into the given s’s, &c.
     Since all the substitutions of I that may be obtained in
 this manner are of the form
                    sBtYs,      (,8, 3:1, 2, . . ., )t: 71:1, ——1)
 their number cannot exceed 2X2. It is easy to verify that
 this maximum is reached in the group of order 168 and
  degree 7 if we take for the s’s its subgroup of order 6. This
  is the group of isomorphisms of the group of order 8 which
  contains no substitution whose order exceeds 2*.
      An isomorphism may be transformed into another with
  the same constituent groups (1) by transforming either or
  both of its constituents, (2) by interchanging the constituents,
  and (3) by transforming a part of one constituent into a part
  of the other. All the isomorphisms which may be obtained
  by the <U+FB01>rst two methods or their combination correspond to
  substitutions of I that are included in the given rectangular
  form. As the last method does not apply to transitive groups
  we observe that the given form includes all the substitutions
  of I which correspond to a given distinct isomorphism when
  G is transitive.            When G is intransitive, several of these
  rectangular forms may belong to the same distinct iso
  morphism.
      From what precedes it is evident that a study of the group

                      of a Substitution- Group to itself.                     241
 of isomorphisms with respect to the arrangement of its sub
 stitutions in the given form is of great importance in the
 study of simple isomorphisms. For instance, if the group of
 isomorphisms of G is the symmetric group of order 6, and
 its subgroup that corres onds to the transforms of the iden
 tical is of order 2 or 3, then will G have just two distinct
 simple isomorphisms to itself. This is evident when the
 subgroup is of order 3. When it is of order 2 we may
arrange the substitutions of the symmetric group as follows ,:
                    sl, .92                         l         ab

    It is clear that we should have arrived at the same result
by using either one of the other two subgroups of order 2,
since these three subgroups are conjugate. “'hen G is
transitive the problem of <U+FB01>ndin the number of its distinct
simple isomorphisms is thus reiuced to the following two
more elementary problems :——(1) To determine the subgroup
of its I which corresponds to all the transforms of the iden
tical isomorphism ; and (2) To arrange the substitutions of I
in the given form. When G is intransitive the number of
distinct simple isomorphisms cannot exceed the number found
in this way.
    In making G simply isomorphic to itself it is frequently
convenient to inquire whether a given subgroup may corre
spond to another given subgroup.                       We have observed that
such subgroups must be of the same type.                         Suppose that this
condition is satis<U+FB01>ed, and that the corresponding substitutions
are, in order,

Let t1 and t2 be two substitutions of G such that (1) all the
substitutions of two larger subgroups of G (or of G itself) are
of the form
          t‘l‘s,3  tgs<U+FB01>'     (a=l,2,...,: B=l,2,...,)t);
(2) the <U+FB01>rst power of t1 that occurs among the s’s corresponds
to the same <U+FB01>rst power of t2 that occurs in the given simple
isomorphic subgroups ; and (3) the same powers of t1 and t2
transform the corresponding generating substitutions of the
given subgroups into the same .power of the t’s multiplied
into corresponding s’s: then will these larger subgroups (or
G) be also simply isomorphic.

                                 § 4. The Group I.
      If m is the number of substitutions of G that correspond
  to themselves in all the simple isomorphisms of G to itself,
  the degree of I is g—m, 9 being the order of G. It is
  evident that m; 1. Professor Moore has examined the case
  when I is transitive and of degree g—l *, arriving at some
  very interesting results. As a rule I is intransitive. In
  stead of considering the entire group it is frequently con
  venient to consider a constituent which is simply isomorphic
  to it. As elements of such a constituent we may take those
  which correspond to any system of generators of G and to
  the substitutions to which these generators correspond in any
 'simple isomorphism of G to itself.
       I has always a 1,0: isomorphism to the largest group of
  degree n that transforms G into itself, n being the degree of
  G.       We have seen that at=n when G is regular.                When G
  is a non-regular transitive group the substitutions that are
  commutative to each of its substitutions must be of degree 0
  or 'n.      Since they form a group their number cannot exceed
  11. As every substitution of this group is commutative to
l substitutions whose degree is less than nit must be intransitive.
  Hence or cannot exceed n+2 for such a G. If G contains a
   subgroup of degree n— 1,a is evidently 1. When I is simply
  isomorphic to G it is said to be a complete group 1', and

XXVII. On the Electric Resistance of Cobalt, Iron, and
       Mckel Films in Diagnet'ic Fields of various strengths.
       By J. C. BEATTIE, 11.80., F.R.S.E.*
THE fact that the paramagnetic metals iron, cobalt, and
       nickel have a different electric resistance according as
the specimens examined are magnetized or not was <U+FB01>rst
observed b Lord Kelvin. Attempts have betn made to
determine ow the change in resistance is related to the
magnetic properties of the specimen. Some have found that
the variation is proportional to the magnetic moment; others,
again, have found other relations. Certain it is that, in these
three metals, the variation is an increase when the resistance
is measured parallel to the lines of magnetic force, a decrease
when perpendicular to them. In the following pages experi
ments will be described which had for their object the
investigation of the relation of the resistance variation to the
magnetization in <U+FB01>lms of cobalt, nickel, and iron transversely
magnetized.      For such <U+FB01>lms, Kundt‘l' has shown that the
Hall effect is proportional to the magnetization.         The method
employed in the experiments to be described in this paper,
was to measure for any one <U+FB01>lm the Hall effect and the
resistance perpendicular to the lines of magnetic force ; then
to compare these two effects at different <U+FB01>eld-strengths ; and
see whether or not any simple relation between the two
existed. Did such a relation exist, we could then say in
what manner the variation of resistance depended on the
magnetization.
      he <U+FB01>lms were deposited on platinized glass by electrolysis.
Nickel was obtained from a solution of the double sulphate
of nickel and ammonium; cobalt from the double sulphate
of cobalt and ammonium ; and iron from a solution of four
parts of iron vitriol and three parts sal ammoniac in thirty
parts water.
    The specimens used were cut in the form of a rectangle
usually 9 mm. long by 7 or 8 mm. broad; the thickness of
the <U+FB01>lms varied from m of a mm. to                  of :1 mm. Care
was taken to have the thickness of each <U+FB01>lm as uniform as
possible.
    To measure the Hall effect the <U+FB01>lm had the usual two
primary electrodes soldered along the whole extent of the
ends, wires from a secondary battery of two cells were soldered

   The resistances of the four arms of the bridge were made
as nearly equal as possible.
   When a balance had been obtained in the Wheatstcne
bridge, the magnetic <U+FB01>eld was created ; the balance previously
existing was disturbed, that is, a de<U+FB01>exion was now observed
on the galvanometer due to the fact that the resistance of
the <U+FB01>lm had changed. This reading was then assumed
proportional to the current <U+FB02>owing through the galvanometer,
that is proportional to Aa, the variation of the resistance, a,
of the <U+FB01>lm. Such an assumption gives a result less than the
true one by 0'003 of the total result in the most unfavourable
case ; in other words, with a reading of 300 mm. the error
is 1 mm.
   The steady magnetic <U+FB01>eld was created by means of a small
Ruhmkor<U+FB02>' electromagnet with pole-pieces 10 mm. in diameter
and between 3 and 4 mm. . art. The electromagnet with
its pole-pieces was pierced t rough the centre so that the
<U+FB01>eld-strength could be determined by the rotation of the
plane of polarization in a piece of glass.
   The galvanometer was placed in such a position as to be
unin<U+FB01>uenced by the magnet. It had a resistance of 10 ohms.
Its scale was placed about 3 metres distant from its mirror.
   The Hall e<U+FB02>'ect is given in the results only in scale
readings. The variation of resistance is given in scale-readings
and in absolute measure.
   To <U+FB01>nd what variation of resistance in the <U+FB01>lm was
indicated by a galvanometer reading of one scale-division,
the following method was employed. A suitable resistance——
usually 100,000 ohms—was placed in parallel with an arm
of the bridge ; the point on the graduated scale which was
such as to give no current through the galvanometer was
found when the parallel circuit of 100,000 ohms was broken;
this latter was then made and the reading observed. Evi
dently, knowing the resistance of the arm of the bridge
concerned, of the shunt, and knowing the de<U+FB01>exion produced,
the variation of resistance represented by one scale-division
de<U+FB02>exion on the galvanometer could be calculated.
   A plus sign denotes an increase, a minus sign a decrease
of resistance.
   In most of the <U+FB01>lms the Hall e<U+FB02>'ect was observed <U+FB01>rst ;

then the variation of resistance.                 The order in which 'the
two are measured affects the result in the case of nickel ; in
that metal there is a hysteresis effect in both phenomena.
In cobalt the hysteresis effect is so small as to be negligible.
    To discover whether or not the resistance of the platinized
glass and the connecting wires was modi<U+FB01>ed by the presence
of the magnetic <U+FB01>eld, a nickel <U+FB01>lm was <U+FB01>rst used ; its
variation of resistance was observed and the nickel afterwards
taken off by means of acid; the platinum mirror and its
connecting wires showed no change of resistance due to the
creation of the magnetic <U+FB01>eld.

        Other mirrors were used ; some of the results are given in
 the appended graph. The form of the curve is the same in all.
 We have <U+FB01>rst a parabolic part starting at the origin and con
 tinuing up to a <U+FB01>eld-strength of about 9000 units; the form
 then undergoes a change, and <U+FB01>nally the concave part is
 turned towards the axis. This form and the fact that the Hall
 effect divided by the square root of the change of resistance
 is constant justi<U+FB01>es the conclusion that in cobalt the differ
 ence in the resistance of a thin <U+FB01>lm of it when transversely
 magnetized from its resistance when unmagnetized is
 proportional to the magnetization squared.
        The value of this variation differs very much in different
 mirrors. This can best be seen from the curves, which are
 drawn to the same scale. No hysteresis effect was observed,
 although in the Hall effect a slight effect was obtained.

   The results obtained with nickel differed very much for
different plates both qualitatively and quantitatively. The
results were also much complicated by a very great hysteresis
e<U+FB01>‘ect'in the variation of resistance; this caused a greater
variation in the <U+FB01>lm’s resistance after it had been magnetized
and demagnetized several times.

    A great number of other <U+FB01>lms behaved in the same manner
 as XXVII. The results for some of them are given in the
 curves on page 250.
    It will be noticed that the form of the curve is <U+FB01>rst para_
 bolic, with the convex side towards the horizontal axis ; that
 there is a point of in<U+FB02>exion usually between a <U+FB01>eld-strength
 of 5000 and 6000 C.G.S. units; and that after that strength
 the concave part of the curve is turned towards the horizontal
 axis. Roughly this is the same thing that we had with
 cobalt; but here we have not usually a constant quantity
 when the Hall effect is divided by the square root of the
 resistance variation. The difference between the resistance
 variation and the Hall effect squared is shown for <U+FB01>lm XIV.

        so small that even in the most favourable case not more than
        30 scale-divisions’ reading could be observed on the galvano
        meter-scale. So far as conclusions from such slight effects
        could be relied upon, it appeared as it' the resistance variation
        was not proportional to the magnetization squared.

 variation is greatestin nickel and in cobalt, and least in iron;
 the variation can be observed in nickel at much lower <U+FB01>elds
 than in cobalt, in some cases with a strength of 1000 C.G.S.
 units: in cobalt it can be with certainty observed from 2000
 C.G.S. units onwards.          In iron the variation can usually not
 be observed with <U+FB01>elds weaker than 6000 C.G.S. units.
    (2) In cobalt <U+FB01>lms a direct relation exists between the varia
tion of the resistance and the Hall effect: from it we conclude
that the latter is proportional to the magnetization squared.
    (3) In nickel the variation of resistance di<U+FB02>‘ers very con
siderably according to the specimen used. In all the mirrors,
however, it shows signs of attaining a maximum, but at a
higher <U+FB01>eld than that required for the Hall effect maximum.
   Again, the variation becomes greater in some plates after
they have been used, so that a plate which originally had a
resistance variation proportional to the magnetization squared
has, after <U+FB01>rst being used, a higher variation than this relation
would lead us to expect.
    (4) In iron the variation of resistance is less than propor
tionality to magnetization squared would lead us to expect.
   I have to express my thanks to Professors Warburg and
Rubens for their great kindness and assistance to me while
engaged in carrying out the above experiments.

XXVIII. On the Determination of the Conductivity of Liquids
   in Thin Layers. By G. B. BRYAN, B.Sc., 1851 Erhibition
   Science Scholar, University College, Nottingham, St. John’s
    College, Cambridge *.
                             INTRODUCTION.
 INTEREST in this subject has been aroused by the work
       of Koller ‘I', who found that, with certain liquids, the con
 ductivity decreased as the thickness of the layer was decreased;
and it was suggested by Prof. J. J. Thomson that it might
 be worth while repeating some of Koller’s experiments. In
doing this the apparatus and method of measuring the resis~
tance differed from Koller’s, and therefore his method of
experimenting will be brie<U+FB02>y described.
   To obtain a thin layer of a liquid, Koller took two flat
circular metal plates, and placed one horizontally on the
bottom of a glass vessel; the other was laid on this and

254         Mr. G. B. Bryan on the Determination of
separated from it by three small pieces of' glass, all of the
same thickness, which was carefully measured. These plates
formed the electrodes, and as the glass vessel was of very
little greater diameter than the plates, the speci<U+FB01>c resistance
of the liquid was calculated from the formula, Sp. R.=ra/d,
where a is the area of the plates, d the thickness of the layer,
and r its resistance.   Two pairs of plates were used; one pair
of brass, gilded and polished, and the other pair of zinc,
carefully amalgamated. The diameter of the gilded plates
was 6'6 cm.; that of the zinc plates was slightly less.
   To measure the resistance between the electrodes they were
connected in series with a standard resistance and a battery of
constant E.M.F. The potentials at the terminals of the
electrodes and the standard resistance were compared by
 means of an electrometer, and the unknown resistance thus
 determined. Readings were taken at a given time, T, after
 starting the current.
   Koller tested a large number of substances, includingr
turpentine, benzol, toluol, xylol, and CS2, with which the
gilded electrodes were used. The following is a specimen of
 the results obtained :—

used.
   The above figures were taken from a large series of readings
which all agreed in showing that the speci<U+FB01>c resistance in
creased as the thickness of the layer decreased.
   Koller concluded, from his experiments, that this effect
was due neither to “ transition resistance ” nor to polarization,
but to dielectric effects. If this were the case it was thought
that the subject would be well worth further investigation.
                     DESCRIPTION or APPARATUS.
   In carrying out the present investigation it was decided,
after some preliminary experiments, not to use glass separators
between the plates, for being small they were troublesome to
work with. and also necessitated the removal of the upper plate
and disturbance of the liquid when it was required to change
the thickness of the layer. It was therefore resolved to attach
the upper plate to a vertical screw, and a piece of apparatus
was found in the laboratory which, it was thought, would

   To the iron baseqplate P is attached a vertical glass rod 92,
which carries two brass plates 105,104 connected together by
adjusting screws 828282 similarly to the plates pl, 112. 123 is
another brass plate connected to 104 by the glass rod 93, and on
this plate is placed the glass vessel V which cdntains the
lower electrode B, resting on three glass points. The glass
vessel is covered by an ebonite plate T which <U+FB01>ts loosely

            the Conductivity of Liquids in Thin Layers.     257
 round the glass rod 91. The lead wire, b, from the lower
 plate is brought up through a thin glass tube.
     The micrometer-screw has 20 threads to the inch, and
 passes through a very long nut; and as it carries a consider—
 able weight there is no backlash. The micrometer head is
 divided into 100 parts, so that one division represents @6165
 inch. The screw was examined by observing the edge of
 the upper plate A with a microscope, and the error was found
 to be so small as to be negligible.
    Adjustment of the Plates—(1) As the upper plate A
 rotates with the screw it must be made to move parallel to
 itself. To do this the lower edge of A was observed with a.
 horizontal microscope containing a micrometer-scale ; each of
 the three screws s,s,sl was brought opposite the microscope
in turn (the exact position being read on the divided head)
and adjusted until the downward or upward motion during
each third of a revolution was the same.
    (2) The lower plate B must then be made parallel to the
upper one. To do this a strong light was placed behind the
  lates and looked at through the space between the plates.
   he screws $282.92 were adjusted until, on screwing down the
upper plate, the light was extinguished right across at the
same instant.       The light was moved round the plate, and
when it disappeared at the same moment, whatever its position,
the adjustment was assumed to be correct, and the reading of
the divided head at that instant was taken as the zero. This
method was tested by making the adjustments with the glass
vessel removed, and then measuring the thickness of a. iece
of thin glass at several points round the edges of the plates.
The measurements were found to agree very closely amongst
themselves and with the thickness of the glass, as measured
by a spherometer, to '01 mm. The adjustment was probably
not always as good as this; but it could not be tested when
the glass vessel was in position.
    The Plates.—The plates <U+FB01>rst used were of brass, 10 cm.
in diameter and 3 mm. thick. They were ground <U+FB02>at on an
emery-wheel, and then on plate—glass with <U+FB01>ne emery-powder.
They were then carefully amalgamated. It was found im
possible to get these plates perfectly <U+FB02>at on account of their
springiness; both were found to be slightly concave. The
correction for this was estimated to be 0013 turn of the screw
 =O'0165 mm., to be added to the distance between the plates
given by the reading of the divided head.
    As these plates were not considered satisfactory two others
were made. These were 5'64 cm. in diameter and about
1 cm. thick, so as to avoid springiness. The metal was zinc.

258          Mr. G. B. Bryan on the Determination of
They were turned up all over and the surfaces were then
ground on plate-glass with <U+FB01>ne emery until, after washing,
one plate would hold the other up when they were pressed
together. These plates were then sent to a jeweller’s to be
gilded, and unfortunately the gilder, contrary to instructions,
cleaned the surfaces in the usual way and rather spoilt them ;
they were found to be slightly irregular, so that a correction
could not be estimated. Thus the only advantage of these
plates over the others was the gilding.
           METHODS or DETERMINING THE RESIs'rANCE.
   Three methods of <U+FB01>nding the resistance were tried in various
cases :—
   (1) Comparison with a standard resistance by direct de
<U+FB02>exion, using a continuous current from a battery of secondary
cells. The galvanometer used had a resistance of 17,380 ohms
and gave a de<U+FB02>exion of one division with a current of about
10*” amperes.

         Comparison with a standard resistance by direct do;
<U+FB02>ex10n, using an alternating current. The same galvanometer
was used as in (l). The alternating current was obtained
by means of a revolving commutator. This commutator
had two brass segments on an ebonite drum, and is shown,
together with the connexions, in <U+FB01>g. 2. The commutator was

           the Cdmluct'ivily of Liquids in Thin Layers.    259
driven by means of a small water-motor. It will be seen
from the diagram that the current through the galvanometer
was always continuous, but the sensibility was reduced slightly
owing to the insulating spaces between the segments of the
commutator. When the four brushes were set right the
de<U+FB01>exion was quite steady and was not affected by slight
changes in speed, with the liquid layer in circuit.
        The third method was the modi<U+FB01>cation of the Wheat
stone bridge described by T. (I. Fitzpatrick *. By means of
a double commutator, designed by Prof. Threlfall, an alter
nating current is supplied to two corners of a VVheatstone
bridge, whilst the connexions to the galvanometer are reversed
at the same time as the current, so that any current through
the galvanometer is always in one direction. The commutator
employed at <U+FB01>rst had two drums, each with two brass segments
and four brushes. It is shown in <U+FB01>g. 3, with the connexions.
Driven at full speed the commutator gave about 60 alterna
tions per second.
                  METHOD or EXPERIMENTING.
   With the direct deflexion methods of measuring the resis
 tance the upper electrode was set at the required distance
 from the lower one, the current switched on, and a readin
 of the galvanometer taken at a de<U+FB01>nite interval of time, '1,
afterwards; usually about 1 minute. A series of readings
 was taken, increasing the thickness of the layer before each
reading, and then a series decreasing the thickness.       The
means of these two sets, when they agreed fairly closely, were
usually taken.
   In the case of the bridge-method the measurements were
made as quickly as possible one after the other, so as to avoid
any changes in the state of the liquid, or of the surfaces of
 the electrodes.
   The speci<U+FB01>c resistance is calculated from the formula
          ra
 SP. R. = 7
          RESULTS WITH FIRST FORM or APPARATUS.
   The <U+FB01>rst liquids tried were paraf<U+FB01>n-oil, turpentine, benzol,
 and CS2, using method (1) to <U+FB01>nd the resistance; but their
 resistance was so high that only a small de<U+FB02>exion could be
 obtained with the thinnest layer ('317 mm.), about 50 mm

260       Mr. G. B. Bryan on the Determination of
  Aniline was then tested, its conductivity being much higher.
The amalgamated plates were used. The standard resistance
was a megohm box; the battery, <U+FB01>ve secondary cells. The
galvanometer was shunted.
   A large number of readings were taken with aniline, which
was distilled several times during the experiments. lts resis
tance was found to change considerably with the duration of
the current, increasing as a rule *.
   Thus for a sample of brown aniline :—

    These <U+FB01>gures show that the change is very considerable,
 especially in the <U+FB01>rst few minutes. Two causes were found
 to be producing this change: (1) due to the metal electrodes,
 which were found to produce a slow darkening of the aniline,
 and a slow decrease in the resistance. (2) Due to the passage
 of the current; this produces an increase of resistance, and
 the rate of this increase depends upon the purity of the aniline.
 Thus before distilling, with a thickness of 065 mm., the
 resistance rose in 20 minutes from 11,800 to 23,800, i. e. 100
 per cent., whilst after distilling, the resistance rose from
 298,000 to 400,000, 1'. e. 30 per cent., in the same time.

   The same results were obtained after distilling the aniline
and thus decreasin its conductivity about 20 times.
   These <U+FB01>gures s ow that there is probably considerable
polarization of the electrodes, or else some change in the
liquid which is reversed with the current, and most likely
takes place at the electrodes.
  The polarization was measured in some cases, just after

   262          Mr. G. B. Bryan on the Determination of
   stop ing the current, by balancing against a Clark cell. As‘
   muc as 0'3 volt was found with a thickness of 0628 mm.,
   which would not account for the large increase in resistance
   during the passage of the current, since the applied E.M.F.
   was 10 volts.                                 -
      The polarization, however, fell o<U+FB01>' very rapidly and might
   have been much greater whilst the current was on.
      Hence it would appear that although the conductivity of
   aniline might not vary with the thickness of the layer, it would
   be very dif<U+FB01>cult to prove it by means of a continuous current.
      A large number of readings were taken with different
   thicknesses, and on the whole they appeared to show that
  the conductivity decreased with the thickness. The following
 are specimens of the results obtained :—

     As this difference might be due to the rise in resistance
caused by the current immediately after starting being greater
with the thinner layers than with the thicker ones, it was
decided to try the effect of an alternating current, and the
second method of measuring the resistance was used.
     The aniline was redistilled and the plates were cleaned with
alcohol and readjusted.
     The results at <U+FB01>rst obtained appeared to show that the con
ductivity increased as the thickness of the layer decreased.

ductivity of the thinnest layer remained practically constant,

   264            Mr. G. B. Bryan on the Determination of
       Wotan—The ordinary water from the laboratory-still was .
   used. This had a comparatively high conductivity, and was
   in fact a dilute solution. The gilded zinc electrodes were
   employed, and to keep the conduction as much as possible to
   the space between the plates they were surrounded by a close
<U+FB01>tting inner cylinder of glass, as shown in <U+FB01>g. 1.
      Before putting the plates into position they were cleaned
 with dilute acid and alcohol.
      The resistance was measured by method 3, two Daniells
 being used to give the E.M.F.
      A large number of readings were taken, and they all agreed
   in showing that the apparent speci<U+FB01>c resistance was consider
ably greater in the thin layers. The plates were removed and
 cleaned several times, but the results were always the same.
The following is one set of readings :—

      The values of the speci<U+FB01>c resistance in the fourth column
   show a large falling off as the thickness increases.                       In the
 <U+FB01>fth column are given the differences between consecutive
   values of the resistance in column 3, and these are multiplied
 by constants to give the resistance of a thickness of '127 mm.
The approximate equality of these numbers shows that the
great increase in speci<U+FB01>c resistance in the thin layers is
probably due to the plates not being perfectly clean to begin
with ; to polarization, and changes at the electrodes produced
by the current; and to errors of adjustment. As the end
e<U+FB01>'ect was probably rather di<U+FB01>'erent with different thickness,
the following experiment was made to <U+FB01>nd the conductivity
at each position of the plates.
      At each position the resistance was measured, then the '

           the Conductivity of Liquids in Thin Layers.                                 265
upper plate was screwed down one-tenth of its distance from
the lower plate and the resistance again measured. The
plate was then brought back to its original position, and one
tenth above it, the resistance being measured in each case.
This series was repeated several times and the ditt'ereucos
between consecutive readings gave the resistance of a layer
equal to one-tenth the distance between the plates.
   From the mean of these differences was calculated the
resistance of a layer equal to one turn of the screw (1'27 mm.).
Thus, at the position d='5 turn, the readings were :—

   Here again there is a great increase in the speci<U+FB01>c
resistance in the thin layers, whilst the di<U+FB01>'erences between
the layers give an approximately constant value for the
resistance of one turn, as was the case with water. For this
reason it was expected that by improving the apparatus the
differences in the apparent conductivity of the layers could
be considerably reduced.
                       DESIGN or NEW APPARATUS.
   The chief improvements to be made were :—
   (1) To make the upper plate move parallel to itself without
turning with the screw. This would increase the accuracy of
the adjustment as well as reduce the time required for it.
   (2) To so <U+FB01>x the plates that they could be removed after
adjusting, to be cleaned, and replaced without spoiling the
adjustment. The liquid could then be poured into the vessel
immediately after re<U+FB01>xing the plates, so that there would be
much less time for them to get dirty again than in the old
arrangement.
   (3) To improve the surface of the plates.
   (4) To increase the rapidity of alternation of the current
so as to reduce the polarization.
   With the rate of alternation already used (about 60 per
see.) the balance-point with the very thin layers of water
was not quite steady, and it was thought that this was prob
ably due to slight polarization.                                -
   The new arrangement for holding the plates is shown in
<U+FB01>g. 5.    My best thanks are due to Professors Heaton and
Robinson, of University College, Nottingham, for the use of ‘
their workshops while 1 was making this apparatus.

   Condition (1) is ful<U+FB01>lled by attaching the upper plate A
to a steel rod 1- which slides without turning in the two
v's, vI r2.

   (Condition (2) is ful<U+FB01>lled thus :—The shaft of the upper
 plate has a 1» in. hole bored in it, and slips without shake on to
 the reduced end of the steel rod r, and is <U+FB01>xed by a set-screw
 which screws into a small hole in the rod and draws the shaft
 tight up against the shoulder at the same time. The lower
 plate B screws on to an ebonite rod e1 which is attached by
 means of the iron screw 81 to the iron plate P1; sl passes
 through a hole much larger than itself so as to admit of some
 lateral adjustment. The plate P1 is <U+FB01>xed laterally by the
 three levelling-screws which rest, by hole slot and plane, on

268        Mr. G. B. Bryan on the Determination of
three ebonite plugs e2, e2, e2. After adjusting the lower
plate B parallel to the upper one the levelling-screws are
<U+FB01>xed by lock-nuts, and the plate can then be removed and
replaced without impairing the adjustment. The glass
vessel Vl consists of a cylinder ground to <U+FB01>t the shoulder on
the lower plate, and of such internal diameter that the upper
plate just slides easily inside it. Just before pouring in the
liquid to be tested this cylinder was fastened down with
clean paraf<U+FB01>n wax.
   The Plates.——These were of cast brass, turned to the shape
shown in the <U+FB01>gure. The surfaces were very carefully
scraped up to a good surface-plate, until, after cleaning, one
would hold the other up (weight of each plate about 1 1b.).
They were then gilded, great care being taken not to damage
the surfaces in any way, and only a very thin coating of gold
was put on, just enough to prevent oxidation. These plates
were very satisfactory, and the error due to irregularities of
the surfaces negligibly small. Area of plates=20'82 sq. cm.
   To realize condition (4) a new commutator was made. It
is similar to the one shown in <U+FB01>g. 3, but each drum has eight
segments instead of two, thus increasing the number of
reversals per revolution four times. If the drum were rolled
out it would appear as in <U+FB01>g. 4. Two brushes press on the
outer rims, and two others on two consecutive teeth.
   This commutator was driven by an electromotor, and the
speed could be varied so that from 100 to 250~ per second
of the current could be obtained. The speed used gave about
200'» per second.
   The galvanometer used was a dead-beat one of 1430 ohms
resistance, and <U+FB01>gure of merit, with the interrupted current,
of 10‘7 ampere.
   The connexions were the same as in <U+FB01>g. 3. The adjustment
of the lower plate parallel to the upper one was made in the
same way as before : but could now be easily tested by
placing a piece of glass of known thickness between the
plates. The error was found to be about '01 mm., but was
probably sometimes less than this.
   The micrometer-screw s has 30 threads per inch, and the
head H is divided into 100 parts. The screw was compared
with a standard.

                             CONCLUSION.
    It will be seen that the expectation of reducing the
 apparent differences in conductivity of the different thiclb
 nesses (Tables VIII. and XI.) has been realized to a great
 extent; in most cases reduced within the limits-of error of
 adjustment. This is partly due to the improvement in the
 surfaces of the plates, and partly to better cleaning. The
 plates were washed in' alcohol, after dipping in dilute-sub»
 phuric acid, until the liquid to be tested wouldI thoroughly
 wet them.                 '
    The readings, in the case of the very thin. layers of dilute
 solutions, depended very much on the state of cleanliness of
 the plates. Thus for water (Table XII.) the Sp. R. of '1 turn.
 is 27 per cent. greater than that for 10 turns (of this di<U+FB01>'erence
 about 12 per cent. can be accounted for by error of adjust
ment); whilst for very diliute KCI (Table XVI.) when the?
 plates were more carefully cleaned, the corresponding. differ
pnce is only 15 per cent., although the resistance is <U+FB01>ve times»
  css.
    With alcohol (Table XVII.) the readings from 1 to 12 turns
agree very closely, and below 1 they are within the limit of
error of adjustment.
    With aniline (Table XVIII.) all the values of the Sp. R.
agree fairly closely, the greatest difference from the mean
being less than 2 per cent.
    The range of the experiments may be considered to be from
'5 turn (4% mm.) to 20 turns (16'92 mm.); below '5 the
values of the Sp. R. show a difference from the rest which
could not be got rid of ; above 20 turns several experiments
were made with a tube 16 cm. long and about 4 cm. in
diameter. The values of the Sp. R. obtained were in very
close agreement with those at 10 or 20 turns for the same
    uid. above results show that for dilute solutions, alcohol, and
1iqThe
aniline, the conductivity is the same for all thicknesses within
the- limits of the-experiments.   It has been. tbund that the great
di<U+FB01>'erencesv obtained by Keller, for water.~ andf alcohol,-can be
eliminated by taking care that the plates are true and'clean', and:
by using an alternate current instead of a continuous one.
Keller allowed for polarization. by estimating it immediately
after stopping the'cur-rent, but this isv not satisfactory, since‘
the polarization tails off very rapidly. He estimated that the
greatest polarization: could not have been greater than!
'02 volt., which, though great compared with the whole
E.M.F. (1 Daniell)‘ would npIt~ account for the ditl'erence of

      In conclusion, I wish to thank Prof. J. J. Thomson for his

XXIX. On Air Electri<U+FB01>ed by the Discharging Action of
 - Ultra-violet Light. By JOHN ZELENY, B.Sc., Assistant
  v Professor of Physics, University of illinnesota *.
THE fellowing experiments were made to compare some of
         the electrical properties of air into which a body is
being discharged by the action of ultra-violet light, with
those when Rontgen rays are the cause of the discharge.
   ' The apparatus was arranged as is shown in the <U+FB01>gure. T
is a brass tube. At M it is joined by a. lead cylinder which
contains on the inside an insulated metal tube <U+FB01>lled with
glass wool G, which latter is connected to a pair of quadrants
of the electrometer E.

      The light of an arc lamp A was concentrated by the quartz
lens L, and after passing through the quartz window P fell
upon the freshly cleaned, negatively charged, zinc plate D.
    _ If air was blown into the apparatus at C, it passed by D,
through G, and out at R. When new the air was at rest
and the light was turned on, or when the air was blown through
while the light was cut oil", the glass wool at G received no
charge.v But if_ both the light and air-blast were in action,

      The de<U+FB02>exion increased continuously until it passed off
the scale.                                                      "
      When, however, another plug of glass wool was introduced
 into the tube at B, no charge whatever reached G, showing
 that here also, as with gases charged under the action of
Rontgen rays (J. J. Thomson and E. Rutherford, Phil. Mag
Igov. 1896, p. 393), a plug of glass wool completely discharges
t e gas.                                                         ~
      It was found that even with a fairly stroncr blast only a
small part of the charge lost by D reached . . .The much
larger part Went to the walls of the tube T.               .
     This was shown b noting the rate of leak under the
action of the light when <U+FB01>rst D was connected toa pair of
charged quadrants and G was to earth ; and next when both
D and G were connected to the same char ed quadrants. In
the latter case any charge that reached (g went to replenish
the original charge.
      It was further found, when a source of R<U+FB01>ntgen rays
 (replacing A and L, and tinfoil being placed over P) was so
arranged as to discharge the plate D at the same rate as did
the ultra-violet light, that by using the same blast of air and
having the same negative charge on D, the quantity of
positive electri<U+FB01>cation which reached G was considerably less
than the quantity of' negative obtained by the use of the
      ht. gas blown away from the plate had a proportionally
li gThe
greater density of free electri<U+FB01>cation when ultra-violet light
was used than was obtained by the use of the Rontgen rays.
In the case when light is used the negative carriers start
from the negative plate and enter the stream of air. With
 Rontgen rays, however, the positive ions, though distributed
throughout the whole gas, are free from the negative ions
only when near the plate towards which they are moving,
and so are less easily blown away. In addition some of the
free negative ions near the walls of the tube are carried into
the glass wool and diminish the resultant charge.
     These experiments were performed last June at the Physical
Institute in Berlin, and other work .prevented a more thorough
consideration of the subject.

IN ordinary testing work when using a Clark cell as the
     working standard of difference of potential, it is desirable
to get rid of the trouble of continually having to make the
temperature correction. Some time ago (‘The Electrician,’
pp. 601-603, September 6, 1.895) I proposed and investigated
three methods by which a self-acting correction could be
attained.    Quite recently I have constructed the apparatus
for two of the methods, and I have found it an easy matter
to reach the accuracy aimed at (viz. maximum error 1 in
2000).
   léhe arrangement of the <U+FB01>rst           of apparatus is shown
in g. 1.

na,and pb are connected as in a Wheatstone’s bridge with an
auxiliary cell X, whose voltage must be known within 5 or 6
 per cent. A Leclanché cell is found suitable for this. The
 resistances a and pb are of a metal such as copper or iron
 with a large temperature-coef<U+FB01>cient, while I) and na are of
 manganin or a similar ulloy. As shown in the paper cited
above, we can choose n and p so as to have a constant voltage of,
 say, 1400 volts between N and Q at all temperatures from
 0° to 20° 0. when S. C. is a Clark cell. The arrangement
 thus not only corrects for temperature but can be made to
 give a more even <U+FB01>gure b cutting off the 0034 volts at the
same time. In one of t e coils exhibited the resistances
have the following values at 15° C :—

 As the absolute values of a and b are of no importance so
 long as they are high enough to keep the auxiliary Leclanché
 cell from running down, the copper coils a and pi) did not
 require to be adjusted but were merely measured ; their
 resistances were reduced to 15° C. and the manganin coils no
and b were then adjusted to give n=9'96,p=7'78*. It is
clearly a great saving of trouble not to have to adjust the coils
which have a high temperature-coe<U+FB01>icient. The four coils were
wound on a brass cylinder 7 or 8 centim. in diameter, and then
well protected with silk ribbon, four leads bein          brought out.
To test the whole directly the cylinder we<U+FB01> wrapped in
wadding was placed in a tin canister, the lid of which was
then soldered on so as to be watertight. The leads were
brought out through a long tube soldered to the lid. A ther
mometer also passed down this tube into the canister. A
Leclanché cell was connected as in <U+FB01>g. 1. The tin was then
well immersed in water at various temperatures, and steady
temperatures inside the tin Were got by stirring the Water
until a thermometer in it showed the same temperature as the
one inside the tin. The potential-ditference from P to Q was
measured by a potentiometer method at various temperatures
with the f0110wing results :—

It will be seen that the actual observed values of the auxiliary
Voltage are just what Would be required along with the
Clark cell to give 1400 volts at all ordinary temperatures.
     The arrangement in <U+FB01>g. 1 was chosen so as to give the
maximum possibility of correction. Mr. C. W. S. Crawley
has pointed out to me that some trouble is saved in the con
struction of the coils by making only one of the four of

brass tube on which the coils are wound.
   In the other arrangement exhibited three resistance-coils

A current of 1000 ampere gives a balance with a Clark cell
at F and G at all ordinary temperatures (to within 1 in 2000).
This de<U+FB01>nite current, obtainable at all temperatures, can be
passed through known resistances and so used to measure
unknown voltages by potentiometer methods.
    If the resistance r be subdivided other exact currents such
as 2, 3, 4 . . . amperes can be got directly.
    It should be noted that although 1 have made special
 reference to the Clark cell, either of the two forms of com
pensator may be arranged for any other type of standard cell
 so as to wipe out the greater part of the temperature varia
 tion. For instance, if a Carhart 1 volt cell has a coef<U+FB01>cient
 of 0'0097 per cent. per degree (1., used with a compensator it
 would not vary by more than 0'001 per cent. per degree.          It
 will thus be seen that in some cases a compensating arrange
ment such as I have described above would prove of value
 not only in ordinary testing work but also in measurements
 where much higher accuracy is required.

 XXXI. 0n Electric Equilibrium between Uranium and an
     Insulated Metal in its Neighbourhood. By Lord KELVIN,
     G.C.V.0., J. OARRU'I‘HERS Bnsrrm, D.Sc., F.R.S.E.,
     and M. SMOLUCHOWSKI DE SMOLAN, Ph.D.*
 THE wonderful fact that uranium held in the neighbourhood
         of an electri<U+FB01>ed body diselectri<U+FB01>es it was <U+FB01>rst discovered
 by H. Becquerel.      Through the kindness of M. Moissa-n we
 have had a disk of this metal, about 5 centim. in diameter and
 =1- centim. in thickness, placed at our disposal.
     We made a few preliminary observations on its diselec
-trifying property.     We observed <U+FB01>rst the rate of discharge
 when a body was charged to different potentials. We found
 that the quantity lost per half-minute was very far from
 increasing in simple proportion to the voltage, from 5 volts
 up to 2100 volts; the electri<U+FB01>ed body being at a distance of
 about 2 centim. from the uranium disk. [Added March 9.—
  We have to-day seen Prof. Becquerel’s paper in Comptes
 Remius for March 1. It gives us great pleasure to <U+FB01>nd that
 the results we have obtained on discharge by uranium at
 different voltages have been obtained in another way by the
 discoverer of the effect. A very interesting account will be
 found in the paper above cited, which was read to the French
 Academy of Sciences on the same evening, curiously enough,
 as ours was read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh]
      These <U+FB01>rst experiments were made with no screen placed
 between the uranium and the charged body. We afterwards
  found that there was also a discharging effect, though much
  slower, when the uranium was wrapped in tinfoil. The effect
  was still observable when an aluminium screen was placed
  between the uranium, wrapped in tinfoil, and the charged
 bod '.
     Tb make experiments on the electric equilibrium between
 uranium and a metal in its neighbourhood, we connected an in
  sulatedrhorizontal metal disk to the insulated pair of quadrants
  of an electrometer. We placed the uranium opposite this
  disk and connected it and the other pair of quadrants of the
  electrometer to sheaths. The surface of the uranium was
  parallel to that of the insulated metal disk, and at a distance
  of about 1 centim. from it.     It was so arranged as to allow
 of its easy removal.
     With a polished aluminium disk as the insulated metal and
 with a similar piece of aluminium laced opposite it in place
 of the uranium, no deviation from t e metallic zero was found

  when the pairs of quadrants were insulated from one another.
  With the uranium opposite the insulated olished aluminium
  a deviation of —84 scale-divisions from t e metallic zero was
  found in about half a minute.         [Sensibility of electrometer
  140 scale-divisions per volt.] After that the electrometer
  reading remained steady at this point, which we may call the
  uranium rays-zero for the two metals separated by air which
  was traversed by uranium rays. If instead of having the
  uranium opposite to the aluminium, with only air between
  them, the uranium was wrapped in a piece taken from the
  same aluminium sheet, and then placed opposite to the insu
  lated polished aluminium disk, no deviation was produced.
  Thus in this case the rays-zero agreed with the metallic zero.
     With polished copper as the insulated metal, and the
  uranium separated only by air from this copper, there was a
  deviation of about +10 scale-divisions. With the uranium
- wrapped in thin sheet aluminium and placed in position
  opposite the insulated copper disk a deviation from the
  metallic zero of +43 scale-divisions was produced in two
  minutes, and at the end of that time a steady state had not
  been reached.
     With oxidized copper as the insulated metal, opposed to
  the uranium with only air between them, a deviation from the
  metallic zero of about. +25 scale-divisions was produced.
     When the uranium, instead of being placed at a distance of
  1 centim. from the insulated metal disk, was placed at a
  distance of 2 or 3 millim., the deviation from the metallic zero
  was the same.
     These experiments show that two polished metallic surfaces
  connected to the sheath and the insulated electrode of an
  electrometer, when the air between them is in<U+FB02>uenced by the
  uranium rays, give a de<U+FB01>exion from the metallic zero, the
  same in direction, and of about the same amount, as when the
  two metals are connected by a drop of water.

  THIS volume, published as one of the series of annals of the
        University of Lyons, contains a full account of Dr. Rigollot’s
  work on the electromotive force between two plates, one of which
  is illuminated and the other kept in the dark. Two metallic plates
  are taken, and. one side of each is coated with the substance to
  be examined; the other side of each plate is then varnished or
  para<U+FB01>ined, and the plates are placed in an electrolyte in the dark

and short-circuited until there is no diiference of potential between
them. One of the plates is then exposed either to white light or
to a portion of the spectrum, and the difference of potential pro
duced between the plates is compared with a standard Daniell cell
by a potentiometer method. Tables and curves are given, showing
the behaviour of various substances when illuminated, and the
author sums up the results of his investigation as follows :—
    1. Plates of oxide, sulphide, <U+FB02>uoride, chloride, bromide, or iodide
of copper, plates of oxide or sulphide of tin, and of sulphide of
silver, may, under certain conditions, form actinometers of great
 sensitiveness.
    2. For   a given actinometer, other things being equal, the
electmmotive force depends on the electrolyte.
    3. In the spectrum each actinometer shows a maximum of
 sensitiveness for a wave-length depending only on the nature
 of the sensitive plate, and independent of the electrolyte.
    4. When the plates of an actinometer of oxide, <U+FB02>uoride, chloride,
 bromide, or iodide of copper are immersed in solutions of different
 colouring-matters, the electromotive force produced by light of
 given intensity is increased. In the spectrum the electromotive
 force is increased for radiation of all wave-lengths, but the
 maximum of sensitiveness corresponds to a wave-length depending
 on the colouring-matter chosen. The position of this maximum is
 independent of the copper salt of which the actinometer is formed.
     5. In the spectrum, for an actinometer with coloured plates, the
 maximum electromotive force due to the colouring-matter occurs
 always with longer waves than those corresponding to the maximum
 absorption of light by the colouring matter itself.
    The author points out several possible applications of electro
 chemical actiuometers, their great advantage being that their
 electromotive force returns to zero on removal of the illumination.

         Observational Astronomy.    By ARTHUR MEE, F.R.A.S.
     2nd Edition.    Western Mail, Limited : Cardi<U+FB01> and London.
 THE <U+FB01>rst edition of this work appeared in 1893, and met with
  well—deserved appreciation from amateur astronomers. It has now
  been thoroughly revised, partly re-written, and brought up to
  date. Profusely illustrated and abounding in facts tersely, plea
  santly, and correctly described, the new volume is well calculated
  to prove a safe and ef<U+FB01>cient guide to the young telescopist.
  Written in a chatty attractive style, the information imparted
  holds the attention ; and the work forms not only a compendium
  of astronomical history, but a comprehensive handbook of in
  struction for beginners. It matters not in what direction or
  department the student may essay to achieve distinction, he will <U+FB01>nd
  in these pages the stepping-stones to success clearly indicated.
  The author, in preparing the volume, has received valuable help in
  several branches from specialists, and this, in combination with his

 280                    Geological Society :—'
 own excellent writings, has enabled him to produce a work which
 must prove of great utility to the ever increasing class of amateur
 observers. He dilates on Naked-eye Astronomy, The Telescope
 and its employment, the Moon, Planets, the Sun, Comets and
 Meteors, the Sidereal Firmament, Astronomical Photography; and
 the close of the book contains a memoir of that able, amiable, and
 greatly respected friend of the amateur astronomer, the Rev. T.
W. Webb. A mass of accurate and recent information is con
 tained in these pages, and everyone who makes astronomy a hobby
 and possesses a telescope should procure the book. It is useful as
 a reliable means of reference in regard to past events and the
 position of the science to—day, while it also points out the road to
 new discoveries. The volume bears evidence of careful revision,
 and contains very few misstatements or misprints. On p. 3 we
 notice Fomalhant instead of Fomalhaut. It is stated on p. 29 that
 Herschel’s highest magni<U+FB01>er (6000) was applied to his largest
 instrument (48-inch); but the power was really tried on a
 63—inch of 7 feet focal length in 1782. It was employed upon
 aLyrae, and was thought to be 6450; but a later determination
 made it 5787. On p. 66 Lassell and Bond are said to have dis
 covered a seventh and eighth moon to Saturn ; but only one satellite
 was found by them in 1848. On p. 103 Canis Venat. should be
 Canes Venat. and on p. 98, Kreuger should be Krueger. These
 are, however, very trivial blemishes in a generally very accurate
 handbook which we believe will admirably ful<U+FB01>l the purpose for
 which it is intended and become the vade mecu'm of the astronomical
 amateur.

     The age of the Cape System is doubtful. The Upper beds rest
 unconformably on the Lower ones, and if the latter be of Devonian

    The following communications were read:—
    1. ‘A Revindicatiou of the Ll'anberis Uneonformit'y.’ By the
Rev. J“ F. Blake, M.A., F.G.S.
    In a paper published in the Quarterly Journal of the Society
for 1893, the author of the present paper maintained that certain
conglomerates and associated rocks occurring for some distance
north-east and south-west of Llanberis, which had hitherto been
considered to lie below the workable sl-ttes of the Cambrian rocks
of that area, were in reality unconformable deposits of later date
than those slatesr In the year 1894, a paper appeared in the same
Journal, in which the authors maintained that in no case which
had been examined could any valid evidence be found in favour of
the alleged unconformity, and that in one (on the north east side of
Llyn Padaru) which they supposed to afford the most satisfactory
proof of it, the facts were wholly opposed to the notion.
    The present paper is a reply to these authors, in which their
objections, founded on general considerations, on <U+FB01>eld observations,
and on microscopic examination of rock-specimens, are discussed,
and the author gives the results of further observations on the
rocks of the district. The Moel Tryfaen sections, and those on each
side of Llynv Padarn in the Llanberis district are considered, and
he maintains that the post-Llanberis (using this term in the sense
of being after the deposition of the main workable slates). age
of thc conglomerates which are under discussion is established;
though. the more he considers the correlation of these conglomerates
with. the Bronllwyd Grits the less- he likes it, and as, list as the
stratigraphy is concerned, they maybe much newer,—their age is
at present an open question; but of their unconformable position
he has no doubt.

    The- authors, who have previously described the neighbouring
district of P'ortraine( Quart. Journ; Gisol’. 300., Dec. 1897), undertook
an examination of this island; with the intention of comparing the
rocks with those of Portraine, and of investigating the nature of the
rock familiar to geologists under the name of ‘ Lambay porphyry.’
The sedimentary rocks are similar to some of those of Portraine, and
are‘ of Middle or Upper Bala‘ age. Associated with them are pyro
clastic rocks and andesitic lava <U+FB02>ows. some of the- lavas having <U+FB02>bwed‘
beneath the sea. The sediments and volcanic rocks were exposed
to denudation, and a conglomerate composed of their fragments
was accumulated round the volcano. The ‘ Lambay porphyry,’
which has been determined as a diabase-porphyry by Dr. von Lasaulx,

   The following communications were read :—
   1. ‘On the Pyromerides of Boulay Bay, Jersey.’ By John
Parkinson, Esq., F.G.S.
    After briefly noticing the literature of the subject, the author
describes the altered rhyolites of Boulay Bay. One variety, the
commonest, is of a dark red colour, showing <U+FB02>ow-structure ; another
is porphyritic; a third, near the centre of the Bay, has a pale
greenish matrix enclosing fragments, which, however, are due to
<U+FB02>ow-brecciation. Large pyromerides occur in two localities: in
the more interesting, that north of the jetty, the structure of the
rock indicates either a very peculiar magmatic di<U+FB01>’crcntiation. in situ
 or (more probably) the mixture of two magmas differing in their
 stage of consolidation.
    From study of a series of specimens of' the pyromeridal rock, the
author arrives at the following conclusions :——(1) The rock shows
 marked <U+FB02>ow-structure and at times bands which indicate a slight
 difference   in   its composition, the Iatter tending to assume a
 moniliform outline.       In such the microscopic structure corre
 sponds with that of the pyromcrides, and exhibits traces of radial
 crystallization. (2) These afford a passage into somewhat oval
 pyromerid'es, with rather tapering ends and irregularly mammillated
 surfaces. (3) From these sometimes a single one seems to be
 thrown off, while lines of pyromerides. or little lumps of similar
 material are scattered about the matrix.            (4) Many of the
   yromerides are solid' throughout; others have a central cavity
 <U+FB01>lled with quartz.
     The author describes varieties of' the pyromerides. They are
 generally deep red in colour, and exhibit (a) <U+FB02>uxiou-structure,
  made more distinct by minute black microliths; (b) a radial
 structure; (c) a ‘ patchy’ devitri<U+FB01>ed structure (with crossed nicols);
  the second being not always present. The matrix is usually of a
 greenish tint, showing devitrificatiou-structure and sometimes a trace
 of perlitic structure.
     The pyromerides frequently exhibit more or less crescentic cracks,
  due apparently to contraction, which have been <U+FB01>lled by quartz..
  Sometimes also they scale of? in rudely crescentic shells. In one
  locality a variety with good spherulites,. about as large as a pea,
  passes into one showing a <U+FB02>uxion-structure and pyromeridcs,
  having traces ot' radial structure as well as clots and irregular
  ‘wisps,’ suggestive of a stiffer material broken up- by one more
  liquid.
     As the result of his studies, the- author thinks that while very
  regular spherulites do occur, apparently in consequence of radial;
  crystallization. round a centre,,the pyromerides are due to the mixture
  of two magmas slightly different in composition and. <U+FB02>uidity, the
  less plastic of the two being, sometimes drawn out into streaks, but
  at others forming lumps, in which, where their form is suitable, as

 284                     Geological Society.
radial structure is subsequently developed. He concludes by com
paring the pyromerides of Boulay Bay with specimens from other
localities described by MM. Delesse and Lévy, Prof. Iddings, and
Miss Raisin, or collected by himself, and by dismissing the quartz
<U+FB01>lled cavities which occur in certain cases. These he regards as
originally vesicles, and not due to any subsequent decomposition.
   2. ‘ On the Exploration of Ty Newydd Cave near Tremeirchion,
 North Wales.’ By the Rev. G. C. H. Pollen, S.J., F.G.S.
    In November 1896 a Committee was formed, consisting of
Dr. H. Hicks, Dr. H. Woodward, and the author, for the purpose
of exploring this cavern, which is situated in the same ravine on
the east side of the Vale of Clwyd as the well-known caverns of
Ffynnon Beuno and Cae Gwyn, explored about 12 years ago by
Dr. H. Hicks and Mr. E. B. Luxmoore. Grants have been made
by the Royal Society and by the Government Grant Committee
for the purpose of carrying on the explorations; and though a
considerable time must elapse before the work is completed, the
results already obtained are of so much importance that the author
has thought it advisable to bring them before the Society. In the
work of exploration he has throughout been ably assisted by the
 theological students of St. Beuno’s College. The cavern had been
 in part broken into by quarrying operations, but the chambers and
 tunnels were completely <U+FB01>lled up with more or less strati<U+FB01>ed deposits,
 and had remained entirely untouched.
   Although the ground above the cavern is strewn over with drift
and erratics from the North and from the central areas of Wales,
not a fragment of anything but immediately local material has been
discovered in the cavern itself, showing clearly that the deposits in
the cavern had been carried in by water before the Northern and
Western ice had reached this area. The work has been carried on
almost continuously throughout the year, and most of the material
has been removed for a distance of over 60 feet from the entrance.
The height of the cavern above sea-level is 420 feet, or about
20 feet above the <U+FB02>oor of the Cae Gwyn Cave.
   The following points appear to the author to be now fully
established :—
   1. The material in the Ty Newydd Cave, as in the lower parts of
those of Ffynuon Beuno and Cae Gwyn, is of purely local origin.
Of this he can speak with con<U+FB01>dence, as the question was before
him from the beginning and the gravels were examined with minute
care for erratics.
   2. This local deposit is of earlier date than the Boulder Clay with
Western and Northern Drift. This was proved by the <U+FB01>nding of
granite- and felsite-boulders abundantly at higher levels and OVer
the Cave, and in one case <U+FB01>lling the upper part of one of the
<U+FB01>ssures communicating from abQVe with the Cavern.
   3. The occurrence of the tooth of a large mammal (Rhinoceros)
in the lower part of the Cave shows that the animal was con
temporary with, or of earlier date than the in<U+FB01>lling of the Cavern
by the local drift.

XXXIV. Variations in tire Electromotive Force oft/1e H-form
    of Clark Cells with 'j'emjremtm'e. By F. S. SPIERS, B.Sc.,
    F. TWYMAN, and W. L. WATERS.
THE work described in this paper was intended as a com
         pletion of the investigation carried out some years ago
by Prof. Ayrton and Mr. W. R. Cooper-1' on the effect of
variations of temperature on the E.M.F. of the Board of Trade
form of Clark cell. Their results showed that it was not
possible, by applying the ordinary temperature-correction, to
obtain the true value of the E.M.F. of the cell with a greater
accuracy than 0'1 per cent. It was thought that the H-form
of cell would show some improvement over the ordinary type
in this respect ; and this was con<U+FB01>rmed by some results
published recently by Dr. Kahle I. The experiments to be
described in this paper were undertaken with the object of
seeing how far this was correct, and in general to investigate
the behaviour of this form of cell under variations of tempe
rature. The experiments were carried out at the Central
Technical College.
    The tests were made on four cells set up in accordance with
the speci<U+FB01>cation issued by Dr. Kahle from the Reichsanstalt§.
The cells were in every way alike ll, and were mounted

together inside a glass vessel in paraf<U+FB01>n oil, and during the
experiments they each underwent precisely the same treat
ment. The diameter of each of the two legs of the cell was
about 2 inch, and their length about one inch.
    The method used for the determination of the E.M.F. was
as follows. Current from a storage-cell traversed a potentio
 meter-wire in series with a resistance, the value of which
was such that the fall of potential along the wire amounted to
 one ten-thousandth of a volt per centimetre-length. The cell
 to be tested was joined up in opposition to the standard, and
the difference in their E.M.Fs. was balanced against the fall
 of potential along a certain length of the stretched wire.
    The standard used in comparison consisted of one or other
 of two cells of the Muirhead type, which had been found to
 have an           approximately constant during several years.
 The two cells were in one case, and during the experiments
 were placed in a thermostat in which the temperature could
 be kept constant to Oo'Ol C. The E.M.F. of the standard
 was determined absolutely by balancing it against the RD.
 between the terminals of a resistance of known value of about
 three ohms, due to a current of about half an ampere passing
 through it. The resistance had been made specially for the
 purpose of manganin wire, wound upon an ebonite frame and
 immersed in paraf<U+FB01>n oil. It had been previously aged by
 heating, and had assumed a steady value, as shown by com
  parison with standard manganin coils. The current was
  measured by a Kelvin centiampere balance, the constant of
  which had been frequently checked by means of a silver
  voltameter. By this means the             could be determined
  absolutely, correct to 0’0001 volt.
     The thermostat consisted of an inner air-space, in which
  was placed the standard, surrounded by an outer water-bath
  which was heated by a gas-jet, the gas being automatically
  cut off when the temperature rose to a given value, and being
  allowed to come on again as soon as the temperature had
  fallen below that value.         v
     In <U+FB01>g. 1, A B C are zinc vessels : A is the air-bath, con
  taining the standard resting on cottonwool ; B the surrounding
  water-bath, closed at the top and containing the thermo
  meter D ; C the enclosing jacket, between which and B the
  hot air from the gas-jet passes, heating the water-jacket on
  its way.    D is an alcohol thermometer with a mercury
  index F, which, on the expansion of the alcohol, is pushed up
  the narrow tube L, and electrically connects the two platinum
  wires f1 and f2. J is the gas-jet for heating the water-bath ;

to carry otf some of the heat of the jet ; G is a little by-pass,

burning at the mouth of the tube E, and serves to relight
the main jet when extinguished. M is an electromagnet;
H, its armature, is pivoted at S and weighted at P, and carries
a platinum wire Q which dips into the mercury cup Q’.
   When the temperature of the water-bath has reached a
certain arbitrary value, the mercury-index electrically con
nects f1 and f2, completing the circuit of the electromagnet M
and the battery Z. The electromagnet bein thus excited,
attracts its armature H, which compresses t e indiarubber
tube T that feeds the main gas-jet J, between the brass
piece N and the adjustable wooden block N’, and so extin
guishes the light. The water-bath now cools slowly till its
temperature has fallen below the <U+FB01>xed value, and the contact
is broken at f2 by the falling of the mercury-index.      When
this happens, the armature of the electromagnet is released
and pulled up at once by the weight P, the gas coming on
again at the jet J ; some of the gas passing up the tube E
is ignited at the top by the by-pass G, and then striking
back, lights the main jet J, restarting the heating, and the
cycle is repeated.
   As it requires a less current to hold the armature down
than it takes originally to attract it, the current circuit of
the magnet is so arranged that when the armature is '
attracted it breaks the direct-current circuit at the mercury
cup Q’, and inserts into the circuit a. resistance of 50 ohms,
thus economizing the energy.
   The temperature at whidh the cut-off acts can be adjusted
several degrees by altering the distance which the wire f2
projects down the tube L.
   By carefully adjusting the size of the jet, the by-pass, and
the height of the block N’, we could keep the temperature of

coming on again about every <U+FB01>ve minutes.
   To investigate the effect of temperature on the cells, it was
necessary to be able to vary their temperature so as to get a
uniform rise or fall. To effect this, some special form of
heating-bath was needed. In its <U+FB01>nal form, this heating
bath consisted of an outer zinc bath, in which the vessel
containing the Clark cells was placed, which was divided up
by means of a number of partitions, reaching from the
 bottom of the vessel to above the surface of the oil. The
 oil was forced alternately under one partition and over the
 next, round the whole of the bath, and from the last com
 partment was drawn off into a separate chamber containing
 a heating-coil and a coil of lead tubing for an iced-water

    The circulation obtained by this means was excellent.
 When the bath was tested at a rate of change of temperature of
  1° in eight minutes, there was found to be a maximum differ
 ence of temperature between any two oints of the bath of
 0°‘2 ; while at a rate of change of 1 in <U+FB01>fteen minutes, no
 difference in temperature was detected.
     In the inner vessel containing the cells (<U+FB01>g. 3) the oil was

290 Messrs. Spiers,‘Twyman, and Waters on Variations in
circulated by means of two sets of vanes ; the upper set, A, in
the form of a screw-thread, was arranged so as to send the oil
downwards 0n rotation ; the lower set, B, were radial near the
centre, and at the outer ends curved so as to force the oil
upwards. Thus, as the oil was forced downwards from the
<U+FB01>rst set A, it was caught, and <U+FB01>rst sent outwards and then
upwards by the second set B, thus producing a constant
circulation. During our experiments the temperature in this
bath was always uniform to at least 00'02 O.
   The stretched wire (<U+FB01>g. 4), three metres in length, was
                              Fig. 4.

employed as the potentiometer-wire. The resistance of this
being known, the strength of current necessary to give a
drop of potential of one ten-thousandth of a volt per centi
metre length was calculated, and also the resistance required
to be traversed by this current to produce a potential-di<U+FB02>'er
ence between its extremities equal to the                 of our
standard. The resistance R1 was adjusted so as to be as
nearly as possible equal to that value, and the de<U+FB01>cit was
found in terms of a length AP of the stretched wire. For
example, suppose the resistance necessary to produce a
potential-difference equal to the E.M.F. of our standard to be
found by calculation to be 214'30 ohms. Plugs would be
taken out of R1 to the value of 214 ohms, and the point P on
the wire would be selected such that the resistance of AP
equalled 0'30 ohm. Then the mercury cups (1,!) and .z', 2'
being joined, the current sent through the wire by the storage
cell B was adjusted b means of' the auxiliary variable resist
ance R, until the                 of' the standard equalled the
potential-difference between the points H and P. In this
way the wire was rendered direct reading for any subsequent
comparison-s, one centimetre on the scale corresponding with
one ten-thousandth of a volt.        By joining the mercury cups
a, b and w, z, the value of the current could be readily checked
at any time during the experiment without interruptin the
rest of the circuit. As a rule, very little variation was ound

to occur.       In this method we measure the difference of the
E.M.Fs. of the cells on the stretched wire, and not the
actual E.M.F. of the cell under test, consequently considerable
variations of the current have very little effect on the result.

contact P, we could <U+FB01>nd a point such that the potential
ditference between P and C equalled the difference in E.M.F.
between the cell to be tested and the standard. If the
difference between the E.M.Fs. was positive, then the point
P lay on one side of the point C, while if the difference was
negative, it lay on the other side.
     To <U+FB01>nd how the changes in E.M.F. lagged behind those of
the temperature, it was found best to subject the cells to a
cycle of temperature, the temperature being <U+FB01>rst raised at a
uniform rate through a certain number of degrees, and then
cooled again at the same uniform rate to the original tempera
ture.      Supposing no lag to exist, the curve connecting
temperature and E.M.F. would be the same for both rising and
falling temperatures. But if there is a lag of short duration,
1'. e. not cumulative, then, provided that the temperature varies
at the same rate throughout, two distinct curves, the second
parallel to the <U+FB01>rst for the greater part of its length, will
result, and will enclose an area between them. If there is
any lag of a semi-permanent character, it will be shown by the
 curve not returning to its original starting-point till after a
considerable time.
     When we proceeded to take the cells through a cycle of
of t erature,

                    we <U+FB01>rst     of had

ture for some days in the thermostat. The current for heating
the cell-bath was then turned on, the required value of the
current to give a certain rate of rise of temperature having
been previously determined by experiment. The current in
the stretched wire was then adjusted to its pro er value, and
the readings of the E.M.Fs. of the cells were taiien every few
minutes. The temperature of the cells was observed every
<U+FB01>ve minutes and a curve plotted connecting temperature and
time. The heating curve between time and temperature
always gave practically a straight line, without readjustment
of the current. When we started to cool our bath, we turned
on the iced-water circulation full for the <U+FB01>rst few minutes, to
 get a sharp bend in the temperature and time curve, after
 wards it was made to go much slower, and the <U+FB02>ow required
 readjusting from time to time to keep the curve straight.

292    Messrs. Spiers, Twyman, and Waters on Variations in
Considering that this adjustment was done purely by the
method of trial and error, the curves obtained may be regarded
as highly satisfactory. They approximate so closely to straight
lines that it was thought unnecessary to reproduce them. In
some of the cycles we cooled <U+FB01>rst and and heated afterwards,
thus reversing the cycle. At the conclusion of each experi
ment the E.M.F. of the standard was again tested absolutely.
   The accuracy of the method was all that was desired.
The thermostat would keep the temperature of the standard
constant to O°'Ol C., and the temperature of the cell-bath was
uniform to O°'02 at least. The difference in the E.M.Fs.
could be read on the stretched wire to one hundred-thousandth
of a volt. The E.M.F. of the standard never varied more
than one ten-thousandth of a volt during an exPeriment, and
in general it probably varied much less.
   Three different rates of change of temperature were tried :
1° C. in seven minutes; 1° in <U+FB01>fteen minutes; and 1° in
thirty minutes. A cycle generally lasted about <U+FB01>ve or six
hours. The curves are plotted for               and temperature,
and, to avoid confusion, the curves for the di<U+FB02>’erent cells
have been separated by displacing the origin of E M.F.
di<U+FB02>'erences.
   It will_ be seen that the curve connecting E.M.F. and
temperature is not the same for both the rising and the falling
temperatures in a cycle. As explained above, this indicates
the existence of lag. The lag of E.M.F. at a rate of change
of temperature of 10 in seven minutes is about four ten
thousandths of a volt; at a rate of change of 1° in <U+FB01>fteen
minutes, it is about two-and-a-half ten-thousandths ; at a rate
of 1° in thirty minutes, it is about one twenty-thousandth of a
volt. By this lag is meant half the difference between the
E.M.Fs. given by the rising and falling curves for any par
ticular temperature. If these lags are compared with those
obtained for the B.T.-type of cell, in the paper above referred
to, we see that the lag in the case of the H-form of cell is less
than one quarter of that in the ordinary form. (See <U+FB01>g. 7.
N.B.-—The zero-lines on this diagram are purely arbitrary;
the curves are merely for the purpose of comparison.)
   The temperature at the close of a cycle was sometimes not
exactly the same as at the commencement, hence the tempera
ture—time curves are not closed.    It is highly probable that if
the temperature had been the same, the E.M.F. would have
returned to its original value. On keeping the temperature
constant at the end of the cycle, the lag passed off rapidly ;
at a rate of variation of temperature of 1° in <U+FB01>fteen minutes
it disappeared in about ten minutes.

the Electromotive Force of Clark Cells with Temperature.     293
   The probable reason for the superiority of the H-form
over the ordinary form is that when the changes of tem
perature produce variations in the density of the zinc sulphate
solution, the zinc amalgam, being at the bottom, is always in
contact with a saturated solution, while in the B.T.-form we
have the solution in contact with the mercury saturated, but
that in contact with zinc will not be saturated till the whole
of the paste has attained its equilibrium condition and again
become saturated with zinc sulphate at the new temperature.
   Thus in general it appears that in the H-form of Clark cell
the lag is much less than in the B.T.-form, and that under
ordinary conditions, when the rate of variation of temperature
is not greater than 1° in half an hour, by applying the ordinary
temperature-corrections we can obtain a result accurate to less
than a ten-thousandth of a volt. If we wish to apply a
temperature-correction for a greater rate of variation than
this, we must either <U+FB01>nd the temperature-coef<U+FB01>cient for varia
tions at that rate from curves such as those given here, or
else slightly diminish the ordinary coef<U+FB01>cient. Subsequent
experiments showed that if an H-cell were placed in a water
bath, which was heated through 3° or 4° as quickly as possible,
then the E.M.F. of the cell would reach an approximately
steady value as soon as the temperature of the bath, and b
taking the temperature of the cell as being that of the bath,
we could apply the temperature correction accurate to a ten
thousandth of a volt.
   The two Muirhead cells used as standards in the above
experiments were also taken through a single cycle at a rate
of variation of temperature of 1° in <U+FB01>fteen minutes. From
the curves (<U+FB01>g. 8) it will be seen that one of the cells is but
slightly interior as regards lag to the H-form, while the other
comes about midway between the H and the B.T. forms.
These two cells have been recently dismounted, and it was
found that they were almost dried up and that the zinc
sulphate had crystallized out over the top of the cells. They
had thus practically become examples of Prof. Callendar’s
crystal cell*, and this probably accounts for their small
lag. The cell which appeared the drier of the two had the
larger lag.
   ()ur best thanks are due to Prof. Ayrton and Mr. T. Mather
For their many valuable suggestions and kind help, and to
Mr. Cooper for the loan of the cells tested.

                             APPENDIX.
    Since the above investigation was completed, some experi—
ments have been made to test whether the lag of E.M.F.
observed was due to the lag of the temperature of the cell
 behind that of the bath or to diffusion lag.   A B.T.-form of
 cell was made up in a tube 2 cm. diameter, and a thermometer
inserted in a position similar to that occupied by the zinc.
 The cell was immersed in a water-bath so that the upper
 surface of the paste was about 2 cm. below the surface of the
 water. The temperature of the bath was then raised uniformly,
 the bath being kept stirred, and the temperature of the cell
 observed from time to time and compared with that of the
water-bath. The lag of the temperature of the cell behind
that of the bath was, at a rate of variation of temperature of
 1° in six minutes, 0°‘l5 ; at a rate of 1° in <U+FB01>fteen minutes
0°‘lO ; at a rate of 1° in thirty minutes less than O°'O5. The
same experiment was tried with the thermometer half in the
mercury and half in the paste so as to represent the condition
of things in the H-form. The temperature lags in this
position were found to be very slightly less than in the
 other.
    Experiments were also made in which the cell at a tempera
ture of 12° C. was placed in the bath at 30° C. and the bath
stirred ; the temperature of the cell was observed at different
times. The observations showed that at the end of <U+FB01>ve
minutes the lag behind the temperature of the bath was 0°‘lO,
at the end of eight minutes practically zero. The tempera
tures in these experiments were observed accurate to O°'O5 C.
    A Callendar crystal cell was tested in the same manner as
the above and gave almost identical results.
    It appears from these experiments that about half the lag
of          observed in the H-form of cell is due to the lag of
the temperature of the cell behind that of the bath, and the
rest to diffusion lag.
    Hence in . all experiments with Clark cells, where the
temperature effects are likely to be serious, it is better to
discard the B.T.-form of cell and use either Prof. Callendar’s
crystal cell, Prof. Carhart’s modi<U+FB01>cation of the B.T.-form,
or the H-form. The Callendar crystal cell, in which the
zinc rests in a mass of moist zinc-sulphate crystals, has a very
small diffusion lag, but has the disadvantage that there is a
possibility of particles of zinc falling and       reaching the
mercury.     This fault is, howeVer, eliminated in his inverted
type.    The Carhart cell, in which the solution is of constant
strength, also possesses a very small diffusion lag, but it has

                                two serious drawbacks, <U+FB01>rstly, an error of a few tenths of a
                                degree in the temperature at which the cell is saturated makes
                                an error of several ten-thousandths of a volt in the E.M.F.,
                                and, secondly, every time a current passes through the cell a
                                certain amount of zinc is dissolved, so in time the solution
                                becomes stronger. This point is of particular importance
                                where the cells are used with condensers.

 §20. GLASS-MERCURY thermometers, and probably
                  all others, differ from the ideal of our de<U+FB01>nition
in requiring a sensible time to follow a change of tempera
ture. This lag in a mercury-thermometer increases with the
 mass of the mercury and the thickness of the glass. It also
 depends on the nature of the surrounding medium. A
 clinical thermometer, for instance, initially at 15° C., will rise
 to the temperature of the body faster in a moist than in a
 dry mouth, and much faster in a well-stirred bucket of water
 than in either. In still air where temperature is altering
 rapidly, two adjacent thermometers of diHerent sluggishness
 may ditfer by degrees.
     If T denote time, t the thermometer reading, 7 the tem
 perature of its surroundings, the formula usually advanced
 to represent the phenomena is * :
                                 dt
                                     + Alt—'1') =0,
                                d'l‘
  where )t is a constant. When t—r is small, this is probably
 at least a close approximation to the facts. When, however,
 t—r is considerable—as, for instance, when a thermometer
  initially at 15° C. is suddenly exposed to a temperature of
 40° C.—the initial phenomena, in my experience, do not
  follow so simple a law.
     When -r is constant, the solution of the differential equation is
                              i=7 + (to—r)e“*T,
  where to is the value of t when T=O.

    Thus if the temperature 1" be absolutely constant, the
 difference between t and 7 tends ultimately to vanish, and
 the temperature of the medium may be obtained directly, to
 any required degree of accuracy, by allowing suf<U+FB01>cient time
 to elapse before reading the thermometer. Usually, how
 ever, 7 is to some extent variable *, and to arrive at a
 suf<U+FB01>ciently exact interpretation of the readings of the ther
 mometer it may be necessary to carefully observe the rate of
 variation of t and employ some mathematical analysis. The
 mere presence of the thermometer tends frequently to intro
 duce variation in the temperature of the medium surrounding
 its bulb. When, for instance, there is only partial immersion
 in a liquid bath or in a freezing solution, whose temperature
 differs appreciably from that of the room, there is a constant
 transfer of heat along the thermometer-stem, which in<U+FB02>uences
 to some extent the temperature recorded.               This in<U+FB02>uence
 depends largely on the character of the thermometer and the
 nature of the bath.
    The phenomena discussed in this paragraph have an
 important bearing on the accuracy of ordinary thermometric
 measurements, which is perhaps somewhat apt to be over
 looked by those whose experience has centred in laboratories
 provided with elaborate thermo-regulators.

    § 21. Particulars of the method of determining (depressed
 zero) freezing-points at the Bureau International will be found
 in Guillaume’s Tizemnome’trz'e, p. 116. The object is to reduce
 the temperature to 0° C. as rapidly as is consistent with the
 safety of the thermometer. The ice must be pure, the
presence of the least trace of salt being especially objection
able. It should be very <U+FB01>nely divided, and su<U+FB02>iciently but
not excessively moist. What Guillaume speaks of most
favourably is good lake ice or freshly fallen snow moistened
with pure distilled water. He quotes the tollowing results
so observed by Pernet :—

to recent work on the subject and also a variety of interesting experi

        These are to be regarded rather as indications of the order
   0f probable differences under ordinary conditions than as
   rigid physical data.          Thus Marek, whose results Guillaume
   also quotes *, got for dry arti<U+FB01>cial ice —O°'O519 or —0°'O919,
   according as it was <U+FB01>nely divided or only pounded.
       When ice is dry, its temperature may in reality be very
  much below the freezing-point. Of course under ordinary
  experimental conditions the ice is exposed to a temperature
  over 0°, and its surface is usually moist. The tendency for
  the ice in the centre of large blocks to be at a lower tem
  perature than 0° C. has been noticed at the Reichsaustalt 1',
  where it is the practice to employ arti<U+FB01>cial ice from distilled
  water.
       In making arti<U+FB01>cial ice, the purity of the water seems of
  some importance, ice from tap or cistern-water giving
  freezin -points too low by from 0°‘002 G. to 0°‘003 C. 1'
      To 0 tain results agreeing to 0°'001 C. a very uniform
 procedure must be followed, and it is quite conceivable that
 the adoption of different procedures at different places might
 lead to slightly di<U+FB02>'erent scales of temperature 1.
      One disturbing agent, to which attention may be called, is
 conduction of heat down the thermometer stem. Though
 specially to be feared in depressed-zero readings following
 high temperatures, its absence can hardly, perhaps, be safely
 assumed in ordinary <U+FB01>xed-zero determinations, especially in a
hot room.
      In dealing with toluene or other spirit-thermometers, in
 which the liquid wets the tube, the depressed zero method
has been found impracticable at the Bureau International §,

owing to the slowness with which the spirit drains down the
tube after a fall of temperature.
    011 the <U+FB01>xed zero method, the thermometer ought theoreti
cally to be kept at 0° C. for an inde<U+FB01>nite time. In practice,
however, prolonged exposure to a temperature of about 15° C.
is a much more usual preliminary. Now a verre dur thermo
meter after long exposure to 15° 0. would give, even after
10 or 15 minutes immersion in ice, a zero reading about
O°'015 0. below the true <U+FB01>xed zero, and this, of course, is a
very serious ditference in thermometry aiming at accuracy of
the order O°'001 0.         Even with English glass, where the
depression of zero after ordinary atmospheric temperatures is
considerably less than with verre dur, it is hopeless to think
of accuracy above 0°‘01 C. unless attention is paid to the
previous temperature.
    For work of the highest accuracy, the pressure to which
the ice is exposed may become of importance. According to
the theory of Prof. James Thomson, and the experiments of
Lord Kelvin, an increase of one atmosphere in the pressure
lowers the freezing-point about O°'OO75 C.* Thus in vacuum
tubes where the pressure is practically nil, or in laboratory
experiments with compressed gases, a very sensible correction
might be necessary. Even under natural conditions a cor
rection of the order 0°‘OO3 0. might be required at lofty
stations.
    It must not be overlooked that such variations in external
pressure affect the reading in another totally different way,
through their direct in<U+FB02>uence on the glass of the thermo
 meter (see § 26).      In fact, care is required to ensure that no
 external pressure effect is produced by too tight packing of
the ice, or by allowing the bulb to rest unsupported 0n largish
ice-crystals.
    In determining freezing—points of metals or solutions it is .
customary to cool down the liquid and observe the stationary
point on an immersed thermometer. This method, though
not usually adopted, is of course applicable to the freezing
point of water. A discussion of it by Dr. M. Wildermann
  as appeared recently in the Phil. Mag. 1', in which will be
 found references to recent work on the subject.

    § 22. In Balfour Stewart’s ‘ Heat’ (art. xxi. 1st ed.),
 212° F. is de<U+FB01>ned as the temperature of steam under the
 pressure of 29'905 inches of mercury reduced to 32° F. at
 the latitude of London.        Balfour Stewart points out a differ
 ence between 212° F. and 100° C., de<U+FB01>ning the latter as the
 temperature of steam under the barometric pressure of
 760 mm. of mercury reduced to the temperature of freezing
 water in the latitude of Paris. The Bureau International,
 however, now generally recognized as the central authority,
 have substituted latitude 45° for that of Paris in the de<U+FB01>
 nition *. This has apparently the fortunate result of bringing
 212° F. and 100° G. into almost exact agreement.
    According to Knter’s determination,
                       760 mm. = 29'9218 inches;
and so            759'573 mm. = 29'905 inches ;
 and, according to Guillaume’s Thermome'trz'e, p. 325,
     {Gravity in London (Standards’ Of<U+FB01>ce) 1» +
                           .2 Gravity in latitude 45°} = 10005815.
    These data make the pressure of 29'905 inches of mercury
in London equal to that of 760'031 mm. in latitude 45°,
and by Regnault’s table                 Guillaume’s Thermométrie,
p. 327) the boiling-point corresponding to the latter pressure
is 100°'001 C.
    Recent comparisons 1', both American and British, give
apparently for the ratio (yard/metre) a value something like
one part in 40,000 larger than Kater's, and it is uncertain
what accuracy is assignable to values of g, and to what
extent it presents local <U+FB02>uctuations. Thus the closeness of
the above agreement between 212° F. and 100° C. may not
be absolutely relied on. If it should prove that g has a daily
or annual variation of one part in 25,000, an uncertainty of
the order O°'001 C. would exist in the standard boiling-point.
   * Guillaume's Thermométrie, p. 4.
   T A preliminary discussion of the most recent comparison, initiated by
Mr. Chaney, wil be found on pp. 37—40 of the Proces- Verbaua: for
1895 (Paris, 1896) of the International Committee of Weights and
Measures. Owing to the absence of a legally de<U+FB01>ned scale of tempera.
ture, there seems some uncertainty as to the interpretation to be put on
the standard tem erature 62° F.       At this point the cerre dur and
hydrogen scales diger by about 0°'075 0.

    Also for this degree of accuracy it may prove that speci<U+FB01>ca
    tion of the standard latitude, 45°, alone is not suf<U+FB01>cient. It
     is desirable, of' course, that the de<U+FB01>nitions of 212° F. and
     1000 0. should be absolutely equivalent.
        § 23. When we leave de<U+FB01>nitions and come to actual
     determinations of boiling-points, we encounter, as has recently
     been emphasized by Mr. E. H. Grifliths *, uncertainties in
     barometric determinations. Differences of '002 inch, or
     more, in the readings of the same barometer by two skilled
     observers, due mainly to personal equation in setting the
     ivory pointer, are not unusual. Mr. Grif<U+FB01>ths does not refer
     to this point, but directs his attention to possible differences
     between barometers themselves. A comparison of a Tonnelot
     barometer examined at the Bureau International and an
     En lish barometer veri<U+FB01>ed at Kew Observatory leads him
     to t e conclusion 'I' “ that a discrepancy of as much as '2 mm.
     would appear to exist between the Sévres (Bureau Inter
     national) and Kew standards.” He adds, however, that the
     conditions of the comparison “ were not entirely satisfactory.”
        Several more direct comparisons of the standard barometers
    at the principal European institutions have been made by
    skilled observers, using portable barometers as intermediaries.
    The more important comparisons prior to 1890 are summarized
    in a table in Waldo’s ‘Modern Meteorology,’ from which I
    have extracted the following results :—

accuracy even of the order O°'OO5 C.‘ in the absolute value of
a boiling-point determination would appear highly problem
atical. It is not unlikely, however, that many of the discre
pancies arose in great part from changes in the portable
 barometers during transit. Barometers, even with contracted
tubes, are awkward things to carry by rail, and trustworthy
 results can only be obtained after t e transported instrument
has been hung up for a considerable time. Not unlikely
 Prof. Mohn’s 1' suggestion, viz. to compare barometers by the
aid of a travelling hyposometric thermometer, might prove a
 good one, at least in the case of stations where appliances
exist for observing both boiling- and freezing-points with the
 highest degree of accuracy.
     § 24. There are other sources of uncertainty in boiling
point determinations. Every thermometer has a time-lag,
and so probably has every barometer; hence simultaneous
readings of thermometer and barometer may not really cor
respond to simultaneous temperature and pressure phenomena.
The columns of wide-tube barometers, in which the lag is
least, generally pulsate slightly even to the eye, unless under
exceptionally steady conditions of pressure. Under normal
conditions, one may expect changes of several thousandths of
an inch in barometric pressure during the time occupied by a
boiling-point determination.
    In the paper already referred to, Mr. Grif<U+FB01>ths raises the
question whether the temperature of steam accommodates
itself immediately to the barometric pressure when the latter
changes. On his p. 230 be, however, expresses the opinion
that a table on his p. 231 “ will . . . convince the most sceptical
that the temperature-lag of the steam may be disregarded.”
I am not sure his argument will be universally conceded, as
the data—consisting of observed boiling-points by a platinum
thermometer, and boiling-points calculated from simultaneous
readings of a barometer in the course of one afternoon——
might have been advanced, with perhaps equal force, in
support of the contention that barometers and platinum
thermometers are instruments free from lag. The uncertain
ties arising from lag are usually small, but still it is desirable
   “ Since writin the above, I have observed it stated on p. 102 of the
Reichsanstalt’s     iss. Abhandl. vol. i. that their determination of the
fundamental interval of a certain Tonnelot thermometer differed by
'005 C. from that of the Bureau International. It is signi<U+FB01>cantly added
that '005 0. answers to a di<U+FB01>'erence of '14 mm. in the barometer-reading
at the boiling-point.

      §25. This is too technical and mathematical a subject to
be pro<U+FB01>tably discussed here in detail.             The methods in use at
the Bureau International are described in several of their
publications-I“ and in Guillaume’s Thermométrie, pp. 43 et seqq.
In calibrating an ordinary thermometer, range 0° to 100° 0., use
is made ot'threads of 50, 40, 30, 20,12, 10, 8, 6,4,and 2degrees.
     The publications of the Reichsanstalt recommend that the
 shortest mercury-threads used do not exceed in length one
degree-division, and speak of an error as large as 0°‘01 0.1
arising in the calibration of a Tonnelot thermometer when
the shortest thread equalled 20'5. They also recommend a
double calibration with each thread, proceeding from one
end of the thermometer to the other and back again. This
is to serve as a protection against the error that might arise
from gradual heating of the mercury-thread. Alleged “nicht
unerheblichen” errors§ in the calibration-data supplied by the
Bureau International for one of the Reichsaustalt’s verre dur
thermometers are ascribed to the neglect of this precaution.
     The object of calibration at both these institutions is to
supply a table of corrections to be applied habitually to every
reading of the thermometer.                  Degree-divisions represent
 equal lengths, not equal volumes, on the French and German
standard thermometers.
      Kew standard thermometers, on the other hand, are cali
 brated before they are subdivided, and the calibration results
are used to guide one in dividing the stem into equal volumes,
 not equal lengths. Most authorities take for granted that
 this attempt is bound to fail when accuracy of the order
 O°'001 C. is in question. This is very probably a true con
 clusion, but it is not always safe to prophecy failure before .
 the attempt is made. The fact is that no attempt has ever
 been made to construct Kew standards suitable for this degree
 of accuracy. They are intended to be read easily by the
 unaided eye, and the width of the divisions is usually a very
 considerable multiple of the l—Olfm of a degree interval. The
 accuracy ordinarily aimed at in the construction of these
 instruments is really O°'O5 F., and if we may judge from
     ' Fora description of the principal methods see a report by Profs.

  careful calibrations by Dr. Thorpe and Prof. Riicker ', Prof.
  Rowland, Mr. Waldo 1', and others, the accuracy actually
  attained is usually considerably higher than this.        What can
  be done depends very much on the natural uniformity of the
  bore. If the preliminary calibration shows the tube destined
  for a Kew standard to be unduly conical or erratic in bore it
  is laid aside. When calibration-tables are constructed, a tube
  of this kind may seem to be as good as another; but I, for

                         Pressure Coef<U+FB01>cients.
     §26. The application of increased pressure to the outside
 of a thermometer, whether through rise of barometric ressure
 or immersion in a li uid, compresses the glass and re uces its
 internal volume. T is makes the mercury rise in the stem,
 and, supposing the increase in pressure uniform over the
 outer glass surface, the rise bears to the increase in pressure
 a constant ratio, known as the “ external pressure coef<U+FB01>cient.”
 The unit of pressure usually employed is that of a millimetre
 column of mercury at 0° 0., the rise in the stem being measured
 in degrees. Knowing the external pressure coef<U+FB01>cient, one
 can calculate the correction necessary to reduce the readings
 taken with the thermometer under any known external pressure
 to what they would have been under the standard pressure.
    Again,when the horizontal position is adopted as the standard
one—as is done at. the Bureau International and the Reichs
anstalt—a correction is necessary when the thermometer in
 read in the vertical position, to allow for the in<U+FB02>uence of the
increased internal pressure. This pressure expands the bulb
and compresses its contents, both effects contributing to lower
the reading. If we treat the internal pressure as uniformly
distributed, and proportional to the length of the mercury
column measured from the centre of the bulb, we can, by
observing the difference in the readings of a thermometer
when vertical and when horizontal at any one temperature,
calculate an “internal pressure coef<U+FB01>cient.” This may con
veniently be the ratio of the observed rise of reading in
degrees—when the thermometer is transferred from the ver
tical to the horizontal position—to the length'of the mercury
column measured in millimetres. Knowing this internal
pressure coef<U+FB01>cient, one can calculate a table giving the cor
rection for internal pressure to be applied to any reading
taken with the thermometer vertical.

      Applying the mathematical theory of elasticity, Guillaume *
hasdeduced a very simple relation between the external and
internal ressure coef<U+FB01>cients, measured of course in the same
units.      Galling these coef<U+FB01>cients [-3, and ,8,- respectively, as
 Guillaume does, this relation may be written
                                  Bi—Ba=c)
where c is proportional to the difference between the com
pressibility of mercury and that of the particular glass of
 which the thermometer is made. Thus in all thermometers
of the same glass ,85—18. should be constant. Taking the
units recommended above, viz. rise of 1° in reading and 1 mm.
of mercury pressure, the results deduced at the Bureau
International* and the Reichsanstalt 1' are as follows :—

      §27. In determining B, the thermometer, immersed in a
liquid, is exposed to various air pressures, from an atmosphere
downwards §.         The fact that the changes of pressure tend to
affect the temperature of the liquid is pointed out in the
publications of the Reichsanstaltll, and it is apparently re
commended that water—preferably near 4° O.—should be
used rather than glycerine or mercury 1i.
     Observations of the thermometer alternately in the vertical
and horizontal positions, at any convenient temperature,
supply the means of calculating ,8,» The Sévres-pattern
hypsometer is specially adapted for this purpose. The experi
mental determination of 3;, however, is not so easy as it looks.
In a horizontal thermometer the end of the mercury column
loses its symmetrical shape—especially in a large bore—and
the reading becomes uncertain. There is also apt to be trouble
through the capillary effect. Oapillarity causes a pressure on
the mercury and bulb. Unless this is constant, which ceases

    Regarding the experimental determination of ,8." as some
what uncertain, Guillaume* recommends that it be deduced
from the observed value of [3,, employing the theoretical
connexion between the two coef<U+FB01>cients.
     The capillarity dif<U+FB01>culty is dwelt on in the Reichsanstalt’s
 publicationsT ; but, notwithstanding, the plan recommended
 is to attach equal weights to experimentally determined
 values 181, B" of the two coef<U+FB01>cients, and to calculate values
 B, and B,- by means of these and the theoretical value of
 Bi—Bs.        For instance, in a verre dur thermometer we should
 have
                         e=%(B/+B.’—-0000154),
                       18.: MB: + B.’ + 0000154).
 A table 1 of observed and calculated values in various ther
 mometers of different patterns shows a pretty close agreement
 between the mean observed difference ,8;’—B,' and the
  theoretical; but in individual cases the observed difference
  varies from 45X1()_7 to 250 X 10—7. The explanation
  favoured is apparently the uncertainty in the capillary effect.
      Personally, I am disposed to think that too much reliance
  is placed on the supposed constancy of [ii—B, in all thermo
  meters of the same glass. The supposed relation is exact
  under two restrictions, absolute homogeneousness in the
  glass, and uniformity in the distribution of the external and
  internal pressures over their respective surfaces, inclusive
  of bulb, stem, and any auxiliary chambers. Under these
  circumstances a simple proof of the relation has been given
  b myself §, and independently by Schuster and Gannon
  The supposed uniformity of pressure is, however, non-existent,
  in the case more especially of the internal pressure, and the
  means of allowing for this in the theoretical investigation
  have not yet been devised.
       In appl ing the internal pressure-correction allowance is
   made at t e Reichsanstalt<U+FB01>l for the diminution in the density
   of the mercury-column as the temperature rises. Guillaume“
   omits this, on the ground that the elasticity of the glass also

changes with the temperature, and that, at least in the case
of verre dm', the two in<U+FB02>uences nearly neutralize one another.
The limits of temperature within which this happy arrange
ment prevails are, I suspect, somewhat uncertain. At
temperatures above 100° 0., I suspect the uncertainties
proceeding from the above sources and from the capillarity
are appreciable. Internal pressure-corrections of the order
0°“l U. are by no means unprecedented, so that when accuracy
of the order 0°‘001 C. is aimed at, an error of even 2 or 3 per
cent. in the value of B,- begins to tell.
   § 28. By adopting the vertical as the standard position, the
practice followed at Kew Observatory, the necessity for an
internal pressure-correction can usually be avoided, at least
for accuracy of the order O°'01 C. As already pointed out,
when the stem is vertical the reduction of the reading, like
its two contributory causes expansion of the bulb and com
pression of the mercury, is preportional, at least as a <U+FB01>rst
approximation, to the length of the mercury-column measured
from the middle of the bulb ; but in an ordinary thermometer,
increment of stem-length is suf<U+FB01>ciently nearly proportional
to increment of reading. Hence at any temperature t the
depression due to internal pressure is, in stem-divisions,
                               9+t/Pa
where p and g are constants for the thermometer.
   Thus to make a Bureau International thermometer register
correctly in the vertical position we need only lower the
freezing-point mark 9 divisions below the position answering
to a horizontal reading, and shorten each degree-division by 1 /p
of itself.  This obviously comes to the same thing as marking
the freezing- and boiling-points with the thermometer vertical
and subdividing the fundamental interval in the usual way.
   This fact has been pointed out by Prof. Schuster and
Mr. Gann0n*; it was arrived at independently by myself
and embodied in a report on therlnometry made some years
ago to the Kew Observatory Committee.
   When an ordinary Kew thermometer is used in the
horizontal position a subtractive correction must be applied
to obtain the true temperature. Exceptions to this rule exist
in the shape of meteorological maximum and minimum
thermometers, which it is the custom to employ in a hori
zontal position.     To prevent possible misconception, the
certi<U+FB01>cates issued state explicitly to which of the two positions
the table of corrections applies.

   If the stem of a. thermometer were of very unequal bore,
and consequently its degree-divisions of very unequal length,
the adoption of the vertical as the standard position would
not eliminate the internal pressure-correction satisfactorily.
It is rare, however, even in the commonest commercial tubes
to encounter cases where this need be taken into account for
accuracy of the order 0°‘01 C.
   § 29. There are, however, thermometers—some of the most
approved patterns—for which the ordinary Kew method of
avoiding an internal pressure-correction fails. It is becoming
increasingly common to have one or more auxiliary chambers
blown on stems of thermometers, with the object of including
one or both fundamental points in the scale without making
the stem inconveniently long. Now the difference between the
mercury-pressures in the bulb for two readings, one occurring
above, the other below an auxiliary chamber, is no longer
proportional to the difference in the temperatures. Thus the
determination of the fundamental points in the vertical
position, and the subdivision of the stem into equal volumes,
each one-hundredth of the fundamental interval, fails to
render readings in the vertical position correct measures of
temperature. The remedy is easy enough, at least theoreti
cally, as the following investigation shows :—
   Let the degree-divisions immediately below and immediately
above an auxiliary chamber be respectively t1 and t2, while
the interval between the two divisions equals the length of 'r
degree-divisions, instead of ta—tl divisions as it would in an
ordinary thermometer.     For shortness let
                         tg— t1—'r='r';
in other words let 1’ denote the number of degree-divisions
b which the stem is shortened through the existence of the
chamber.
   Let “depression ” temporarily signify lowering of reading
as the thermometer, its temperature remaining constant,
changes from the horizontal to the vertical position ; also let
A represent the depression at the ice-point, and 8 the de
pression due to a column of mercury equal in length to a
degree-division.
   Above the chamber at a reading t, which may exceed
100° (1.,
                   depression=A+8(t—-r’) ;
below the chamber at a reading t, which may be below zero,
                      depression =A + 5!.

312          Dr. C. Chree’s Notes on Thermometry.
The depression, being A at the freezing- and A+8(lOO—-r’)
at the boiling-point, would require to be given throughout by
                                t
                        A + 5 m (lOO—T')
if the adoption of the vertical position alone were to suf<U+FB01>ce.
Thus above the chamber the depression actually found would
be too small by
        8{(t/100)(100—'r’) —(t—'r’)} EST/(IOO—t)/100;
while below the chamber it would be too large by
                             S-r't/lOO.
Consequently we can accomplish our object by simply
shortenin each degree-division, whether above or below the
chamber<U+FB01>iy 81"/100 of its natural length (2'. e. the length of
stem whose volume would be one-hundredth of the funda
mental interval). This is equivalent to the following rule :—
Determine the freezing- and boiling-points in the vertical
position ; calculate from a calibration where the divisions
t1 and t2 immediately below and above the chamber would
come in the usual way, but mark the former point lower b
8t1'r’/100 and the latter higher by 8(100—t2)-r'/100 than
according to the calculation ; subdivide the stem between the
divisions 0 and t1, t2 and 100, into equal volumes.
   This instruction supposes 5 to be known. To determine it
observe the difference D in the boiling-point readings obtained
with the thermometer vertical and horizontal, then
                     8=D—:-('ro+10()—'r'),
where T' has its previous meaning, while To is the number of
degree-divisions between the centre of the bulb and the zero
point.   It must be remembered that the correction is a small
one, so that we may safely use in our calculation of 8 the
values obtained for To and 1" when the correction is neglected.
   In practice, for moderate accuracy, the simplest plan would
be to mark off two points one slightly below, the other
slightly above the chamber, by comparison with an ordinar
standard thermometer of the same kind of glass, both ther
mometers being vertical. Subdividing the two portions of
stem included between these marked points and the respective
fundamental points into equal volumes, we attain our object.
   If a chamber existed above the 100° C. mark, the only
change required would be a raising of all the degree-divisions
above the chamber—relative to the positions calculated in

              Dr. (J. Chree’s Notes on Niel-)rzonzetry.            313
the ordinar way from calibration—by a constant amount
81'", where has its previous meaning, while 7” is the number
of degree-lengths by which the stem is shortened through
the existence of the chamber.
   In all possible combinations of auxiliary chambers the
degree-spaces must be equal in volume throughout the entire
stem, if the scale is to be that natural to the glass.
    § 30. In all ordinary mercury-thermometers some trace of
air * exists, and if this collects in the stem when the thermo
meter is exposed to a high temperature the mercury-column
is apt to break. Partly to prevent this, and partly to increase
the range, limited by the boiling-point of mercury, it is
becoming common to introduce nitrogen or carbonic-acid gas
above the mercury, sometimes under very considerable
pressure. In such thermometers the internal pressure from
the gas may much exceed that arising from the wei ht of the
mercury-column. If there were a chamber at t e top of
the tube similar in size to the thermometer’s bulb, and if this
chamber and its gaseous contents remained at a constant
temperature, the internal pressure contributed by the gas
 would increase very approximately directly as the length of
 the mercury-column. Thus, supposing the tube calibrated
before the introduction of the gas, the experimental deter
 mination of two <U+FB01>xed temperatures and the subdivision of the
 tube into equal volumes would supply, at least theoretically,
 an independent standard thermometer. In practice, however,
 the top chamber is usually of restricted size, and its tempera
 ture tends to rise with that of the thermometer. For both
 reasons the gaseous pressure may become dangerously large
 when the thermometer is recording near the top of its scale.
    In practice it is advisable to regard a gas-<U+FB01>lled thermo—
 meter as deriving its authorit from a direct comparison with
 an ordinary standard. And t e conditions of this comparison
 should a proximate as closely as possible to the circumstances
 under wliich the thermometer is to be used.
    Under ordinary conditions the external pressure-correction
 is of tri<U+FB02>ing importance relative to the internal pressure
 correction. Variations of barometric pressure at sea-level
 may give rise to corrections of a few thousandths of a degree,
 and similar consequences may follow from immersion in a
 water-bath. In a heavy liquid, however, such as mercury,
 a comparatively shallow immersion produces effects which
 cannot be disregarded even for accuracy to O°'Ol C.
    " In the Reichsanstalt’s Wiss. Ablumdl. vol. i. p. 71, there is a
 reference to a supposed in<U+FB02>uence of the small trace of air or vapour in
 ordinary thermometers on the internal pressure.

314           Dr. C. Chree’s Notes on T/zermomet'ly.
   The change of external pressure in balloon ascents or in
mountain-climbing merits some consideration. At 20,000 feet
above the sea, for instance, neglect of this change might lead
to an error of 0°‘l F. in the calculated boiling-point of a
thermometer, and thence to an overestimate of some 50 feet
in the height.
   A more important case arises in the measurement of deep
water temperatures. For this pur ose it is customary to use
a special pattern of “deep-sea ’ thermometer, in which
complete protection from external pressure is aimed at.
Occasionally, however, one meets with instances in which
ordinary unprotected thermometers have been used to take
readings in deep wells. In one case which came under my
notice the consequent error amounted to no less than 15° F.
Analogous results would follow the exposure of an ordinary
thermometer to high gaseous pressures.
                       Emergent Column.
     31. Elementary theory assumes all the glass and mercury
of a thermometer to be at one temperature.         Even in well
stirred baths in physical laboratories this is rather an ideal
 state of matters. In ordinary use there is often an appreciable,
 sometimes a long, mercury—column exposed to a temperature
 differing from that of the bulb. This is especially true of
 thermometers employed to measure the temperature of a
liquid, which is largely in excess of the temperature of the
 surrounding air. In such a case, if a long mercury-column
be emergent, the thermometer, it correct, will read considerably
below the true temperature of the liquid. A direct mathe
matical calculation of the correction, supposing even that all
 the physical data were known, would hardly be feasible,
unless one simpli<U+FB01>ed the problem by making jetsom of many
of the dif<U+FB01>culties. If we suppose the immersed part of the
thermometer unaffected by the existence of the emergent
part, and assume the whole emergent part, glass and mercury,
to be at one temperature, an approximate formula for the
correction is easily obtained.
    Suppose that the liquid reaches to the division t, on the
stem, that t is the temperature read and t’ the temperature
assigned to the emergent column ; and use the notation of §2,
a: being the correction required.         The emergent mercury
would at 0° C. have the volume                        '

   As already stated, e1 is approximately the reciprocal of
the number of degree volumes included in the bulb up to

glass, and in all ordinary kinds of glass it is a little less than
1/6000. Knowing the glass, we should at once know the
correction provided we knew 1’.
   In reality, of course, the emergent column varies in
temperature from base to summit, so that t’ must be regarded
as its mean temperature. To determine t' directly, the
Reichsanstalt employ a “ Faden-thermometer,” placed appar
ently with its very elongated bulb closely adjacent to the
emergent column. Taking the reading of this auxiliary
thermometer for t', and replacing e1 in (27) by 1/6100, they
claim, as already stated, to obtain with thermometers of Jena
glass 59m corrected temperature-readings which are consistent
to 0°‘l C. even up to 500° C. This practice of the Reichs
anstalt seems a development of an idea which originated
with Regnault T.

    of the same type as (27), but have taken for t' the temper
    ature of the room, and determined C for each thermometer
    by special experiment. These experiments have been made
    in two ways :—
       1. The lowering in the boiling-point reading caused by
    increasing the length of mercury-column emergent from
    the hypsometer has been observed for several lengths of
    column '.
       2. The thermometer has been attached to a platinum
   resistance pyrometer, so that the centres of the bulb and
   resistance- coil are at the same level in a well-stirred bath of
   fusible metal. Then two series of simultaneous readings
' have been taken of the two instruments, the immersions in
   the two series being different.               If we assume that the
   difference of emergence has not affected the readings of the
   platinum pyrometer, whose coil is completely immersed in
   both series of experiments, one has obviously the means of
   calculating C.
      The <U+FB01>rst of the above methods enables one to check the
   adequacy of the formula for a series of values of t‘l at a
   speci<U+FB01>ed value of t ; the latter enables one to test it readily
   for a series of values of t. The second method is by no
   means very dif<U+FB01>cult in practice when one is content with
   accuracy of the order O°'l C. in the readings, and some
   promising results have been obtained by means of it.             There
   are several possible pitfalls, however, which want fuller
  investigation.
      When the resistance-coil of a platinum pyrometer is at
   a high temperature, there can hardly fail to be an appreciable
  transfer of heat up the tube, both by air convection currents
  and conduction along the metal leads, tending of course to
  depress the reading of the pyrometer, and conceivably this
  depression may vary sensibly when the length of stem
  immersed above the platinum spiral is altered. Again at
  high temperatures there is sometimes dif<U+FB01>culty in securing a
  suf<U+FB01>ciently slow steady rise of temperature, so that sensible
  error may arise from a difference in the lag of instruments

    The values obtained for C in formula (28) at Kew Ob
servatory have varied from one thermometer to another. A
good deal seems to depend on the <U+FB01>neness of the bore and
the thickness of the enveloping glass. Even with a given
thermometer so much depends on the conditions to which
 its stem is exposed, that corrections, whether from a general
formula or from direct experiment under one de<U+FB01>nite set of
conditions, are of uncertain value. If corrections are to be
deduced from a particular experiment, the conditions ought
to be made as similar as possible to those in which the
thermometer will normally be employed. The nature of the
ventilation over the surface of the hot liquid seems to
have a large in<U+FB02>uence on the temperature of the emergent
column and also, one would suspect, on the height of
the point where the emergent column has its mean tem
perature.

    § 33. Forty years ago, when Mr. John Welsh, F.R.S., was
 Superintendent of Kew Observatory, the accurate pointing
of thermometers at temperatures within 40° or 50° F. of the
normal boiling~point of water presented serious dif<U+FB01>culties to
makers. At the same time thermometers with such a range
as 172° F. to 212° F. were considerably in demand for
estimating heights of mountains &c. by hypsomet-ric obser
vations. It was probably this combination of circumstances
that led Mr. Welsh to initiate the method to which his name
is here attached. The only description of the method
published by Welsh, so far as I know, is a brief note entitled
“ Instructions for the Graduation of Boiling-point Thermo
meters, intended for the Measurement of Heights,” B.A.

    As evidence that Welsh did not con<U+FB01>ne his attention to
 this particular case, I may mention that he supplied at least
 one London optician with data applicable to any length of
  redundant column, and that since his time a considerable
 variety of thermometers of the type have been sent to Kew
 Observatory for veri<U+FB01>cation.
     The method has gradually extended to thermometers
 intended for other than hypsometric purposes. Thus before
 referring further to Welsh’s particular case, it is convenient
 to discuss the general theory.
     §34. In the <U+FB01>nal state suppose that at 0° C. the internal
 volume of the thermometer up to the division 0 (or where
 that division would come if it existed) is V0, while 100 1:0 is
 then the volume between the divisions O and 100. Suppose
 also that the mercury thrown over when measured at 03 C.
 occupied 'r scale-divisions.
    In the preliminary state suppose the thermometer reads
 t+'r+.7v' when the hydrogen temperature is t, then in the
notation of (1) and (2)
       (V0+v0'r)(l +A1t +A212+ . .)=

 where vO/Vo is given by (4).
    Eliminating 120/ V0, and for brevity retaining only constants
 with suf<U+FB01>xes l and 2, we get 011 reduction
where                        E=.’C+tl",      .   .  .    .   .  .

                  .z'='rt(el+€2£)/(l+a1t+a2t2).           .  .   . (30)
    Referring to (8) we see that w is simply the departure at
temperature t of the natural scale of the glass of' the thermo
meter from the hydrogen scale. Thus if we compared the
thermometer in its preliminary state with an ordinary
standard thermometer of the same glass, we should <U+FB01>nd its
reading to exceed that of the standard by T+a:'.
    The excess of reading thus consists of a constant part T
which should equal the number of degree-lengths (measured
at 0° C.) to be thrown over, and of a variable part a." given
by (30).
    The data already laid down as to the magnitudes of the
constants of expansion point to the conclusion that so long
as t and 'r, in the centigrade scale, are less than 100, it will

 where e is the mean value between 0° and 100° of the co

 the thermometer.                                                            '
     Our calculation assumed the thermometer to read correctly
 in its <U+FB01>nal state, and our conclusion shows that in order that
 this may be the case it should in the preliminary state
 read '1' degrees too high in ice, and show an error increasing
 e-r per degree as we pass up the scale. In other words, in
 the preliminary state its scale must he too short for the
 quantit of mercury then present by lOOe'r scale-divisions in
 100; t 0 quantity 100w may be conveniently called the
percentage contraction.
     For the mean coefficient of expansion of mercury between
 0° and lCO° C. Stewart and Gee * give '0001815. What the
 mean coef<U+FB01>cient of expansion for the glass in English thermo
 meters may he is somewhat uncertain, but it is unlikely to
 differ much from the value '000025, given by Stewart and
 Gee (l. c. p. 120) for the mean from nine different kinds
 of glass.
     Taking these values provisionally we have
                                    e='000156 1',

                           100 er: 1' 13.
     The instruction to the optician in this case would thus be:
make the scale 1'13 per cent. too contracted for the quantity
of mercury originally present ; or, more simply, tell him that
the following table of relations applies :—-

     For simplicity it should be noticed that all we have to
consider is the absolute value of er in (31), so long as we
measure .1! and ton the same scale, whether centigrade or
Fahrenheit. In other words the suitable contraction of
scale depends only on the amount of mercury thrown OH.

 100° C. on a centigrade thermometer is equivalent to throwing
 over 100° F. on a Fahrenheit thermometer is one against
 which experience shows me a warning is necessary. The
  contraction of scale required in the former case is of course
  9/5 times that required in the latter.
     Welsh’s <U+FB01>gures, as a matter of fact, differ slightly from
 those given above, in a systematic way; he has 201'87 for
  example in place of 201'89, and 17148 in place of 171'55.
  The cause of this discrepancy was, I suspect, his neglecting
 any expansion in the glass, for his <U+FB01>gures are deducible from
  (31) by taking '000180 as the value of e.    The B.A. <U+FB01>gures
  in fact accord with the rule “contract the scale by l per
  cent. for each 100 degrees (Fahrenheit) of mercury to be
  thrown over,” which I know Welsh to have actually laid
 down.
     § 35. In discussing the theory of Welsh’s method we sup
 posed the surplus mercury to be measured at 0° 0., as this
 shows most simply its relation to what remains. In the
 actual operation it is hardly possible to have mercury and
 glass at 0° 0., and it is usually inconvenient to keep the
 detached column in the tube and measure it at 0° C. before
throwing it off. Welsh’s own idea for boiling-point thermo
 meters was simply to put the thermometers in steam and
 throw off the quantity of mercury required to make them
 give the correct boiling-point reading. Supposing this not
 exactly accomplished, he directed that the error observed at
 212° F. in the <U+FB01>nal state should be regarded as a constant
 zero error, being combined of course with the calibration
 errors detected by the comparison with the standard thermo
 meter in the preliminary state.
    This is certainly satisfactory in short-range thermometers
 such as Welsh had in view. For example, to introduce an
 error varying by O°'01 C. throughout a range of 25° 0. there
 would require to be a mistake of about 212- scale-divisions in
the length of the mercury-column thrown over, and this is at
least ten times as great as is at all likely in the hands of a
competent workman.
    §36. The modern extension of 'Welsh’s method to high
range thermometers is no doubt exposed to greater uncer
tainty. Suppose, for instance, we wish the thermometer in
its <U+FB01>nal state to cover the range 200° C. to 350° C. approxi
mately. In the preliminary state the thermometer may
cover say from 0° U. to 150° C.——the accuracy of the scale
throughout the upper 50° being determined by calibration
with a mercury-column whose value is observed at the lower
part of the scale, where direct comparison with a standard

               Dr. C. Chree’s Notes on Thermomet'ry.          321
 thermometer is possible. The simplest way to break off the
  necessary mercury-column is to heat the bulb with a spirit
 lamp so as to force a long column into the tube. After it is
 broken off and measured it must be run into the top chamber,
 and a second column must be broken off in the same way, so
 as to get the complete quantity, 200 divisions long, that is
 required.
     The possible cumulation of errors of measurement may be
 tri<U+FB02>ing when the operator is skilled: but the very consider
 able heating ot' the bulb and mercury renders it appreciably
 uncertain what is the true length of the mercury-column at
 0° C.
     For de<U+FB01>niteness and generality let us suppose that the
 mercury thrown off <U+FB01>lls 'r stem-divisions when mercury and
 glass are at a temperature of T (on the hydro en scale),
 instead of 'r divisions at 0° as was intended. Then in its
 <U+FB01>nal state the thermometer when at 0° has a volume of
 mercury too great by
                              e,+e2T+...
                      1’07T1+A1T+A2T2+.       .
 Consequently at temperature t the thermometer will read 3/
 degrees higher than a standard of its own glass, where
                   e1+e2T+...        1+AI¢+A2:2+...
 Suppose,   for instance, in the case 7:200, recently selected,
         3/=TT
                1+A1'1‘+A2T*+... 1+a1t+a2t2+.._'
 that T is 100° (1., corresponding to an error of about 1% per
 cent. in the quantity of mercury thrown off.         Using the
 mean values of expansion coef<U+FB01>cients between 0° and 100° C.
 instead of the series—which is quite good enough for our
 present purpose—we get approximately, in degrees centi
 grade
                      y =3'10(l + '000156 t) .
This makes the error vary throughout the entire range of
 150° C. only between 3°20 C. and 3°25 C.
    Accuracy to 0°05 C. is, I suspect, at present a high ideal
in mercury thermometers used above 200° C.         Thus even in
the above case it is doubtful whether we can improve on
Welsh’s direction to treat the difference observed at some
 standard point as a constant zero correction.
    If, however, the observed error rose to 4° or 5° C. we
should certainly expose ourselves to errors of the order 0°'1 C.
if we followed this direction.

322           Dr. C. Chree’s Notes on ’l‘hermometry.
» A direct determination of the error at some one tempera
ture in the <U+FB01>nal state is all the more necessary because the
operation of knocking off the mercury-column, involving
severe heating of the bulb, may leave a slight permanent
e<U+FB02>'ect.
    It is important to notice, in the case of any such high
range thermometer as that just described, that the method
assumes the thermometer to be of the same kind of glass as
the standard with which it was compared in the preliminary
 state, and that the readings of the thermometer in its <U+FB01>nal
 state—corrected for errors of calibration and of volume of
mercury thrown off—are temperatures on the natural scale of
a standard thermometer of this particular kind of glass. The
readings have no direct relationship to the hydrogen or any
 other gas-thermometer scale, and temperatures measured
near the top of the range must possess an uncertain value
 unless the natural scale they relate to has been studied.
    If the high-range thermometer and the standard it is com
 pared with are of different kinds of glass, and still more if
 the thermometer has its bulb of one kind of glass and its stem
 of another, the interpretation of its readings would require
 further consideration.
    §37. As related to Welsh’s method, I would mention an
 ingenious way of obtaining e, the mean coef<U+FB01>cient of expansion
 of mercury in glass between 0° and 100° 0., described on
pp. 102—104 of the Reichsanstalt’s Wiss. Ablzandl. vol. i. It
 consists in observing the fundamental interval in a thermo
 meter’s normal state, and also after a series of threads of
 mercury of different lengths have been detached and run into
 a top chamber. For instance, let f,f1,f2, f3 represent the
 observed fundamental intervals in the original state and after
 detachment of threads of 50, 100, and 150 degrees respec
 tively. Then, a denoting the number of degree volumes in
 the bulb up to the zero mark, we have
       100 e=f/n=f1/(n-50)=fy(n —100)=f3/(n—l50).
 Thence we can deduce e and n- by least squares or otherwise.
 Obviously the method need not be restricted to the range 0°
 to 1000' U.
               Comparison of Thermometric Methods.
    §38. It remains for us to consider brie<U+FB02>y the relative
 defects and advantages of the ordinary British methods of
 thermometry and the more re<U+FB01>ned methods of the Bureau
 International.   In favour of the latter is the strong argument
 that when a verre dur thermometer veri<U+FB01>ed at the Bureau

               Dr. (I. Chree’s Notes on Thermometry.                 323
 International is used in a carefully prescribed way, one can
 deduce the corresponding temperature on the scale of the
 hydrogen thermometer (at least throughout the range — 20° C.
 to 100° C.) to a very high degree of accuracy.          In a physical
 laboratory the probable error may be as small as iO°'OO2 (7.,
 or possibly even i0°"001 C. It may also be urged that the
 reduction of the thermometer readings by means of the tables
 supplied by the Bureau International requires no higher
arithmetical powers than every well educated man should
possess.
    On the other hand, it must be conceded that the existence
of lengthy tables is an evil, however necessary, both on account
of the very appreciable labour their application entails, and
on account of the large increase their calculation makes to
the prime cost of the instrument. The fact that for high
accuracy an ice reading is desirable after every temperature
observation is also a drawback. Very considerable skill is
required when the preceding temperature is high, the risk of
breaking the thermometer being appreciable, and the frequent
preparation of ice is both troublesome and expensive. The
conditions under which it is safe to dispense with an ice
observation and use the Bureau’s table of depressed freezing
points for verre dur, are somewhat uncertain. The use of the
table is presumably satisfactory when the temperature has
been stationary for a long time‘, or has been made to rise
very slowly. But how s ow the rise must be, or what is to
be done when the temperature falls or oscillates, appears by
no means clear. Again, if the thermometer has been at a
temperature approaching 100° (J. one cannot safely plunge it
straight into ice. The time required adequately to immerse
it varies with the skill and audacity of the operator.          Meam
time the thermometer is robably changing its condition,
with a. rapidity which may depend on the time of its exposure
to the high temperature and its previous history.            At really
high temperatures, 150° C. and upwards, increasing dif<U+FB01>culties
can hardlv fail to oppose the successful use of the depressed
zero method, unless the glass employed be extremely little
affected by sudden physical changes.
    In favour of the customary methods of using English glass
thermometers there are certain advantages. The necessity
for an internal pressure correction, as we have seen, is avoided
   4‘ Schuster and Gannon (Phil. Trans. for 1895, p. 429) conclude that
25 hours exposure of a verre dur thermometer to_a temperature of
225° C. was insufficient to produce the full depression of zero.. The
subsequent ice-reading was, t ey think, as much as 0°‘002 0. too high.

324          Dr. C. Ohree’s Notes on 'T/zermomet'ry.
by adopting the vertical as the standard position. The actual
readings of a correctly divided thermometer, after allowance
is made for any secular change of zero, are likely to give at
 ordinary atmospheric temperatures—where nearly all very
 exact absolute measurements are made—results agreeing with
 those of the hydrogen thermometer to within 0°‘l C. To
 those physicists and chemists who are accustomed to record
 temperatures to 0°‘OOl (3., or even O°'0001 0., this may seem
 a paltry claim: but it does not seem so to many scienti<U+FB01>c
 men whose interests extend beyond the temperature of the
 thermometer to that of its surroundings. For many purposes,
 including even some investigations of high scienti<U+FB01>c import
 ance, the measurement of temperatures to 0°‘001 O. is just as
 futile as the use of 10 <U+FB01>gure logarithms in handling data in
 which the fourth signi<U+FB01>cant <U+FB01>gure is uncertain.
    On the other hand, there unquestionably exist physical and
 chemical investigations, tending to increase in number, in
 which the absolute determination of temperatures with the
 highest possible precision is of fundamental importance.    For
 these, in the mean time, English glass thermometers and
 ordinary British methods are not suitable. However good
 the workmanship, and however accurate the calibration, there
 exist the following defects :—
     1. Ice readings corresponding to in<U+FB01>nitely prolonged ex
 posure to 0° C. are not practically obtainable; and ordinary
 ice readings being affected to some extent by the previous
 temperature are not strictly comparable.
     2. So long as changes of 3% inches of mercury in baro
 metric pressure are possible, and occasions arise for the im
 mersion of thermometers in heavy liquids, corrections for
 external pressure cannot always be avoided.
     3. Unless frequently subjected to temperature-cycles of
 considerable range, an ordinary English glass thermometer is
  apt to be in<U+FB02>uenced for days, it maybe weeks, by exposure
  to any temperature much over 120° F.
     4. For accuracy of an order higher than 0°‘1 F. it is
  certainly unsafe to assume the natural scale of an English
  glass thermometer identical with that of the hydrogen or
  nitrogen thermometer, ever. for the restricted range 22° F.
  to 212° F.                                >
     5. Whether through variety in the constitution of the glass
  or differences in its treatment, the natural scales of ordinary
  English glass thermometers do not appear su<U+FB01>iciently ac
  cordant to render practicable the use of any general table of
  reductions to a standard scale of temperature.

     XXXVI. Radiation Phenomena in the .llagnetic Field.
                   By THOMAS Pans'rou, M.A.“'
                          [Plate XXIII.)
 IN March 1897, Dr. P. Zeeman announced in the pages of
     this Magazine the important discovery that the bright
 lines of the spectra become sensibly moditied in appearance
and constitution when the source of light is placed in a
strong magnetic <U+FB01>eld. This effect has often been sought for
both by men who have published the results of their investi
gations as well as by many who have not, but it is only n0w,
thanks to the work of Dr. Zeeman, that the scienti<U+FB01>c world
has become convinced of its existence and nature.
    Considerable dif<U+FB01>culty attends the experimental investiga
tion of this effect owing to its smallness, and it is only when
a very strong magnetic <U+FB01>eld is used in combination with
high dispersion that it can be placed distinctly in evidence.
Its investigation, however, has been greatly assisted by the
present advanced state of electromagnetic theory, which
pointed out what the essential features of the phenomenon
were which should be looked for. Thus, the theor informed
us that each bright line of a line-spectrum shou d be con
verted into a doublet, or a triplet, according as the source of
light is viewed along, or across, the lines of magnetic force,
and further, that each member of a doublet            should be
circularly polarized, whereas each member of a triplet should
be plane polarized, the plane of polarization of the central
line being at right angles to that of the two side lines.
    This information proved of special importance to the
experimental inquiry owing to the fact that a bright spectral
line is not a mathematical line, but, on the contrary, possesses
a <U+FB01>nite width, so that in order to observe the triplet effect
the resolution must be great enough to separate the lateral
components from each ot er by a distance greater than the
width of the spectral line in question.     For resolutions less
than this the central member of the triplet overlaps the
lateral components, and the effect presented to the eye is

what appears to be merely a broadening of the bright line by
the magnetic <U+FB01>eld. Once we know, however, that the
central line is polarized in a plane at right angles to that of
the two side lines we can, by suitably interposing a Nicol’s
prism, obliterate the central constituent and leave the two
side lines of the triplet unextinguished. The overlappin is
thus removed and the triplet constitution, as distinguisied
from a mere broadening, of the affected line becomes to
some extent revealed even though the magnetic <U+FB01>eld has not
been strong enough to completely separate the constituents
of the triplet from each other.
    It is much more satisfactory, however, to push the resolu
tion to such a point that each member of the triplet stands
revealed and isolated from the others, so that their general
character may be studied separately. In fact, until this has
been effected, we cannot assert that a line can be resolved
into three others by the magnetic <U+FB01>eld. The observations
mentioned above with the nicol are consistent with tripling,
but they do not absolutely prove it. With the object of
doing this, if possible, and also with the ulterior object of
making a general survey of the spectra of various substances,
in order to determine if the spectra of different substances
were equally or similarly affected, or if the various spectral
lines of a single substance were equally or differently affected,
I gladly availed myself of the opportunity a<U+FB02>'orded me of
using the excellent Rowland’s concave grating mounted in
the physical laboratory of the Royal University of Ireland*.
This instrument is of the usual type, having a radius of
21'5 ft., and ruled with about 14,438 lines to the inch. It is
<U+FB01>tted with a camera-box, which takes a photographic plate
50 cm. long and 6 cm. broad, so that a length of the spectrum
 equal to half a metre approximately can be photographed at
a single exposure.
    As a consequence, I naturally decided to study the
phenomena by means of photography as well as by e e
observation, for the latter, besides being applicable in t e
visible portion of the spectrum alone, lends itself somewhat
to the personal bias of the observer in the case of small and
doubtful effects. The photographic plate, on the other hand,
gives a faithful record of the phenomena as they actually
exist in the image focussed upon it, and this record can be
examined at leisure.       Moreover, as a considerable length of
the spectrum can be photographed at a single exposure, the

e<U+FB01>'ects produced on many lines, under exactly the same cir
cumstances, can be compared with precision. Still it is to
be remembered that the photographic plate is not capable of
reproducing detail beyond a certain order of fineness, and,
further, that the negative is of the nature of an integral and
reproduces the sum total of all the effects produced on it
during the time of exposure. For this reason, if the image
.varies, owing to variations going on in the source of light,
or elsewhere, during the time of exposure, the photographic
negative will be the muddled integral of these various images,
and may not in the end be similar to any one of the various
images which produced it. For this reason, the examination
 of the visible portion of the spectrum by means of the eye
cannot be dispensed with, as will appear from what follows.
   In the case of a phenomenon which exhibits itself as a
very small effect, and one which it is dif<U+FB01>cult to oblain and
 observe, it is natural that some doubt should exist at <U+FB01>rst as
to what it is that actually is presented to the observer, and
 that discrepancies should occur in the statements of different
 observers regarding the phenomenon now under consideration
is not surprising. Thus, while Dr. Zeeman distinctly states
that he obtained a tripling of the spectral lines when the
source of light is viewed across the lines of magnetic force,
and a doubling when it is viewed along the lines of force;
 yet these eifects were obtained only after the theory of the
 phenomena pointed in this direction. and other reliable
 observers investigating the same lines have given expression
 to the opinion that when viewed across the lines of force a
 doubling (like a reversal) or a broadening combined with a
 doubling occurred.      So far as I am aware, all these observers
 have failed to obtain distinct triplets when the light is
 viewed across the lines of force, that is, they have not
 succeeded in separating the constituents suf<U+FB01>ciently to enable
 them to decide what the exact composition of the modi<U+FB01>ed
 spectral line is. By placing a Nicol’s prism in the path of
 the light it has been determined that the central part of the
 modi<U+FB01>ed line is plane polarized, and that the edges are also
 plane polarized, but in a plane at right angles to the plane
 of polarization of the middle part.        Thus with the nicol in
 one position the middle may be cut out, leaving the two
 border lines, and with the nicol turned through a right an lo
 the two border lines may be removed, leaving the mid le
 portion alone. It is to be remarked, however, that observa
 tions of this nature, although they are in accordance with
 the supposition that the modi<U+FB01>ed line is a triplet, yet they
 do not absolutely prove tripling pure and simple. For this

 328        Mr. T. Preston on Radiation Phenomena
 purpose it is necessary to obtain high resolving power and a
 magnetic <U+FB01>eld strong enough to separate completely the
 constituent parts of the modi<U+FB01>ed line, so that each can be
 observed separately, without the complications attending the
 overlapping of the others.
    With the ordinary U-shaped electromagnet at my disposal
 I had considerable dif<U+FB01>culty at <U+FB01>rst in obtaining any effect
 whatsoever, even a broadening of the spectral lines. How
 ever, by pushing the pole-pieces very close together and
 working with a very short spark as the source of light, I
 was able to obtain not only a distinct broadening but ulti
 mately a complete separation of the constituents of the
 affected line—in the case of certain lines—so that the photo
 graphic negative showed them as distinct triplets with each
 component sharp and clear when viewed through any ordinary
 hand magnifying-glass.       Finally, with a more powerful
 magnet of the same U-shaped type, kindly lent to me by
 the Rt. Rev. Monsignor Molloy, I was able to obtain photo
 graphs which showed triplets visible to the naked eye without
 any magni<U+FB01>cation whatever.
   With this apparatus I have made a general survey of the
spectra of various substances, from the lowest visible to the
highest ultra-violet, and the various effects which I have so
far observed I shall now brie<U+FB02>y describe.
                General Types of Efect observed.
   If we take the case of a single substance, say cadmium or
zinc, the most casual observation is sufficient to show that the
effect produced varies considerably for the different spectral
lines; for while some lines are clearly separated into distinct
triplets, others are not so resolved, but show on the photo
graphic plate as “ quartets ” or “ doublets,” the source being
viewed across the lines of force, 2'. e. while some lines show as
sharp triplets, others (if we wish to express it so) show as
triplets in which the middle line is replaced by two fainter
lines, while others appear to have lost the middle line
completely. Further, some lines on the same plate, that is,
photographed under exactly the same condltions, show only a
very small broadening; but in no case have I found a line
which could with certainty be said to be absolutely unaffected
by the magnetic <U+FB01>eld.
   Thus, while some lines are largely affected, others (and
these may be of not very different wave-length) are scarcely
affected at all. With a stronger magnetic <U+FB01>eld, however, I
hope to resolve these latter, and so obtain the data necessary
to a full comparison of the effects produced on all the spectral

                      in the .lfagnelic Field.               329
lines, and so be able to attack the problem of throwing the
lines into groups and series, periodic or otherwise, subject to
some general law. Although the photographs which I have
already obtained throw out some hints as to the direction in
which such a law is to be looked for, yet nothing can be su<U+FB01>i
ciently decided till a careful survey has been made and every
line resolved and measured.
   The Plate accompanying this paper (Pl. XXIII.) has been
reproduced from a portion of a negative showing the lines of
cadmium and zinc taken simultaneously. For this purpose an
electric spark from an induction-coil was passed between two
electrodes, one of cadmium and one of zinc, so that the lines of
the two metals as affected by the magnetic <U+FB01>eld were photo
graphed under precisely the same conditions. The lines shown
are the blue (4800) and the violet (4678) lines of cadmium
together with the adjacent lines (4811, 4722, and 4680) of
zinc. The Plate shows the various lines una<U+FB01>'ected, that is,
when the magnet is unexcitcd, as well as the effects produced
by the magnetic <U+FB01>eld. The bottom row AA shows all the lines
converted into doublets when the source of light is viewed
along the lines of force. The next row BB shows the lines
una<U+FB02>'ected, i. e. with no magnetic <U+FB01>eld.
   The next row CC shows the appearance presented when
the source is viewed across the lines of force, and it may
be here observed that while the line 4678 of cadmium and
the adjacent line 4680 of zinc are both converted into
triplets, the line 4722 of zinc and the celebrated blue cadmium
line 4800 are not so resolved (in appearance), but show as a
species of quartets in which most of the light is concentrated
in the side lines. Finally, the line 4811 of zinc shows as
nothing very de<U+FB01>nite, but may in this picture be described as
a hazy doublet. It is to be remarked, however, that many
lines show as perfectly distinct doublets when viewed across
the lines of force, doublets which are scarcely rendered any
clearer by the interposition of a nicol.
   The two rows at the top of the plate show the polarization
of the affected lines. In these a nicol has been inserted in the
path of the beam of light.      In the to     row EE the nice] is
placed with its principal plane aralle to the lines of force,
and in the other row DD wit its principal plane at right
angles to the lines of force.       The polarization of the con
stituents is thus shown to be complete and in two rectangular
planes.
   The foregoing are the appearances presented on the photo
gra hic plate.     In addition to these there are two other
modi<U+FB01>cations depending on a <U+FB01>neness of detail not as yet

 330         Mr. T. Preston on Radiation Phenomena
 recorded on the photographic plate, but which presents itself
 with great distinctness to the naked eye when the lines are
 viewed through a well-focussed eyepiece. One of these
 modi<U+FB01>cations occurs in the case of lines which photograph
 as doublets when the source of light is viewed across the lines
 of force, and may be described by saying that the affected
 line is a modi<U+FB01>ed triplet in which the central line is absent,
 and in which at the same time each of the side lines is
 reversed. Thus the appearance presented to the eye is that
 of two pairs of lines rather than a doublet or triplet. The
 other modi<U+FB01>cation of note is that in which each constituent of
 the triplet shows as a pair of lines, or, in other words, the
 whole appears not as a. triplet, but as a sextet of fine equally
 spaced well-marked and sharp lines.
    All the modi<U+FB01>cations so far observed, when the source of
light is viewed across the lines of force, are illustrated by the
accompanying woodcut. Thus in <U+FB01>g. 1 we have the normal
triplet, such as is presented by the violet line of cadmium 4678
and the vast majority of other lines. Then we have in <U+FB01>g. 2
the weak middled “'quartet ” in which nearly all the light is
concentrated in the two side lines. Next we have in <U+FB01>g. 3
the doublet in which the central line has completely disappeared.
Next in <U+FB01>g. 4 we have the double doublet, 0r two pairs of <U+FB01>ne
lines, and <U+FB01>nally in <U+FB01>g. 5 the sextet or three pairs of equally
spaced sharp lines.
                        The Sodium Lines.
   It is interesting to remark that the two D-lines of sodium
do not belong to the class which show as triplets in the mag
netic <U+FB01>eld. Owing to the ease with which these lines reverse
and to the constant variations going on in the vapour-density
in the spark obtained from a solution of the salt, it is not easy
to obtain the sodium lines in a steady state for any length of
time. But when the sodium saltis contained in small quantity
in the solution the lines may be obtained sharp and fairly
steady. Under these circumstances one of the sodium lines
D2 shows as a sextet (<U+FB01>g. 5) of fine sharp equally-spaced lines

                           in the lllagnetic Field.                        331
of which the two border-lines are somewhat nebulous on their
outside edges. The other line D] is of the double doublet
type (<U+FB01>g. 4), and shows as two pairs of sharp lines. It is thus
seen that the sodium lines and the blue cadmium line 4800 do
not show as normal triplets ; and it is probably for this reason
that different observers have differed in their accounts as to
the effects observed in the case of these lines". Di<U+FB02>iculties
no doubt encumber the observation of the true effect in the
case of the sodium lines by reason of the ease with which they
become reversed. If the sodium salt is present in any consi
derable quantity, there is constant sputtering and reversal
of the lines which completely masks the true e<U+FB02>'ect.
              Erplanution of the Various Appearances.
     All the modi<U+FB01>cations of the normal triplet described above
may be sufficiently accounted for by the supposition that
reversal, or more or less complete absorption, takes place in
the case of one or more of the constituents of the triplet.
Thus, if the middle line of the triplet (1) becomes reversed,
2'. e. has its middle absorbed, we are furnished with the weak
middled quartet             ;, and if the middle line becomes com
pletely absorbed in the layers of colder vapour surrounding
the spark, then we have the doublet (3). While if, in
addition, the side lines of (3) become reversed, we have the
double doublet (4) ; and,<U+FB01>nally, if each line of the triplet 1)
becomes reversed, we have the sextet (5).
     Although the hypothesis of reversal or absorption accounts
easily for the number of the constituents in the modi<U+FB01>ed lines,
yet it must be remarked that the appearance of these modi<U+FB01>
cations is not that which is usually associated with reversal.
The constituents are not sharp on one side and nebulous on
the other, but are sharp and well de<U+FB01>ned on both sides ; nor
do the original lines when unaffected by the magnetic <U+FB01>eld,
that is when photographed in the free <U+FB01>eld, show any sign of
reversal. For this reason, in order to test this matter, I have
spent much time in taking photographs under various con
ditions
spark, but       so farto without
           in regard                   exposure

                                           conclusive       result. Onithe'  in
whole, however, the weight of evidence lends itself to the
supposition that all these variations of the normal triplet type
are produced by absorption in the vapour of the spark.
     An interesting point to be remembered in this connexion
is that the spectral lines may be more or less complex in their

  332         Mr. T. Preston on Radiation Phenomena
  own constitution, and an important investigation bearing on
  this subject has already been made by Prof. A. A. Michelson *,
  who has shown that the D-lines of sodium and the green and
  blue lines of cadmium (with others) are really complex in
  constitution. Now these lines are amongst those which show
  deviations from the normal triplet type, and it is consequently
  of importance to determine if this complexity of structure
  gives rise to the deviations from the normal triplet, or if, on
  the other hand, the deviations as well as the complexity of
  structure observed by Michelson are due to a common cause,
  namely intermittent reversal.        For example, if a bright line is
  not simple but really a close doublet, then in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld
 each member of this doublet will give rise to a corresponding
 triplet. These triplets, however, will overlap and appear as
 one triplet in the <U+FB01>eld of view. Yet it is possible to conceive
 a state of affairs such that, by the action of the magnetic <U+FB01>eld,
 one or more of the members of one triplet shall be opposite in
 plhase to the corresponding member of the other triplet.
    nder such circumstances the overlapping lines will “ inter
 fere ” and produce doublets. Thus if the central lines alone
 are opposite in phase they will obliterate each other where
 they overlap, and the weak-middled quartet will be produced
 as in the case of the blue cadmium line, and so on.
    It is to be remembered, however, that the conditions in the
magnetic <U+FB01>eld are not the same as in the free <U+FB01>eld, for in the
 former the spark is violently blown about, and this may lead
to a sharpness on both sides of the reversed lines not obtain
 able in the free <U+FB01>eld, and thus account for the fact that the
 modi<U+FB01>cations described above do not look like ordinary
 reversals.                          ,      .
    Viewed from the theoretical standpoint, however, we have
no reason to demand that all, or indeed necessarily any, of
the spectral lines should be resolved into sharp triplets when
the source of light is viewed across the lines of magnetic force.
For, in order that a spectral line should exhibit itself as a
characteristic triplet under the in<U+FB02>uence of the magnetic <U+FB01>eld,
it is necessary that the freedom of vibration should be equal
in all directions, and in this case the intensity of each rect
angular component will be the same. Hence the middle line
of the triplet will contain as much light as the two side lines
taken together. If, however, the vibrations are not equally
free in all directions the foregoing result will not hold, and it
becomes possible to have a triplet with a weakmiddle line or

  without a middle line, in which case it shows as a doublet.
  For example, if the vibration is restricted to one plane, and
 if this plane sets itself at right angles to the lines of magnetic
  force under the in<U+FB02>uence of the magnetic <U+FB01>eld, then the
 component of the vibration in the direction of the lines of
 force will be zero, and the middle line will vanish from the
 triplet. If, on the other hand, the complete vibration should
 set itself parallel to the lines of force, then the side lines of
 the triplet would vanish, or, in other words, the spectral line
 would be unaffected by the magnetic <U+FB01>eld. It is clear, there
 fore, that the study of the way in which the spectral lines are
affected by the magnetic <U+FB01>eld is likely to throw light on the
character of the molecular vibrations,
                     The .llagnetic Substances.
    The substances which one would expect to resent peculiari
ties in this way are iron and nickel, which, ift ey retain any of
their magnetic properties at the high temperature of the spark
produced between the terminals of an induction-coil, should
exhibit some characteristic behaviour in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld.
I was led to expect, indeed, that many, if not all, of' the iron
lines would be resolved into doublets rather than triplets when
the spark is viewed across the <U+FB01>eld.     I found it no easy matter,
however, with the magnetic <U+FB01>eld at my disposal to resolve the
iron lines into anything : in the <U+FB01>rst place because the effect
is much smaller (about one-half) for iron than for the
4678 line of cadmium or zinc ; and in the second place,
because it is not possible to work with the pole-pieces of' the
magnet so close together when the spark is passed from a
solution of a salt as when it is passed between small metal
electrodes. But in the case of a highly-magnetic substance
like iron, the metal becomes almost unmanageable in a. power
ful magnetic <U+FB01>eld, and so it happened that in my <U+FB01>rst attempts
I was not successful in resolving the iron lines into either
doublets or triplets; yet, even at this stage, I observed two or
three lines converted into what I considered doublets. Finally,
I succeeded in resolving the vast majority of the lines of iron
by enclosing pieces of iron wire in small glass tubes, so that
the ends of the wire protruded slightly from the glass where
the spark occurred. The pole-pieces were then pushed up to
touch the glass jackets, and the spark was thus obtained in a
very strong <U+FB01>eld, in fact in a <U+FB01>eld strong enough to resolve
the majority of the iron lines into distinct triplets, showing
that these vibrations possess freedom in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld
(at the temperature of the spark); but, in addition to this,

other lines are observed as distinct doublets, and the appear
ance of these doublets is not that usually associated with a
reversal. In addition there are other lines in the spectrum
of iron which are scarcely affected, if at all, by the <U+FB01>eld at my
disposal.
    Similar remarks apply to the magnetic metal nickel, but it
is not to be understood that these occasional doublets are in
any way characteristic of the magnetic metals, for they occur
with considerable frequency in the spectra of many other
substances*, such for example as barium, platinum, rhodium,
&c., &c.
                                Gases.
   The investigation of the spectra of gases in the magnetic
<U+FB01>eld is a department of this inquiry which would naturally
be looked forward to with considerable interest, and it is per
haps disappointing to have to record that, so far, I have not
been able to detect any sensational behaviour on their part in
the magnetic <U+FB01>eld.
   Observations were made on the spectra of gases under small
pressure contained in “vacuum ” tubes. The tubes which
  had at my disposal, however, showed no lines bright enough
for observation except the hydrogen lines, and these were
bright and sharp when the magnet was unexcited. When the
magnet was excited, however, they became faint and nebulous,
showing a scattering of the light and broadening such as
might be produced by increase of pressure, both to the eye
and on the photographic plate. In addition, the necessity for
placing the vacuum-tube between the pole-pieces reduced the
strength of the magnetic <U+FB01>eld, and whether from this or other
causes I was unable to observe triplication pure and simple of
the lines in any case.
   When the electric spark is passed between electrodes in
air, the air lines were photographed as well as the lines
characteristic of the electrodes, and in all cases attention was
paid to the effect produced on the air lines as well as those of the
metals. In every case the air lines showed distinct broadening,
but in no case were they resolved into triplets. This resolu
tion indeed could hardly be expected except in a very powerful
<U+FB01>eld, owing to the considerable width and nebulous character
of the air lines. Nevertheless, by placing a nicol in the path
of the light so as to remove the central member of the triplet,

                      in the Magnetic Field.                       335
distinct doublets have been obtained on the photographic plate,
showing that the gases are subject to the in<U+FB02>uence of the
magnetic <U+FB01>eld, but in no exceptionally marked degree. The
photographs which I have already taken, indeed, show a re
solution of the violet air lines which is only about two-thirds
that produced on the violet lines of zinc and cadmium.
   The study of these substances has consequently been post
poned till a stronger magnetic <U+FB01>eld is obtained, which I trust
to have soon at my disposal.
                          Measurements.
   Although from time to time measurements have been made
on various photographic plates, in order to compare the effects
produced on different lines and ditt'ereut substances, yet, so
far, no systematic attempt has been made at exact quantita
tive determination, for it did not ap ear possible to turn such
work to good account until the reso ution of all the lines had

resolution (which it is hoped may be soon obtained) has been

   In the meantime, however, the following numbers will show
the general trend of the effect in the case of a few conspicuous
lines.  The strength of the magnetic <U+FB01>eld was not accurately
determined, and indeed was of little importance for our present
purpose, but it may be taken at something over 20,000 C.G.S.

corresponds to 2'6 ngstrtim-units.

     These numbers, although they possess only a rough accur
 racy, are yet suf<U+FB01>cient to show that for both these metals the
 effect at <U+FB01>rst increases as the wave-length diminishes, and, in
a parallel manner, after rising to a maximum, gradually
diminishes. The measurements were made on a photograph
taken from a spark passing between a cadmium electrode and
a zinc electrode, so that the lines of both substances were
taken under exactly the same circumstances. They there
fore represent the effects produced on these two substances
by the same magnetic <U+FB01>eld.
     Other substances were studied in the same way with one
electrode of cadmium or zinc, so that the effects produced by
the same <U+FB01>eld could be compared.                 '
    For example, in the case of tin and zinc (one electrode of
each), when the violet line of zinc 4680 showed a widening
of 42, in the units used above, the tin lines 4525 and 3801
showed widenings amounting to 21 and 13 respectively.
Thus the resolution for tin is about half as much * as for zinc
or cadmium.
     Similar results apply to other metals.             For example,
measurements made on the spectrum of platinum gave a
separation ranging from 30 downwards.                  The magnetic
metals iron and nickel gave separations varying from 18
downwards, and rhodium gave similar results.
    Many other substances have been examined, but no further
novelty is exhibited by them. The above are mentioned
merely as typical elements. For splendour and variety of
effect throughout the whole range of the spectrum, the sub
stances calcium and barium are noteworthy.
    These results do not point to any parallel between the
magnetic effect and the pressure-e<U+FB01>'ect investigated by Messrs.
Humphreys T and Mohler.
     It has not been considered necessary to refer to the theo—
retical explanation of this magnetic in<U+FB02>uence on the spectral
lines, as Dr. J. Larmori has already furnished a completely
satisfactory explanation of the typical phenomena on the basis
   * [Dr. Zeeman obtains an e<U+FB01>ect for the tin line 4585 which is much
greater than the greatest obtained for either zinc or cadmium, but this
must be either a. misprint or a mistake. The line 4525 gives a well
marked sha triplet, and lends itself to accurate measurement, but the
line 4585 is i<U+FB01>'use on both sides and merely becomes more diffuse when
subjected to the magnetic <U+FB01>eld. Hence, although considerably broadened,
it does not lend itself to measurement, even when a nicol is interposed.
This diffusive broadening occurs inmany other cases where the lines
have the character of air lines—Cf. Zeeman, Phil. Mag, Feb. 1898.]

 of the electromagnetic theory. Indeed all the main facts
 were su<U+FB01>iciently accounted for by Dr. Zeeman ' as deductions
 from the theory of Lorenz. The foregoing measurements,
 however, when taken into consideration with the formula
 deduced theoretically throw important light on the quantities
 involved in the theoretical calculation. Thus if T be the
 periodic time corresponding to any spectral line, and if 81‘ be
 the difference in period between the side lines of a triplet
 produced by a magnetic <U+FB01>eld of strength H, then the formula
yielded by theory is, in electromagnetic units,

 where e is the ionic charge and m the inertia.          Expressed in
 terms of the wave-length this becomes
                             87x _ e     H
                             X.“ _ 1n ' :R)’
 where v is the velocity of light.
     Now the foregoing measurements show that 8% does not
 vary as 79, nor apparently according to any simple law, so
 that at present the ratio of e to m has to be determined as a.
function of 7t for each substance, and accordingly we must
write
                                ,1 =fe>,
where the form of the function remains to be determined.
     It is possible, however, that the lines of any one substance
may be thrown into groups for each of which 87x varies as
7t”, and each of these groups might be produced by the motion
of a single ion. The number of such groups in a given
spectrum would then determine the number of different kinds
of ions in the atom or molecule.
     Homologous relations may also exist between the groups
in different spectra, but all this still remains for complete
investigation.

of a strong magnetic <U+FB01>eld on the spectrum of a source of light

Considering the unstable character of the sodium lines, I am
strongly of opinion that M. Fievez was dealing with the real
magnetic widening, and that he obtained the effect on a toler
ably large scale. The effects, indeed, as described by him,
are quite true to nature when special precautions are not
taken against reversals. The real point of importance is the
broadening always observed. No doubt if he had known
the theory the whole question would have been settled in
1885 :—

   XXXVI]. Determination of the Frequency of Alternating
          Currents. By CARL KINSLEY, 111.15., A.M.‘
IN using alternating currents experimentally it is necessary
      to know their periodicity. The most simple and direct
methods of measuring self-induction, mutual induction, and
capacity require this determination.         While working on
another subject I found that this could be done with great
accuracy by means of a vibrating air-column. If a telep one
receiver is used on an alternating current circuit, it will
  've a musical note whose fundamental—<U+FB01>rst harmonic—
will have the same number of vibrations that the alternating
current has periods. When the telephone is placed in front
of a tube of the ri ht length this note will be reinforced. If
we can compute the velocity of sound in the air in the tube
and can determine the wave-length of the sound, the number
of vibrations or periods per second follows immediately;
                             n: T
where       n=number of periods,
            7t=the wave-length of the note,
          V,=the velocity of the sound.
   Thus experimentally it is necessary to determine merely
the length of the tube for the condition of maximum reson
ance.
   The receiver should be a powerful one and placed at least
'41 diam. from the tube. The tube should be of uniform
diameter and the piston <U+FB01>t easily; then all the adjustments
can be made by hand.

    In most alternating current work it has been

    This is substantially true under normal working
conditions, and may be assumed for alternating
current computations.
    The actual curve, however, may be strictly con
sidered as the resultant of many pure sine-curves
whose periods are multiples of the <U+FB01>rst harmonic:

purpose it is suflicient to state that in the many cases examined
all of the harmonics are found. This holds up to a periodicity
of .1200 per sec., which is in some cases the 36th harmonic.
It is therefore plain that any or all of the overtones may be
used in the determination of the period of the fundamental.
The relation between the self-induction and capacity of the
circuit sometimes gives particularprominence to one of the
overtones, which may be either an odd or an even harmonic.
   This note ma then be used most advantageously during
the progress of tlie experiments with the alternating currents.
The period of the note can be easily gotten from the
accompanying tables.

   Open tubes act as though they were 0'41 d * longer than
their real length.
   Then the <U+FB01>rst length of the tube giving maximum resonance
will be             1=P_0-41 d=i7\—0'41 d,

                   7t=wave-length of the sound.
   Table II. is computed for the diameter of tube of 4 cm.
and so the correction to be added to l will not be constant.
   Add the correction gotten from Table I. to the observed
value of l, and in the column for the temperature of the tube
<U+FB01>nd the frequency corresponding to the length. Divide
this periodicity by the number of the harmonic, and the
periodicity of the fundamental will be the result.
   The frequency of the fundamental will be the greatest
common divisor of the frequencies of successive harmonics.
Having gotten by trial the number of the harmonic most
advantageous to use, that harmonic alone may hereafter be
used.

   By inspection No. (l) is found to be the sixth harmonic,
and No. (2) the seventh. The fundamental which is the
highest common divisor is then 60'0.

 346          Mr. C. Kinsley on the Determination of
and the constants assumed are
          <U+FB01>=% saturation for the different temperatures,
            =760 mm. of mercury,
          d=4 cm. in Table II.
     Since (1 is assumed to be 4 cm. in Table II. the quantity
to be added to 1 will be 0'41 d=l'61 for every note when a
tube of that diameter is used.
     For other tubes the correction will vary for different l's
 due to the changing V0 for the different tubes. Table I.
 gives this correction for all tubes apt to be used.
     The error in reading l is very small and need be only a
 fraction of a millimetre in any case.
    The greatest possible error due to the assumption of
1]; saturation will be, at 20° 0., only + { per cent. when p is
 100 per cent. of saturation and -—£ per cent. for zero vapour
in the air.
     Consequently for engineering measurements the error will
 be less than that due to other instruments, and so may be
 neglected. The adjustment for maximum resonance can be
 made with greater rapidity than that with which a Siemens
 dynamometer or a Thomson balance can be used. This makes
 it possible to use an ordinary alternating current circuit for
 accurate experimental work.
    The tube that will be found most durable, uniform, and
convenient will be a drawn brass tube 4 cm. in diameter.
    The writer has very carefully compared glass and drawn
brass tubes, and <U+FB01>nds that y is the same for each. He has
also measured the velocities of sound using a chronograph to
determine n, and <U+FB01>nds that the value for a already given can
be used without sensible error.
    The uniform internal diameter of the brass tube makes it
much more convenient for use, as a dry piston can be employed.
    The natural period of the diaphragm in every telephone on
the market is too high to affect in any sensible way the
harmonics due to the alternating current.
    A number of other methods have been proposed* that
depend on the resonance of iron wire or strips set into
vibration by the alternating current.
    Besides the impossibility of making, with either, really
accurate adjustments for maximum resonance—which is
independent of the accuracy of the gearing—it is necessary
to standardize the instrument,           and that will be found
impossible to do with accuracy except in a very well-equipped
laboratory.

               the Frequency of Alternating Currents.       347
         Method for Determining the Velocity of Sound.
   The velocit of sound in air has been determined by many
observers hot in the free air and in air con<U+FB01>ned in tubes.
The early experimenters *, of whom Moll, Von Beck, and
Kuytenbrouwer in 1823 did exceptionally careful work, used
composite sounds in free air. It was suggested by Le Roux 1',
that the temperature measurements were incorrect. This
view is supported by the observations of Nansen, who found
that the temperatures gotten on the surface were at variance
with that taken in his “ crow's nest.” Therefore, the tem
perature measurements of Parry and Foster}: certainly did
not give the true temperature of the path of the sound. In
1868 M. V. Regnault§ reported measurements taken both
in free air and in tubes which cast so much doubt on the
earlier measurements that the whole subject was reopened.
   Since then, H. Scheebli H and Dr. Low 1, using pure
notes, have found, from the positions of maxima in resonating
tubes, the wave-length of sound. Dr. Low’s relative results
are particularly good; but his method of standardizing his
tuning-forks and of determining the vapour-pressure of the
air in the tubes is unfortunately not above criticism. His
values for a and y must, however, be very nearly correct and
so they were used in the preceding tables.
   The writer would suggest that the use of a telephone as
the sounding-body with the periodicity determined directly
from the motor generator by means of a chronograph would
be a most satisfactory method of producing the notes desired.

          XXXVIII. Radiation in a .Maynetic Field.
                     By A. A. MICHELSON *.
FURTHER analysis of the radiations emitted in a magnetic
       <U+FB01>eld shows that the phenomenon is much more complex
than was supposed. An examination of the separate com
ponents of the “triplet” brings out the fact that in general
these are multiple lines.
   The laws may be summarized as follows :—
                                A.
   1. All spectral lines are tripled when the radiations emanate
in a magnetic <U+FB01>eld.
   2. The separation is proportional to the strength of <U+FB01>eld
and is approximately the same for all colours and for all
substances.
   3. Viewed in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic <U+FB01>eld,
the outer lines are polarized parallel to the <U+FB01>eld, and the
central line is polarized at right angles with the <U+FB01>eld.
   4. Viewed in a direction parallel with the magnetic <U+FB01>eld,
the central line vanishes, while the outer ones are circularly
polarized; the shorter waves in the direction of the magne
tizing current, the longer waves in the opposite sense.
   To these laws (which were veri<U+FB01>ed by the examination of a
dozen or more lines) the following must now be added :—
                                B.
   1. The “ middle line ” is a symmetrical triple, the distance
between the components being one-fourth that of the “ outer
lines,” and hence also proportional to the strength of field.
   2. The relative intensity of the components varies for dif
ferent substances and for different lines of the same substance ,
and accordingly the group may appear as a single line or a
double or a triple.
   3. The “ outer lines” are unsymmetrical, but are sym
metrically placed with respect to the “middle line.” The
distance between the components is usually one-fourth that
between the “ outer lines,” but is in some cases one-sixth.
   4. The intensity of the components varies for different
spectral lines, and these variations (in not always correspond
to those of the “ central line.” The outer groups may accor
dingly appear as single or double or triple or multiple lines.

350                Prof. A. A. Michelson on
employed in the investigation. S is the source of light, either
a small hand-blowpipe with a bead of the substance to be
examined in the <U+FB02>ame, or a vacuum-tube, which is usually
placed in a metal box (for heating) of such form as to permit
a close approach of the pole-pieces P of an electromagnet.
One of these is bored out to permit examination of the axial
ray. The light from S undergoes a preliminary analysis by
the spectroscopic train (two bisulphide prisms), the radiation
to be investigated being isolated by the slit .9. It then enters
the interferometer, one of the mirrors of which, M, is move
able on ways so accurately ground that no readjustment is
necessary in any part of its path ; that is, the mirror remains
s0 nearly parallel with itself that the interference-fringes
 (concentric circles) are always as clear as possible. The
emergent beam then passes through the analyser N to the
observing telescope.
    The clearness or “ visibility ” of the interference-fringes is
estimated at positions of the mirror M corresponding to in
crements of the difference of path of l, 2, or 5 mm. according
to the nature of the curve. This, it must be admitted, leaves
much to be desired in the way of precision, and in some cases
there may be corrections of as much as 20 per cent., to reduce
the observations to the value they should have, namely,
where 11 is the maximum intensity and I2 the minimum
for adjacent fringes. Doubtless much more accurate readings
could be obtained by the use of a double quartz lens* for
comparison; but the process is so much more tedious and
troublesome that the form of the curve is liable to alter on
account of changes in the source during the observations.
The case is somewhat analogous to making eye-estimates of
stellar magnitudes, which are but little inferior to photometric
determinations and much less troublesome. In any case it is
always easy to distinguish ascending and descending slopes,
and maxima and minima can be located with very great
accuracy, and this is usually quite suf<U+FB01>cient to permit a fairly
accurate deduction of the distribution of light in the spectrum.
 It has been shown 1' that with the de<U+FB01>nition of visibility just
given, if y=¢(w) is the intensity-curve of the spectrum,

  so that if C and S are both known, ¢(.z') can be determined.
  In general this is not the case unless another relation between
  C and S is given.      Such a relation is furnished by the “phase
  curve,” which gives the displacement of the fringes from the
  position they would have occupied had the source been homo
  geneous. If 8 is this displacement and 0:21r8/7t, then
                   C=V cos 9        and    S=V sin 0.
     In general the 0 curve is troublesome to obtain, on account
 of the dif<U+FB01>culty in securing a suf<U+FB01>ciently homogeneous com
   arison source ; but in the present instance this is furnished
   y the non-magnetized radiations *.
     Usually, h0wever, the assumption was made that the spec
 trum was symmetrical, and in only a few cases was the
 solution veri<U+FB01>ed by the complete analysis. In this simpler
 form we have 0:0, 8:0, and                   whence
                       ¢(.r) = “ Vcos ka: d/c.

    This integral may frequently be calculated when V can be
 expressed in simple analytical form as a function of k. In
 general this is not the case, and it was for the solution of
such problems that the harmonic analyser“? was devised.
The curve V=f(lc) is “fed” to the machine, which then
draws the curve y=¢(.z'), the whole operation taking but a
few minutes.
    It was found on completin the analysis of some <U+FB01>ft or
more visibility-curves, that the resulting spectra could, be
classi<U+FB01>ed under three types; there were some interesting
variations which would merit a separate investigation, but
most of the cases could be identi<U+FB01>ed at a glance.
    The three types of visibility-curve are given in <U+FB01>gs. 2, 3,
   " These are not always su<U+FB01>iciently simple as in the case of the green
thallium line.

the line of sight at right angles with the magnetic <U+FB01>eld and
with the plane of polarization perpendicular to the lines of
force; while B correspond to observations with the line of

parallel with the lines of force.

   It was found that there was no appreciable difference
between these last and the observations taken when the line
of sight was parallel with the <U+FB01>eld ; but in this case it was
possible to analyse either one of the outer groups se arately
by the use of the quarter-wave plate, Q, <U+FB01>g. 1. T is was
done in a few cases, but no new result was obtained.

determined by a bismuth spiral.

  mately true.
      In fact, owing to the complexity of the spectra, there is
  considerable latitude in the choice of the distance between
  the outer groups. If this correspond to the brightest com
  ponents, the law can hardly be said to hold at all ; but if the
    istance be taken between the centres of gravity of the light
  areas, a fair agreement is found. The table gives separation
' in tenth-metres for a <U+FB01>eld 10,000. The lines marked with
  an asterisk are less accurate than the others, on account of

      Taking into account the uncertainty alluded to, the results
  show on the whole a fair agreement, from which it may be
  concluded that the separation is independent of the radiating
  substance and of the colour.                             .

tables are due to the fact that the substances in question are
chemically related; and perhaps it is scarcely justi<U+FB01>able
to generalize from such a limited number; and it may
well be that a wide range of elements would show other
peculiarities.
   I desire to express my hearty appreciation of the ef<U+FB01>cient
service rendered in this work by Mr. C. R. Mann, and
especially to recognize the patience and skill shown in the
tedious and delicate process of preparation of the vacuum
tubes, to which in great measure the success of the investi

   Isaac Newton Student in the University of Cambridge *.
1.    ‘HE system described below shows rather remarkable
         discontinuous properties. The work was suggested
by a passage in Sir George Stokes’ Read lecture, and formed
part of an essay written in December 1896.
   A heavy string of density p under tension T extends from
~00 to +00.       From —00 t0 0 it is free from loads; from
0 to + w it is loaded at equal intervals l with equal particles
of mass M. To avoid ambiguity we will suppose that the motion
of each mass is retarded by a small viscous force; this will
<U+FB01>nally be neglected. We will investigate the steady vibration
of the system when simple transverse waves are travelling
along the string from —w . These impinge on the system of
masses; a re<U+FB02>ected wave is generated which travels back
along the string; furthermore, the masses are agitated in a
certain manner.
   2. We will denote by E the lateral displacement of a point
on the string between .r=—oo.and .7:=O. The velocity of
                                         T
propagation along the string is            :0.     For a motion

neglect the friction and put k=0.               Then either sina or
sin   B vanishes; the former or the latter being the case
according as :22].

 will represent an exponential falling off of motion, consecutive
 masses being either in the same or in opposite phases. In
 this case the deeper masses will be practically unaffected by
 the incident wave.

 the frequency of the incident wave, we must trace the changes

    XL. A Numerical Evaluation of the Absolute Scale of
            Temperature.     By R. A. LEHFELDT'.
                          Introduction.
NUMEROUS attempts have been made to reduce the
        readings of thermometers to the absolute scale, since
that scale was <U+FB01>rst clearly de<U+FB01>ned by Thomson and Joule;
but though the process of calculation has been varied a good
deal, the most essential experimental basis of all the reductions
is the same, viz. Thomson and Joule’s own experiments on
the out<U+FB02>ow of gases through a porous plug. It is very
remarkable, therefore, that no one, so far as I know, has
attempted to re eat or extend these experiments, except in
one case studied liy E. Natanson, and that notwithstanding the
  reat discrepancies in Thomson and Joule’s measurements.
  or hydrogen, the substance which is probably the best for
thermometric purposes, there were twelve experiments carried
out at about 7 and <U+FB01>ve at about 90°; but these results varied
from +09 to —-0'1 l while the hydrogen was in no case even
approximately pure ; and although the determination of ab
solute temperatures depends upon that experiment, it has
been left in so unsatisfactory a state for half a century. Of
the other data required, some, such as the speci<U+FB01>c heat and
speci<U+FB01>c volume of the gases used, are known with suf<U+FB01>cient
accuracy, since they enter only in a small correction term:
the most important, however, is the coef<U+FB01>cient of pressure in
the case of a gas thermometer at constant volume (or the
coef<U+FB01>cient of expansion in the constant-pressure thermometer).
On this point, and this only, a distinct advance has been
made since the time of Regnault. This has been accom
plished by Chappuis, working at the Bureau International,
who has measured the coe<U+FB02>icient of pressure between 0° and
 100° for hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, with all the
care and scrupulousness that modern physical methods can
suggest. My object in writing this paper is partly to take
advantage of Chappuis’s results, and partly to draw attention
                  * Communicated by the Author.

 364    Mr. R. A. Lehfeldt on aNumerical Evaluation of
to the fact that if the other data required were investigated
with equal care and thoroughness, we could now know the
absolute scale as accurately as we know the hydrogen or the
mercury scale.
   The problem consists of two parts : <U+FB01>rst, taking the interval
between the freezing- and boiling-points as 100’, it is ne
cessary to determine the absolute temperature corresponding
to one of those <U+FB01>xed points ; second, knowing that value, we
can proceed to compare the absolute scale with some actual
scale, such as that of the constant-volume hydrogen ther
mometer, throughout its range, so far as experimental infor
mation extends. On the <U+FB01>rst of these points no substantial
advance can as yet be made on the result published by
Thomson and Joule several decades ago. The freezing-point
is approximately 273° absolute, and the uncertainty amounts
to one or two tenths of a degree on each side of that number.
But I think it is at least certain that the higher values
obtained by some later German writers (some as high as
274°'5) are wrong. On the second point very varying results
have been found; but I think it is possible to show that the
existing data are in good accord with the comparisons between
the three gas thermometers made at the Bureau International.
                      Theory of the Method.
   In order to determine the relation between the absolute and
an arbitrary scale of temperature, it is not suf<U+FB01>cient to know
the characteristic equation of a gas, but, as has recently been
pointed out afresh by Boltzmann *, calorimetric data are also
necessary; consequently any reduction that does not explicitly
make use of such data must do so implicitly. The form in
which the calorimetric data usually occur is that of the differ
ence between the two speci<U+FB01>c heats of a gas; consequentlv
the evaluation of the absolute scale is closely bound up with
the determination of the difference, or the ratio of the speci<U+FB01>c
heats. But all direct determinations of KP—Kv, by mea
suring KP and Kv, or by measuring KP and the ratio ry, are,
I believe, insuf<U+FB01>ciently accurate. The difference is, however,
nearly equal to the principal gas constant (KP—KV=R),
and it is the small outstanding discrepancy between these
two quantities which is the subject of Joule and Thomson’s
experiments on the cooling by free expansion, so that those
experiments afford the most satisfactory means of determining
the difference between the speci<U+FB01>c heats.
   The argument runs as follows :—Let a gram of hydrogen

                the Absolute Scale of Temperature.           365
  be heated at constant volume through the range 5t (6 being
  the temperature on the constant volume or “normal” scale).
  The heat required is KVSt. But let it be heated through the
  same range at constant pressure, and it will expand by an
 amount
                           8v: (ape/Bt<U+FB01>t.
 It will consequently do an amount of external work in the
 expansion represented by
                          1) (ape/at) 8t.
 Further, internal work is done by the gas (i. e. its internal
energy is increased) by an amount which is a function of the
 initial and <U+FB01>nal states of the gas, and which therefore we may
 <U+FB01>nd by any method in which the same expansion is consi
dered, whatever the external circumstances may be. We
proceed to <U+FB01>nd it in the following way.
    Lemma.—Let one gram of hydrogen in the state speci<U+FB01>ed
 by p, v, T expand by an amount 80 without doing external
work and without acquiring any appreciable kinetic energy (as
in Joule and Thomson’s experiment). In this case it is well
known that the relation 5U +5(pv)=0 holds ; but as pv= RT
nearly, we may put 8U+R8T=0, where ST is the rise in
temperature that occurs during the expansion. Next let the
gas be cooled at constant volume to its original temperature;
then it gives out KVST of heat. Hence its internal energy is
less than at starting by (Kv + R)5T= KP5T to the same degree
of a proximation as before.
      ow according to Joule and Thomson, 5T=—e8p, where
8)) is the change (increase) of pressure involved in the free
expansion, and e is a constant, which for h drogen is positive.
Hence the gain of internal energy is + asp.          We wish to

But v+Re=v(l +pe/T); so that, as e is very small, unless
the pressure be much greater than is actually used in gas
thermometers pe will be less than 1 per cent. of T (for
T=273°, say); and as e is not known to 1 per cent., we may
safely neglect the second term of the denominator and write
the gain of internal energy = --K,,epdv/v. But as the tem
perature of the gas is the same at the end as at the beginning
of the process, its heat energy is unchanged, and the quantity
found is the amount of internal work done by the gas in
expansion.
    Reverting to the main argument, we <U+FB01>nd that when a gram
of hydrogen is heated at constant pressure, the heat required,
being the sum of the increase of heat energy, the external
work, and the internal work, amounts to

368       Mr. R. A. Lehfeldt on a Numerical Evaluation of
in that form in the equation before integrating : but as e is so
small, even for carbon dioxide, and is known with so little
accuracy, it is not worth while to do so ; it is su<U+FB01>'icient to <U+FB01>nd
the average value over the range of integration, and take it as
constant at that ; the error committed is less than the errors
in the experimental data.          The same is true of KP; for while
it has been measured more accurately than 6, its variations
 are less, indeed practically ml for hydrogen, air, and nitrogen.
    The logarithmic form of the equation is the most con
 venient for calculation; but on account of the smallness of
 KPe/v we <U+FB01>nd approximately that
                           l/TO=B(1 +hKPe/v),         .    .  .   .  (vi.)
 where h is a numerical constant =1'163 . . .; this leads to
 the important conclusion that ,8, the coef<U+FB01>cient of pressure,
 varies linearly with l/v, i. e. with the density. So far as it is
 true that the cooling effect on expansion is proportional to
 the change of pressure, so far the result just found holds
 good; and consequently, so far as the determination of To is
 concerned, by merely assuming the form of Joule and Thom
 son’s result we may dispense with its numerical value if only
 we know the rate of variation of the pressure-coef<U+FB01>cient with
 the density        e. BB/Bp). This is analogous to the deduction
 made by Lord Kelvin with regard to the coef<U+FB01>cient of ex
 pansion*. We shall have occasion to revert to this below in
 considering the numerical values of 6.

 has the coef<U+FB01>cient 000366254 for a pressure of one metre at

 of Begnault 0'0036678, Magnus 0'003‘6594, Jolly 0'0036562,
 all for one atmosphere at the freezing-point. It is impossible
 to draw any conclusions from these numbers as to the varia
 tion of the coei<U+FB01>cient with the density of the gas, a variation
  which in any case must be extremely small. We shall
  therefore take Chappuis’s result simply, 0r

 ef<U+FB01>cient of pressure at the ordinary density ; it seems to me
 there can be little doubt that is too low. Another series of
 observations by Regnault himself gives 0'0036679, while
 Magnus <U+FB01>nds 0'0036678 (reduced to the boiling-point under
 76 cm. pressure), and Jolly 00036695, all higher than the
 <U+FB01>rst quoted number. Further, Mendeléef*, on recalculating
 these three observations and applyin                   certain corrections
 neglected by the experimenters, concluged that they show a
 much closer agreement than when uncorrected, thus :—

                   Jolly . . . . . . . . . . . .       702
 Mendeléef’s reduction is regarded probably with justice as
 the most exact, and we will take, therefore, the mean result
 as being true for the normal density (corresponding to a.
 pressure of 1 atmo at 0°).
    The variation with the density of the air was taken by
 Jochmann as 0'0000115, the unit of density being, as before,
 the density at normal temperature and pressure. This re
 presents the set of measurements taken by Regnault for the
express purpose; it also agrees moderately well with some
 observations by Melander, quoted in Landolt and Biirnstein’s
 tables, the only others I have been able to <U+FB01>nd bearing on the
 point. We may then put

    Nitrogen (atmospheric, containing argon). — Regnault
 found 00036682 for one atmo pressure at the freezing

 adopt the latter value, and in the absence of any more de<U+FB01>nite
 information take the same density variation as for air.
                B= 0'0036710 + 0'0000115 (p — l)
 where p is the density expressed in terms of that at N.T.P.
 as unit.
    Carbon Dioxide—This gas has been very much studied, but
 the results are more discordant than for air.              Regnault gives
 00036871 and 00036856 as the result of two experiments,
 Magnus 0'0036937, Jolly 0'0037060, all at normal density,
 while Reguault’s observations on the density variation are
 well represented by 0'00004668, the number adopted by
 Joehmann. The values given here are not corrected in the

370     Mr. R. A. Lehfeldt on a Nuneerz'cal Evaluation of
manner indicated by Mendeléef for air; but that correction
would be too small to bring them into agreement ; while only
Jolly’s number is at all consistent with that recently found at
the Bureau International. Ohappuis gives these values :—
           0'00372477, with initial pressure   995 mm.
               371634,           ,,       -    870 ,,
they may be represented by the equation
              3:0'00370893 + 0‘00005126(p— 1),
p being, as before, expressed in terms of the density at N.T.P.
as unit. We may perhaps best make use of the last-mentioned
numbers, but it is remarkable that the discrepancies in the
measurement of ,8 should be about four times as great as for
air. The expressions given above must not, of course, be
relied upon either for large densities or for very small.
   Specz<U+FB01>c Heat.—The speci<U+FB01>c heat and speci<U+FB01>c volume of the
gases need only be known approximately, as they only enter
into the expression for the absolute temperature in the small
correction term. The well-known experiments of Regnault
and E. Wiedemann aiford the necessary information on the
speci<U+FB01>c heat at constant pressure. The former used as unit
of heat the capacity of water between 12° and 15°, the latter
between 16° and 24°.     Following the table recently given by
Gri<U+FB02>iths,the unit used by Regnault is equal to4l ,920,000 ergs,

     Cooling on Free Ewpansion.—This quantity also enters
 onl     in the correction term, but it has not been determined
  wit suf<U+FB01>cient accuracy even for that. If we take the pro
  bable error of B as measured by Ohappuis at 2 ><10~7 (or
  1/18000 part of its whole value)—an opinion which seems
justi<U+FB01>ed by the close agreement of his observations among
  themselves—then the cooling as resulting from a fall of 1
  atmosphere in the ressure should be measured to about
  0°‘004 to in<U+FB02>uence t 0 result equally. This is about 1/50 of
  the value of e for air; that degree of accuracy has certainly
not been attained, even for air, much less for the other gases
which Jonle and Thomson studied.
     Hydrogen.—With this gas twelve experiments were made
at about 7° and <U+FB01>ve at about 90°.                         The mean of the twelve
at the low temperature gave e=0°'301 per 100 inches of
mercury pressure for pure hydrogen ; but in only <U+FB01>ve cases
did the analysis of the gas used show as much as 90 per cent.
of hydrogen—the rest being air—and these <U+FB01>ve experiments
   ave e=0°'108, while the one case in which the purity rose
to 98'2 per cent. gave e=0°'075 for the pure gas.                                 It is

372     Mr. B. A. Lehfeldt on (1 Numerical Evaluation of
obvious that no reliance can be put in deductions made from
the mixtures containing much air, and that the whole question
is in a very unsatisfactory state. The high temperature
measurements gave e=0°'l55, and the mean between that
and 0108 reduced to the atmosphere as unit of pressure gives
a: +0°'039 : which is the number used by Lord Kelvin in
the Encyclopcedia Brittam'ca. article. It should be noted,
however, that this appears to indicate a greater effect at the
higher temperature, contrary to what was observed for the
other gases.
   Air.—In their        earlier memoir, Joule and             Thomson*
record experiments with' air at 17° and at 91°, yielding
 -—0°'259 and —0°'206 per atmosphere respectively. In the
later memoir'l‘ they paid more attention to the experiments
at high temperatures, so probably the results are more trust
worthy than that <U+FB01>rst found for 91°. The following table shows
the mean of the observations grouped about four different
temperatures, and also the value of e calculated on the
assumption that it varies inversely as the square of the
absolute temperature :—

   Nitrogen—The single experiment made at 7° with this gas
gave a cooling of 1°'034 for 100 inches of mercury; and two
experiments at 92° gave 0576 and 0691 respectively.

    The numbers in the last column are calculated from the
 inverse square rule, taking so as -— 10'293. The cooling
 effect seems to fall off more rapidly ; I have therefore
 preferred to make a diagram of the observed results, together
 with those published in the earlier memoir, which agree with
 the above, and read off the value of e for each temperature
 from the curve.       \Vith the value of so assumed in the above
 table and the inverse square rule, the mean over the range
 0° and 100° (which is 0732 of the value at 0°) is —0°'956 ;
 whilst the value taken from the curve is —-0°'930. Lord
 Kelvin, in the encyclopaadia article, gives —1°'105, without
 ex laining the process of reduction used.             1 have not been
 ab e to see how this number is arrived at.
    E. Natanson‘ has repeated Thomson and Joule’s expe
 riment on carbon dioxide, using the commercial lique<U+FB01>ed gas
 from a cylinder: he made all his experiments at one tempe
 rature, —20°, and found that the cooling is not quite pro
 portional to the pressure, but may be represented by
                          —-e=1'18+0'0126p,
 p being in atmospheres. This, for low pressures, is in accord
 ance with Joule and Thomson’s result at the same temperature.
    We have, however, seen that there is an indirect means of
 estimating the cooling effect, by means of the density-varia
 tion of the coef<U+FB01>cient of pressure, the relation being

    own reduction or by mine ; and if Regnanlt’s value of Sig/Sp
   be used the result will be 10 per cent. smaller still.                        This

      \Vith regard to these results we may remark that in each
   case the data leave something to be desired. Hydrogen, no
   doubt, is the best thermometric substance, since its divergence
   from a perfect gas is so small ; and the numbers suggest that
    erhaps even taking e=0°'039 is an overestimate of the
    ivergence. Moreover, as we shall see below, there appears
  to be an anomaly in its behaviour which makes the course of
   the hydrogen scale between 0° and 100° run differently from
   those of the other gases. For both these reasons, more
  information on the thermal effect due to free expansion, and
  its variation with temperature, is especially needed; and it
  is essential that the experiments should be made with pure
  hydrogen.                             ‘
     The value for To derived from the air-thermometer is
    robably entitled to about the same weight as that from
  liydrogen. It is the only gas for which :2 appears to be satis
' t'aetorilv determined ; on the other hand, it is probable that
  ,8 is a little higher than is assumed above ; for, according to
  Jolly, whose measurements seem to be more reliable than
  Regnault’s, air has a coef<U+FB01>cient of pressure higher than that
  of nitrogen by 2 x 10‘6 ; this is all the more likely because
  it brings air nearly into the position it would occupy if its
  constituent gases exercised no in<U+FB02>uence on one another. Now
  if this is true, and Chappuis’s value for nitrogen is correct, the
  pressure-coef<U+FB01>cient for air would become 00036730 and the
  value of To derived from it 273°'05.
     The determination from nitrogen is not of much value on
  account of the absence of information on the value of 6.                   Of
  the two values from carbon dioxide, the <U+FB01>rst is, of course,
  quite inadmissible; if the theory given in this paper is cor
  rect, we must conclude that the measurements of the cooling
  effect contain some error, and that the variation of the
  coef<U+FB01>cient of pressure is more to be depended on in this
  instance. It may be remarked too, that if we take Regnault’s

376     Mr. R. A. Lehfeldt on (1- Numerical Evaluation of
'value of this quantity instead of Ohappuis’s, To will come out
much closer to 273°, and it would probably be right to do so,
 since the experiments of Regnault covered a wide range of
 density, whereas only two densities, near together, were used
 at the Bureau International. The numbers derived from
 carbon dioxide cannot, however, be allowed much weight in
 the result, at present; a fresh set of experiments on the
 cooling e<U+FB01>'ect, carried out with the pure gas, and over a.
 considerable range of temperature, is needed to make the
 conclusions trustworthy; while determinations of the coef<U+FB01>
 cient of pressure for lower densities, not only for carbon
 dioxide but for all the gases, including air, would give most
 valuable information.
    The results, allowing for such possible corrections as we
have just indicated, seem to point to the conclusion that the
 freezing-point is within a tenth of a degree of 273° absolute.

   The hydrogen and nitrogen scales exhibit a curious reversal
at 80° to 90°, which is not reproduced in the calculated
numbers; the calculated temperatures are consequently a
good deal in error there. It will be noticed that the calcué
lated difference for tcoz—tN is much more 00rrect than that for
tcoa—IH, which seems to show that the anomaly is rather in
the hydrogen than in the nitrogen scale; this is another
point which cannot be cleared up without further experimental
data. The greatest difference between the observed and
calculated numbers is 0°‘O22 ; the mean of all the differences

Theoretical Mechanics, an Introductory Treatise on the Principles
   of Dynamics, with Applications and numerous Examples.                By
   A. E.      LOVE, M.A., F.R.S., Fellow and Lecturer of St. John’s
    College, Cambridge.     Cambridge, at the University Press, 1897.
    HIS well-printed volume issuing from the Cambridge Univer
       sity Press seems intended to meet the wants of candidates for
scholarships or places in the Mathematical Tripos. Its contents
consist of eighty-four pages of “ Preliminary ” matter, sixty on “ the
Principles of Dynamics,” and two hundred and twenty-six on
“Methods and Applications”; an ‘Appendix’ of <U+FB01>ve pages on
" Measurement, Units, and Dimensions " ; <U+FB01>nally, an Index.
   The terminology of the treatise involving the frequent use of
the vector, ch. ii. is devoted to “ the Geometry of Vectors”; while
Force is de<U+FB01>ned (ch. v.), as “a vector localized at a point ” or what
is represented by a right line drawn from a given point in a
determined direction, sense, and length. Bodies have ‘ mass ’ and
“act ’ upon one another; and, in the case of homogeneous bodies,
the ratio of mass to volume is the density; the limit at any point
of course giving the density at the point, where this is variable.
 The di<U+FB01>erential coef<U+FB01>cients introduced are usually printed in the
 <U+FB02>uxional manner with dots, as in Thomson and Tait’s treatise;
 axes of coordinates form a ‘frame.’ ‘Gravity’ is the vertical
action of the particles of the Earth on those of any body “small
enough to be handled or moved by machinery ”; thus, the neigh
 bourhood of the Earth is a ‘ <U+FB01>eld of force,’ and the acceleration
 at any point in the <U+FB01>eld, i. e. the intensity of the <U+FB01>eld, is at any place
 vertically downwards and equal to y ; weight being “ the resultant
 force on a free falling body in the neighbourhood of the Earth,
 numerically equal to my.” “ At any place on the Earth’s surface
 the mass of a body is proportional to its weight” is a statement
 which implies an ideal Earth, homogeneous and of spherical form.
 “The tendency of a body, apart from the action of other bodies,
 to persist in its state of motion at any instant is known as its
 inertia”; which the mass can be taken to measure.
     In an historical note, at the conclusion of ch. v., the idea of
 acceleration is assigned to Galilei, and that of force as its cause
 to Newton, of whose Amiomutu sive Leg/es Motus a translation is
 given ; they being regarded as postulates of which the third
contained what was afterwards knovin as d’Alembert’s Principle.

   380               Notices respecting New Boats.
  In the Preface Mr. Love refers students for the history of
  dynamical ideas to Mach’s Science of Mechanics.
     The term ‘kinetic reaction’ is used with the de<U+FB01>nition “a
   vector localized in the line and with the sense of acceleration of a
  particle and of magnitude equal to the product of its mass and
  acceleration.”
     After a chapter (vi.) of general theorems, in that following the
  deformability of bodies, regarded as geometrical surfaces <U+FB01>lled
  continuously with particles, strain and stress are introduced;
  as also ‘ Bodily forces,’ ‘ Surface tract-ions,’ ‘ Tensions of strings’
  (inextensible or extensible) and reactions thereof when in contact
  with surfaces ; <U+FB01>nally ‘ Springs.’
     Ch. viii. is devoted to the important subject of ‘Work and
 Energy.’ A ‘conservative’ system, the analytical condition for
 it, and its ‘Potential Energy’ are explained.           A collection of
 Examples of the Calculation of Work is appended. The subject
 being then resumed, a proof of the constancy of the sum of kinetic
 and potential energy of a conservative system is given ; forces are
 distinguished as ‘ Positional and Motional,’ and it is shown that
 those of. rational mechanics may be conditioned as always conserva
 tive as regards positional, but generally non-conservative as regards
 motional. ‘ Power ’ is de<U+FB01>ned as the rate per unit of time at which
  work is done by the action of one system on another. The
 kinetic energy produced by impulses; the principle of virtual
 work or ‘virtual moment of a localized vector,’ the ‘variation
 equation of motion,’ and a ‘critical note ’-—in which a conclusion
 is arrived at that “if we are prepared to abandon precise de<U+FB01>nition
 and the purely logical deductive method, as unsuited to a science
 at present incompletely known, we may construct a physical
 theory, inde<U+FB01>nite in parts and incomplete in details, but neverthe
 less available for co-ordinating the results obtained by physical
 investigation, and capable of being itself advanced towards
 perfection thereby ”—conclude the <U+FB01>rst half of the volume. The
 second half is occupied with ‘Methods and Applications,’ largely
illustrated by a copious collection of examples, some worked out
 in full, attached to each chapter.     ‘Motions of Free Particles in
given Fields of Force,’ and ‘under Constraints and Resistances,’
form the subjects of obs. ix. and x. devoted to the ‘ Dynamics of a
Particle.’     The ‘Motion of :1. Rigid Body in Two Dimensions’
Occupies ch. xi.        Impulse and Collision, as far as Impact of
 smooth Spheres, necessarily introduces reference to Elasticity,—
reminding us of Mr. Love’s Treatise on that subject, reviewed in
this Magazine some few years since. The Impact of Rigid Bodies in
 two dimensions, Initial Movement and the Mot-ion of a Chain are the
subjects of ch. xii.— one of Examples essentially. A short chapter
on ‘ Relative Motion and Universal Gravitation ’ forms the last.
 A From this abstract of its contents, it will be seen that the
treatise, within the limits to which it is con<U+FB01>ned, is quite “ up to
date”;     and maintains the Author’s character as a careful and

involving, as before, the condition dQI/dr=d.Q,/dr.
    Before determining the images which represent the eEect
of the currents induced by the introduction of a given pole,
 magnet, or current in the presence of such sheets, it will be
convenient to think, for a moment, of the images which occur
 in hydrodynamical problems relating to the cylinder and
 sphere. ln two-dimensional <U+FB02>uid motion, the image of a line
 source outside and parallel to the axis of a cylinder is an equal
line-source through the inverse point together with an equal
 line-sink through the centre (2'. 0. along the axis); similarly
 the image of a line-source inside the sphere together with an
 equal line-sink along the axis is an equal line-source through
 the inverse point. The image of a vortex-<U+FB01>lament parallel to
 the axis of a cylinder, whether inside or outside the cylinder, is
 an equal and opposite vortex through the inverse point.            1n
 the case of a sphere, the image of a doublet whose axis passes
 through the centre is a certain doublet at the inverse point,
 whether the original doublet be inside or outside the sphere.
 The image of a source in a sphere, on the other hand, is more
 complicated, consisting not only of a source but also of a sink
 extending to the centre if the original source was outside the
 sphere, and to in<U+FB01>nity it inside.                         ' .
    We may therefore expect by analogy that the images in a
 spherical sheet due to the motion or generation of magnetic
 poles in its neighbourhood will be less simple than these pro
 duced by magnets whose axes pass through the centre of the
 sphere ; and such we shall <U+FB01>nd to be actually the case.
     Image due to Generation of a Line of Poles parallel to the
                  Axis outside a Cylindrical Sheet.
     2. We <U+FB01>rst consider the two-dimensional problem in which
 the currents are induced by the generation or destruction of
 a linear distribution of magnetism parallel to the axis of the
  cylinder at A (<U+FB01>g. 1) in the line whose polar (cylindrical)
  coordinates are r=b, 0:0, where b is greater than a the
  radius of the cylinder. To cover all cases we commence by
  assuming at the outset that the line-density of this line of
  poles, as it may be called, is f(t) a function of the time.
     The magnetic potential of this distribution at the point
  (r, 6) is therefore
        (20 (say) = pf(t) {const. — log ~/ (r2 + b”- 2rb cos H) },

       Plane, Cylindrical, and Spherical Cinvent-Sheets.             383
  where y, the magnetic permeability of the dielectric, will be
  taken to be unity, or included under fit).
                                Fig. 1.
    The above potential may, for values of r less than 6, be
 expanded in the form
            <U+FB02>o=f(t) {const.—logb+27—1Lgcosntl}.                    . (3)
    Consistently with the surface condition of continuity of
 magnetic induction, we can assume for the potentials of the
induced currents inside and outside the cylinder expressions
 of the form
                  9': - 2A7;        cos n0 (inside),      .   .  .   (4)

account of changes that have been taking place from an

   To analyse the images, consider now the case in which a
line of poles of strength m is suddenly generated at A at the
time 0, so that
                            f(t) =0 when t<0,
                            f(t) =m when t>0,
f' (t) vanishes except when t=0, and the time-integral of
f' (t) over a very small interval containing the time 0 is equal
to m. We thus obtain
                              An=me—MR/a‘,’)i:.
    Substituting in the expressions for Q' and 0” we <U+FB01>nd

    =m [log r—log { r2+ (grainy —2r ($2M) cos 0} i]. (7)
    Hence we have the following results :—
    (i.) At points inside the conductor,the magnetic potential due
 to the induced currents initially neutralizes that produced by
 the sudden generation of the line of poles at A, and is equiva
 lent to that of a line of poles (P, <U+FB01>g. 1) of constant strength
 —m, starting at the point A and moving away from the
 centre so that its distance from the centre at time t is e‘R/“b.
    (ii.) At points outside the conductor the magnetic potential is
 equivalent to that of two lines of poles, one of constant
 strength —m at O the centre, and the other (Q) of strength
  + m, starting at B the inverse point of A (a2/b, 0), and moving
 towards the centre so that at timet its distance from the
 centre is e"R/“a2/b. We observe that P and Q, the positions
 of the inside and outside images, move so as always to remain
 inverse points.
     The velocities with which the images P, Q move away
 from and towards 0 respectively are R/a times their distances
 from O, and their accelerations are Rz/a2 times these distances
 respectively.
     3. The current function at any point M of the cylinder is

   The arbitrary constants in ¢ may be functions of the time,
but they do not affect the distribution of currents in the
c linder, and therefore need not be considered.        Since P and
(5' are inverse points
              PM: QM=OP :a=a :OQ=bem/“:a;
log PM and log QM therefore differ by a term which may be
included in the arbitrary constant of 45, so that for determining
the currents we may take

              = - glog PM, or ¢= - é'J—rlog QM,

    4. If we were to suppose the currents to be induced by a
line of poles of strength<U+FB02> t) at the point (6, 0) where 6 <a, we
should have to expand the potential in descending pom-rs of
'r in order to obtain a convergent series at the surface of the
sheet. We should thus obtain for the inducing potential

Now the portion
                       f(t){const. - log r}
represents the potential of a line of poles of strength f t)
along the axis, for investigating the effects of which t e
ima 0 method is inconvenient. To remove these terms we
shal suppose the inducing system to consist of a line of poles
through the point (b, 0) together with an equal and opposite
line of poles along the axis: in other words of a line of
magnets having their positive poles {(t) at (b, O) and their
negative poles —f(t) at the axis.          be potential of such-a

    The analysis is almost identical with that of the preceding
case, and passing to the case when                              ‘

 the following results may be obtained, taking B (fig. 1) to
 now represent the point (I), 0).
    (i.) If lines of poles of strengths m and -—m be instantaneously
 generated at B and the axis respectively, the images repre
 senting the magnetic potential of the induced currents outside
 the cylinder after a time t are lines of poles of strengths —m
 and +m at Q and the axis, where OQ=e'm/“b. Hence the
 total magnetic potential at outside points due to the poles and
 the induced currents at time t is that of lines of poles of
 strengths +m and —m at B and Q respectively.
     (ii.) At points inside the cylinder, the magnetic potential due
 to the induced currents alone is that which would be produced
 by a line of poles of strength +m at P, where P is the
 inverse point of Q, so that OP=e‘R/“a2/l).
      Images due to Generation of Straight Currents Parallel
                   to the Acts of the Cylindrical Sheet.
      5. The cases where the currents are induced by the sudden
  generation of a straight current parallel to the axis of the
  c linder probably have a more practical physical interest than
  t ose considered in the previous articles.           If we suppose
  all the lines of poles of strengths im of the'preceding
  sections to be replaced by currents of intensities i-I the
  results regarding the images will be identically the same as
  before. To satisfy ourselves that such is the case we have
  only to notice that while the magnetic potential of a line
  of poles of line-density m at (b, 0) is the real part of the
  expressmn
                                m log (rem—b),
   the magnetic potential of a current perpendicular to the
   plane of reference and of intensity em is the imaginary part
   of the same expression. Where r< b, the potential of the
   current expands therefore in the series
                                    1 r"

   These expressions di<U+FB02>'er from those used in the previous
articles by the substitution of since for cosines only, and it
follows that when we make similar changes in the assumed
expressions for the potentials of the induced currents, the
work of substituting in the boundary conditions will be
unaltered. For convenience, however, itwill be well toagain
state the <U+FB01>nal conclusions, which are as follows :—
   (i.) If a current of strength I he suddenly generated
parallel to the axis of the cylinder at A outside the cylinder,
the image representing the ett'ect ot' the induced currents t'or
inside points at time I will be a current of strength —1 at P,
and the images representing their e<U+FB01>'ect for outside points
will be a current +I at Q and a return current —I in the
axis, where OP=em/“OA, and Q is the inverse point of P, so
that OQ=e_m'“a2/OA.
    (ii.) If a current of strength Ibe suddenly generated at
B inside the cylinder, accompanied by a return current —I
in the axis, the image representing the effect of the induced
currents for outside points will be a current I at P, and the
 —I at representing
images    Q, and I in their           for inside
                             effectwhere
                         the axis,                              currents
                                                 points will beand
                                             0Q=e_'R'I“OB,          P is
 the inverse point of Q, so that OP=e‘R'“a’/OB.
    The eti'ect of breaking a current of intensity I will of course
 be the same as that of superposing a current —I and the
images will be equal and opposite to those above obtained.
   Images due to sudden Generation of Lines of Magnets, and
                            Moving Poles.
    6. It is now easy to build up the images due to the sudden
 generation or destruction of lines of magnets parallel to the
 axis of the cylinder, the motion of lines of poles and so forth.
 The methods are almost identical with those used for plane
 sheets, and it will be suf<U+FB01>cient here to call attention to one
 or two salient features of the images in cylindrical sheets.
 As in the previous articles we shall take A, B to be any two
 inverse points inside and outside the cylinder, P and Q, two
 other inverse points such that OP = 'R‘"OA, OQ=e_'R'“OB,
 and similar relations will be supposed to hold when the letters
 are accented.
    (i.) its. line of magnets parallel to the axis at AA' be gene.
 rated suddenly, having their positive poles at A and their

388      Dr.         Bryan on Electromagnetic Induction in
negative poles at A' (<U+FB01>g. 2) , the image at time t for inside points
will be the oppositely magnetized line PP', and for outside
points the line QQ' having its positive magnetism at Q. From
the properties of similar triangles and of inversion, FF is
                                Fig. 2.
parallel and QQ’ is antiparallel to AA', also, since the strengths
of the poles are constant, the magnetic moments of the images
are to one another and to that of the inducing system as
PP': QQ’ :AA', that is as OP : OQ' : OA or, in the limiting
case (when Q and Q' are in<U+FB01>nitely near together), as the
distances OP : 0Q :OA.
   Hence if M be the magnetic moment generated in AA’,
those of the images PP’ and QQ’ at time tare —MetR/” and
M€_tR/“a2/t)2, where b = 0A.
  (ii.) Similarly, ifa line of magnets of moment M be suddenly
generated at BB' inside the cylinder, the images at timet
for outside points will be the oppositely magnetized line QQ’
of magnetic moment -Me"'R/“, and for inside points the
magnetized line PP' having its positive poles at P and of
magnetic moment MetR/“a2/b’, I) being now taken =OB.
   7. If a line of poles of strength m suddenly changes position
from A’ to A the effect is equivalent to the superposition of
—m at A' and +m at A, and is thus equivalent to the
generation of a line of magnets in the direction AA’, the
images of which have just been found.
   Fig. 3 shows the application of this method to construct
the trails of images of a line of poles revolving uniformly
about the centre and passing in succession through the
positions A1, A2, A3, A4, . . ., at equal small intervals of time,
the actual trails are of course the limits of the series of moving
poles thus plotted out.       By supposing the line of poles to
remain <U+FB01>xed and the cylinder to rotate, we get a kind of

     Plane, Cylindrical, and Spherical Current-Sheets.       389

    Comparing the <U+FB01>rst of these results with (9) and the
second with (10), we have the following conclusions :—
    (i.) At time t after the generation of the magnet, the potential

 equivalent to that produced bya magnet of moment —Me3‘R/2*'
 at a distance from the centre of em<U+FB01>b.
     (ii.) At points outside the sphere, the potential is equivalent
 to that of a magnet of moment —Me'3‘1"/’“a“/b3 at a distance
 from the centre of e_'R-“"a"/b. The positions P, Q occupied by
 these images at time t are always inverse points.
     It is easily seen that the intensities of the images at P and
 Q are to each other and to that of the inducing magnet as
  OP§:OQ3 :OAi, that is in the sesquiplicate ratio of their

  representing the magnetic potential of the induced currents

  Images due to Generation of Circular Currents coaxial with
                      a Spherical Sheet, <U+FB01>re.
   10. A circular current whose axis passes through the centre
of the sphere is equivalent to a magnetic shell forming a spheri
cal cap on the surface of a concentric sphere, this cap being
bounded by the current. It is thus evident that the images
due to the sudden generation of such a current are also circular
currents, which move in the manner described in the pre
ceding sections. There is no need to restrict the results to
circular currents as the same arguments are equally applicable
when the inducing current <U+FB02>ows in any closed curve traced on
a spherical surface concentric with the sheet, the images in
this case being currents in similar curves. It remains to state
the relation between the intensities of the currents in the
images and that of the inducing current.
    (i.) Let AA’ (<U+FB01>g. 4) be the. wire in which an inducing
                              Fig. 4.
current of intensity I is suddenly generated outside the sheet.
Then at time t the image for inside points will be a current in
PP’ and for outside oints a current in QQ’,where OP=e‘R/“OA
and OQ=e"‘R/“a2/8A. Suppose the currents replaced by
 their equivalent magnetic shells on spherical surfaces centred
 at O, and let corresponding elements of these shells be taken.
The magnetic moments of the elements of PP’, QQ’, and AA’
are respectively as OPiI : OQi : 0A3 ; and the areas of these
 elements are as OP2 : 0Q2 : 0A2; hence the strengths of the
shells are as 0P4 : ()Q'?i : OA'%, and the current-intensities

      Plane, Cylindrical, and Spherical Current- Sheets.     393
are in the same ratio.    Thus <U+FB01>nally, if I’ and I” be the inten
sities of the image-currents at time t in PP’ and QQ’, we have

    11. A magnetic pole m generated at time 0 outside a sphere
 at the point r=b where I) > a might be regarded as equiValent
 to a line of elements uniformly magnetized in the direction of
 the radius-vector extending along that radius from r=b to
 in<U+FB01>nity ; and similarly a positive pole m inside the sphere at
 'r=b when b<a together with a negative pole --m at the
 centre might be regarded as equivalent to a line of elements
 uniformly magnetized in the line joining these points. In
 this way the images might be obtained by integration.
 Practically as short a way of obtaining the result as any is h

 potential of a line-distribution of magnetism of uniform linear

 equal to the strength of the pole divided by p or 0Q, it follows
 that the total quantity of magnetism on this line OQ is equal
 and opposite to that in the pole Q (<U+FB01>g. 5). This distribution
 of images is related to the image on the opposite side in the
 same manner as the hydrodynamic image of a source in a
 sphere is related to the source, except in the matter of algebraic
 sign. The reason for the resemblance is that the two potentials
 here have to make dQ'/I.l1-=dQ’’/dr at the surface, while in the

       Plane, Cylindrical, and Spherical Current-Sheets.     395

 This linear density is equal to the strength of the pole-image

    13. When the inducing potential is due to a small magnet
 whose art's does not ass through the centre of the sphere we
 could of course <U+FB01>nd!) the images by considering the positive
 and negative poles separately. If the axis of the magnet
 makes an angle a with the radius-vector the simplest plan
 would be to replace it by two magnets of moment M cosa
 and M sin or along and perpendicular to the radius.
    14. The images due to a pole of constant strength moving
along the radius-vector and initially at rest will be trails of
 magnets which can be worked out by employing the simpler
 images of §§ 10 and 11. If, initially, the pole were suddenly
generated, we should have to introduce the more complicated
images of §§ 11 and 12, but this may be avoided by considering
the problem in which the pole is supposed to have remained
at rest from an in<U+FB01>nite time past (or, at any rate, so long that
all currents in the sheet have died out), and investigating only
the effects due to its motion. As usual, any small displacement
may be represented by putting down a magnet of which one
pole cancels the moving pole in its old position, while the
other is identical with the moving pole in its new position. If
the pole moves in a direction other than radial, the more com
plicated images of §§ 11 and 12 will of course be introduced.
                      GENERAL CONCLUSIONS.
   1. The phenomena of two-dimensional induction in cylin
drical sheets and of induction in spherical sheets due to a
sudden disturbance in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld can be represented
by moving trails of images which are generally not much
more complicated than those obtained with a plane sheet.
   2. The images in every case start from the source of dis
turbance and its inverse, and move away from the sheet
radially with velocities varying directly as the distance, the
constant of variation being such as to make the velocity at
the surface of the sheet become equal to R, the corresponding
velocity for a plane sheet. of the same thickness and conduc
tivity. The image which initially coincides with the source of
disturbance initially neutralizes its effect on the opposite side
of the sheet.
   3. Where the source of disturbance is a distribution of

        Plane, Cylindrical, and Spherical Current-Sheets.           397
poles or an unclosed current inside the sheet it is necessary
from physical considerations to place equal and opposite
poles at the centre or to close the circuit by axial return
currents, and this is also essential for the success of the image
method.
    4. The relations between the intensity of the source of dis
turbance and those of the images will readily be found to be
in every case expressible in terms of their distances from the
centre.      The results expressed in this way may be tabulated
as follows :—
      Sheet.             Inducing disturbance.     Law of variation.
   Cylinder.       Line of poles parallel to axis.   Constant.
         ,,       Current parallel to axis.                ,,
         ,,       Line of magnets.                  or distance.
   Sphere.        Magnet radially magnetized.       cc (distance<U+FB01>.
                  Concentric magnetic shell.             -        Q
        ”        {Current on concentric sphere. }   a; (dIStanco) '
        ,,        Magnetic pole (with exception).   as (distanoe<U+FB01>.
    5. The last-named exceptional case is that of a spherical
sheet when the disturbance is due to the generation of a
pole, and it is required to represent by images the potential of
the currents on the same side as the disturbing pole, the
images thus being on the opposite side of the sheet. Here,
in addition to the single pole whose intensity and position
are given by the above statements, the image consists of a
line-distribution of ma netism of opposite sign, extendin
from that pole along t e radius away from the sheet, an
having its line-density equal to the quantity of magnetism
in the pole or image divided by its distance from the
centre.
    6. When the source of disturbance is in motion, the trails
of images can be built up synthetically as in the case of a
plane sheet.       If the source of disturbance is rotating uni
formly about the centre of the cylinder or sphere, the
curves described by the trails of images will be equiangular
spirals.

                               1. Introductory.
 §. 1. THE experimental investigation described in this
                communication had as its primary object the
 elucidation and measurement of the variations of volta contact
 electricity of a pair of conductors, due to changes in the state
 of that portion of the surface of each conductor which was
 separated from the other conductor by an insulating medium.
     § 2. The discovery of contact electricity of dry metals in
 air by Volta at the beginning of the present century, extended
 a quarter of a century later by Pfati' to dry varnished metals
 in other gases, has been con<U+FB01>rmed by many subsequent
 experimenters. The reality of the electrostatic force in air
 near an interface between copper and zinc, inferred as an
 obvious consequence from it by Lord Kelvin, was experi
 mentally demonstrated by him in 18611'. In the next twenty
 years many investigations were made, the more important
 being those of Hankel, Gerland, Clifton, Ayrton and Perry,
 and von Zahn. In 1881 a paper of great importance was
 published by M. Pellati, and as the present paper is, in some
 respects, only an ampli<U+FB01>cation and extension of his work, it
 may be of advantage to give a short re'sume' of it before going
 further.
     M. Pellat’s most important results appear to be (1) his
 demonstration of the in<U+FB02>uence of the physical condition of
 the metallic surfaces on their volta-potential ; thus he found
 that a sharply scratched plate is positive to a more smoothly
 polished one of the same metal, the metals being washed with
 alcohol after polishing in both cases and allowed to dry before
 the measurement of their potential :                his measurements of
                 * Communicated by Lord Kelvin.

  Dr. J. Erskine-Murray on Volta Electricity of Jlfetals.     399
the temporary variations of potential due to change of tem
perature of a copper, iron, or zinc plate : and (3) his
experiments which prove the smallness of the changes pro
duced in the potential-difference of copper and zinc by
varying either the pressure or the nature of the gas surround
ing them.
   § 2a. I shall now give a short summary of the results
detailed in the present paper :—
   (a) Metals covered with nonconducting solid <U+FB01>lms of wax
or glass, except at their point of contact, give nearly the same
potential as the bare metals in air. The substitution of wax
for air next the metal only causes a small change which may
be in the same direction and of approximately equal amounts
for metals whose potentials in air are very different ; e. g. the
volta-potential-di<U+FB01>erence between zinc and copper when both
are coated with solid paraf<U+FB01>n-wax is very nearly the same as
that between bare zinc and copper. In this connexion I may
mention that I have measured the potential of sodium coated
with wax and glass, and <U+FB01>nd it to be about 3‘56 volts positive
to a standard gold plate (see Chap. X.).
   (b) A metal, cleaned by careful polishing and scratching
with emery-cloth or glass-paper is less )ositive when its surface
is in a shar 1y scratched condition than when smoothed or
burnished, tie difference frequently amounting to ‘2 or '3 of
a volt. This result is not in opposition to that of M. Pellat,
mentioned above, §2 (1), for the conditions were different,
as his plates were washed with alcohol after polishing while
mine were not (see Chap. Ill. and also        39 et seq.).
   (0) The temperature variations, between 15° C. and 60° 0., 0f
the volta-potential of many metals have been determined, both
for clean dry metals in air and for metals coated with 1i uid
0r nonconducting solid <U+FB01>lms ; and it has been found thatt ey
are of considerable magnitude in both cases. The curves
representing the variation of potential with temperature
appear as if they should meet at a point below —200° C., at
a potential about '4 volt ositive to a standard gold plate at
16° 0.; this suggests that volta-potential-ditferences may
possibly vanish at a very low temperature (see Chap. 1X.).
   (d) A liquid <U+FB01>lm, even if of extreme thinness, may cause
a considerable change in the potential of a dry polished plate
which continues permanent for many hours and even days
afier the disappearance of the <U+FB01>lm.
   Two <U+FB01>lms of the same liquid opposed to one another on the
surfaces of two plates of ditt'erent metals do not usually give
zero potential-difference, as solid conducting <U+FB01>lms of one
material would do, but give nearly the same potential
                             2E 2

400      ‘         Dr. J. Erskine-Murray on
difference as the dry metals on which they lie (see Chaps. VI.
and VII.).
   (e) A very thin <U+FB01>lm of oxide on a metal produces only a
very small change in the potential, and every increase in
thickness of the <U+FB01>lm is attended by a further change in
potential until a limitin value is reached, which is that of a
mass of the oxide (see hap. IV.).
    (f) Exposure to the atmosphere at ordinary temperatures
does not as a rule produce any rapid change in volta-potential,
especially if the air be comparatively dry and free from dust.
The ultimate change is usually in the negative direction
 (see Chap. V.).
    (g) I have extended Lord Kelvin’s experiments on the
effect of temporary immersion of a metal in a as to the
 cases of copper, zinc, tin, and silver in oxygen, an <U+FB01>nd that
 copper, zinc, and silver become temporarily positive, while
 tin becomes negative in consequence of this treatment (see
 Chap. VIII.).
    The research, suggested by Lord Kelvin, was carried out
 in the Natural Philosophy Laboratory of Glasgow University
 during the Sessions 1893—94-95, and during 1895—96 in the
 Cavendish Laboratory of Cambridge University. My thanks
 are due to Lord Kelvin for many suggestions and much
 valuable advice, both in regard to experiments and to the
 discussion of results; and to Professor J. J. Thomson for
 similar kindnesses during my work in the Cavendish
 Laboratory. A small portion of this investigation, on the
 effect of Bontgen x-rays on the contact electricity of metals,
 was published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society for
 March 1896.
    I have also to thank Professor James Holm, M.A.*, and
 Mr. George E. Allan, B.Sc., for the part they took in the
 earlier portion of the work.
                     II. Method of Experiment.
    § 3. The measurement of the natural potential-difi'erence
 between any pair of conductors was usually made, in air, b
 the null method described very brie<U+FB02>y by Lord Kelvin in the
 Report of the British Association for 1880, p. 494. To make
 clear the exact circumstances in which the potentials were
 measured it will be advantageous to describe the apparatus and
 general method of experiment in detail.
    §4. A circular disk of one of the metals, usually about

 worker was Professor of Applied Mathematics in the South-African
 College, Cape Town.   He died in October.

                      Volta Electricity of Metals.             401
9 centim. in diameter and '2 centim. thickness, is insulated
and in permanent connexion with the insulated pair of
quadrants of an electrometcr. A similar plate of the other
metal placed parallel to the <U+FB01>rst, at a distance of a few milli
metres from it, is uninsulated and in connexion with the
uninsulated pair of quadrants. While in this position they
are temporarily connected with one another through a simple
form of potential-divider in which a slope of potential is
maintained by a Daniell cell, in the direction opposite to that
given by the experimental plates. The temporary connexion
is now broken and the plates are separated. In doing so the
capacity of the condenser is reduced, hence it there be any
electric charge on them it will be indicated by a further
de<U+FB02>exion of the electrometer. This operation is repeated
with different values of the counterpotential until separation
of the plates produces no change in the de<U+FB02>exion of the
electrometcr. Since it has annulled the charge, the counter
potential must now be equal and opposite to the natural
potential-difference.
    § 5. During most of the experiments a piece of apparatus
made by Lord Kelvin in or about 1861 was used. In it the
plates were surrounded by a cylindrical zinc case. This was
made in two parts for convenience in manipulation, the lower
<U+FB01>xed to a heavy cast-iron base plate, while the upper stood
upon small brackets attached to the top edge of the lower
part, its position being regulated by a hole-slot-and-plane
arrangement. Openings in the si es of the upper part
facilitated the adjustment of the experimental plates, but these
were closed by a sliding cover during a measurement of
potential.
   The lower plate was supported by an insulating glass stem
which was kept dry by means of pumice and sulphuric acid.
On the to of this stem was a brass cap screwed to <U+FB01>t the
sockets w ich were soldered to the backs of the plates, and
from the brass cap a stiff wire passed out through a hole in
the case and formed the connexion between the insulated
plate and the electrometer.
   A piece of platinum foil Was soldered round a part of this
wire
between      iveplates
        to tghe   a clean contact
                       through  the for  the temporaryand
                                                        connexion
                                     potential-divider,   the wire
from the divider had likewise a platinum end piece.
    The up er plate hung, by a ring at the centre of its back,
on a hook at the lower end of a vertical metal rod which
 could be drawn up so as to increase the distance between the
 plates. A small disk <U+FB01>xed on the rod at right angles to it just
 above the hook had three screws passed through it and pressed

402                 Dr. J. Erskine-Murray 0n
against the plate, holding it <U+FB01>rmly in the hook; by this
means the upper plate can be set parallel to the lower one in
 a very short time. This apparatus, which is the same as that
 used by Lord Kelvin in his experiments many years ago,
 was found to be very convenient, the arrangements enabling
 us to take out and replace a plate very rapidly, a matter of
 great importance when observing temporary variations, while
 at the same time both plates were <U+FB01>rmly attached to their
 supports when in position.
    § 6. The divider, whose total resistance was about 2400
ohms, was made to divide the potential-difference between its
outer terminals into one hundred equal parts. The potential
applied was usually that given by a Daniell cell of Lord
Kelvin’s gravity type, and was tested frequently by comparison
with a standard Clark cell, or by means of a standard resistance
and a current balance.
    § 7. The permanent connexions were as follows :—(1) IThe
lower plate to the insulated pair of quadrants of the electro
meter; (2) The terminals of the Daniell cell to the ends of
the divider (there was a reversing plug in this circuit) ; (3)
 One end of the divider to the upper plate and uninsulated
quadrants of the electrometer.
   The temporary connexion (§ 5) was from the sliding con
tact-piece of the divider to the lower plate.
    § 8. Each experiment was as a rule begun by polishing a
metal plate on clean glass-paper or emery-cloth. Its con
tact potential with a standard plate, generally of electrolytically
deposited gold washed some hours previousl with alcohol, as
used by M. Pellat, was then measured. The plate was next
subjected to some particular treatment; for instance it was

with water, alcohol, or turpentine, or heated in air and
oxidized, or not oxidized, or exposed to steam, or oxygen, or
fumes of iodine or hydrogen sulphide, or simply left to alter

measured, and the change due to the treatment its surface

    § 9. The metal which requires to be joined to the zinc end
of the battery, in order to effect a balance, will be called
positive. Thus aluminium is positive to zinc and zinc positive
to copper. Also, when a plate becomes more positive its
potential will be said to rise; when more negative, to fall.
When the “ potential” of a plate is mentioned, without other
quali<U+FB01>cation, its contact potential-di<U+FB01>'erence with a standard
plate (§ 8) is meant.                                             '

         III. Efects of di<U+FB01>erent hfcthods of Cleansing the
                         .lletallic Surfaces.
     § 11. It seems probable that the very con<U+FB02>icting results
 obtained by different experimenters for the potential-difference
 of any given pair of metals, in air, must be due, to a large
 extent, to differences in the methods by_ which the surfaces
 have been prepared. In order to obtain a metallic surface as
 free as possible from all contamination it is clear that a hard
 polishing agent, such as a clean steel <U+FB01>le, or emery-cloth, 0r
 glass-paper, must be used, as a softer material leaves more of
 itself on the plate. A liquid is quite unsuitable, since every
particle of the metal probably retains particles of the liquid
adhering to it. Thus the smell of a liquid remains long after
the plate appears to be quite dry ; and it has been found that
such a <U+FB01>lm as must exist to cause the odour is quite suf<U+FB01>cient
to alter the potential very considerably.
    § 12. In order to obtain uniformity of action the clean
glass-paper or emery-cloth used to polish a plate was <U+FB01>xed on
a wooden roller made to revolve with a circumferential velocity
of about 100 centim. per second. Care was taken to hold the
plate so that the scratches, caused by the polislier, should all
be parallel. Thus little or no grit could lodge in the surface,
which would have occurred had the scratches crossed one
another. A record was kept of the nature of the polishing
agent in every case. A piece of glass-paper, or other polisher,
was seldom used more than once or twice, and was never used
for any different metal.
    § 13. M. Pellat found that every change in the smoothness
of a surface is accompanied by a change in its contact poten
tial; but as his experiments were limited to metals washed
with alcohol, it was of interest to extend them to more general
cases. Thus a plate of zinc which had been polished on clean
glass-paper, and had therefore a surface sharply scratched in
parallel lines, was found to be
                               '70 volt
positive to the standard gold plate.        It was next burnished
with a. tool of hardened steel, and with the same standard
plate it now gave
                              '94 volt.

404               Dr. J. Erskine-Murray on
Two hours later the same plate gave
                             '92 volt,
showing that the effect is nearly permanent.        By burnishing
the plate again a <U+FB01>ner polish was obtained.        With the same
standard the potential is now
                            1'00 volt,
still further burnishing giving
                            1'02 volt.
 If the zinc be now polished on glass-paper it returns to its
 original potential. Now steel, of which the burnisher was
 made, is negative to zinc; hence this rise cannot have been
 due to particles of steel on the zinc, but must have been
 caused by some change involved in the smoothing process to
 which the zinc had been subjected, possibly by a hardening
 of the surface layer.
    § 14. Intermediate states of polish give intermediate values
 of potential.   For instance, if a zinc plate be <U+FB01>led it will not
 be so sharply scratched as it would be by glass-paper, and of
 course not so smooth as if burnished. lts potential is also
 found to be between those of scratched and burnished zinc.
 Each polishing, with any given material, was usually suf
 <U+FB01>ciently thorough to etface the effects of all previous polishings;
 the potential observed thus depended only on the state of
 surface produced by the polisher used just before the ob
 servation. The results of experiments show that the smoother
 the surface the more positive it becomes.
    § 15. The generalization given in § 14 is supported by the
 results of over one hundred similar experiments with a
 number of metals. The actual results are given in Table I.
  (pp. 406, 407); it will be well, however, to discuss some of
 these in greater detail than is possible in tabular form.
     §16. In order to eliminate the use of diti'erent polishing
  agents, I tried the effect of producing ditTerent states of
  surface by rubbing the plate against another of the same
  metal. Two copper plates which had been polished on glass~
  paper gave
                          (a) +'Ol volt,
                          (b) +‘O4 volt,
  with the standard plate. They were next gently rubbed
  together until parts of each were shiny, and now gave, with
  the same standard,
                          (a) +‘O7 volt,
                          (b) +'07 volt.

                    Volta Electricity of Metals.             405
   In another experiment two coppers which had been-polished
on medium emery-cloth (Davies’s No. 1t) gave, with the
standard plate,
                            (a) —'11v.
                            (b) —'06 v.
When slightly burnished by rubbing them together, they
gave
                            (a) —'02 v.
                            (11) —'()2 v.
Thus, smoothing by mutual friction made both more positive.
The amount of the change is not great, either in potential or
in smoothness, as it is very dif<U+FB01>cult to polish copper on copper,
but the direction of change is the same as previously found,
namely, a smooth surface is more positive than a sharply
scratc ed one.
    § 17. On account of the di<U+FB01>iculty of obtaining a burnished
 surface b     simply rubbing two pieces of the same metal
 together, T tried another form of experiment in which the
 possible effect of the material of the polishing agent is elimi
 nated by using the same tool to produce different states of
surface.    Thus a copper plate was scratched very roughly
with a steel tool, and gave
                               -'07 v.
 with the standard plate, then burnished slightly with the
 same tool it gave
                                —'02 v.
    It had thus risen '05 v. on account of the alteration pro
 duced in smoothing its surface. Thus these results also con
 <U+FB01>rm the conclusion given in § 14.
    §18. It should he noticed that although individual results
 occasionally appear to con<U+FB02>ict, the average value of the
 potential of any given metal when polished with a certain
 agent is almost alwa s in proportion to the smoothness of
 the surface produce . However much one may try, it is
  impossible to get exactly the same state of surface over again,
 but by taking the average of a considerable number of experi
  ments with one polishing agent, a eneral value is got which
  represents the potential given by ghe plate in a certain state
  of polish. It is so arranged that the sharply scratched sur
  faces come at the head of the table, and each succeeding
 polishing agent in the list produces a smoother surface.
     § 19. It should be observed that with soft metals such as
 tin, di<U+FB01>'erent polishers produce but little change in the contact
 potential._ This, though at <U+FB01>rst sight apparently contrary to

 408                Dr. J. Erskine-Murray on
 the results for harder metals, is really in accordance with
 them, for different polishers do not produce appreciably dif
 ferent states of polish on a soft metal. This remark applies
 equally to the fact that a smaller variation was observed with
 “ high conductivity ” copper than with the old copper plate,
 as the old p‘ate was found to be considerably harder than the
 purer “ high conductivity” copper.
     § 20. It is probable that the variation described in this
 chapter is not directly due to roughness or smoothness, but
 rather to alteration, either by change in the outer layer of
 the metal, or in the <U+FB01>lm of condensed air which no doubt
 exists on it, of the interface between metal and air.
           IV. Thin Solid Films of ()a'ides, Iodides, d‘c.
    § 21. Among the earlier experiments were many in which
 the changes due to <U+FB01>lms of oxide of different thicknesses
 were studied ; indeed this was the primary object of investi
 gation suggested by Lord Kelvin. But constant dif<U+FB01>culties
 and ambiguities presented themselves, hindering the inter
pretation of even the simplest experiments, and it was found
 necessary to enlarge the scope of the research in order to
 remove or explain them.
    § 22. The experiments detailed below are among the most
 definite of those carried out. They show large changes in
potential on account of very thin <U+FB01>lms of oxide, and prove
that the amount of change is dependent on the thickness of
 the <U+FB01>lm when below a certain limit.
    § 23. Two plates of cast zinc, which had been carefully
polished on medium glass-paper the day before, gave with
one another
                              +°02 v.,
the upper plate being positive.       The upper plate was now
taken out and heated on the back by means of a very
small blowpipe <U+FB02>ame.         Its face became slightly blistered,
but not much discoloured, and when cold it gave with the
other, which had not been altered in any way,
                              —‘44 v.,
the “minus” indicating that the upper is now negative.
This shows a permanent fall of "46 v. due to heating in air.
    § 24. A plate of rolled zinc, which gave
                              —'04 v.
with another plate of the same material, was heated as in the
last experiment but to a higher temperature, very nearly to
its melting-point. Its face became a streaky yellowish brown,

                    Volta Electricity of .lfelals.            409
slightly purple towards the centre (the brown parts turn
purple it' moistened). When cold, compared with the clean
plate it now gave
                              —'79 v.,
a fall of '75 v. Thus this oxidized zinc plate has practically
the same potential as copper. This great fall of potential
does not take place by exposure to the atmosphere at ordinary
temperatures, unless possibly alter the lapse of many years,
for the potential of zinc plates which have been left unpolished
for many months is only two or three tenths of a volt below
that of clean zinc (see § 34).
   §25. Similar experiments were made with copper. The
<U+FB01>lln of oxide was gradually increased in thickness by
 repeatedly heating the plate, and the potential measured in
each stage of oxidation, the plate being cold. There was a
 change of about '03 v. in the ne ative direction before the
 oxide-<U+FB01>lm became visible, and furt ier increase in the thickness
 of the <U+FB01>lm was judged by the gradual change of colour, until
 the well-known dull purplish black of massive copper oxide
 was attained. The potential, measured each time when the
 plate was cold, gradually t'ell until it reached a limit'of about
 ‘30 volt negative to a standard gold plate, which value may
 therefore be taken as the potential of a mass of copper oxide
 at 15° C.   It may be remarked that there are good reasons,
 which will be given in Chap. IX., t'or supposing that oxida
 tion does not commence in air unless the temperature of the
 plate be raised above 80° U.
    § 26. A plate of copper which had been polished on glass
 paper and then on wash-leather gave
                               +‘20 v.
 with a standard gold plate, and was next held in iodine vapour
 for a short time. It looked moist at <U+FB01>rst, but quickly became
 dry. In this state it gave
                              —'34 v.
 with the same standard, a change 01"54 v. in the ne ative
 direction.    The surface had a dull colour with a w itish
 “bloom” on it, the tint resembling that of clean copper,
 though rather darker. Exposure to iodine vapour thus makes
 the surface of copper nearly as negative as continued ex
 posure to the atmosphere at a high temperature.
Y § 27. The potential of a clean zinc plate fell about '12 v.
 when it had been exposed to iodine vapour.
    § 28. The iodine compounds formed on the metallic surfaces
were not stable, as the appearance and potential of the plates
 altered considerably during twenty hours’ exposure to the
 atmosphere.

                V. Atmospheric or Time E<U+FB01>'ects.
   § 30. A small variation of the potential is usually found to
take place during a short time after the plate has been polished,
and before it has settled down to a more or less permanent
value. This is partly due to the fact that the plate has been
slightly warmed during polishing, and takes some time to
come to the atmospheric temperature (see Chap. 1X.). As
regards changes which are not due to variation of temperature,
I shall give some typical experiments in the following sections
of this chapter.
   § 31. Two plates of “ high conductivity ” copper were
polished on <U+FB01>ne glass-paper, and several experiments by
burnishing them by mutual friction were then made (see
§ 16). Forty-seven minutes after the original polishing their
potentials with the standard plate were
                          (a) +035 v.
                          (b) +045 v.
The plate (a) was left in the apparatus all night, that is to
say, in a position sheltered from dust, and in air partially
dried by the sulphuric acid in the lower part of the case ; the
potential next morning, 20h 3'“ after the measurements given
above, was
                             + '045 v.
with the same standard plate.      It was thus nearly constant.
The plate (b) was left in a rack in the laboratory without
special protection, with the result that next morning the
potential, owing to exposure to the air of the room for about
20", had fallen to
                             —'O56 v.,
a change of —'101 v. The plate (b) was now placed in the
apparatus, and remained nearly constant for two hours at
least. Plate (a) was left in the rack, and its potential fell
0% v. in about 2 hours. It is thus evident that at ordinary
temperatures in a rather dry atmosphere, and in a place pro—
tected from dust and light, the rate of variation of the con
tact-potential of copper is very small; in an exposed place,
however, it is by no means negligible.
   §32. A plate of block tin was polished on glass-paper.
Its potential varied with time as follows, the time being
counted from the completion of the polishing :—

The plate was kept in the apparatus all the time and its
potential taken with a standard gold plate.
   §33. In another experiment a tin plate polished on the
<U+FB01>nest glass-paper gave, after 0h 15'“,
                             +‘525 v.
After 23" 30‘n it gave
                             +‘535 v.
   This experiment was made in June, while the previous one
was made in December. Hence probably the greater rate of
variation in the former was due to a moister and less pure
atmosphere.
    § 34. An old zinc plate which had probably not been
polished for many years gave
                             +'37 v.
with the standard gold plate. It was next polished on glass
paper, and gave
                             +75 V.
with the same standard. This shows that the ultimate effect
of exposure is to make the potential of zinc fall. 1 have found
that in some cases this fall is preceded by a slight rise, as in
the case of tin (§§ 32, 33); but the ultimate e<U+FB02>'ect is in the
negative direction.
   § 35. The potential of a silver plate which had been polished
on glass-paper remained constant for an hour. The experi
ment was not continued further.
   § 36. Aluminium becomes gradually negative in air. In
one case the potential fell about '18 v. in a week. The
time-change of this metal, mainly on account of its large
temperature-variation (see Chap. IX.), is rather di<U+FB02>icult to
determine.
   § 37. An iron plate which had not been cleansed for two
months rose '05 v. when polished. Hence the effect of
exposure had been to make its potential fall slightly.
   § 38. I have included these results, for which, as for many
others like them, I can as yet give no de<U+FB01>nite explanation,

412                 Dr. J. Erskine-Murray on
in the hope that they may serve as a basis for future expe
riment and generalization. The great dif<U+FB01>culty in all such
experiments on contact electricity is to de<U+FB01>ne the circum
stances and, with them, the causes of any given variation.
            VI. Very Thin Liquid Films on <U+FB01>fetals.
   § 39. In the earlier experiments it was found that, as a
rule, copper polished on glass-paper 0r emery-cloth was about
'20 v. negative to the standard alcohol-washed gold plate.
On comparing this value with M. Pellat’s results* I found
that his value for copper was about '20 positive to the same
standard. I at once determined to try his method of cleansing
the plate so as to <U+FB01>nd if the difference ('40 volt) were due to
that alone. For this purpose a copper plate was carefully
polished on glass-paper. It gave, with the standard,
                              -'2() v.
It was then washed with alcohol and allowed to dry in air.
It now gave                    +")2 v
with the same standard. The change due to the treatment is
therefore +'42 volt, and continues permanent many hours.
   § 40. A plate of thickly oxidized copper giving, with the
standard plate,               __24 v
gave, after it had been washed with alcohol and allowed to
dry’                          -00 v.
a rise of '24 volt.
   § 41. A zinc plate, when cleaned on glass-paper, gave
                              +'61 v.
It was then washed with alcohol, and when apparently quite
dry gave                      +94 V”                     ‘
remaining constant at this value for many hours. The rise
in this case is '33 volt.
 I § 42. The results of many similar experiments made with
alcohol and other liquids on gold, silver, zinc, copper, iron,
tin, lead, and aluminium will be found in Table II. It is
notable that in almost every case the contact-potential of a
metal which has been polished on a hard dry material rises at
least '15 volt in consequence of alcohol washing, and that
this change is nearly permanent for many hours after the
plate appears to be quite dry.
   §43. It may be remarked that, as M. Pellat appears to
have invariably washed the metal with alcohol before making
a measurement of its potential, his results do not apply

    directly to metals which have been cleaned b means of a
    hard dry agent only.                      Even in the experiment which he gives
    on pp. 79-80 of his paper as a proof that alcohol-washing
    does not permanently alter the potential of a clean gold plate,
    he appears to have used a plate which had already been
    washed with alcohol; his result, therefore, does not prove that
    alcohol-washing makes no change in contact-potential of a
    clean plate, but only that subsequent washings do not alter
    the state of surface, 2'. e. that the effect is nearly permanent.
    This agrees with the results given above and in Table II.
           § 44. The alcohol <U+FB01>lm, whether in combination with the
    metal or not, must in any case displace the air from the
    surface of the plate. Other liquids seem to leave <U+FB01>lms in
    much the same way, though the change of potential is different
    for each liquid; in some cases, 0. g. turpentine on zinc and
    copper, it is in the positive direction for the positive metal
    and in the negative for the other.

414                 Dr. J. Erskine-Murray on
               VII. Thick Liquid Films on Metals.
    § 45. In experimenting with <U+FB01>lms of sensible thickness
 the liquid was usually placed on a <U+FB02>at metal plate, its surface
 tension being suf<U+FB01>cient to retain it if its depth were not more
 than '3 or '4 centim. In other cases a shallow metal dish
was used. The behaviour of water puzzled me for some
 time, and made me realize the extreme dif<U+FB01>culty of obtaining
 a clean liquid surface. After some preliminary experiments
 I found that distilled water which has not been exposed
to the atmosphere gives fairly constant results when lying to
 a depth of '2 centim. on one of the standard gold plates.
 When water on gold formed the one plate and a dry standard
 gold plate (see § 8) the other, the value found was '10 volt,
 the water being negative. Thus clean water in contact with
 gold is about '10 volt negative to it.       The value found is
 quite different if the water has been exposed to the air for
 some time, and is usually positive instead of negative to the
 standard plate.
     § 46. Air expelled from the lungs produces a very marked
  chan go in the contact-potential of water. By blowing through
  a <U+FB01>ne glass tube which dipped under the surface of a layer
  of distilled water on a gold plate, the potential was changed
 from
                               —'10 v.
  with the standard plate to
                               + '16 v.,
  and remained at this latter value for more than half an hour,
   showing that the change was not due to a rise in temperature.
   The curious point is that the change seems to be only in the
  surface of the liquid; for when most of it was shaken off the
  potential fell to
                               ---'05 v.,
   although the plate was still wet all over. This appears as if
   the alteration were due to a surface <U+FB01>lm of oily or dust
  matter on the water. It was found that distilled water which
  had been exposed to the air of the room for some time gave
   the same value as water which had been breathed through.
      §47. A' lead plate and a <U+FB02>at circular leaden dish were
   scraped clean with a knife, and next morning, when com—
   pared with each other, they gave
                                +'1() v.,
   the plate being positive to the dish.    Water was now poured
   into the dish until it was nearly full, '4 centim. deep, the

                   Volta Elecfa'z'czty of Metals.          415
potential remaining the same; i. e. the lead plate gave with
the water in the leaden dish,
                              +‘10 v.,
water in leaden dish being negative.
   § 48. The plate and dish were again scraped, and this time
they gave
                              4"05 v.,
the plate being positive. Water was next poured into the
dish, which gave, with the dry lead plate,
                      '       + '09 v.,
the water in the dish being negative as before. The dish was
now removed and a standard gold plate put in its place; with
this the lead plate gave
                              + '52 v.,
the lead being positive.     Thus water in contact with lead is
about '09 v. negative to dry lead.
   § 49. Turpentine seems to produce opposite e<U+FB02>'ects on zinc
and copper, i. 0. copper becomes more negative and zinc
more positive when wet. Thus copper and zinc which had
been dry-polished gave with one another
                               '77 v.,
zinc positive.
   With the zinc wet with turpentine,
                               '96 v.
And with both zinc and copper wet about
                              1'20 v.
Their potential-difference increased somewhat as the turpentine
dried up; and when apparently quite dry its value was still
at least
                              1'20 v.,
the plates, however, smelt strongly of turpentine, showing
 that an invisible layer remained on their surfaces.
    § 50. A crystal of copper sulphate gave, with a standard
gold plate,
                              + '02 v.,
copper sulphate positive. This result was obtained in con
nexion with some experiments on the contact-potential of an
aqueous solution of copper sulphate. It was found that such
a solution in a copper dish gave about +'O7 volt with a dry
 standard gold plate, the solutlii‘on being positive. Blotting
                               2 2

 416                 Dr. J. Erskine-Murray on
paper saturated with copper sulphate gave about +‘10 volt
 with the same standard plate. As no special precautions
 were taken in these experiments to obtain a perfectly pure
 liquid surface, one cannot, especially in view of the changes
 described in § 46, be quite certain that they represent the true
 potential of copper coated with a solution of its sulphate.
 They agree, however, with Professors Ayrton and Perry’s
 values for saturated and non-saturated solutions.
    § 51. One of the standard gold plates which had been
 polished with Hollis’s plate-powder used dry gave, with a
 similar plate which had a layer of alcohol'on it,
                              —-‘13 v.
 When the alcohol had dried up the value was
i                             —'05 v.,
 the polished plate being negative as before.
    § 52. The conclusion which I draw from the experiments
 described in this and the preceding chapter and in the tables is,
 that a layer of liquid on a metallic surface does not give, with
 a metal separated from it by air, a de<U+FB01>nite potential-di<U+FB01>'erence
 of its own, as in similar circumstances a solid conducting <U+FB01>lm
 would do, but merely adds a certain amount to that of the
 plate on which it lies. Thus two 'diH'erent metals coated with
  ayers of the same liquid do not, as a rule in air, give zero
 potential-difference, but usually give nearly the same potential
 di<U+FB01>'erence as the dry metals. For instance, the potential of
 lead with an alcohol layer ‘1 centim. deep on it is about
 '13 volt higher than that of dry lead, while! that of wet copper
 is about the same amount higher than the average value for
 dry copper. There is no tendency shewn for a liquid <U+FB01>lm to
 take up a de<U+FB01>nite potential independent of that of the metal
 on which it lies, with any metal separated from it by a
 dielectric, as a solid conducting <U+FB01>lm would do. This seems to
 be the most important distinction between solid and liquid
 conductors, and it is in accord with what is known of voltaie
 cells ; for if the potentialdi<U+FB02>'erences in the chain copper—
 water-zinc were equal and opposite to that of zinc-copper, as
 copper-iron-zinc is to zinc-copper, we should have no electro
 motive force in the circuit,when the materials are all at one
 temperature. In most of my experiments the type is copper
 water-nonconductor (air) -water-zinc and not copper-water
 zinc; the members of the <U+FB01>rst and last pairs are in contact,
while a non-conductor intervenes between the two free water
surfaces, these being able to take up their natural contact
potential-differences with the metals they touch ; but the sum

                            Volta Electricity of Metals.                                                               417
 of the potentials, copper-water and water-zinc, is not equal to
 copper-zine, thus proving that the two free surfaces of water
 are not at the same potential. This is directly demonstrated
 by the experiments of Professors Ayrton and Perry, and by
 the results given in Chaps. VL, VII., and X. of this commu
 nieation.
    If the intervening layers of non-conductor be removed by
joining the liquid surfaces so that there is but one mass of
 liquid between the plates, conduction at once tends to reduce
 the whole liquid to the same potential, leaving the contact
 potential-di<U+FB02>erences, now unbalanced by the removal of the
 non-conducting medium which was capable of sustaining the
 stress, to act as external electromotive force. This then
 shows the connexion between contact-potentials, measured
 clectrostatically by the method described in this paper, and
 the electromotive force of a voltaic cell.
    § 53. The contact-potential of a liquid with a metal is
 clearly, if the air-potentials be neglected, the difference
 between the potential of the dry metal and that of the metal
 when wet with the liquid; the same standard plate being
 used as zero of potential in both cases. The results given in
 the tables must no doubt be in some cases com licated by the
 formation of solid compounds in the interface etween li uid
 and metal so that the liquid is no longer in contact with 0 can
 metal, and the liquid must also displace any <U+FB01>lm of condensed
 air which may exist on the metal.                                              The latter in<U+FB02>uence will
 be discussed in Chaps. VIII. and X.

                   VIII. Films formed on illetals by Gases.
           § 54. The potential of a metal is usually altered by soaking
      the plate in a gas other than air. If the gas be 'oxygen, this
      alteration is as a rule only temporary, and apparently depends
      on the formation of a surface <U+FB01>lm, or rather on a change in
      the <U+FB01>lm which doubtless already exists. It will be shown
      that the change of potential of zinc due to soaking in oxygen
       is nearly equal to that of copper ; hence the <U+FB01>lm of oxygen
       acts like a liquid film (Chap. VII.), but its effect is less
       permanent. Previous experimenters, except Lord Kelvin,
       appear to have neglected the existence of these <U+FB01>lms, and to
       have looked only to the nature of the body of gas between
       the plates. Of course I do not here allude to the “ double
        layer” which has been o<U+FB01>'ered as an explanation of the
        phenomenon, but to a layer in mechanical and electrical
        contact with the metal. If the contact-potential of two
        metals immersed in a gas were the sum of the potential
        ditl'erences between each metal and a skin of gas close to it,
        we should have no slope of potential in the body of the gas
        between the plates.          That a slope does exist, however, is
        proved by Lord K elvin’s earliest experiments with the divided
         ring of copper and zinc.         In this connexion Dr. Bottomley’s
         research on contact-electricity in high vacua‘ is of great
         importance as showing that the volta-potential of metals is
                                   "t B. A. Report, 1885.

not sensibly di<U+FB02>'erent in different gases so long as the metals
are not chemically affected, and is not sensibly altered by a.
great reduction of pressure. The body of the gas may
possibly have some in<U+FB02>uence, but the variations which have
frequently been attributed to it may usually be more satis
factorily explained as being due to change in the <U+FB01>lm in
contact with the metallic surface. In the case of a gas which
acts vigorously on the metal at ordinary temperatures the
<U+FB01>lm is permanent, and is probably a solid compound; in
other cases it is not )crmanent, and hence probably not solid.
   § 55. In ‘Nature for 1881, Lord Kelvin describes some
ver important experiments on this subject. As these appear
to e but little known I shall give some extracts from his
paper before describing my own results. Under the date
November 23, 1880, Lord Kelvin says :—-“ I have found that
a dry platinum disk, kept for some time in dry hydrogen
gas, and then put into its position in dry atmospheric air in the
Volta-condenser, becomes positive to another platinum disk
which had not been so treated, but had simply been left
undisturbed in the apparatus. The positive quality thus
produced by the hydrogen diminishes gradually, and becomes
insensible after two or three days. P.S.——On December 24,
1880, one of the platinum plates in the Volta-condenser was
taken out ; placed in dried oxygen gas for forty-tive minutes;
taken out, carried by hand, and replaced in the Volta-con
denser at 12.30 on that day. It was then found to be
negative to the platinum date, which had been left undis
turbed. The amount of t e difference was about '33 of 11
volt. The plates were left undisturbed for seventeen minutes
in the condenser, and were tested again, and the difference
was found to have fallen to '29 of 0. volt. At noon on the
25th they were again tested, and the difference found to be
'18.   The di<U+FB01>erence had been tested from time to time since
that day, the plates liavin been left in the condenser undis

420                 Dr. J. Erskine-Murray an
    After detailing some experiments in which the plates were
coated with the gases by electrolysis, Lord Kelvin concludes :
“ Thus in the case of polarization by oxygen, as well as in the
case of polarization by hydrogen, the e<U+FB02>'ect of exposure to
the dry gas was considerably greater than the effect of elec
troplating the platinum with the gas by the electromotive
 force of one volt.”
     The large effects on contact—potential produced by <U+FB01>lms
 formed from gases are clearly shown in these experiments of
 Lord Kelvin’s. It is well known that platinum and other
 metals have the property of occluding large quantities of gas
 in their surface layers, and that the condensed gas is possibly
 in the liquid state, which would account for the similarity
 between the e<U+FB02>'ects of liquids and of gases on metals.
     § 56. The plates with which my <U+FB01>rst experiments on this
 subject were made were of “ high conductivity ” copper. They
  had been polished on <U+FB01>ne glass-paper <U+FB01>ve hours before, and
 their mutual potential had remained constant at
                               ‘027 volt
  for four hours. The lower plate was then put into a glass vessel;
  into which oxygen gas was admitted from a cylinder, and the
  oxygen, which was of Messrs. Brin’s manufacture, guaranteed
  93-95 per cent. oxygen (nitrogen is usually the only
  impurity), was allowed to stream through the glass vessel
  containing the plate for some minutes, and the exit and inlet
  of the vessel were then closed.      Forty-<U+FB01>ve minutes later the
  plate was taken out and its potential again measured with
  the other plate, which had remained in air during the interval.
   Counting time from the moment at which the plate was taken
   out of the oxygen, the potential varied as shown below, the
   oxygenized plate being positive to the other in all cases :—
                        Time.            Contact-potential.
                        h.  m.                   v.

    Thus the elfect of increasing the proportion of oxygen in the
    surface <U+FB01>lm was to make the copper more positive.
       § 57. This variation is in the opposite direction to that
    found by Lord Kelvin for platinum which has been soaked in
    oxygen.    In order to make sure that this difference was not
    the effect of some impurity in the oxygen, I repeated his

                      Volta Electricity of .lIetaZs.            421
experiment, obtaining the same result as he had obtained.
This shows that the result iveu above was not likely to be
due to an impurity which had in<U+FB02>uenced the action of the
oxygen.
   § 58. Without any further treatment the same copper late
was placed in the bell-jar and the oxygen admitted.             fter
forty-<U+FB01>ve minutes it was taken out and its potential again
measured by comparison with the other plate.             The results
are given in the following table, time being counted from the
moment the plate was taken out of the oxygen :—
                       Time.         Contact-potential.

    The experiment was discontinued before the plate had
 returned to its original value; but it would no doubt have
 done so in a. few hours, for the amount of change, and its
 rate, are almost exactly the same as in the former experiment
 (see § 56 .
    §59. n the following experiment the conditions were
 somewhat varied. A copper plate was polished on glass
 paper. It gave, with a standard copper plate,
                               — ‘05 v.
 A jet of oxygen was now sent against its surface for two or
 three minutes, and with the same standard plate it now gave
                                —'06 v.
 It was then left in oxygen for twenty-<U+FB01>ve minutes, and on
 being taken out gave

 itsl potential thus coming back to very nearly the original
va no.
     This experiment- shows: (1) that the change requires
considerable time; for even a fairly strong jet of oxygen
playing on the plate for two or three minutes produces no
appreciable e<U+FB02>'ect, while twenty-<U+FB01>ve minutes in still oxygen
causes a rise of '20 v.: (2) that gentle heating does not
produce arise, as it would do with clean unoxy enized copper
 (see Chap. IX.), but it must be remembered t at the copper
 was, when heated, already above the potential to which heat
alone would have raised it; hence this experiment does not
show any connexion between temperature-variation and
density of the oxygen <U+FB01>lm as might at <U+FB01>rst sight be supposed.
     § 60. A zinc plate which had been polished on glass-paper
gave with a standard copper plate
                         '81 v., zinc positive.
It was then put into oxygen and left for <U+FB01>fteen minutes.
After being taken out, its potential was again measured with
the same standard plate, and was as follows .—
                       Time.          Contact-potential.
                      h.    m.                 v.

                     4 35                     '85
This shows that zinc also is more positive after immersion
in oxygen.
    §til.-The same zinc plate was again polished on glass
paper and gave
                               + '73 v.

gave with a copper plate
                                + '40 v.,
tin being positive. Fifteen minutes later the potential of the
plates had not altered. I now put the tin into the bell-jar
and turned on the oxygen. After it had soaked for 47
minutes it was taken out and compared with the same copper
plate. It gave
                        Time.          Contact-potential.

Thus the variation of tin appears to be in the negative direc
tion, like that of platinum.
   § 63. A silver plate, polished on glass-paper, gave with a
standard copper plate
                                —'04 v.,
and remained constant during an hour. It was then put into
oxygen for 15 minutes, and when taken out its potential was
found to be
                        'l‘ime.        Contact-potential.
                       h.    m.                 v.

                      O     59              —'03
Thus by immersion in oxygen for 15 minutes it had risen
:06 v., and had fallen to nearly its original value in an hour
in air.
   §6~L Silver polished on clean “ <U+FB01>ne ” glass-paper gave
 with a standard copper
                                —'095 v.
 After it had been 24 minutes in oxygen it gave in air
                                +'Ol5 v.,
 and 12 minutes later
                                +'OlO v.,
 showing that the potential had in 24 minutes in oxygen
become '110 more positive.
    § 65. It is noticeable that the amount of change in these
 experiments on silver is to some extent proportionate to the

424                 Dr. J. Erskine-Murray on
time of exposure to oxygen. Thus, in § 63, 15 minutes in
oxygen caused a rise of '06 v. ; while, in § 64, 24 minutes
in oxygen caused a rise of '11 v., but there is no doubt a limit
to the change.
   § 66. In searching for an explanation of the temperature
variations described in Chapter IX., I compared them with
those given above. In the case of copper, the oxygen-<U+FB01>lm
variation is in the same direction as the temperature-variation
of copper in air, which suggests the possibility of the latter
being caused by an increase of the proportion of oxygen in
the <U+FB01>lm at higher temperatures 011 account of a greater
attraction between the elements. The same reasoning holds
as regards zinc and tin, but the results for silver are in direct
opposition ; while the further experiments described in
Chapter X., which show that the temperature-variations
exist in cases where air is entirely excluded from the metallic
surface, render such an explanation very doubtful.     Probably,
therefore, the temperature-variation is the more general of
the two, it being a change in contact-potential of the metals,
which, if they are exposed to a gas, may be complicated by
alteration of the surface-<U+FB01>lm.
                  IX. Temperature Variations.
   § 67. A large number of determinations were made of the
variation of contact-electricity with the temperature of the
conductor. This was done by heating one plate while the
other was kept cool ,and their potential-difference was measured
from time to time as the warm plate was cooling, their
temperatures being observed at the same time. In the
diagrams, the abscissze      represent temperature and        the
ordinates potential; each curve, therefore, shows the tem
perature-variation of the contact-potential of a particular
metal. For instance, the potential represented by the point
which corresponds to 16° C. on the gold line is called zero
in this and other chapters of the present communication.
Thus a standard gold plate (see § 8) at 40° C. is '04 v. negative
to one at 16° C., and an aluminium plate at 40° C. is '10 v.,
positive to aluminium at 16° C., or 1'20 v. positive to a gold
plate at 16° C.
   It must be remembered that unless stated otherwise these
variations are for metals in air. In the experiments described
in Chapter X., however, the metallic surfaces were protected
by solid non-conducting <U+FB01>lms, and were not in contact with
the atmosphere; nevertheless, temperature-variations were
found, which in the case of silver were actually larger than
those which took place in air.

   § 68.   One of the co per plates used was hollow and could
be <U+FB01>lled with water an a thermometer inserted, but with the
other plates other methods of measuring temperature had to
be adopted. In some cases the temperature was measured
thermo-electrically, while in others a sim tor and more rapid
mode of measurement was used, which), though not very
accurate, is quite reliable within certain limits.
   §69. By touching the back of the plate I found that its
temperature could be judged as “tepid,” “slightly warm,”
“warm,” “very warm,” and so on. It was found experi
mentally that these terms correspond to constant temperatures ;
or rather that each term denotes a small range of temperature,
the middle point of which may be taken as corresponding to
the term.    In determining the values of these terms a plate
was used in which a thermometer was inserted. One observer
touched the plate with the tips of the <U+FB01>rst and second <U+FB01>ngers
and judged its state, naming it by one of the terms, “ warm,”
“tepid,” &c., the other observed the thermometer, and the
temperatures found to correspond to each term are as
follows :—

   This method of measuring temperature is rough and ready,
but since the possible errors are within limits of a very
few degrees, one only requires to take the average of a
considerable number of results in order to arrive at a. very
fair approximation to the true values. In experiments on
contact electricity in air there are so many possible causes of
disturbance that extremely accurate measurement of the
temperature is of little use, especially if it require that much
time be spent over each reading.
   §70. As a rule the upper plate was heated, in order that
the lower plate might not be affected by drangbts of hot air,
as would have been the case if the lower had been hot and
the upper cold. Sometimes, during the time of cooling, the
upper part of the apparatus, includingr of course the upper

  426                 Dr. J. Erskine-Murray on
  plate, was removed after each observation and was replaced
  only the moment before the next.        In other experiments the
  upper plate was merely drawn up as far as possible (about
  10 cm.) to prevent its warming the lower one. The tempera
  ture of the lower plate was also observed, but as a rule it
  varied only a very few degrees.
     §71. At <U+FB01>rst 1 used to apply a hot soldering-bolt to the
  back of the plate in order to heat it, but latterly I heated two
  or three small blocks of tinned copper and placed them on
  the back of the upper plate. By this second method it was
  possible to observe the variation of the potential during the
  rise as well as the fall of temperature.
     § 72. »In attempting to determine the temperature-coef<U+FB01>cient
  of copper we were long ba<U+FB02>ied by curious anomalies. Some
  times the plate was positive when hot, other times negative,
 and occasionally it did not vary at all. The clue to this was
 found in observing that during one experiment while the
 copper was cooling it was at <U+FB01>rst positive, then negative, and
 then it gradually became positive again, though never quite
 reaching its original value.
     Now it had been found that copper oxide is negative to
 copper, and that it became temporarily more negative when -
 hot; hence it was guessed that the successively positive and
 negative variation must be due to hot clean copper being posi
 tive to cold copper, but that it had <U+FB01>nally become oxidized
 and therefore negative whether hot or cold, the small perma
 nent change being due to the thin coating of oxide formed.
    § 73. The copper was heated much more gently next time,
 and gave the expected result that clean copper becomes
 rapidly more positive as its temperature rises, and that, on
 cooling, its potential returns to its original value unless the
 temperature has exceeded a certain limit.        If this limit has
 been exceeded its potential rapidly becomes negative and
does not return to its original value.
    § 74. At ordinary atmospheric temperatures the surface of
 clean copper remains for a long time almost unaltered either
 visibly or electrically (see § 31), and the <U+FB01>lm which ultimately
 forms on the surface cannot be pure copper oxide because
the potential of tarnished copper is higher than that of
copper oxide obtained by heating in air. If, however, the
temperature of the copper is raised to about 80° C. it imme
diately begins to oxidize, though heating to a temperature
below this limit does not rapidly produce any permanent
change. Thus there is, as it were, an ignition point for
copper and oxygen in air ; below it, little action takes place ;
above it, combination proceeds vigorously.

                               —'02 v.,
the minus sign indicating that the upper plate is negative. I
now heated the upper ; when “ tepid,” 2'. e., about 35° 0., it
gave with the cold plate
              '               —'045 v.
 It was next heated further until “very hot” (57° C.) and
 gave
                               —'()6 v.
 When it had cooled down to “ tepid ” (35° (3.), it gave
                                --'04 v.
 When “cool” (28° 0.),
                               —'03 v.
  Some hours later, when both plates were cold, they gave as
  at <U+FB01>rst
                                — ‘02 v.
      Hence the potential of gold which has been washed with
  alcohol and allowed to dry falls temporarily about '0016 v.
  per degree centigrade rise of temperature.
      § 76. Most of the temperature experiments on cop er were
  made with the hollow plate previously mentioned, which was
  <U+FB01>lled with hot water in which the bulb of a thermometer was
  placed. In many of the experiments on zinc, and also on
   aluminium, a thermo-electric arrangement was used, and the
   results obtained with it do not differ materially from those
   obtained by the above method (§ 69).           These and other
   details are noted on the diagram.
       § 77. The diagram on p.428 gives the temperature-variations
   of all the substances studied. The curves in it are plotted by
   taking the results for each metal of those experiments which
   are most free from all complication or cause of doubt. If the
   curves be prolonged in the direction of lower temperature
   they appear to meet somewhere below -200° 0., and prob
   ably asymptotically to the line representing '4 v. positive to
    standard plate at 16° C. Within their range they show
    contact-potential-di<U+FB01>'erences diminishing with lowered tem
    perature. The only a parent exceptions are clean copper,
    and silver coated wit glass; but both their curves are
    distinctly bent between 16° C. and 50° 0., so that probably
    they are directed towards the same point as the others at
     ower temperatures. Thus it appears that at about —-200° C.
    the contact-potential-di<U+FB01>'erences of metals may vanish, and

                           conducting Films on the dielallz'c Surfaces.
              § 79. As very great di<U+FB02>'erences of opinion seemed to exist
        as to the part played by the layer of air which is close to the
        metallic surface, I devised a method in which it should be
        removed and a <U+FB01>lm of solid non-conducting material of a
        very di<U+FB01>'erent chemical nature put in its place. A copper
        plate which had been polished on glass-paper was <U+FB01>led with a.
        clean dry <U+FB01>le which had not been used for any other metal.

430               Dr. J. Erskine-Murray on
The copper plate Was now gently heated with a bolt until it
was hot enough to melt parat<U+FB01>mwax ; the temperature, about
50° 0., required for this is not suf<U+FB01>cient to cause sudden
permanent change of the copper surface (see § 74). Paraf<U+FB01>ni
wax was then poured on, and the plate was <U+FB01>led with its own
<U+FB01>le while covered with molten wax. Thus the fresh surface
exposed by the <U+FB01>ling came directly into contact with the
wax. More wax was poured on and the <U+FB01>lings drained off,
the plate remaining well covered with wax all the while. It
was then allowed to cool, and gave with the bare zinc plate
                            + '555 v.,
zinc being positive as before. Thus the change due to
substituting paraf<U+FB01>n-wax for air next the copper is not more
than +‘100 v. I now waxed the zinc in exactly the same
way. When it was quite cool it gave with the Waxed copper
                            +‘602 v.,
showing that Waxing the zinc had raised its potential
                            + '047 v.
 SO on the whole, the substitution of wax for air on both
copper and zinc had only decreased their mutual potential by
                            + '053 v.
 and the potential of the waxed plates remained nearly
 constant for several hours.. The changes due to waxing the
 plates as giVen above were con<U+FB01>rmed by the independent
 Comparison of each plate with the standard gold plate.     It
 does not follow that even the small changes which did occur
 were due solely to the substitution of wax for air, for they
 may have been caused by slight changes in the surface on
 account of the <U+FB01>ling.
    §80. An aluminium plate was coated with wax in the way
 described in §79, a knife being used to scrape the surface
 under the molten wax.      When cold, this waxed plate gave
 with a bare zinc one
                             +‘36 v.,
 which is about the usual value for bare aluminium and zinc.
 The removal of the air had therefore not appreciably altered
 the potential.
    §81. I now warmed the waxed aluminium slightly.        Its
 potential with the zinc varied as follows :—
                  47° C. . . . . + '41 v.
                  35° C. .    . .   .  +‘37 V.
                   28° C. .   . .   .  +‘35 v.

                      Volta Electricity of Metals.              431
 This gives a variation of about
                   '0032 v. per degree centigrade,
 which is nearly the same as the temperature-variation of bare
 aluminium in air.
    §82. A plate of silvered glass used with the glass side
 facing a standard plate gave almost the same potential as
 clean silver in air.     This plate, which was practically silver
 coated with glass, gave a temperature-variation larger than
 that of silver in air. In this case we have glass in contact with
 the silver surface instead of air, but the change does not alter
 the potential. It may be mentioned that the back of the
 silver <U+FB01>lm was painted black, and not coated with glass ; but
 this is of small consequence, since it has been proved by
 experiment that the condition of the back of a plate does not
 sensibly affect the volta contachpotential; or, more generally,
 that if parts of a plate be in different conditions, the potential
 observed will be the mean of the potentials of the different
parts, the importance of each part being proportional to its
capacity.
    §83. On account of the great attraction of sodium for
oxygen, it ‘seemed of interest to measure its potential in cir
cumstances which excluded that gas from the surface of the
metal. In order to effect this two pieces of thin sheet-glass,
each about 6 cm. square, were put into a dish of melted
paraf<U+FB01>n-wax together with some clean sodium, and a large
drop of the sodium was put between the plates of glass and
squeezed out into a small plate of 3 or 4 square cm. area.
The glass plates, with sodium between them, were taken out
of the melted wax and allowed to cool. Since the glass plates
were of much larger diameter than the sodium, the edges of
the latter were protected by the wax which <U+FB01>lled up the space
between the plates not occupied by sodium. The <U+FB02>at faces
of the sodium were apparently in contact with the glass.
The sodium was connected to the electrometer by a <U+FB01>ne
copper wire. The reater part of the sodium surface was
bright or only slight y tarnished, and it remained in almost
the same condition for many days, being protected by the
  lass plates and b the wax which <U+FB01>lled the space between
5mm unoccupied y sodium. The <U+FB01>rst measurements gave
sodium
                               2'86'v.
positive to a tarnished zinc plate, 2'. e. about
                               3'56 v.
positive to the standard gold plate.      This potential gradually
decreased.

432-            Mr. A.,P. Wills on the Susceptibility of
      § 84. Experiments were made to make s1'1re that the result
was not due to temporary electri<U+FB01>cation of the glass. For
instance I breathed on the glass, causing a conducting layer_
of impure water to form on its surface. Repeated measure
ments, made by the usual method, showed that the potential
at once fell to a small fraction of a volt, but slowly rose again
to nearly its original value as the <U+FB01>lm evaporated.      This shows
 that the electri<U+FB01>cation was not a temporary one of the glass
 surface, for that would not have returned to a de<U+FB01>nite value.
 Heating the plate by radiation or washing the glass with
 benzol caused the potential to rise further, but in no case was
 the potential quite so high as when the plate was <U+FB01>rst formed.
 An even more convincing proof that the potential measured
 was really that of the sodium was found inthe fact that the
 sensibility of the apparatus was such as would be given by a
 plate the size of the sodium. It the electrification had been
 on the whole surface of the glass, the sensibility, on account
 of the larger surface, would have been at least ten times as
 great as that observed.
    , § 85. The experiments described in this chapter show that
   (i.) when two metals are coated with the same non-conductor,
 such as wax or glass, their potential is not sensibly diti‘erent
 from that of the bare metals in air; (ii.) that temperature
 variation still takes place, though air be excluded. These
 results seem to prove that gaseous <U+FB01>lms play no essential
 part in the phenomenon.
      XLIV. On the Susceptibility of Diamagnetic and Weakly

 '      ARADAY U845) showed that all substances, whether
           solid, liquid, or gaseous, are either diamagnetic or
 magnetic. Previously, however, Brugmans (1778) and
 Becquerel 1827) observed certain diamagnetic phenomena.
       By way of relative measurement' of the coef<U+FB01>cient of
 susceptibility, a great deal has been done by various
 physicists, among them Pliicker and Faraday. For bismuth
 there have been a number of determinations in absolute
 measure. It will su<U+FB01>ice to mention here four of the best
 methods used :—l. The method used by Uhristie‘l' (1858)
 depends upon the comparison of the inductive action of the
 magnetized bismuth with that of a solenoid through which a
 known current is <U+FB02>owing. , 2. The method used by Topler

 and Jacques‘l' (1875)) depends upon the measurement of the
 in<U+FB02>uence of the diamagnetic force upon the time of swing of
 a piece of bismuth suspended in an inhomogeneous magnetic
 <U+FB01>eld. 4. The method used by von Ettingshausenill (1882)
depends upon the measurement directly ot' diamagnetic action
 at a distance.                                                          >

    von Ettingshausen also made absolute determinations of
the susceptibility for antimony and tellurium. There has
 been a considerable amount of work done by various physi
cists by way of determination of the susceptibility for liquids
and gases. A great number of liquids and gases have been
 used, and the susceptibility has been determined for them
by different methods. The results thus obtained sometimes
di<U+FB02>'er widely.
    Concerning the determination of the susceptibility for
bodies in which it is exceedingly small it may be said that the
methods previously used have sometimes su<U+FB02>'ered greatly in
consequence of the weakness of the action to be observed.
No doubt many of the divergent results obtained by different
physicists are due in large measure to dissimilarity in the
samples of the substance experimented upon. In some cases,
however, they seem due to some chronic weakness in the
method of experimentation. A fundamental dif<U+FB01>culty met
with in the elaboration of a method for the study of diamag

lar e as possible.
      11 the autumn of 1895 *, acting upon the suggestion of
Prof. A. G. Webster, I attempted to determine the suscepti
bility of substances by suspending an ellipsoid of the substance
in a homogeneous magnetic <U+FB01>eld, and observing the times of
oscillation with a known <U+FB01>eld and with no <U+FB01>eld. I failed in
this object owing to the fact that I was unable to obtain a<U+FB01>eld
 which was uniform to a suf<U+FB01>cient degree of approximation,
the effect which I wished to observe depending upon the
 square-of the extremely small quantity 1:, while the effect
 depending upon the non-uniformity of the <U+FB01>eld varies with
 the <U+FB01>rst power of 1c.
    The purpose of the present paper is to describe a method
 for the determination of K for bodies in which it is extremely
 small and either positive or negative, and to give the actual
 results obtained from experiments upon a large number of
 substances.
                     Description of the Apparatus.
     It has long been known that if any substance be introduced
 into an inhomogeneous magnetic <U+FB01>eld it experiences a
 mechanical force which tends to make it enter a stronger or
 weaker part of the <U+FB01>eld, according as the substance is mag
 netic or diamagnetic. To determine this force the amount
 and distribution of the <U+FB01>eld in which the substance is placed
 must be known.
     I shall describe the apparatus used in the present experi
 ments, and in the theory of the method shall show that the
 apparatus as here deScribed is adequate to allow for certain
 simpli<U+FB01>cations in the general theory, giving the force acting
 on a body placed in an inhomogeneous magnetic <U+FB01>eld. As a
 result of these simpli<U+FB01>cations we get an expression for the
 mechanical force upon the body in a convenient direction,
 which involves the <U+FB01>eld-strength at the two limiting surfaces
 only, in that direction. A suitable form for the experimental
 body is that of a thin rectangular slab. Fig. 1 will give a
 general idea of the arrangement of the apparatus.
    1* In connexion with this work I noticed a very remarkable behaviour
 of non-conductors in a magnetic <U+FB01>eld, which led me to suspect an action
 akin to hysteresis in iron.   As my direct object at that time was to
 establish a method for the determination of coef<U+FB01>cients of susceptibility
 I dld not push my experiments far enough to warrant my publishin
 results. Mr. Duane has published (Wied. Ann. Bd. lviii. p. 517, 1896)
 an account of similar experiments performed by him in the physical
 laboratory at Berlin, which seemed to indicate hysteresis in non-con
 ductors, but in which later research showed the effect to be due to traces
 of iron (Wled. Ann. lxi. p. 436, 1897).

    In <U+FB01>g. 4 is shown the suspension arrangement used in
 holding the slab. P is the suspension-wire from the balance
 beam passing through the vulcanite cross-arm e. TV and W/
 are rigid brass wires passing easily through slots in c, and
 supported by means of nuts d and d’, the upper ends of W
 and \V’ being threaded ; b and b’ are small vulcanite blocks
 to which the rigid wires W and W’ are <U+FB01>rmly attached. A
 part of the surface f of block I; is made conducting and in
 metallic connexion with \V ; likewise a conducting part of
surface f1 is in metallic connexion with “1". For holding
 the slab S, a clamp operated by the screw s is used; for
 making the necessary adjustments in the positions of S, the
 nuts 0, d, d’ serve. The reason for making the surfaces f
 and f’ partly conducting and in metallic connexion with W
 and \V’ respectively will be made clear when the method
 used in making the <U+FB01>eld determination is described. In
 circuit with the magnet coils of A there is an ammeter which,
 with a variable resistance, serves to keep the current con

 also a commutator which serves to change readily the direction
 of the current through the magnet coils.

 magnetic force H and the magnetic induction 28 respectively.
    Referring to <U+FB01>g. 3, let the axis of X be in the line of
 symmetry perpendicular to the pole faces; let the axis of Z
 be vertical and the axis of Y be perpendicular to the axes of
 X and Z.     We wish to <U+FB01>nd an expression for the mechanical
 force acting upon the slab when placed relatively to the pole
 pieces as shown in <U+FB01>g. 3. There will be discontinuity in the
 stress-components XI, Y,, Z,, Y,, Zr, X, at the surface of the
 slab where there is discontinuity in the permeability ,u. and
 the forces per unit area are equal to the amounts of the dis—
 continuities. Let the permeability of the slab be [L2, and let
the permeability of the surrounding medium (air, in the
present case) be M.     The slab used is so thin that through
out its whole thickness the tubes of induction may be assumed
parallel to the X-axis, and consequently perpendicular to the
faces perpendicular to the X-axis.
    With this assumption we have then
                   z,=Yy=Y,=Z,=Xy=0,
and <U+FB02> Xz dy dz taken over the two surfaces of the slab per
pendicular to the X-axis equals zero.    In a similar way the
surface-integral of‘ the forces taken over the two surfaces
perpendicular to the Y-axis vanishes. But now consider the
forces on the two faces perpendicular to the Z-axis. The
conditions of symmetry applicable to the other faces do not
hold here. Consider the lower Z-face, that is, the face be
tween the poles. The equations show that all forces vanish
at this face save Z2, and we have then the force Zz given in
medium of permeability #1 by
                         Zz= 8;l am,

   The difference in these two values ives us the total force

where H’ is the magnetic force at the top surface.
   The difference between P1 and 1” times the area of the
 Z-face will give us the total force acting in the line of sus

vertical force, is given by

Now experiment shows that H’2 is negligible in comparison
with H12. If #1, the permeability of air, be assumed equal
to unity, we have                                              .

where H is put for H1, and x for K“.
   For the determination of K it is, accordingly, only necessary
to determine P the mechanical force acting on the slab, H
the magnetic force at the bottom of the slab, and the area of a
 cross-section of the slab. In determining the strength of the
 <U+FB01>eld the balance mentioned above was used. A known
current is sent through a conductor placed in that part of the
<U+FB01>eld the strength of which we wish to measure, and then the

  440       ' Mr. A. P. Wills 0n the Susceptibility of ‘
  vertical force F upon the conductor is} determined by means
  of the balance. The <U+FB01>eld is given by the equation
                              H- lOgF11 ’
  where I is the current in amperes, lis the length of the wire in
  centimetres, F is the force in grams measured by the balance.
     A rectangular slab of plaster-of-paris was made with nearly
  the dimensions of the experimental slabs. On three edges of
  this slab (the bottom edge and the two' side edges) were
 pasted thin strips of tinfoil just as wide as the slab was thick.
 Now when this slab is clamped in the clamp of the suspension
  apparatus, so that the tinfoil of the side edges is in contact
  with the metallic part of the surfacesf and f’, we shall have
 metallic connexion between W and W’ by way of the tin
 foil along the sides and across the bottom of the slab.   When
 a <U+FB01>eld determination is to be made the slab is adjusted with
 reference to the poles in just the same manner as are the
 experimental slabs. Then the tinfoil strip across the bottom
 of the slab is a conductor in the <U+FB01>eld we wish to determine.
  Since the corners turned by the tinfoil are very sharp the
 length of this conductor can be determined with great
 accuracy. '                                                     -
     For the determination of the current I a Weston millivolt
 meter was used in connexion with a german-silver shunt.
 The millivoltmetor was carefully calibrated by means of a
 Rayleigh current-weigher constructed by Mr. S. N. Taylor
 in connexion with his work on Clark and Weston cells.
                    Zllet/rod of_E'wpe1'imentat5011.
    The substance for a series of experiments having been
 selected, the <U+FB01>eld magnets were excited with the proper
 current regulated by a suitable. resistance. An assistant kept
 the needle of an ammeter in' circuit with the magnet coils
 always over a selected line of the scale. The plaster-of-paris
 slab described above was then introduced into the proper
 position. Equilibrium was obtained when no current passed
 through the conductor in the <U+FB01>eld and a reading of the balance
taken. A current measured by the Weston millivoltmeter
 was then sent through the conductor and a new reading
taken when equilibrium had been again secured. The differ
ence in these two readings gave the .force in grams F, due to
the <U+FB01>eld, upon the current in the conductor. Then the
plaster slab was removed and a slab of one of the substances
to be investigated introduced, and a reading of the balance

        Diamagnetic and Weakly Magnetic Substances.            441
taken when equilibrium obtained. The slab was then reversed,
top for bottom, and another reading obtained. This process
was then gone through with all the <U+FB01>ve or six substances
selected for a particular series of experiments, another deter
mination of the <U+FB01>eld being made in the middle of the series
and still another at the end.
   After the last <U+FB01>eld determination, and while the <U+FB01>eld
magnets were still excited, a reading of the balance was
obtained with no slab in the clamp ot' the suspension apparatus.
This reading was to enable us to make correction for any
magnetic action upon the suspension apparatus itself. The
current through the magnet coils was then cut oti'.        ’ '
   The wires 20 and 10’ were hung in long loops from <U+FB01>xed
supportsin the balance-case to a little rubber support <U+FB01>rmly
attached to the suspension rod P.        From this, being well
insulated, they were twined about the rod Pand connected
with W and W’ at the nuts (I and d’, as shown in <U+FB01>g. 4.
These wires would vary slightly in length when a current
passed and correction had to he made for this. Both wires
10 and 10’ Were connected with one nut (d, <U+FB01>g. 4) and the
same current used in making the <U+FB01>eld determination was thus
sent over the <U+FB02>exible wires in the balance-case, without going
near the <U+FB01>eld magnets. A reading of the balance was taken
 when the current had been )ropcrly adjusted.
   The residual <U+FB01>eld was tlen eliminated with great care.
This was done by reversing over and over again a small
current through the magnet coils until the balance gave no
indication of a <U+FB01>eld when a current was sent through the
conductor arranged as when the <U+FB01>eld was determined. '
   The slabs were then, each in turn, clamped in the clamp of
the suspension apparatus and readings of the balance with
the zero <U+FB01>eld taken. These readings, with those taken with
the <U+FB01>eld on and with the proper corrections mentioned above,
are sut<U+FB01>cient- to determine the mechanical force in the Z
direction. This force we have, in the theory of the method,
called P.     '
   A scale graduated to read <U+FB01>fths ot' a millimetre was used
to determine the width of the slab, and a Brown and Sharpe
micrometer screw-gauge graduated to read thousandths ot' a
centimetre was used to determine the thickness of the slab.
The product of this width and thickness gave the area A. In
making these width and thickness measurements, many
measurements were taken on a given slab and the mean of
these used in the calculations. '

                Special attention was thus bestowed upon the study of the
            magnetic properties of marble since it has been often used as
            a means of support for coils in standard apparatus. The
            results obtained seem to indicate that almost any variety of
            marble can be relied upon to be diamagnetic and free from
            iron, and to have a magnetic susceptibility of about
            —'8><10"‘.                   Therefore it would seem that a free use of
            marble in magnetic ap aratus is allowable.

        It should be noticed that the coef<U+FB01>cient of susceptibility for
     tin is positive, that is, the present experiments would seem to
     indicate that tin is magnetic. Now previous experiments upon
     tin have clearly shown it to be diamagnetic, and the conclusion
     to be drawn in the present case is that the sample used must
     have contained traces of iron. The glass used was a piece of
     <U+FB01>ne optical glass. The value of 1c obtained for this piece of glass
     is four or <U+FB01>ve times the value usually given. Aluminium is
     seen to have a positive value of 1c and quite large.

     and Amend, of New York, and was supposed to be chemically
     pure. The results for antimony seem to show that the sample

       There has been in the pasta difference of opinion among
   physicists as to whether diamagnetic substmces are or are
   not less susceptible under the application of large m ignetizing
   forces. Most of the earlier experimenters, among them
   Tyndall, Joule, and Becquerel, found reason to believe that x
   is constant for diamagnetic substances. Pliicker, however,
   believed that in some cases, as the magnetizing force is
   increased the coef<U+FB01>cient of susceptibility x for diamagnetic
   bodies decreases in a similar way as in iron. Pliicker also
   thought he observed in some cases an increase in x with an
   increase in the magnetizing force up to a certain point, after
   that a decrease ; that is, for a certain value of the magnetizing
   force 1c has a maximum. Silow" (1880) published results
   which indicate that x for ferric chloride increases for a while

    that I: for this substance is constant within wide limits of the
    <U+FB01>eld-strengths ; and in the light of these results it would
    seem probable that for solids, at any rate, 1c is constant.

  On the Function of the Condenser in an Induction-Coil.   4&7
phenomena in solid bodies, described in the present paper, is
easily adapted to the study of liquids, and of gases under

    At various intervals during the present century many
different physicists have been interested in the study of dia
magnetism. But notwithstandin the fact that many have
worked upon the problems which a. study of diamagnetism
offers, there seem to be some things in connexion with the
subject which merit more careful investigation. For instance,
the question as to whether or not a diamagnetic body, after
being under the in<U+FB02>uence of a magnetizing force and this
force withdrawn, requires, if left mechanically undisturbed, a
“coercive force ” to bring it to the neutral magnetic state
again, is still an open one. Of course the extreme smallness
of the action to be measured is the great difficulty en
countered in any quantitative work in diama netism.
    For the illustrations used in this paper     have to thank
Mr. Joseph Daniels, of the Colorado State Normal School. I
am under great obligations to Dr. A. G. Webster, Professor
of Physics at Clark University, for suggestions and advice
  iven while the work was being carried out, also to Clark
   niversity for providing the necessary apparatus.
XLV. On the Function of the Condenser in an Induction-Coil.
                    By T. MIZUNO, Riga/cushi".
     HE e<U+FB02>iciency of an induction-coil is greatly increased by
       the employment of a condenser in its primary circuit, in
accordance with [*‘izeau’s suggestion, but the part played by
the condenser is not yet clearly known. The most commonly
accepted opinion is that the extra_current in the lprimary
circuit, instead of being expended in making a spar at the
interruptor, darts into the condenser and hastens the decay
of the primary current, thereby raising the terminal petential—
difference of the secondary circuit. Moreover, according to
this view, if a condenser is inserted across the interrupter,
then on breaking the primary current it continues to run on
into the condenser for a while; but then rebounds, and is
reversed in sign, retaining its initial full strength. Hence
the electromotive force set up in the secondary circuit is the
joint result of a stoppage of a prunary current and its im
mediate reversal in direction.     But this simple explanation,
however plausible at <U+FB01>rst sight, is yet an imperfect account
of the function of the condenser. In this paper, I propose to
                   ' Communicated by the Author.

 448            Mr. T. Mizuno on the Function of
 communicate the results of my investigations on the con
 denser, which seem to me to throw some new light on its
 action. The object of my investigation was to examine the
 effect which variations of the capacity of the condenser
 inserted in the primary circuit produced upon the maximum
 spark-lengths ot' the secondary, when the primary current
 was kept constant.
                          Ewperiments.
    An induction-coil 11 centim. in diameter, 21 centim. in
 length, and having a mercury interruptor was used for
 experiment. The condenser of the coil was removed, and an
adjustable condenser was put in its place. The primary
 circuit was fed by nine accumulators, the strength of the
 current being regulated by means of a rheostat.
    The arrangement of the experiment is shown in the annexed
 <U+FB01>gure :—
                                             P   S

                           Q} :| | | . S
   P and S denote the primary and the secondary circuits
respectively. Q is the mercury interruptor, and the inter
ruption was effected by band.      C is the condenser, whose
capacity could be varied between 0'05 and 1'00 microfarad.
   The maximum spark-lengths between the terminals of the
secondary circuit were determined by a point-plate spark
micrometer R, each measurement being made <U+FB01>ve times, and
the primary current was measured by a Lord Kelvin’s graded
current-meter G.
   Since 'the spark-length depends, to a large extent, upon the
surface conditions, especially on that of the point, the latter
was each time thoroughly polished with sand-paper. Even
with this precaution the spark-lengths occasionally showed
some irregularities.   The results of observation are given in
the following table :—

                                         Capacity in microfarads.
                    Thus the relation which the capacity of the condenser bears
                 to the maximum spark-length between the terminals of the
                 secondary circuit with various primary currents is made
                 clear.
                    Next I took another induction~coil, 11‘5 centim. in diameter
                 and 21'5 centim. in length, with a platinum interruptor.
                 The condenser of the coil was taken o<U+FB01>', and the adjustable
                 condenser was inserted just as in the case of the <U+FB01>rst experi
                 ment. Also the mercury interrupter was substituted for the
                 platinum interruptor, and then experiments were carried on.

               the Condenser in an Induction-Coil.             453
                             DISCUSSION.
   The curves for the two coils both indicate that for a given
primary current there is a corresponding special capacity
which makes the secondary spark-length a maximum. They
also show that the value of the capacity for maximum spark
]ength becomes larger as the'primary current becomes stronger.
Again, the character of the curves is such that each of them
rises very rapidly at <U+FB01>rst until a maximum point is reached,
and then falls down somewhat gradually.
   Hence below this maximum point the effect of capacity is
to increase the secondary spark-lengths at a rate much greater
than that at which it diminishes them beyond this point.
Since the sole object of an induction-coil is to et the greatest
possible spark-length, that is to say, the higiest attainable
potential-difference at the secondary terminals, makers of
induction-coils must pay great attention to the above fact.
   An insuf<U+FB01>cient as well as an excessive capacity spoils the
action of coils to a large extent; and it is therefore necessary
to carefully <U+FB01>nd out by experiment the most suitable capacity
for each coil before construction. Froma mere consideration
of minimizing a spark at the interrupter of the primary circuit
one might be induced to add an extra capacity to the circuit.
This addition of capacity, if the condenser belonging to the
circuit is already suf<U+FB01>cient or too great, would not onl be
useless but will do harm. What amount of capacity, t en,
must be inserted in the coil? To settle this question is not a
simple matter. As the curves show, the <U+FB01>ttest capacity
depends upon the strength of the primary current, and conse
quently it is necessary to choose a capacity giving a maximum
resonance-e<U+FB02>'ect, so to speak, for the possible strongest current
allowable to the primary circuit. In the two induction-coils
examined by me their condensers both had wrong capacities.
   For on measurement the capacit of the condenser in the
<U+FB01>rst coil was found to be 0078, while that of the second was
0'75 microfarad. Judging from the results of my observations
and also from actual experiments with those condensers, the
<U+FB01>rst coil had a smaller, the second a much greater capacity
than was necessary. One recent valuable research on induction
coils is that of Colley ’, who examined both theoretically and.
experimentally the action of his induction-coil.
   A few months ago Walter'l’ also published an interesting
paper on the same subject.        In fact, he found that there is a
               ' Culley, “'ied. Arm. xliv. p. 109 (189] ).
                t “'alter, Wied. A’IIH. lxii. p. 3C0 (1897).

 454      Mr. “'ilson on the Influence of Dissolved Substances
 certain capacity giving a maximum spark-length for a given
 primary current, just as my experiments prove.
    But he did not examine the relation of capacities with several
 primary currents, as I have done. From theoretical consi
 deration he drew the conclusion that a maximum secondary
 potential-difference E2 is equal to J1 ~/ Z2 /C1, where J1 is the
 primary current, Z2 the coef<U+FB01>cient of self-induction of the
 secondary circuit, and 01 the capacity of the condenser in the
 primary. This conclusion, however, does not appear to me
 to be valid.
    Fora comparison of the above formula with experimentally
 observed facts brings out a rather wide discrepancy as to the
 capacity effect. In my view' the existing theories of the
 induction-coil as they stand are yet insuf<U+FB01>cient to account
 for all the observed phenomena, especially the e<U+FB02>'ect of capacity
 on secondary spark-lengths.
    This might perhaPs arise from the incompleteness of the
 data in establishing the theories, that is to say, mathematically
 writing down the differential equations for the primary and
 secondary circuits. For according to the existing theories
 the coe<U+FB02>icients of self-induction and mutual induction are
 both regarded as constant, and almost no aceount is taken of
 the relation which they bear to the e<U+FB02>'ect of capacity, and also
 the variable magnetization of iron bundles in the primary
circuit.
   To sum up, in order to elaborate the theory of the induction
coil to a greater perfection, I believe a considerable number
of further experiments on the mutual relations of capacity,
self-induction, and the magnetization of iron bundles in the
coil must be made.

XLVI. On the In<U+FB02>uence of Dissolved Substances and of Elec
   tri<U+FB01>cation on tile .Re-formation of Clouds. By HAROLD A.
   WILSON, B.Sc. Lond.         Vict., Trinity College, Cambridge,
   1851 Exhibition Scholar *.
THE object of the experiments described below was to see
     whether clouds consisting of dilute solutions of various sub
stances after being destroyed by bubbling through sulphuric
acid would reappear on passing into air saturated with
moisture, and also to see whether electrifying the cloud had
any effect on its power of reappearing.
            “ Communicated by Prof. J. J. Thomson, F.R.S.

     and of Electri<U+FB01>cation on the Re-formation of Clouds.         455
    The fact that vapours of various substances, e. g. sulphuric
acid, form clouds in moist air is well known, and ldo not
propose to make any attempt to describe previous work
connected with this subject.
    As J. S. Townsend has shown ', the oxygen and hydrogen
evolved by the electrolysis of dilute sulphuric acid or caustic
potash solutions are electri<U+FB01>ed, and also form clouds in presence
of moisture. These clouds can be destroyed by bubbling
through sulphuric acid and reappear on passing into water
without much loss of charge.               Gases evolved in certain
chemical reactions behave in a similar manner (see Townsend,
loo. cit. and also Enright, Phil. Mag, 1890).
    The gases evolved b electrolysis or by the action of acids
on metals carry with them a spray of the solution in which
they are formed, and previous eXperimenters have arrived at
di<U+FB02>'erent conclusions with regard to the part played by this
spray in the above phenomena.
    In the papers referred to above, Townsend arrives at the
conclusion that the formation of the clouds in the newly
prepared gases is probably an electrical phenomenon, and is
not the result of the presence in the gas of spray.
    Another view is that the spray of acid condenses moisture
on itself, so forming the clouds, and that the electric charge
in the gas does not have any important effect on the formation
of the clouds.
    The ap aratus I employed is'shown in the accompanying
<U+FB01>gure.      t consisted of a Gouy sprayer S, which was worked
by the air supplied by a water-pump P.

Gases,” Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc. vol. ix. pts. v. & vii.

  456     Mr. Wilson on the In<U+FB02>uence of Dissolvrd Substances
      The pressure of the air was indicated by the mercury
   manometer M, and was usually 30 cms. The air could be
   saturated with moisture if necessary by gently warming water
   in the <U+FB02>ask W. The spray was projected into a four-necked
   globe G, which also contained the solution being sprayed.
  The spray given by this sprayer was very abundant and <U+FB01>ne,
   and formed a cloud which did not settle for a considerable
  time.
     The air containing the cloud was bubbled through sulphuric
  acid in the two wash-bottles, and then through water in the
  <U+FB02>ask F. The rate of bubbling was regulated at the outlet
  tube T, where most of the air was allowed to escape.
     On spraying distilled or tap-water no cloud could be detected
  in F usually, though sometimes a very faint cloud appeared.
  If a dilute solution of sulphuric acid was sprayed, then a
  cloud appeared over the water in F. If the air from which
  the dilute-acid cloud had been removed by bubbling through
  the sulphuric acid was collected in a dry <U+FB02>ask, n0 cloud could
  be detected in it; but on adding a little water and shaking
  gently so as to saturate the air in the flask with moisture, a
  cloud was formed. This occurred even if the dry <U+FB02>ask con—
  taining the air was allowed to stand for half an hour before
  the water was put in it.      One gram of H2SO.1 in a litre of   up.
  water produced a dense cloud.
     Dilute solutions of H3P04, KOH, CaCl-z, NaCl, KQCOB,
  sugar, and glycerine all gave a similar effect, and the presence
  of the alkali metals in the cloud could be easily shown by
 passing it into a bunsen <U+FB02>ame. The solutions when made up
 so as to contain equal numbers of molecules of the dissolved
 substance per litre gave apparently about equally dense
 clouds. A considerable change in the strength of a solution
 was, however, necessary to produce a sensible change in the
 density of the cloud.
     A solution of potassium uranium sulphate gave a similar
 cloud in F, as also all other solutions of non-volatile sub
 stances we tried. Dilute hydrochloric acid gave no cloud in
 F unless the solution contained about 5 per cent. or more of
 HCl, when a cloud appeared, no doubt due simply to dry
 HCl gas entering F. Acetic acid solutions gave no cloud in F.
    The explanation of the re-formation of the cloud in F is
 evidently very simple. The small drops of solution forming
the original cloud evaporate to the sulphuric acid, and minute
particles of salt or other substance remain which are too small
to form a visible cloud. These particles on coming into a
moist atmosphere condense water on themselves, re-forming
the visible cloud.

    and of Electri<U+FB01>cation on the Re-formation of Clouds.               457
   A tube containin a plug of glass-wool introduced between
the sulphuric acid gottles and F did not prevent the reap
pearance of the cloud in F, unless it was several inches long
and tightly packed.
   To try the effect of electri<U+FB01>cation on the clouds a wire E
was <U+FB01>xed opposite the nozzle of the sprayer and connected to
one of the poles of a. battery of 400 cells giving about 700 to
800 volts. The other pole of the batter and the solution in
the sprayer were connected to earth. T e original cloud was
now found to be strongly charged of opposite sign to the
wire. The <U+FB02>ask F was insulated and wrapped in tinfoil,
which was connected with one pair of quadrants of a quadrant
electrometer, the other pair being connected to earth. The
air was passed into F through a metal tube, which was con
nected to earth and did not touch F.
   On spraying distilled water a charge on F was indicated
by the electrometer. With about six bubbles passing per
second the electrometer de<U+FB02>exion increased about 50 divisions
per minute (1 volt gave 30 divisions), showing a negative
charge on F when E was positive, and vice oersé. On
stopping the sprayer and blowing unelectri<U+FB01>ed air into F
about half of the electri<U+FB01>cation could generally be blown out.
No cloud appeared in F when the air was bubbled through
water, although the air carried with it this-charge*.
   On putting in a small glass-wool plug between F and the
sulphuric acid bottles all the electri<U+FB01>cation was stopped by
the plug unless the bubbling was very rapid.
   On spraying dilute sulphuric acid a charge appeared on F
as with water, and the usual cloud also appeared. On utting
in a glass-wool plug between F and the sulphuric acid ottles,
however, the electri<U+FB01>cation was not stopped as it was when
pure water was sprayed, but the electrometer indicated 20
to 30 divisions per minute. On stopping the sprayer and
blowing into F practically all this electri<U+FB01>cation could be
blown out, even after some little time had elapsed.                  Other
solutions, including those of sugar and glycerine, gave similar
results.
   It thus appears that the electri<U+FB01>cation of these clouds is
not able to cause them to reappear in moist air after bubbling
throu h sulphuric acid, although the electri<U+FB01>cation is not re
move from the gas by the passage through the acid. In
order that the cloud may reappear it is necessary that the
drops forming it should contain some material capable of
  * When the wire E was unelectri<U+FB01>ed a small amount of electri<U+FB01>cation
could still be detected on the gas entering F, giving about 4 or 5 divisions
per minute.

  forming a nucleus on which the drop can be re-formed after it
 has been evaporated by the acid.
    The behaviour of the electri<U+FB01>cation with a glass-wool plug
 is interesting. With a solution the particles left after passing
 through the acid must be larger than those left when water
 is sprayed. Yet the electri<U+FB01>cation gets through the plug
 only in the former case. The fact that the electri<U+FB01>cation
 which cannot get through the plug is also not easily blown
 out, whilst that which goes through the plug is readily almost
 entirely blown out, shows that the smaller electri<U+FB01>ed particles,
 as we should expect, are much more rapidly driven to the
 sides of the <U+FB02>ask and discharged than the larger particles.
 In the case of the plug, also, the smaller particles, owing to
 their more rapid motion and greater velocity under electric
 forces, are much more readily caught by the <U+FB01>bres.
    The charged gases obtained by the action of Riintgen rays
 are unable to carry their charge through a glass-wool plug,
 whilst the far larger particles which form the nuclei in the
 above experiments are able to do this.    It has been supposed
 that the fact that the charge of R6ntgenized gases is stopped
 by glass wool shows that the charge is upon large particles,
but the above observations lend additional support, if any is
needed, to the view that the stoppage of the charge is due to     nn
the rapid velocity with which such very small particles move
eausing them to strike the <U+FB01>bres of the wool plug.
    The fact which I have observed, that a charged cloud of
water after evaporation over sulphuric acid does not reappear
 over water although the charge is not stopped, does not seem
 to favour the view that the formation of clouds in newly
prepared gases is an electrical phenomenon. It is, however,
possible that in my experiments the number of particles on
which the charge was distributed was small compared with the
number present in newly prepared gases. Against this we
have the Fact that nearly all the charge which passed through
glass wool could be readily blown out, which seems to show
that it was distributed over a large number of particles.
   The electri<U+FB01>cation of hydrogen prepared by the action of
50 per cent. sulphuric acid on iron wire at 80° 0., after pass- .
ing through sulphuric acid and a glass-wool plug, could be
almost entirely blown out (Townsend, tomcat. p. 246).         In
this it exactly resembles the electri<U+FB01>cation on a cloud of
dilute sulphuric acid as 1 have shown. This similarity be
tween the bebavionr of the newly prepared gases and the air
containing a cloud consisting of a dilute solution suggests the
conclusion that the clouds formed in the newly prepared
cases also consist of a dilute solution of some substance, and
that their reappearance over water after being bubbled through

     Dr. van ltijckevorsel on the 'llnnperature of Europe.       459
sulphuric acid is due to small particles of the dissolved sub~
stance left when the cloud evaporates over the acid.          Town
send’s experiments con<U+FB01>rm this view, for he <U+FB01>nds that the
particles left when the cloud is evaporated are large compared
with molecular dimensions.
   In the case of a gas coming off from more or less dilute
sulphuric acid it seems reasonable to suppose that the nuclei
which cause the form-ition of the clouds consist of this sub
stance, but exactly how the gas becomes charged with such
an immense number of these particles as is necessary to form
a dense cloud is not known.
   The most obvious explanation, viz. that the particles are
simply spray splashed off, does not seem able to account for
many of the facts observed by Townsend. I am not, however,
here concerned with the origin of these particles in newly
prepared gases, and shall not, therefore, consider the question
any further.    The chief results obtained in these experiments
are :
    (1) A cloud of pure water when evaporated by bubbling
through H2304 does not reappear over water.
    (2) A cloud of a dilute solution of a nonvolatile substance
when evaporated reappears over water.
    (3) Electri<U+FB01>cation of the original cloud in either of the
above cases does not affect the reappearance of it over water
after evaporation, although the electri<U+FB01>cation is not stopped
by the acid.
    In conclusion, I desire to say that my best thanks are due
to Prof. Thomson for much information and advice during
the course of these experiments.

                  By Dr. VAN RiJcxEvonsEL *.
        HAT I am going to put before you is not absolutely
          new. Indeed, I believe that most meteorologists
have felt that something like it must be the case; and many
have said something amounting to the expression of such a
feeling in some of their works.           Certainly Roche, Jelinek,
Buys-Ballot are among the number, not to speak of others.
    But nobody, as far as I know, has followed to the end the
path of which many seem to have seen the entrance; and so
nobod has as yet perceived how it seems to be a new road to
some knowledge about temperature and climate.
    What I have done is very simple.            I have collected and
   ‘ Communicated by Prof. G. F. FitzGerald, F.R.S., having been read
before Section A of the British Association at Toronto.

 460      Dr. van Rijckevorsel on the Temperature of Europe.
 compared the daily temperatures of a certain number of places
 mostly in Europe.         For the majority of these the <U+FB01>gures
 could be simply taken from the papers published by diH'erent
 institutions or private observers. For some stations, however,
 I had to compute the daily means from the observations them
 selves as published pcriodically by the observers.
     However, none of these means could be forthwith used in
 the state they were in. There is not one series of obser
 vations, as yet, covering such a number of years that we may,
 without more ado, take the means as normal temperatures.
 Series have been ublished covering a century and more.
 (St. Petersburg, ‘openhagen, among others.)                    Unfortu
 nately no series of even nearly that length seems to be extant
 for a more southern latitude. And for a station in the north
 of Europe, if the mean temperatures for each day of the year
 are plotted down, the resulting curve is, even in cases like
 St. Petersburg and Copenhagen, so hopelessly distorted that
 not much can be done with it.
     Therefore it is necessary to manipulate the <U+FB01>gures to a
 certain degree. I have done so after the simplest possible
 method. The <U+FB01>gures were smoothed down by taking, <U+FB01>rstly,
 the arithmetical means of every set of nine days and assigning
 this corrected value to the <U+FB01>fth of those nine days. (Why I
 choose the number nine need not be here related. It has
 been printed elsewhere*.)
     In most cases even this was not enough, and I had to
 smooth the curves once more. This was done by taking the
 mean of every set of 3, 5, 7, or even 9 days, and substituting
 this second mean for the <U+FB01>gure of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th
 day of the set.
     Of course this may seem to be stretching a useful method
 to a rather dangerous extent. I think, however, that the
 results suf<U+FB01>ciently show that, for the end I had in view, the
 expedient was a good one. It is quite possible that by it
 some peculiarities have been obliterated which may be inter
 esting. But this does not in any way invalidate the results I
 am going to show you.
     Before proceeding any further it is only fair to add that
not all my <U+FB01>gures must be taken as real normal, or even mean,
temperatures. For some stations not nearly enough data
were at hand. In some cases each <U+FB01>gure is the mean of the
readings on three, or even two, chosen hours. In some others
it is the mean of the daily maximum and minimum, or even
the temperature at noon only. In a few cases also the series

téorologique des Pays-Bats, quarante-sixieme année.

      Dr. van Rijckevorsel on the Temperature of Europe.         461
  is not at all homogeneous. All this, however, will also be
  easily understood not to affect my present results.
     I will say at once that it is principally the similarity of
  these temperature-curves which I think interesting. Of more
  than <U+FB01>fty stations for which I have computed the normal
  temperature and constructed the lines, I have drawn only
  four on this diagram in order not to complicate matters. They
  are Valentin, Catania, Munich, and Konigsberg. It is on
  purpose also that I have left out eastern Europe, which would
  be an unnecessary complication.
     N0w I will, later on, speak of these four lines more in detail;
  but you will at a glance be struck by the extraordinary simi
  larity of lines for stations so far apart and in such different
 climates. \Vith a few exceptions, e\ery irregularity in one
 of these curves is exactly repeated in each of the others.
     The <U+FB01>rst inference I draw from this fact is, that the way in
 which I treated the <U+FB01>gures has been adequate.
     But, secondly, it struck me that a method, hitherto in
 great favour, of representing the temperature of a station by
 a carefully calculated smooth curve cannot be of very rcat
 use, because it really misrepresents the true state of things.
 Of course we may, by introducing a certain number of perio
 dical functions, obtain for any of these stations a <U+FB01>ne smooth
 curve without any irregularity. But does such a curve in
 reality show us very much more than that it is colder in
winter than in summer ? I think my curves, by their
similarity, plainly show that such a smooth curve can never
 really represent the temperature as nature makes it for us.
Wherever I take a station within or near the triangle Valentia,
Konigsberg, Catania, whether I take a series of a hundred
years or one of twenty, whether I take it in the 19th century
or in the 18th, the result always is a similar curve with iden
tically the same irregularities. This ‘proves plainly that these
cannot be accidental, cannot be owing to an insuf<U+FB01>cient
number of observations, or to errors of observation. There
fore here again it is not so much the phenomenon as a whole
which is the most interestin , but the anomalies, as repre
sented by the divergencies from the smooth curve, by the
large amount of secondary maxima and minilna. That the
temperature rapidly rises in the second half of January and
falls again in February, that the same phenomenon is re
peated in the end of February, is an apparent fact, and must
not be smoothed away; and it will be, I think, the task for
meteorologists to investigate what the cause of such anomalies
may be. And to a. certain extent I think the method here
put forward affords some clue to these causes.

      Dr. van Rijckevorsel on the Temperature of Europe.           463
     I think also that these curves show that it is not really
  necessary to have such a very large number of years to
  calculate the normal temperatures with if they are well
  manipulated. In this diagram, for instance, the curve for
  Konigsberg is the result of 46 years’ observations, that for
  Catania of only 20 years; and you will see that the result is
  quite as satisfactory. I have even got curves from only ten
  years’ observations which show exactly the same peculiarities
  as others. Of course a larger number of years cannot fail to
  make the normals still better. Suppose we had a series of
  two or three centuries, it is very probable that minor ano
  malies would show themselves which might be quite as real,
  quite as permanent as the larger ones I am able to point
 out now; we might be able then to take the mean values
  directly as normal temperatures without any smoothing.
  But we may safely predict that the grosser features which we
 can detect now would in no way be altered.
     What I have just said is also proved by three curves for
 the Helder which 1 have drawn *.          In the diagram the lower
 curve is the result of the observations of the 25 years from
  1845-1869, the upper one of the next 25 years from 1870—1894.
 Now this series is not a homogeneous one. The thermo
 meter was more than once removed from one place to another,
 and a really good situation seems only to have been found
 some years ago.      Also the mean temperature for the year is
 several tenths of a de ree higher during the <U+FB01>rst 25 years
 than during the secom? series.        Still it will be seen that the
 two cuwes are strikingly similar. ' In June and July there is,
 indeed, a difference. It is evident that during the <U+FB01>rst period
 the thermometer cannot have been quite free from some
 direct in<U+FB02>uence of insolation. But even here you will
 remark that all the essential features appear in both curves.
 Only in the lower one they occur earlier, and seem a little
 distorted.    (Perhaps this might even be a means to detect
 errors in the location of the thermometer.) And in every
 other part of the diagram you will see that the two curves are
nearly absolutely parallel. This shows plainly, [ think, how
a rather short series of observations, how even observations of
only indi<U+FB01>'erent quality, can be made use of, if properly
handled.
    The middle curve shows the mean of the two.
    Again, it must even be possible to give normal tempe
ratures for any place in Europe a priori, with not much more
than a very approximate knowledge of the climate.           Suppose
   * This diagram is not reproduced here as the text seems sut<U+FB01>ciently
clear without it.

 464    vDr. van Rijckevorsel on the Temperature of Eur-ape.
.we have some knowledge of the year’s mean temperature of
 some place in Europe, or of its summer temperature, it ought
 to be possible now to make a very near guess at the mean
 temperature for every day of the year, to compute normals
 which ought not to be very far from the true ones.
     Now, in order to come to the diagram, 1 want <U+FB01>rst to state
 why I did not give any curves for eastern Europe. It is
 because the type of the curves in the East is a different one.
 And I must say I think this is a very interesting fact, because
 it points to the great advantage of this method. To state
 things in a concise manner, I will speak of summer only.
 You will see that practically, for Valentia, the summer lasts,
 without much variation, from the middle of June to the
 middle of August. Now as we move eastward you will see
 that this maximum gradually narrows, and shows a tendency
  to merge into one single peak, and so it quite does beyond
 the space covered by these four lines. The maximum there
 is not for every place in the same part of the curve.
  Sometimes it is in July, sometimes in August. But the
  character is the same, and vastly different from that in
  western Europe, viz., one single maximum, sloping down
  rather rapidly on both sides. But here again the diti'erent
  characteristics are not by any means con<U+FB01>ned to a small area.
  There is for instance a striking similarity between the curves
  for Constantinople and Archangel, although in two sections
  they are just as decidedly dissimilar.
     In connexion with this fact I must call your attention to
  one very remarkable concave part of the curve for Valentia.
  It is the downward movement in the beginning of July.
  You will see that this peculiarity does not repeat itself in the
  other three curves. It is only the more interesting for that.
  It exists very decidedly in all the curves in the United
  Kingdom, in the Netherlands, is still faintly visible in those
  for the south of France, but rapidly diminishes in importance
  and vanishes altogether in an easterly direction.     The same
  remark applies to the next secondary minimum in the end
  of July. This one, however, is more tenacious: it is very
  characteristic, I think, for the temperature of the whole of
  western Europe, and only dies out beyond a line, very
  crooked indeed, passing somewhere in the neighbourhood of
   Copenhagen, Konigsberg, Vienna, and probably Greece.
      The reason why 1 spoke with a smaller degree of certainty
   of the peculiar behaviour in the east of Europe is, that
   possibly there is nothing extraordinary in that. It may be
   that it is the natural summer which we should also have in
   western Europe if the two minima just spoken of, whatsoever

    Dr. van Rijckevorsel on the Temperature of Europe. 465
they may be owing to, did not exist. I have not yet been
able to go far enough into the subject, of which I give the
<U+FB01>rst results.
   But I think a question like this—and there are others of
the same character—points to a more extensive use of our
curves. Suppose such curves to be constructed for our
whole hemisphere in su<U+FB01>icient number. It is not quite
impossible that we should <U+FB01>nd then that some of the anomalies
of my curves are not con<U+FB01>ned to Europe only. I call your
attention here to the fall in the temperature in the <U+FB01>rst half
of June. On this diagram it is very sensible for Valent-ia, less
so for the other stations. This is a most tenacious anomaly,
 which, although in most cases not at all striking, fails in none
of my curves, either in Russia, or in Italy, or England.
    Another instance is the rise of temperature about the first
days of February, followed by a minimum, which is best to
be seen in the curve for Miinich. This anomaly is very
irregular indeed, appearing for some curves in January, for
others in February, and much more apparent in one place
than in another. But it is always there.
    Now it is not very probable that for both these anomalies
 1 should, by con<U+FB01>ning myself to European stations, have
 exactly hit the limits of the area on which they make them
 selves felt. And should it be that any anomaly of this kind
 makes itself felt in America and in Asia also, we ought then
 probably to look for the explanation of it beyond the limits
 of our globe. I do not mean to imply that i expect such a
 thing to be the case, but it is not absolutely impossible.
    Other anomalies, which appear only on a part of a hemi
 sphere, probably must have a purely terrestrial origin. But
 if we had a suf<U+FB01>cient number of curves 1 eXpect that we
 should be able for most of these anomalies to see at a glance
 where they originate, and after that, a guess at the cause
 might in many cases be easier than it is now.
    Allow me to give an instance. The three “ice-saints”
 which have always found such strong belief, and quite as much
 disbelief, are certainly indicated, faintly, as one would expect,
 in many curves for central Europe, even as far as Flushing
 and Konigsberg, more strongly, however, for Miinich,
 Bremen, Lyons, Montpellier. But does this prove that their
 cause lies in the melting of the snow on the Alps, as some
 meteorologists think? The downward slope of the curve
 is just as apparent for Rome, Palermo, Biskra in Algeria,
 especially so for Constantinople and for Arvaralja, a station
 to the north of Vienna. As it is not quite so apparent for
 many other stations, it seems dif<U+FB01>cult as yet to give an

 opinion on the question, still it should seem as if the Alps
 could hardly be the birthplace of this sudden cooling down
in the <U+FB01>rst half of May, but as if we must rather look for
 this in a south-eastern or southern direction, beyond the
 Mediterranean.
    Of course, more local anomalies, such as the one last
named, also make themselves apparent. Thus the curves
for Montpellier and for Lyons—two places so near together,
but the second one more inland, more to the north and near
to the Alps—are exactly similar for the eight months March—
October. This is the more important as I took for Mont
pellier, and on purpose, a series of observations in the 18th
century. But for the four winter months the curves-are
exactly similar also, only the one for Montpellier is much
more contracted. Every feature is repeated in both curves,
only in November and December they all occur nearly a
fortnight later at Montpellier, in January and February on
the other hand as much earlier. A similar instance is given
by the curves for Flushing and Brussels. The two are
strikingly similar, only that for Brussels shows a far greater
range than the other. Here, though the places are so very
near together, the in<U+FB02>uence of the sea-climate of Flushing
is immediately shown by the curves.
    Thus a minimum in the second half of December, with a.
very decided rise of temperature towards the end of the year,
which is very characteristic for the extreme eastern part of
our continent, seems to die out long before it could reach the
middle of Russia.
    On the other hand it is remarkable how persistent some
much smaller features are. Here are the two unimportant
maxima, separated by a more or less apparent minimum in
April. This feature, slight as it is for most stations, extends
over nearly the whole of Europe, and only dies out in the
extreme east. This must be another peculiarity of our climate
which originates to the west of our continent. The next
minimum, just as slight, at the end of the month is still more'
persistent: it is slightly apparent for all European stations
without an exception.
   I do not feel justi<U+FB01>ed in taking up more of your time for a
subject which I have not at all yet thoroughly investigated.
But I think I have said enough to show how interesting
temperature-curves may be, and how desirable it is that as
many of them should be constructed as can possibly be done.
Constructed, and duly compared with others, and on a large
scale.
   And here is also a reason why I bring the subject before
the public before I see the extent even of it myself.     Is it

do the magnetic elements, Show something pointing to a

but the <U+FB01>eld is too large for one man. Therefore my wish is
to entice others to walk on this easy and interesting read.

   Parts 1 and 2. January and February 1898. Published under
   the direction of The Institution of Electrical Engineers; the
   Physical Society of London. London : Taylor and Francis.
AS our readers are aware, the Physical Society of London coin
       menced, a little more than two years ago, the publication
Of a series of Abstracts of the most important papers on Physics
“Ppearing in foreign scienti<U+FB01>c journals. The general excellence of
these Abstracts was admitted on all hands ; and the value of the
Work thus done by the Physical Society was recognized by grants in
aid from the Royal Society and the British Association. It is
understood that the expense involved in the publication of the
Abstracts was a heavy drain on the resources of the Physical
Society, which, notwithstanding the fundamental importance of
the subject with which it deals, is, and perhaps will always remain,
a comparatively small Society ; and it is doubtful whether the publi
cation could have been continued very long without outside help.
It is therefore very satisfactory that a large and wealthy Society
like the Institution of Electrical Engineers should have united with
the Physical Society to put the “Abstracts ” on a <U+FB01>rm basis. The
present publication takes the place of the Physical Society’s
Abstracts, and also of the extracts from electrical papers of
scienti<U+FB01>c or technical interest that have hitherto appeared in the
Journal of the Institution of Electrical Engineers. Speaking
very roughly, we may say that Physics occupies, in the two parts
under review, about two thirds of the space and Electrical Engi—
 neering one third. For the publication generally we have hardly
anything but praise. The high standard attained in the Physical
 Society’s Abstracts seems to be maintained, and we are glad to see
that the typography and general arrangement remain as before ;
the only change obvious at <U+FB01>rst sight is that in the colour of the
wrapper from the modest French grey of the Physical Society to a
brilliant red ; but this, though only super<U+FB01>cial, is suf<U+FB01>ciently
 startling,
   On the whole, we can heartily congratulate the two Societies
concerned in this publication, and hope that it will meet with
the success it deserves. We trust it may be found practicable
to keep up the genuinely scienti<U+FB01>c character which characterizes
the two Parts before us ; but we are a little alarmed by the Editor’s
announcement, pre<U+FB01>xed to a list of <U+FB01>fty-three periodicals from

 468                     Geological Society.
 which abstracts are now made, that “ this list is only preliminary,
 and is being daily enlarged.” We cannot think that this is good
news : to judge by one or two of the abstracts near the end of the
February Part, we should be inclined to say that the list is quite
 large enough already.
   The second word of Abstract 230 should surely be “ equitable,”
 not “ equable.”

       1. ‘ On the Structure of the Davos Valley.’ By A. Vaughan
Jennings, Esq., F.L.S., F.G.S.
   Evidence is brought forward to show that the level area, about
4 miles in length, near Davos is occupied by super<U+FB01>cial deposits,
and that the lateral talus-fans there have been cut through at a
relatively recent date since their accumulation; that the northern
end towards Wolfgang is blocked by moraine-material of great
thickness, but for which the Davoser See would drain north to the
Landquart, carrying with it the waters of the Fluela and Dischma ;
that the contour-lines suggest the former existence of a far larger lake
stretching south towards Frauenkirch, and that in that part there
is proof of the previous existence of a great detrital fan suf<U+FB01>cient
to account for the existence of the lake in question.
   It is shown that the former ice-movement was not from the
present watershed between the tributaries of the Landwasser and
Landquart, but from a spot farther south.
   The author concludes that the main valley-systems were marked
out in pro-Glacial times, and that at one time there was a water
shed somewhere between Davos Platz and Fruuenkirch. During
the Glacial Period moraine-material was heaped up across the valley
below the Hornli, and held up the waters to the south, forming a
great lake of which the present Davoser See is a relic, the out<U+FB02>ow
being probably over a low saddle near the present Wolfgang;
during this time a great moraine and detrital fan existed
across the valley to the south, and the lake for a long time was
thus prevented from draining in that direction. After the Glacial
Period the northern moraine was subjected to little erosion, but the
southern one, formed from the <U+FB01>rst of looser material, was rapidly
cut back by the Sertig Bach, and in time the barrier was so
weakened as to cause that end of the lake to be tapped, and at that
time the terraces opposite Frauenkirch may have been levelled,
while the <U+FB02>ow over Wolfgang would be stopped, and the Fluela
and Dischma streams turned southward; the Landquart would
then cut away the margins of the talus-fans which had been accu—
mulating in the lake.

L. Applications of Hilfusion l0 Conducting Gases.        By JOHN
   S. TOWNSEND, Zlf.A., Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge".
    HERE are many phenomena connected with charged and
       conducting gases which can be explained by diffusion.
Before proceeding to its application to these gases it is
necessary to solve some problems which apply not only to
conductin gases, but also to gases in general. The question
with whic] it is proposed to deal may be stated thus :—If
there are two gases, A and B, contained inside a vessel the
walls of which absorb A, what quantity of A will remain
unabsorbed and be left distributed throughout B inside the
vessel after a given time has elapsed ?
   The <U+FB01>rst section deals with the solution of this problem for
the three particular cases where the boundary consists of a
pair of arallel planes, a cylinder, and a sphere respectively.
It will e supposed that the absorption of the gas A by the
sides of the vessel is so complete as to reduce the pressure of
A to zero at the surface. In order to obtain solutions that
will apply to cases where the pressure at the surface is a small
<U+FB01>xed value it will suf<U+FB01>ce to substitute p+p' for p in the solu
tions obtained on the assumption that p=0 at the surface.
 ' In order that the effect of gravity may not disturb the
distribution of the gases it will be supposed that the quantity
of A is small compared with that of B.
   The second section deals with the application of these
results to the cases of charged and conducting gases.

The boundary will then be the two planes .r=0 and w=a.

   5. The loss of conductivity of a gas is due partly to the
recombination of some of the positively charged carriers with
the negatively charged ones, and partly to the carriers coming
into contact with the conductors. It is with this latter phe
nomenon that we are here chie<U+FB02>y concerned. By substituting
the above value ot'x in the three solutions obtained in Section I.
we obtain expressions which give the loss of conductivity of a
gas due to the diffusion of the carriers towards the sides of
the vessel which contains it. This loss of conductivity takes
place in a closed vessel without any electromotive force acting
on the gas.
   When a carrier comes into contact with a conductor it
either gives up its charge, or remains in contact with the
surface. From the way in which the equations in Section I.
were solved, it is clear that the solutions apply to the case
where the carrier, instead of giving up its charge to the side,
induces an opposite charge on the conductor, and is held
attracted to the surface by the electric force arising from its
image. The solutions apply equally well on the hypothesis
that the carrier discharges and comes back into the gas. In
this case we have a slight increase in the number of molecules
of B, less than one part in 10”; so that the correction to be
applied would amount to calculating the difference of the rate
of di<U+FB01>'usion of A through a gas having a density greater than
B in the proportion of 10‘°+1 to 10‘”, which of course can
in no way affect the original solution.
   If we leave out of consideration the recombination of the
ions or charged carriers, we see that the conductivity of a gas
will fall from 110 to p in a time t, where the ratio ot'po to p is

      These equations show how much more rapidly the con
 ductivity is destroyed in smaller vessels than in larger
 ones.
      Let us take the case of oxygen which has been made a con
 ductor by Rontgen rays; let the charge on each carrier be
 .z' times the charge that an atom of oxygen carries in electro
 lysis, which we will denote by E.
      One electromagnetic unit of quantity evolves 1'2 cub. cent.

 quantity of electricity that they carry is % an electromagnetic
 unit, or slow electrostatic units.

     6. Let us consider more particularly the second case, which
would apply to a conducting gas passing along tubing, and

will be in passing along a tube, 10 centim. long and l

so that the time that any portion of the gas will be in the
tube will be 1%; of a second.
    The ratio of the conductivity of the gas entering the tubing
to the conductivity of the gas as it escapes will, therefore, be

    If m were unity, in other words if the ion in the oxygen
which is conducting under Rontgen rays were to carry the
same charge as it does in electrolysis, then the conductivity
of the gas would he reduced to 113 of its value by passing
it along a tube 10 centimetres long and 1 millimetre radius
at the rate of 100 centimetres per second.
    It is interesting to <U+FB01>nd what would be the effect of the
attraction, towards the sides of a tube made of conducting
material, of each individual carrier by its own image in the
conductor.     It is quite evident that this effect only comes in
when the carrier is near the surface, so that we can regard
the radius of curvature of the tube as large in comparison
with the distance of the carrier from the surface. WVhen this
distance is .r, the force on the carrier will be 4%, and under
this force it would travel at the rate of 4%,, x            , since
under 9. volt a centimetre it travels at the rate of ['6 cent-j.
metres per second.

So that in the case we are considering a layer of 1'5 x 10—3
thickness of the gas would have its conductivity destroyed
in T16 of a second owing to the mutual attraction between each
ion and its image. The ratio of this volume to the total
                        271' x 1'5 X 10—3
volume of the tube is                      , which becomes 3 x 10—2
                                 7T1'
when r='l.       Hence in this case the loss of conductivity due
to the carriers attracting themselves up to the sides is small
compared with the loss of conductivity due to diffusion.
   7. When there is an excess of carriers charged with elec
tricity of one kind the gas not only conducts but exhibits the
properties of a charged body. The motion of the carriers in
such a gas is somewhat complicated, as both the diffusion and
the effect of mutual repulsion have to be taken into account.
When the charge per 0.0. is small we can leave the latter
effect out of account and consider only the diffusion. The equa
tions (5) Section II. can then be applied to charged gases,
and we can look upon them as particular cases of conducting
gases. The properties of these gases vary in many ways in
regard to their power of retaining their conductivity; thus
some of them can be passed along tubing, bubbled though
liquids, or sent through gauze or wool without losing more
than from 20 to 50 per cent. of their conductivity, whereas
others are made perfect non-conductors when similarly treated.
The equations (5) Section II. show that rate of loss of con
ductivity by coming into contact with conductors increases
very rapidly with V the velocity of the carrier under an elec
tromotive force of 1 volt per centimetre. We should, there
fore, expect that for these gases which retain their conduc
tivity at'ter bubbling through liquids &c. the value of V is
small compared with its value for gases which retain none of
their conductivity after similar treatment. In support of this
explanation we have the following results :—The conductivity
of a gas which has been made a conductor by means of Rontgen
rays is destroyed by passing the gas through wool or bubbling
through sulphuric acid, and the velocity of the carrier under
an electromotive force of a volt per centimetre is (for air)

                  Di<U+FB01>'usion to Conducting Gases.            479
1'4 centimetres per second (J. J. Thomson and E. Rutherford, ’
Phil. Mag. Nov. 1896 ; E. Rutherford, Phil. Mag. Nov. 1897).
The gases evolved from a sulphuric acid electrolyte retain a‘
large fraction of their charge after passing through wool or
bubbling through a liquid, and for the oxygen the velocity of
the carrier is only2'2 X 10“ centimetres persecond wh'en acted .
on by the same force (John S. Townsend, Phil. Mag. Feb.
1898).                                                           ‘:
   We have here supposed that e, the charge on the carrier, is
the same in each case. This assumption is reasonable from
theoretical considerations, but it has not yet been established
upon experimental evidence that when an elementary gas
conducts the carriers have the same charge as the atoms
carry in electrolysis. Information on this point might be
  ained by testing experimentally the result obtained in
   6.
   Many examples of this latter kind are to be found in newly
prepared gases. In most of these cases it is easy to account
for the growth of the carrier to a large size owing to the pre
sence of gases or vapours which would condense round the
charge and thus increase the size of the carrier. The velocity
V would thus be greatly diminished.
   When newly prepared gases are evolved from a solution it
is probable that the electri<U+FB01>cation is acquired immediately as
the gas is generated, so that each little bubble of the gas as
it rises in the liquid contains carriers which are charged.
Since these bubbles are small it would only require a very
short time for carriers which diffused rapidly to be com
pletely discharged by striking the liquid round the bubble,
so that in order that an appreciable number of charged
carriers should escape with the gas from the liquid it is
necessary to assume that they diffuse slowly, or what amounts
to the same thing, that they should be large compared with
molecules.
   8. When the number of carriers charged with positive and
negative electricity respectively is unequal, the electrostatic
<U+FB01>eld which is created tends to drive those carriers which
are in excess towards the walls of the containing vessel.
This effect is easily calculated for the case where the carriers
are all charged with electricity of the same sign. Let p be
the density of electri<U+FB01>cation, uvw the velocities parallel to
the axes, and d; the electric potential.
   In order to determine the motion we have three equations
of the form

which shows that after a time t the density is a function of t
alone, and does not vary from point to point in the gas, if pO
is constant initially throughout the gas.         The reduction of
the charge due to this effect is usually large compared with
the reduction due to diffusion when p is greater than 10“.
The two effects can easily be distinguished from one another,
since g in this case is a function of po, the initial density of
         O
electri<U+FB01>cation, and is independent of the form of the vessel.
 (J. S. Townsend, loc. cit.)
    It does not appear that the effect of mutual repulsion would
be instrumental in increasing the discharging power of a
charged gas as it passed through <U+FB01>ne gauzes, since the gauzes
may be considered part of the boundary, the form or extent
of which in no way affects the above va ue of p.

vision ultimately rested, it was itself expounded to micro
scopists and discussed by them for many years as a matter of
fact. it was thus and then con<U+FB01>ned to the statement that
microscopical “ resolution,” or delineation of detail, was due
to the union and interference (in the Fresnel manner) at the
 focal plane, of the direct dioptric beam and of at least one of
 the beams “.di<U+FB02>'racted” by minute periodic structure, in the
 manner of a grating illuminated by light approximating to
the character of plane waves: such diffracted beams with
 white light becoming spectra. The Abbe theory further
 af<U+FB01>rmed that the trustworthiness of. the microscopical ima e
 solely depended upon, and was in direct proportion to, t 0
 number of orders of these spectra which were grasped by the
 aperture of the lens ; and it explained all the advantages of
 greater aperture in greater resolution, upon this basis alone.
    This was a de<U+FB01>nite, limited, and practical theory, easily
   rasped ; and this alone was what came to be known as the
 Diffraction Theory or Abbe Theory. Since, therefore, Dr.
 Stoney now desires to apply that term to the wider manner
 of regarding microscopic vision which he has set forth, in
 order to keep things clear or even intelligible to any micro
  scopist who has followed the past discussion, there is really
  no other course than to <U+FB01>nd a new name for the more limited
  and already well known Abbe theory, as Lord Rayleigh has
  so happily done. The truth or error of this “spectrum”
  theory, or the respective measure of each in it, is a matter of
  ver great practical importance, as will appear. The interest
  in r. Stoney’s wider theory is largely speculative ; but there
  are obvious points of contact between it and the other, which
  also have to be considered, and which throw much light
  upon it.
     2. With the urely theoretical bearings of Dr. Stoney’s
  presentment of t 0 case it is not necessary to deal at length;
  nor, indeed, am I quali<U+FB01>ed to do so. Yet it seems desirable
  to mention very brie<U+FB02>y some objections which suggest them
  selves, and which, if valid, have much bearing on the con
  clusion he reaches in common with Prof. Abbe, that “dif
  fracted light [de<U+FB01>ned as “1i ht which advances in other
  directions than those prescribed by geometrical optics ”] is

482      Mr. L. Wright on ll/[icroscopz'c Images and Vision.
 the machinery by which good de<U+FB01>nition is brought about.”
 That is, of course, getting back to the “spectrum ” theory ;
 and I hope to show, largely from material the discussion has
 provided, this theory is only true in a conditional and limited
 sense, while its acceptance in a universal sense is a present
 cause of positive mischief in microscopy.
    3. There appear to me, then, some fundamental physical
 objections to Dr. Stoney’s method of representing what takes
 place. Putting that most brie<U+FB02>y, and merely for the purpose
 of recollection, it seems to be as follows :——~(A) All light
emitted by an object may be resolved into undulations con
sisting of uniform plane waves. (B) We may conceive these
reversed in direction (since any dynamical system may be
reversed); and when they thus arrive back at the position
occupied by the original object, they will there “produce an
image the most perfect that the light emitted is capable of
producing.” This is held to follow because (§ 8, Phil. Mag.
Oct. 1896) the plane waves there, as at each step, “ repro
duce exactly the same state of the aether as had prevailed at
the same stations on the outward journey.” Hence in general
(we need not at present discuss Dr. Stoney’s other images,
and modi<U+FB01>cations) “plane waves converging inwards” are
capable of producing the most perfect attainable image pro
ducible from the rays grasped by the objective. Stating
objections to this with similar generality and brevity, it
appears to me that such a presentment of the matter must
break down as a full and complete explanation, however true
ina. limited sense, on the ground that “ uniform plane waves ”
such as are spoken of, are not in trustworthy microscopy the
actual or veritable dynamical system; and therefore cannot,
as it will be shown they do not, produce the supposed most
perfect attainable image by reversal.
   4. More speci<U+FB01>cally, it seems evident that we are, ab initio,
debarred from considering the light from a microscopic object
as consisting of uniform plane waves, except on the condition
of plane-wave illumination of the object. (Here, indeed, we
have the secret of Abbe’s consistent enforcement of illumina
tion by a small luminous cone or pencil, which gives approxi~
mately such illumination.) For what are uniform plane
waves? A wave-system is normal to the surface called the
wave-surface, over which undulations from the same disturb
ance are in the same phase. Hence the plane wave arises
from the Huygenian spherical wave, as a limiting case, in
the manner pointed out by all the standard authorities. Thus
Lord Rayleigh says*:—“ So long as the radius of curvature
            ‘ Encycl. Brit, “ Wave-Theory,” xxiv. p. 424.

     Mr. L. Wright on Zllioroscopic Images aml Vision.            483
[of the spherical wave] is very long in comparison with A, each
small part of a. wave-surface propagates itself just as an in
<U+FB01>nite plane wavc coincident with the tangent-plane.” Bassett
puts it similarly“ —“ Spherical waves concentric with the
source are propagated throughout the medium; and if the
e<U+FB02>'ect which these waves produce at some portion of space
whose greatest linear dimension is small in comparison with
its distance from the source, be observed, the wave may be
regarded as approximately plane. We are thus led to study
in the <U+FB01>rst instance lane waves.”
   The student of plivsical optics knows that this is so in
actual fact. To study plane-wave phenomena, or to verify
plane-wave dimensional calculations, he must remove his
source of light, itself relatively small, to a considerable distance
from his grating or other apparatus ; he must get his beams
of rays approximately parallel, that the normal wave-surface
may be approximately plane. This necessity belongs to the
nature of plane waves.
   5. But considering now microscopic objectives, many such
have been made as short in focus as 5‘0- of an inch.             It is
impossible to regard light emitted from an object, as consisting
of uniform plane waves on arriving at the surface of such a
lens, after a path of, perhaps, 2%,, of an inch ; except in the
case of plane-wave illumination of the olg'ect, as in the Abbe
theory. Even in that case it would seem that considerable
modi<U+FB01>cation must be made in Dr. Stoney’s presentment of
events in his <U+FB01>g. 1 (Nov. 1896, p. 433) here reproduced. His

illuminate the object, no objection need be made. But in
this case his <U+FB01>rst focus of the beam (described as “ parallel ”
rays) at x, can no longer be regarded as a focus of rays
emitted from the object C, but contrariwise, of rays pro
ceeding from the much more distant source of light. And
accordingly, as a simple phenomenon, or fact of observation,
it is not an image of any point of the object, but of the whole
source of Ziglzt, which is focussed at w, and is seen there on
removing the eyepiece and looking down the tube.
   6. Consider next the supposed dynamical system. This is
by hypothesis set up, not by the object alone, or in ordinary
method: “ We begin by positing repetitions of the objective
<U+FB01>eld ” (Prop. 1, § 6). Then it is assumed that all these
replicas emit light from their similar points “the same in
direction, intensity, phase, and position of transversal.” This
postulate seems altogether illegitimate in a theory purporting
to represent actual phenomena; we know that it is not true
in physical reality. It, too, depends for the quali<U+FB01>ed truth
which it does possess, upon plane-wave illumination ; then it
is true, so far as that when approximately plane waves fall
upon a grating, the width or number of lines does not affect
the image of the ruling, as ruling. But it seems to push the
result of certain mathematical expressions to an extent which
can hardly be justi<U+FB01>ed.       That opinion must be expressed
with dif<U+FB01>dence, since my very small amount of mathematical
knowledge has become so rusty, that it is only with dif<U+FB01>culty I
can follow (and but too vaguely) even the general drift of the
analyses in the discussion which so interests me. I did, how
ever, gather that the ground of the immense postulate here
objected to, lay in the fact that resolution into plane waves of
acther-disturbances set up by an object, is represented by ex
pressions which equally represent replicas of the disturbances;
the nature of circular functions involving this necessity. From
a private reply Dr. Stoney was kind enough to give me, it
appears this is the case. But mathematical expressions are
but tools, and often have the usual defects of tools ; in par
ticular that of not being sharp enough. Ask these functions
to express a given disturbance and many surrounding replicas,
and they will do it. But ask them next to express an actual
limited disturbance resolved in this manner, and no more,
and they fail ; their edge at present is not sharp enough to do
that. Such failure, however, is in this case an imperfection ;
and surely to ground such a physical postulate upon the very
imperfection of an imperfect tool, is rather arguin in a
circle. It seems to be a case of what was describeg only
the other day in a review of a mathematical work, as “ the

       Mr. L. Wright on. .lllcrnxcoplc Inutyes and Vision.      485
 special philosophical vice of the mathematicians, the tendency,
 namely, to mistake the sign for the thing signi<U+FB01>ed.”
    7. This seems further to appear, when we consider the
 reversal of the supposed dynamical system. This, it is sup
 posed, produces the “best attainable image which the light
 emitted by the object [and grasped by the objective] is capable
 of producing.” Unquestionably the light-waves emitted may
 truly be regarded as a dynamical system ; and may be con
 ceived as reversed ; and the reversal of the whole actual system
 would produce such an image as described. But it does not
 seem to follow that mere “ coalescence and interference of
 uni/brat plane waves ” involves such a result. Besides what
 has already been said as to the absence of plane-wave cha
 racter in rays from any self-luminous object, at the very
 minute focal distance of a high-power objective, questions as
 to the longitudinal components in the disturbances, and their
 disposal and influence, and several other questions, would
 seem to need further solution than is known at present, before
 this could be assumed.
    In any case, what the reversal of the supposed dynamical
system must really reproduce as an image at the place of its
origin, must be the postulated operative cause of the system.
 That, by the hypothesis, is not an actual object and it alone,
 emitting luminous waves, but the object surrounded by an in
 de<U+FB01>nite number of identical replicas, emitting identically similar
plane wares. This does not represent any object in reality:
and that fact seems to dispose of such a presentment as a full
 and complete representation of microscopic vision.
    The same conclusion follows from Dr. Stoney’s directions
 “how to see the rulings” (Phil. Mag. Dec. 1896, p. 525).
\Ve <U+FB01>rst illuminate the object by a near approximation to
plane waves ; and then behind the lens further exclude every
thing but the narrowest pencils of almost exclusively plane
waves. Thus we produce a “ ruliu 1' ” extending far beyond
the limits of a true image, and whic 1 in other respects is as
far as possible from being any such. We are really pro
ducing, and do produce, easily calculable results of interesting
experiments in the interferences of plane waves ; and though
these results are physically and directly related to the periodic
structure of the object, considered as an interference-grating,
they are no trustworthy representation of it. This truth has
always been recognized and insisted upon by Prof. Abbe and
his school, resulting in a sort of “ counsel of despair ” as to
any truth or certainty in such microscopical ima es.
   8. This brings us ack to the more concrete bbe “ spec
trum ” theory, as already described. But Prof. Abbe
   Phil. May. S. 5. Vol. 45. No. 277. June 1898.         2 L

486      Mr. L. “fright on dfici'oscopic Images and Vision.
throughout, as Lord Rayleigh remarks, considers the object
to be illuminated by plane waves. In this limited case, what
Dr. Stoney advances is more or less true; but Abbe differs
from the latter in constantly recognizing that condition and
its consequences. Thus, while Dr. Stoney states that a cone
of rays from the condenser, as wide as possible, may be used
 (as in practice it may, for reasons to be seen), Abbe again
 and again insists that such is not the case, and this at great
length". “Strictly similar images,” he says, “cannot be
 expected except with a central illumination with a narrow
 incident pencil ”'l'.       This is the condition for securing an
 approximation to plane-wave illumination, with its dif
 fraction phenomena.
                                       II.
     9. We may now consider how far the Abbe theory, which
 possesses more or less undoubted truth, is an adequate repre
 sentation of microscopic vision ; and the most satisfactory
  feature about the lengthy discussion from which these remarks
  originate, is that in several ways additional light is thrown
  upon that question. Considering the grounds for it after
  wards, let me <U+FB01>rst state the general conclusion at which I
  have arrived as the result of long and patient experiment, and
  which is further con<U+FB01>rmed by this discussion. Stated brie<U+FB02>y
  as before, it is that the trustworthiness of a microscopic image
  is in proportion as the oly'ect approwimates to a self-luminous
  condition, and diminishes inproportion as it is or has to be
   (for it may have to be) examined by plane-wave illumination.
  Whether this view, or the Abbe view, be true, is of most
   fundamental and practical importance to microscopy and
   microscopic optics.       Let us see whatplight we have updn it.
      10. Supposing the “ spectrum ” theOry to be true, as a full
   representation, it was demonstrated that “ microscopic vision
   is sui generis” 1. Such a statement need not now be criti
   cized        has vanished
          ; it dissociates
   expressly                           fromdiscussion,
                                   in the

      11. Another fundamental objection to the competence of
   the theory as a general one, is found in the fact mentioned
   by Lord Rayleigh, that the character of a grating may be
   such, that its spectra cannot give a proper image.
       12. As he also brings out in his article, the object may
   conceivably be self-luminous ; in which case there will be no
   spectra, and the waves emitted from different points of the
                 * Journ. It. Micr. Soc, Dec. 1889.

object will be quite heterogeneous, and in no permanent phase
rclations. Yet an image must be possible, and can in that
case be only analysed according to the Airy method. We can
only employ a really self-luminous object in experiments with
low powers of the microscope—perhaps up to an inch *. But
even the results with such a power are decisive of the real
question ; and with high powers we can more or less approxi
mate to this kind of luminosity in several ways.
   Thus, even a wide cone from-the condenser approximates to
it. Lord Rayleigh has shown (Phil. Mag. Aug. 1896, p. 175)
how and why this kind of illumination must introduce a large
amount of heterogeneity into the rays proceeding from the
object, and concludes “ that the function of the condenser in
microscopic practice is to cause the object to behave, at any
rate in some degree, as if it were self-luminous, and thus to
obviate the sharply-marked interference-bands which arise
when permanent and definite phase-relations are permitted to
exist between the radiations which issue from various points
of the object.” Since Dr. Stoney, however, seems rather to
regard the function of the condenser as being that of providing
illumination by plane waves, we had better resort to other
methods, which may help us to decide what is a verv important
practical question. For while, according to Dr. Stouey, the
ideal is to get absolutely aplanatic systems of plane waves
transmitted through the object, and all conditions short of this
(caused by imperfections in the slide or various other details)
impair the image (as in one special sense they do impair it,
with some objects); according to the view expressed above,
irregularities of phase thus produced may add to the trust
worthiness of the image, though it may impair it in some
other features.
    Let us take therefore as an object on the stage, a grating of
3000 or 6000 lines to an inch, illuminated by a narrow cone
from the condenser, focnssing the flat of a rather distant
lamp-<U+FB02>ame. Place immediately in front of this <U+FB02>ame a coarse
grating, 50 to 100 lines per inch, either photographed or of
 wire. The several points of these luminous lines emit light
 waves chie<U+FB02>y in the self-luminous manner, indiscriminate in
 phases and transversals as the points of the <U+FB02>ame itself‘l'.
 Arranging the stage grating so as to cover only half the
   * Thus, we may employ a grating of platinum wire made incandescent
by an electric current.
   T If this be   uestioned, let it be remembered that we might get pure
 self-luminosityby employing in the dark a latinum 'ating made incan
 descent as before. Probably no physicist lieves t at there would be
 any observable difference in the phenomena, or would even deem it
 worth while to make the experiment in order to see if there were any.

 objective <U+FB01>eld, a condenser can be selected of such a focal
 length, and other matters so adjusted, that the focal image of
 the coarse grating formed by the condenser, corresponds both
 in intervals and focal plane with the object-grating on the
 stage, and using the same illuminating cone. Remove now
 the coarse grating and place the stage grating centrally: then
 removin the eyepiece and looking down the tube, the dioptric
 beam an its <U+FB02>anking spectra as so often described will be
 seen; they are the images of the source of light, formed at .2:
 in <U+FB01>g. 1. They interfere and form the image seen by the
 eye-piece, in the Fresnel and Abbe manner. Removing the
 stage grating, and replacing the coarse one over the <U+FB02>ame,
 its focal image is now the object. Owing to the heterogeneity
 of the rays, this aerial image emits no spectra—there neither
 are nor can be any such. But it is perfectly resolved. Here
 we have a resolution of 3000 or 6000 lines per inch that has
 no place at all in the “spectrum ” theory; which therefore
 can be no complete theory of microscopic vision, though it has
 an important place in it *.
     As another expedient, we may place beneath the slide
 a sheet of <U+FB01>nely-ground glass. This ground surface refracts
 and re<U+FB02>ects the light in countless phases and directions through
 the object, the waves issuing therefrom with similar hetero
 geneity of character. Here also we must have at least a very
 considerable degree of approximation to the nature of self
 luminosity; nor can we get from such illumination any of the
 well-marked “spectra” at a: (<U+FB01>g. 1), or out-of-focus inter
ference-fringes, familiar to us with the Abbe method. The
difference in character of illumination by such methods, and
 the methods described by Dr. Stoney, is so great, that if the
“ spectrum ” theory be completely true, there should at least
be a uniform and vast deterioration in the image of an object
thus illuminated. On the contrary, with all good lenses of
moderate aperture, and slides with any fair amount of opacity
in details, such an image is about the very best we. can get.
The excellence of this method of illuminating was <U+FB01>rst im
pressed upon me many years ago by the late Dr. Carpenter;
and since I in my turn have recommended it, fresh discovery of
it has been made by Mr. G. O. Karop T. By its means really
good moderate powers can be used up to their full aperture,
   * Using reduced photographs of perforated zinc, I have similarly used
their aerial images 1n comparison with P. angulatum on the stage. Only
ap roximately in one respect, because the di<U+FB01>iculty of getting suf<U+FB01>ciently
re uced photographs prevented use of the same illuminating cone in the
two cases. But there is no doubt about the results in all important
respects.

  rendering the very <U+FB01>nest hairs as tapering to a perfect point,
  with entire absence of the diffraction-fringes shown round such
  details with a narrow pencil. Where and why “resolution ”
  often fails with high powers as regards some objects so illu
  minated, belongs to the question before us, and is dealt with
  presently; but the method can be carried much farther than
  many would suppose. The diatom P. angulatum (45,000 to
  the inch) is resolved by it beautifully with a dry lens; and
  this self-luminous resolution has the cardinal superiority over
  Abbe’s with a narrow pencil, that by no possibility can any
  images be produced by it other than the small white disks on
  dark ground, or black spots on white ground, at di<U+FB02>'erent foci,
 which can be produced in the same way from a sheet of
 perforated zinc. By grinding the back of the slide itself,
 even an immersion-lens can be more or less <U+FB01>lled with direct
 rays, and in this way all the spots can be seen (as spots, and
 not falsely as spherules) in A. Lind/mimerii (69,000 to the
 inch). With a <U+FB01>rst-rate apochromatic and one of the slides
 mounted by Dr. Van Heurck in A575, referred to b
 Dr. Stoney *, I have seen the striae in A. pellucida; though
 with such objects as these the method comparatiVely fails, for
 reasons presently to be seen.
    13. We may also compare the results of mathematical
 analysis with those of experiment. We have two kinds of
 possible image, for the Abbe 0r “ spectrum ” image is a real
 fact enough under the necessary conditions ; our inquiry here is
 simply what pro ortion and value must be assigned to it in
 ordinary researc . Lord Rayleigh’s articles here and else
 where seem to supply useful criteria as regards that question.
 If I rightly understand him, he shows that according to the
 “ spectrum ” theory a square and circular aperture of the same
 width give the same resolution for points or short lines. On
 the other hand, respecting the resolution of self-luminous lines
 of sensible length, another analysis of his 1' led to the conclusion
 that a. circular aperture must exceed a square aperture by say
 10 per cent. to give equal resolution. Airy in a slightly dif
 ferent manner calculated that the circular aperture must exceed
 by about 20 per cent. Of course any analysis must start from
 certain assumptions, but Lord Rayleigh’s appear reasonable.
   * It is an error to suppose no one had succeeded in mounting objects
in this medium except or until Dr. Van Heurck.    Long ago it was used
(I think invented) by Prof. Hamilton Smith in America. Father Thomp
son wns also fond of it, and published a description of his methods of

crystallize.

490      Mr. L. Wright on Microscopzc Images and Vision.
Experimental test was made in conjunction with Mr. R. T,
Glazebrock, using a 50 to the inch wire grating in front of a
sodium <U+FB02>ame, and two different rectangular apertures (with
sides parallel to the wires) on the object-glass ot' a telescope.
measurin the distance at which the object—glass (with aper
ture) resdlved the grating. Of circular apertures, four were
employed in the same way. The two observers diti'ered very
slightly, and the mean for the four circular apertures worked
out in the proportions of 1'13, 1'09, 1'09, and 1'09 to 1‘0 of
rectangular aperture. Here the grating in front of the <U+FB02>ame
is regarded as self-luminous, just as in the experiment with
the microscope above described.
    Thus far experiment con<U+FB01>rms the analysis; but Dr. Stoney
considers (in the previous discussion with me which Lord
Rayleigh alludes to) that the same methods cannot be applied to
microscopical resolution, on account of the wider angle of the
cones of rays concerned, and the physical consequences of that
difference. I think he has over-rated such distinction, and it
is rather hard to see just where it begins or how far it operates;
at all events, the agreement of experiment with analysis as
regards both kinds of image *, in the microscope also, is
remarkable.
    Calculating (as usually done) by the E line for white light,
the ultimate limit of resolution for a dry objective of' utmost
aperture (N.A. 1'0) is 96,410 lines perinch, which we suppose
to be attainable according to the “ spectrum ” theory, although
the aperture is circular.         In 1888 Mr. E. M. Nelson, whose
microscopic vision is phenomenally keen, just “glimpsed”
the striaa of A. pellucida, mounted in the arsenic medium
described by Dr. Stoney, but prepared by Prof. H. L. Smith.
Including the double system, or all across the valve, these
 striae are about 751m,» of an inch in length. He used an oil
immersion condenser of much greater aperture than 1'0, with
 a single-notched stop, through which sun-rays were sent by a
 heliostat. The beam through the notch being <U+FB01>rst so oblique
 as to be outside or excluded by the 1'0 dry aperture of the
 objective, a strong green spectrum alone appeared at one side of
 that aperture, at back of the lens (a: in <U+FB01>g. 1). The notch was
 then gradually deepened until a very small direct or dioptric
 pencil was just seen on the opposite side of the aperture—
    4" As Lord Rayleigh pointed out to me, and as will be understood, the
 absolute theoretical limit of resolution must be considered the same in
 both apertures in each case.       But resolution also requires a certain
 luminous intensity compared with the <U+FB01>eld of view; and in this matter
 the circular aperture may be more or less at disadvantage, depending
 either on the nature of the luminosity or partly on the length of the lines
 compared with the aperture.                   '

      Mr. L. Wright on Microscopic Images and Vision.          491
replacing the eyepiece, the striaa were just seen. The diatom
was pro ably something less than 95,000 per inch, and any
dry lens must be some little less than 1'0 in N.A.     Here then,
with very intense plane-wave illumination—in fact as nearly
as p0ssible in practice Dr. Stoney’s “ uniform plane waves "—
we have also as nearly as possible the theoreticallimit attained,
or closely approached, with a circular aperture.
   Turning now to the more average kind of microscopic image,
the extreme closeness with which Lord Rayleigh’s 10 per cent.
reduction of ef<U+FB01>ciency in circular apertures represents the
facts of observation as found by the most competent observers,
will forcibly strike everyone who has studied microscopy for
any length of time. But Dr. A. Ulitford Mercer, of Syracuse
University, U.S., has recently tested the question photo
graphically. It is comparatively easy to prepare circular and
square apertures of equal dimensions. He also ruled upon
the same glass plate six sets of lines at intervals of 0'42,
0'46, and 0'5 mm. and their doubled intervals of 0'84, 0'92,
and 1'0 mm. apart. The apertures were 5'0, 5'5, and 6'0m1n.
diameter. It will be seen that both lines and apertures ive
excesses of about 10 and 20 per cent., representing those
calculated by Lord Rayleigh and Airy respectively. An
a'érial image of these lines focussed by the condenser, was used
as the object, and successive photographs taken with all the
square and circular apertures. Then only similarity of resolu
tion had to be compared,which can be done within very small
limits of observational error.    The results agreed with Lord
Rayleigh’s calculation and experiments, not with the Abbe
calculation or with Airy’s.
   14. Dr. Stoney himself, moreover, recognizes essentially
what is here maintained in his Proposition 5 (Phil. Mag.
Oct. 1890, p. 346).    This reads :—“ The standard image is the
outcome, partly of the features upon the object, and partly of
the state of the light by which the object is illuminated.
It may be improved by increasing the degree in which the <U+FB01>rst
of these factors, and by decreasing the degree in which the second,
contributes to produce, to modify, or to eg‘hce detail in the
image.” So closely does this practically coincide with my
proposition, that had it stood alone or as the <U+FB01>nal conclusion
of is exposition, nothing more would have been necessary;
and it has the further merit of recognizing the fact (which
constitutes the real place and proportion of the “ spectrum ”
theory in microscopy, and the nevus between it and the Airy
theory) that we have two distinct elements to deal with in an
image, whose respective preponderance or proportion are
highly variable. The present attempt at further treatment is

492     Mr. L. Wright on Morosoopio Images and Vision.
made chie<U+FB02>y because Dr. Stoney does not seem to recognize
the true relative proportions, either in maintaining with Abbe
in such a universal sense that “ diffracted light is the machinery
by which good de<U+FB01>nition is brought about”; or when he
proceeds to illustrate (§ 35) “ the great assistance which is
rendered to the practical microscopist by Abhe’s theory.”
   15. We therefore next consider that illustration.       To begin
with, the resolution of A. pellucida is no real problem at all :
it is not even of the same nature as the problems which do
confront the scienti<U+FB01>c worker. Supposing it were, the latter
would regard with consternation the elaborate apparatus
described for producing monochromatic light. This diatom,
however, has been studied for many years; the dimensions of
its structure are known and familiar; and the powers of annular
illumination have long since been ascertained. It is no
problem, or one in which help is needed, to take what is really
a “grating” of this known <U+FB01>neness, and already known to
have this de<U+FB01>nite periodicity of structure, and arrange matters
so as to get the most conspicuous “resolution ” of it. The
problems in which assistance is really wanted, the microscopic
worker’s really “ dif<U+FB01>cult ” objects, are such as Dr. Dallinger
confronted in detecting the spores of a mound, itself only
6610-0 of an inch in diameter and themselves only §ZOIUW of an
inch; or more especially (because here was involved real
“resolution ” of <U+FB01>ne detail) the process of division in the
nucleus of a cell, itself only @0607, of an inch long. In such
cases what will be found and is to be observed is unknown;
accurate periodicity of structure is probably absent; and
mere arti<U+FB01>cial force or clearness in “resolution,” even if
obtainable (which it seldom is) is worthless in comparison
with known trustworthiness in the image so far as it goes.
Taking any such case as this for our test-object, and com
paring it with the treatment of the A. pellucz'da as described,
we shall be able to appreciate the proportion of both truth and
error—for there is truth as well as error—in the “spectrum ”
theory.
    16. We cannot help, in the <U+FB01>rst place, seeing much error.
While the minuteness of structure to be detected by
Dr. Dallinger (in an unknown object) was as great, the
method of proceeding described for the A. pellucida is im
practicable, and would be useless even if practicable. Real
work has to be done by far different means. The <U+FB01>nest
lenses, used with a wide and solid aplanatic cone of light,
could alone do such work; and moreover, earlier lenses of
1'48 N.A. were surpassed in results by apochromatic lenses
of 1'40 N.A., better corrected for spherical aberration—the

       Mr. L. “fright on Microscopic Images and Vision.                493
meaning of which we shall see. Supposing the microscopist,
however, to know or suppose the measure of minuteness in
the divisions of the cell-nucleus, he would, on the principles
Dr. Stoney explains, have to employ (with doubtless some
modi<U+FB01>cation in detail) arrangements for lane-ware illu_
'mination generically similar to those he escribes for the
diatom. But he would be wrong, and the results would be
nil *. Dr. Dallinger had to do such work with a high degree
of heterogeneous illumination—as close an approach as is
possible with the lens used, to a self-luminous condition of
the object.
    The image even of the diatom is a false image. It is
admittedl so in regard to the “spherules,” and com wetent
judges whom I have consulted are verv doubtful whether
even the breaking up of the strize so shown, is not due to
false ditfraction-fringcs from the midrib of the valve, the
spherules being thus arranged in longitudinal rows far more
straight than is really the case. Looking at the matter
theoretically, it will be observed that after having laid down
how the excellence of the image is in inverse proportion to
“the degree in which [the state of the light by which the
object is illuminated] contributes to produce, to modify, or to
cii'ace detail,” he proceeds to obtain this image by almost the
 greatest specialization of the light which is possible. The
effect of this is to replace the actual detail, by other apparent
 detail which is visually intense. and geometrically sym
 metrical, to an utterly false degree.
    Similar results are traceable in other diatom work by the
 Abbe school, as may be shown by the most familiar test-valve
 of all, a much coarser one, the P. angulatmn. Dr. Van
 Heurck has photographed this with the celebrated Abbe
 Zeiss lens of 1'63 aperture and dense immersion-<U+FB02>uid and
 medium, by Abbe methods, with an uncorrected condenser;
 the result is a series of hexagons resembling a honey-comb.
 Dr. Stoney writes)“ of the same object, that dry objectives
 can only image its details “ correctly so far as regards their
 number and position, but any further detail is not correctly
 represented.”       lmmersions embracing most of the <U+FB01>rst
 spectra, “ we now see some detail : the dots appear hexagonal,
and are separated from one another by walls which are thin,
   it Narrow pencils and annuli have of course been tried, for the contrast
they give. The probable reason of failure is want of suf<U+FB01>ciently regular
   riodicity in the detail.  Only such    eriodic detail is shown better
ii; such methods; all else is “blurre ,” as Dr. Stoney points out in
regard to the other features of this diatom itself.

  and which look like a honey-comb ; ” and he adds that “this
  is the <U+FB01>rst and only step we can take towards learning what _
  the actual detail is,” because no objective will embrace the
  other orders. Examining these several statements, there is
  every reason to believe that a dry objective with a wide cone
  of light gives a perfectly truthful image, while it will give
  the hexagons quite easily if that <U+FB01>gure is preferred ; Zeiss’s
  well-known large-scale photograph is of a valve so coarse
' that it is beyond dispute * that a portion of the second-order
  spectra were included by the lens used, with the result of
  introducing a false doubled resolution impossible with <U+FB01>rst
  orders alone ; and an immense further step can be taken by
  using a <U+FB01>rst-rate immersion-lens of 1'40 aperture, with a wide
  cone. The Zeiss photograph x4900, and the Van Heurck
  photograph, are confessedly the highest triumphs of photo
  graphy by the Abbe method : one has only to compare both
  with the beautiful photograph X 4900 taken in this other way
  by Mr. E. M. Nelson, and other similar ones up to a scale
  of x 6400, to see, once for all, which is the truest image 1',
  and the all-importance of a suf<U+FB01>ciency of heterogeneous
  light.
       17. We can also, however, see the large amount of truth
  in the Abbe theory, and its important, though not all
  important, place in microscopic vision, especially for certain
  classes of objects. Wherever we have a known periodic
  structure in transparent objects, plane-wave illumination and
  the consequent interference-lines formed by the beams dif
  fracted by that structure, have an extraordinary effect in
  intensifying into black and white a'more or less accurate
  representation of the periodic detail. How this occurs can
  be easily seen from two examples, macroscopic and micro
  scope.
     it As demonstrated by Mr. E. M. Nelson, Journal of the Quekett Micro
  scopical Club, July 1890.
     1- The minute detail in some of these photographs could not possibly
  be shown by Dr. Stoney’s method, because, minute as they are, they are
  unsynmzetrz'cat and not periodic. In regard to the 1). anyulaium, both
  circular disks and hexagons can be seen, depending upon the precise
  focus; the sharpest portions show the circles, which, disposed in quin
  cunx arrangement, most diatomists who have worked with English
  appliances believe to be the true <U+FB01>gure. Besides the sha est image,
  we have the phenomena of “ postage—stamp fracture,” and t e shape of
  far coarser markings in other diatoms to guide us. Mr. C. Haughton Gill
  has demonstrated that the spots are either apertures or depressions, by
  depositing pigment in them; and the various images can be imitated
  with perforated zinc.    It is the dlstinct outlines of the fractures, and
  broke n-through apertures, which are so magni<U+FB01>cently shown in Mr. Nelson’s
  photograph with a wide cone.

      Mr. L. Wright on lllicroscopie Images and Vision.       495
   Take <U+FB01>rst quite a coarse striation of 50 to the inch, visible
to the naked eye, represented by a grating of platinum wire
and by a piece of platinum foil corrugated to the same gauge.
Make the wires incandescent, and (checking irradiation by a
smoked glass) the striation is easily seen. Make the corru
gated foil incandescent (these observations are supposed to be
in the dark) and probably the detail will be quite invisible.
The eye was quite competent to see structure of this
<U+FB01>neness by the Airy self-luminous method, if the detail was
in contrast; but there is 110w n0 contrast, and the detail is
more or less invisible. Then let the corrugated foil be cold
and illuminated by extraneous light, and the detail is seen
again. There is both shadow to assist the contrasts, and also
there are phase-relations between the tops and bottoms of the
striations which come into play.
   Let us further imagine a perfectly transparent structure
with uniform periodic detail, but the elements of that detail
differing in thickness only; and let it be mounted in a medium
of nearly the same refractive index. A diatom in balsam
nearly represents such a case. It is quite evident that by
heterogeneous illumination at all approaching the self-luminous
character, it will be dif<U+FB01>cult to <U+FB01>nd anything sog<U+FB02>icimtly
contrasted in detail to see at all, though the very same
illumination of a Illack-aml-white photograph of same scale,
or of the same diatom in a medium of 2'4 index, might show
it easily. But plane-wave illumination might very easily
bring about phase-rebitions more or less approximating to
half-wave discordance, which we know well would be more
effective than black-and-white itself by direct light ; in any
case these phase-relations will produce conspicuous effect in
a. Fresnel-fringe image. Thus the Abbe method has a most
important function in enabling us to see contrast in the
details of a large class of objects—especially hyaline or
transparent objects—which do not present contrast or opacity
suf<U+FB01>cient to be seen in any other way. The error has been
in giving to it the sole or all-important place, not recognizing
that there is quite another kind of image also available,
depending upon Airy’s theory; and that this latter, while
in the ease of transparent details often giving images
insu<U+FB02>ieieut, or at least far inferior, in black-and-white contrast
(what microscopists call “ resolution ”), is free from the
contour errors of the Abbe image, and must be used to
correct it so far as is possible in the individual cases.
   The errors of the “ spectrum ” image are well known:
Prof. Abbe himself has suf<U+FB01>ciently insisted upon them. Its
very contrast, or “resolution,” is in most cases a glaring

 496     Mr. L. Wright on Microscopic Images and Vision.
 departure from truth, to which (when we can get resolution
 at all) the more indistinct self-luminous image is in reality a
 far nearer approach. It tends to make details which should
 be only geometrically symmetrical to a limited extent,
 perfectly so.    In extreme forms it makes rows of spots into
 lines, and these lines straight when not really so. It is
 always liable to false resolutions of double <U+FB01>neness. It fails
 (as Dr. Stoney explains) to give even a tolerable image of
 the larger features of the object, thereby showing its failure
 to be a real “image” at all. All that can really be learnt
 from it, is that there is probably (for this is subject to possible
 delusion from the false intercostals above mentioned) some
 periodic difference of structure in the object similar in
 dimensional intervals to “ lines ” shown : in regard to “ spots ”
 this is more uncertain, since these are often produced by
 false diffraction-fringes from any long line which may cross
 the true ones. That the lines are lines, or that the “ pattern ”
 is so geometrical as appears, is in the highest degree impro
bable. That the “spectrum” theory and method so long
retained exclusive predominance, is because attention has been
so concentrated upon either gratings or diatoms of known
periodicity in structure, but which only represent to a very
small extent indeed any serious kind of investigation.
    18. We are evidently reaching a very practical conclusion.
 It appears that in microscopy we have to deal with two
characteristics of an image, which often are only to a limited
extent compatible; that we have at command two methods
of illumination which respectively promote more especially
each of such characteristics ,- and that in most cases our problem
is so to combine and balance these two methods as to produce
the best result. Fidelity of contour will be secured in pro
portion as we are able to obtain our image by heterogeneous
illumination, approximating the object to a self-luminous
condition. But this method may prove utterly unable to
give us contrast, which we may therefore be compelled to
increase by using to a greater or less (even to a very large)
extent plane-Wave illumination, at the expense, however, of
some greater or less degree of in<U+FB01>delity in contour. Thus
an opaque subject, even of much minuteness, may be best
shown by ground—glass illumination, or a very wide cone;
while a diatom, unless in a very dense medium, or dry in air,
may require narrow pencils of approximately plane waves.
It is interesting to observe that there is thus a great degree
of practical truth in Prof. Abbe’s early contention as to
“ ditt'erent origins ” of different parts of the image. Many
of us have written of this as an “error,” now “recanted,”

       Mr. L. “(right on illicroscopio Images and Vision.      497
which strictly is true; but there is this broad practical sense
 in which it also is true.
    And we are unable to use either kind of image or of
illumination absolutely pure, if we desired to do so. The
 narrowest pencil we can practically use will not give us
 absolutely plane waves alone ; there will be some amount of
 heterogeneity in the pencil, which in some little degree serves
 to correct our image. And the widest cones we can use, or
 even ground glass, do not prevent greater or less approach
 to the character of plane- waves, as the rays travel farther
 from the lamp; and these by their interference tend to
 intensify the image. We have to Cplay off and adjust one
 against the other, and we are helpc by a fact which I had
 not fully seen, till pointed out by Dr. Stoney in our previous
discussion *.    In so far as we may regard every elementary
or excessively small cone or pencil of rays from the condenser
as an individual beam of plane waves (which no doubt is the
case in some degree), in passing through the object it
originates two or more pencils from the same point. These
 being necessarily in the same phase or phase-relation, so far
as they exist must interfere at the focus, and thus intensify
 the image. On the other hand, the numerous such elemen
 tary pencils comprising a wide cone, are in many discordant
 phases and transversals, as Lord Rayleigh has shown: and
 this very heterogeneity tends to correct the contours in the
 image, as above. We thus understand why, in really critical
 work, a large cone from a good condenser usually gives us
the best result; but why it may be impossible, even with a
 perfect objective, to use a cone of light which will <U+FB01>ll its
aperture completely. It may be necessary, to intensify the
image, while using as much heterogeneous light as we can,
to use only pencils each of which throws out another di<U+FB01>'racted
pencil grasped by the aperture, so as to intensify, or as
 Dr. Stone prefers to say, to “correct” it. But this
necessity epends on the nature of the object, and does not
exist in all cases.
    19. There is a very obvious and simple, yet decisive test
as to the correctness of this view. According to the Abbe
or spectrum theory (and even according to some of Dr.
Stoney’s reasoning, I think), the amount of cone or hetero
geneous light which can be used will depend upon the
minuteness of the structure alone. According to the view
here maintained (which recognizes the Airy theory as also
concerned in the image) the density or contrast of the structure
is the chief factor in this question.        All experience proves
that the latter is the case.

   It only remains' to show how directly the questions here
discussed affect practical microscopy and the work of the
microscope optician, and also determine the prospect of
further advances in our powers of microscopical research.
   20. The Abbe or “Spectrum” theory has in its time,
confessedly, led to enormous improvement in objectives.
Owing to that specialization and ignorance of what physicists
had done, which Lord Rayleigh has alluded to, there was
amongst microscopists no understanding of the direct function
of aperture in resolution ; and so the Abbe theory was for
years written about, and advanced, as “ the <U+FB01>rst explanation
ever given.” It thus produced a vivid consciousness of that
 Function which was entirely new, to which we owe our present
immersion and other high-aperture lenses. But it is as
easy to show that, this work being done, its undue prepon
derance and acceptance as the only theory, especially on the
Continent, is now causing distinct prejudicial results, owing
chie<U+FB02>y to its connexion‘in practice with a narrow pencil or
cone.      Dr. Stoney disclaims this for his more general
presentment, as he has of course a right to do ; but it is not
so' with the “spectrum” theory. Abbe himself throughout
insisted upon the narrow pencil. Dr. Van Heurck does the
same; Dr. Peragallo writes that a cone of more than
0'50 N A. is of no use; and Dr. Dallinger, and authorities
like him, who in a general way accept the Abbe theory as
 the “ theory,” but know from their own experience the vital
necessity in di<U+FB01>icult research of a wide cone, write expressly
 of “ theory and practice being thus at variance,” in some way
 or other which had to be explained.
    It is dif<U+FB01>cult to estimate the prejudicial effect of this upon
 microscopy on the Continent. As a quite uncorrected
 condenser will give a fair cone up to 0'50 N.A., and also by
 immersion extremely oblique rays from its margin (equivalent
 to annular marginal illumination), for years no better Con
tinental condenser was made. Prof. Abbe at last was driven
 to compute an achromatic, but this last production of
 Continental microscopy only gives an aplanatic cone of 0'65.
 Except those few who know of English condensers, with
 their aplanatz'c cones of 1'10 for immersion and 0'90 for dry
 combinations, Continental workers have thus been condemned
 to the errors and weaknesses of narrow pencils, which have
 thence been propagated through our own medical schools;
 and the results are suf<U+FB01>ciently striking. Dr. Koch at last
 found out for himself, empirically, that wide cones gave
                              ,J

      Mr. L. \Vright on Microscopic Imuycs and Vision.        499
much sharper and “<U+FB01>ner” images of bacteria, in fact the
only images worth having. Prof. Abbe accounted for this
observational fact, in an article " expressly contradicting any
advantage whatever to the image (as an image) from a wide
cone, on the ground that the wide cone, owing to its more
sharply de<U+FB01>ned focal plane (want of “penetration ”), makes
invisible the transparent tissues in which the bacteria are
situate. But he fails to account for the fact that it is just
the same with bacteria in invisible culture-media or sputum ;
and that the advantage really consists in the much greater
sharpness or thinness of the images of the bacteria them
selves; in truth of contour, so that square ends are shown
square and not rounded ; and in the fact that there are no
blurred edges or ditt'raction- fringes round them, as appear with
a narrow cone.     In fact, many allied bacteria cannot be distin
guished at all by the microscopic methods still too current in
our schools, which have taken their methods from Germany.
    So also, when Mr. Baugh visited the famed Jena workshop
in 1895, he was told by Prof. Zimmermann, one of the
scientific staff (who has himself published a work on micro
seopy), that in photographing they found no difference in
results obtained by the chromatic and achromatic condensers ;
which is equivalent to the statement that they knew of no
better results than those from a 0'50 cone. Our English
results are quite different. Mr. A. Pringle, whose splendid
photographic work on bacteria is well known, often uses the
largest aplanatic cellos; and, to quote once more our
recognized authority on microscopic practice 1', “ Photo
lnicrography with a small cone is quite easy, as great contrast
can be secured [the reason has been shown in foregoing
paragraphs]. \Vith a large cone dif<U+FB01>culties begin—dif<U+FB01>culties
of adjustment, dilticulties of lens correction, dif<U+FB01>culties of
exposure, and ditticulties of development. If, so far as our
ex >erience goes, a good photo-micrograph is required, these
difi'iculties must be mastered.”

 of spherical aberration has been considerably over-rated in
 objectives 1 ” The most eminent <U+FB01>rm of Continental opticians
 states that its lenses, owing to the system of calculation and
 manufacture, are uniformly free from spherical aberration, so
 much so that there is no need for any “ empirical tests,” viz.,
 testing upon the microscope itself. That is not the case when
 tested by the more perfect English appliances*. Not long ago,
 having the opportunity of testing and comparing three
 similar objectives together, I was enabled to see the difference.
 With the Abbe condenser there was no very obvious dis
 tinction ; but tested by English condensers it was quite
otherwise. The great <U+FB01>rm had no cause to blush for any one
of them ; all were good lenses; but they now revealed as distinct
 characteristic features as one sees in individual faces. On a
 graduated series of Podm'as, one of them now gave most
 unusually good de<U+FB01>nition with rather a small cone under the
highest (X27) eyepiece; while a second, scarcely equal in
 this point, excelled the others in the wide cone it was able to
 use on this object. I had the curiosity to ask another operator
 to make the same test. He is probably more skilful than
 myself, and certainly has keener vision: quite independently
he reached identical conclusions. Slight variations of pressure
in the <U+FB01>nal polishing of the glasses are quite suf<U+FB01>cient to
produce such differences as these, in such small lenses as are
here in question.
    Whether this latter be the cause, or some other, nearly all
 high-power objectives even of the present day, and of the
very best makers, show a. very sensible amount of aberration.
Drawing a circle to represent the whole aperture, and smaller
concentric circles to define zones of its surface, many of the
zones have slightly diferent focz'. This fact plays all sorts of
insidious hanky-panky tricks with small-cone interference
images of the Abbe kind; giving more force to such of the
spectra as are correctly focussed than to the others. But in
other respects, with small cones, these zonal differences are
not obvious, and often escape detection, many portions of the
aperture not being utilized at all. There are re<U+FB01>ned tests
familiar to opticians, and some others employed by highly
skilled microscopists ; but not only are these too seldom
employed by even the best makers before the lens is sent
forth, but we have seen that even their necessity is disputed,
and the importance of spherical aberration itself actually chal
   * The condenser itself is an English appliance.   Ten years ago only
one house, I think, made one with wide aplanatic cone. To-day every
English house of any standing constructs achromatic combinations with
0'90 of aplanatic cone, and two, I think, construct apt (:hronlatics.

 lenged, by adherents of the “spectrum” theory as heretofore
 understood.
     When, however, we do employ adequate tests, and at the
 same time make careful comparisons between one objective
 and another, we <U+FB01>nd that the perfect correction of spherical
 aberrations is just all-important in determining how far we
 can go in using with that lens the heterogeneous illuminating
 cone which is so important for depicting true contours in our
 image, still preserving sufficient resolution of minute structure.
 (\Ve are here postulating suiiicient opacity in the details, to
 dispense with much of the aid we have seen to he often
 necessary in liyaline subjects.) High-class moderate powers
 now easily utilize their full aperture, with ground-glass
 illumination. VVltll high powers, the amount of this, or of
 aplanatic cone possible, is in almost direct proportion to the
 perfection of spherical correction. Few lenses over 0'60N.A.
 will, however, even yet hear more than three-fourths of their
 aperture as direct light; many very good ones only two—
 thirds. And objectives differ strangely. In Zeiss’s apochro
matic series, the half-inch of 0'65 N.A. and the g immersion of
 1'40 stand out from the rest: some rare specimens of the
 former will bear their full cone, and occasionally an § of 1'40
 has been used in photography with a cone of 1'10. Very
 recently I had sent me for examination by Messrs. Swift a
 new English 71% apochromatic of 1'40, which I soon found
 was remarkably well corrected spherically*. It was accord
ingly next tested upon the object mentioned by Dr. Stoney,
 A. pelluci'da mounted in arsenic by Dr. Van Heurck. All the
transverse striae in the diatom were most easily resolved with
a central, solid, unstopped full aplanatic cone of over 0'90
from a dry condenser. The larger features were of course
also quite correctly and sharply imaged, as Dr. Stoney’s are
not.     Need it be asked which is the truest image?                      -
    But this is not nearly the limit-I“. Since that experiment
Mr. E. M. Nelson has shown me A. pellucida clearly resolved
   1' A rough but very fair idea of the spherical correction may be obtained
almost immediately by focussing a.1:’odum test-scale with small cone,
and then ascertaining how far the me can be opened Without altering
the image of the exclamation-marks. Using successively larger annula' of
light, this test becomes far more el<U+FB01>cient and severe.
   1‘ Owing to some astigmatism and other defects, my own vision is
very coarse and imperfect in these matters, and for me to see the striae
means much more for many other observers. The <U+FB01>rst valve Mr. E. M.
Nelson showed me in balsam as “strongl " resolved, was to my sight
quite unresolvable, and he had to search or another, which I was able
to see. This diatom is one of the most variable in resolvability of the
whole list, quite apart from the mere coarseness of striation. That is
no difficulty at all.

into striae, mounted in balsam, as well as “ dry,” with a similar
cone of over 0'90 from Powell’s apochromatic condenser, and
a Zeiss 5 apochromatic ot' 1'40. This latter lens was probably
one of the <U+FB01>nest ever made —I at least never saw its equal—
and the mere striae were not all it had to tell us, using no
arrangements beyond the 0'90 full cone, and Gitt'ard’s green
light-<U+FB01>lter.    On a dry valve, it clearly displayed where bits
of coarser upper membrane with their blacker lines were
overlying the lower, as is more often seen in A. Lindheimerz'i.
And on a strong valve in quinidine, carefully adjusting for
what may be termed the “white” focus, each of the striae
could be seen clearly outlined at both edges, the outlines
being a series of small convex curves, scalloping out the stria
into partly-de<U+FB01>ned oval beads. The divisions or narrower
necks between these partly-de<U+FB01>ned ovals did not lie in longi
tudinal rows, but occurred with a considerable degree of
irregularity.    I think it probable that such resolution, which
most closely parallels the coarser Lind/zeimerii valve, may be
the truest resolution yet attained.
   No doubt the above lens was (for the present) an almost
phenomenal one. Every practical microscopist knows that
the “ similar” objectives, by even the very best makers, are
not “ all alike,” whatever the makers may af<U+FB01>rm. They differ
in features as in a case above mentioned ; most of all in the
cone they can employ in critical work, and in what such a
cone will reveal. Everyone engaged in difficult research has
some favourite objective, treasured and spared in work as
much as possible ; because he knows full well that if parted
with or injured, though he can buy a “similar” one at the
list price, it may be long ere he <U+FB01>nds such another!
   22. And this brings us to the last point. The question of
how far we may still expect advances in our optical powers
of research is important; and it is answered very differently
according to the “spectrum ” theory, or the quali<U+FB01>ed views
here maintained. It not only follows From the foregoing,
but has been over and over again stated expressly by the Abbe
school, that we have no hope of further advance, except
through increase of aperture ; and on that ground was con
structed the lens of 1'63 NA. to be used with <U+FB02>int-glass
mounts and dense <U+FB02>uid media—conditions under which it is
practically useless. So little are other conditions recognized,
that Dr. Van Heurck has only used the chromatic condenser
in his skilful published diatom photographs ; and those results
are simply m'l, not one of them surpassing, or in some
res ects even equalling, what has been done in England
wit 1'40 lenses.

   Prof. A. Roiti on the x-Rays and the Cathodic Beam.           503
   It is far different if the Abbe theory be relegated to its proper
place and proportion. Then such “ lucky ” objectives as the
above assume a very marked signi<U+FB01>cance, and hold out a world
of promise : in them and in what they tell us lies the future of
microscopy. Not the best even of them is probably pevfectly
corrected for all its zones; but the best of them reveal a
marvellous standard of approach to this ; and with that we <U+FB01>nd
ever associated an increase of that practicable cone of hetero
geneous light which we have found so all-important to true
contours. And with this we get further revelation. More
minuleness we do not indeed get; for that we can look only to
the 1'63 lens. But we have a world of structure to learn yet,
within the resolution of our present lenses; and for that we
are only waiting better condensers and better correction. It
was only recently that the protoplasm so long written of as
“ structureless jelly,” yielded up some at least of its marvellous
and minute structure, which can only be seen by English
wide-cone methods, with one of the exceptionally-perfect
objectives here referred to; whose significance, however, as
we have seen, is not yet recognized on the Continent as
it is in England, and even here only by the few. It may
be beyond us to-day to discover the minute departures from
type which cause the superiority of the few phenomenal lenses :
it is no easy thing to ascertain precisely what it is, in a
lens one of whose components may not exceed a hemisphere
116 of an inch in diameter.         But the superiority is there ; it
has been attained ; and we may cherish reasonable hopes of
such discovery. We may anticipate that the present rarest
excellence may be reached yet as a standard, more generally
procurable by the scienti<U+FB01>c investigator; that the very best
of all may even be further improved in correction in some
degree. If it be so, such advances will not be barren of
 results in research. The microscopist may yet hope and take
courage.

 504        Prof. A. Roiti on the x-Rays and the Cathodic Beam.
        The ar-rays differ from the cathode-rays in that they cannot
 be de<U+FB02>ected by a magnet, and in that they possess a greater
 penetrating power. Yet this is no hard and fast distinction;
 for as there are cathodic rays which can be more or less
 de<U+FB02>ected, so there are m-rays capable of penetrating to a
 greater or smaller degree into various substances. And on
 the border between the two, although we cannot yet assert,
 we cannot with certainty deny the existence of cathode-rays
 that cannot be de<U+FB02>ected, and of w-rays that can to some extent
 be turned aside by intense magnetic action; while, on the
 other hand, if the various material mediums are turbid for
 the cathode-rays, they are not perfectly transparent to the
 w-ra s.
        Sfiice matters stand thus, one may be allowed to main
 tain in opposition to the English, who continue to adduce
 excellent reasons in defence of Orookes’s theory of radiating
 matter, that the two kinds of rays are not essentiallyditferent,
 but that they gradually merge into each other. Rontgen
 himself, in his third communication*, seems inclined to admit
 this.
        But this is a very different thing from asserting that the
 .r-rays are derived from the cathode-rays by a simple process
 of subtraction.
        Among the various attempts at proving this last assertion
 I must name those of my countrymen T. I refrain, however,
 from analysing them minutely, as I am anxious to avoid here
 any appearance of polemic. Besides, a very little thought
 will be suf<U+FB01>cient to confute them if the following conside
 rations be borne in mind.                                            '

 variations of potential presented by a conductor placed in a
 discharging-tube (whether subjected or not to magnetic action),
 we <U+FB01>nd it impossible to decide whence the dispersive action
 comes and what way it follows ; because the distribution and
 the <U+FB02>uctuations of the electricity within the tube cannot yet
 be rightly determined 1; and because the phenomenon is

 complicated by the fact that the residual as is decomposed
 into free ions, as is demonstrated by J. J. homson.
    2. Every point on a body exposed to cathode-rays becomes
 a point of emanation for w-rays which go in all directions,
 both in the tube and in the body exposed, to a considerable
 depth, so that they can pass through it and emerge. If we
 maintain, then, that the z-rays already exist in the impinging
 beam, we must admit that when they meet a body they do
 not go straight, but are diffused in all directions.
   3. Photographic impressions external to the tube and the
 shadows shown by <U+FB02>uorescent screens move or are modi<U+FB01>ed
in accordance with the deviations of the internal cathode
 rays; hence we are forced to admit that the points struck by
 the de<U+FB02>ected rays have also become points of emanation for
 non-defiectible w-rays; and it would be absurd to suppose
 that these latter already existed in the beam which excited
them.
    4. As a last defence of the proposition, then, one would
 have to maintain that, if not all, a great part at any rate of
the z-rays were contained in the cathodic beam—that part
 which does not obey magnetic action.
   Later on I shall describe some experiments which show, on
the contrary, that if at any rate rays incapable of de<U+FB02>exion
may enter into the formation of the cathode-beam, such rays
have a degree of intensity incomparably less than the x-rays
that issue from the same tube.
   5. There remains, therefore, no other explanation than this :
that the cathode-rays are transformed when they strike an
obstacle; just as occurs in the common phenomena of calo
rescence and <U+FB02>uorescence produced by the various rays of the
solar spectrum.
   6. On the other hand, the cathode-rays properly so-called
—those that can be de<U+FB02>ected by magnetic action—are re<U+FB02>ected
and are transmitted through thin strata, passing into a vacuum
or into the air with all their characteristic properties. This
was taught by Lenard and con<U+FB01>rmed by recent experiments
of photographs taken within the tubes. These photographs,
if the wrapper containing the sensitive <U+FB01>lm is very thin, are
at bottom nothing but the repetition under another form of
those (now become classic) obtained by Lenard himself.
   7. It is natural that no regularity should have been observed
in the re<U+FB02>exion of the cathode-rays: in the <U+FB01>rst place, the
surfaces employed have not, as a rule, been smooth and po
lished enough; in the second place, mirrors optically perfect
may prove furrowed for these rays.         Nor do I understand
how any one can af<U+FB01>rm that they do not follow the laws of

506      Prof. A. Roiti on the x-Rays and the Cathodic Beam.
diffusion, since these are so various and not yet <U+FB01>rmly
established.      Hence it will be better, until further proof, to
assume that they do undergo diffusion.
   8. The emission of the w-rays is not con<U+FB01>ned to the surface
of the object struck, but takes place within a stratum of
perceptible thickness; and this follows as a consequence"E
from the fact that it does not follow Lambert’s law of cosines,
but is constant in all directions.        For this reason, as Hertz
and Lenard have shown, very thin strata are transparent for
cathode-rays which are there transformed to a certain extent;
but when the thickness is increased the intensity of the trans
mitted rays sinks to zero; while, on the other hand, the
intensity of the w-rays emanating from these strata increases
to a maximum, so that photographs taken in the interior of
the tubes upon <U+FB01>lms protected by not very thin wrappers are
due rather to the w- than to the cathode-rays.
   9. Lenard certainly had under his hands the rays after wards
detected by Rontgen; but they escaped him perhaps because
the keton-screen with which he made his observations, although
it <U+FB02>uoresces under the action of cathode-rays, does not do
so under that of x-rays ‘I‘, but more probably because his
windows of aluminium-leaf were too thin to emit w-rays of
suf<U+FB01>cient intensity; and for this reason all the rays issuing
from the tube through these windows appeared to him more
or less de<U+FB02>ected under the action of the magnet.
    10. On the invention of the focus-tubes in which a small
plate of platinum inclined at an angle of 45° acts as an anti
cathode, photographs were obtained with outlines so clear as
to indicate that the place from which the w-rays emanated
was con<U+FB01>ned to the points of the platinum struck by the
cathodic pencil. But it was soon observed that at the discharge
the whole of the wall in front of the platinum plate shines
with a <U+FB02>uorescent light, while that behind it remains almost
dark unless the little plate of platinum be replaced by a leaf.
And an object placed within the tube before the anticathode
plate throws a shadow both on the wall and on an external
<U+FB02>uorescent screen : the <U+FB01>rst shadow is displaced by magnetic
action, but not the second 1.
    There can he, therefore, no doubt that there spring from
the platinum anticathode not only w-rays, but also rays of a
different kind which were called internal rays, and were con
sidered different from the cathode-rays because they were

not arise from the impinging pencil either through regular
re<U+FB02>exion or through diffusion.
    11. It must be remembered, however, that photographs
of the tube, taken with a camera without lens, show that
some .z-rays, weak ones it is true, also start from all the
surface of the glass rendered <U+FB02>uorescent by the so-called
internal rays; and I have already shown that their non
observance of the laws of re<U+FB02>exion does not seem a su<U+FB02>icient
reason for making a distinction between these rays and the
cathode-rays properly so-called. And let it be remembered
that whilst the cathode-rays cause a marked <U+FB02>uorescence in
 glass, I have assured myself that .z-rays cause almost none,
even when their point of departure is an anticathode of
aluminium serving as a dividing wall, so that they have not
already passed through glass.

     I pass to the promised experiments, which, as I think,
 would alone suffice to exclude the idea that the rc-rays are
 derived from the cathodic pencil by a simple process of sub

platinocyanide of potassium and turned towards the centre of
the anticathode disk. Under the in<U+FB02>uence of moderate rare
faction this face, at <U+FB01>rst extremely brilliant, became perfectly
dark; but when the rarefaction was great, it still showed
4/100 of its original brightness, showing that the anticathode,
notwithstanding the deflexion, was still giving o<U+FB02>' w-rays.
This small residuum might, however, have been formed, so to
speak, by second intention—by the cathode-rays re<U+FB02>ected on
the lateral wall F.
    To decide this question I introduced into the tube a leaden
tube, supported against the aluminium bottom as is seen in
the <U+FB01>gure ; and by means of this screen the brightness, even
with extreme rarefaction, was reduced to -]/1000 under the
action of the magnet.
    On replacing the permanent magnet by an electromagnet
separated from the tube by plates of ebonite to prevent the
discharge taking place, at that extreme rarefaction, on the
outside, every excitement of the electromagnet was observed
to occasion the sudden passage of the actiiiometer from
extreme hrilliancy to perfect darkness.
   The coil with the interruptor, which I have described in
L’Elettricista for November 1897, gave a spark of 15 centim.
between balls of 2 centim. in diameter, and the magnetizing
current of the electromagnet was less than half an ampere.
    Hence it is clear that non-de<U+FB02>ectible cathodic rays probably
do not exist, or if they exist they are not transformable into
.r-rays.
                                     III.
    As an appendix to this communication I will speak of one
of my former experiments *, which also shows that az-rays
cannot be considered as simply diffused cathodic rays.                 Two
tubes, of the form represented in <U+FB01>g. 1, alike in all respects
except that in one the disk was of aluminium, in the other of
copper, were both applied to the same air-pump and connected
with the two poles of a Ruhmkortf coil. On covering the
aluminium disk with a copper plate and the copper disk with
an aluminium plate in such a manner that the av-rays issuing
from the two tubes were forced to traverse equal thicknesses
of the two metals, I found the power of emission of the second
tube considerably greater than that of the <U+FB01>rst.

contained in the metals or adhering to the walls is suf<U+FB01>cient
to profoundly modify the results of the experiment ; and I
repeated the experiment, using one tube only. I covered the
aluminium disk, half internally and half externally, with two
pieces of the same sheet of magnesium, being careful to <U+FB01>x
the internal half, which might otherwise, under the influence
of the discharge, have been so. much agitated as to be entirely
overturned.    The disk served as an anode, was in communi
cation with the ground, and was protected externally by a
sheet of lead perforated in the centre.
   When I applied a cryptoscope I could observe not the
slightest difference in brightness on either side of the diameter
of separation. This proves nothing if one re<U+FB02>ects that, with
the concave cathode, the region struck by the cathodic rays
must be very limited in extent.        But I found it also very
limited when I used a convex cathode, on account of the
electrostatic action which the cylindrical wall has on the
pencil, which would otherwise be divergent.
   Iwas able to obtain a fairly uniform illumination of an
extended area by using the tube represented in <U+FB01>g. 2, in
                               Fig. 2.

an aluminium tube to the disk.          With this, keeping the
anodic disk in communication with the <U+FB01>liform aluminium
electrode and with the ground, I was able to assure 1n self

Hence it may be maintained that aluminium has a higher
power of emission than magnesium.
   It then occurred to me to compare other metals in the
same way, by twos ; covering the aluminium disk internally
half with the metal A and half with the metal B, and placing
B externally with regard to A, and A with regard to B.
   In the following table I have arranged the various metals

   It is evident that the power of emission for .e-rays is
determined neither by density nor by atomic volume, but that
 (with the exception of tin, perhaps because I used commercial
 and therefore impure metal) it increases regularly with the
 atomic weight.                                        .
    Should this law prove general it would have a theoretic
 bearing of no small importance. Meanwhile I restrict myself
 to observing that there should be an advantage, unless its
 easy fusibility proves a hindrance, in the use of lead instead
 of platinum as an anticathode in the Rontgen tubes. Lead
 placed in sheets on aluminium should serve still better, as I
 intend proving.
    (Addition during the correction of the proofs). While com
 mercial tin(*) had to be placed between zinc and silver, that
 furnished as pure by Merck, of Darmstadt, and reduced to a
 sheet of 0'11 mm. in thickness, shows a considerably greater
 power of emission ; greater than that of cadmium. We may
 therefore assert that the metals of greater atomic weight emit
 x-rays of greater intensity.

  L111. Phase-Reversal Zone-Plates, and Dg'fraction— Telescopes.
                         By R. W. Wooo’.
                            [Plate XXIVJ
  IN a paper published in Poggendorfs Annalen (1875)
        Soret showed that if we describe a number of small
  concentric circles on a glass plate, with radii pro ortional to
  the square roots of the natural numbers, and lacken the
  spaces between the alternate rings, the plate will have the
  property of bringing parallel rays of light to a focus, like a
  condensing-lens. The dark rings check the disturbances on
  the alternate Huygens’s zones on the wave-front, which by
  destructive interference with the disturbances from the other
  zones ordinarily produce darkness at points within the geo
  metrical shadow.
      Soret’s method was to draw circles of suitable size on a
  sheet of paper, blackening the alternate rin s, and make a
  reduced photographic copy of the whole.           e showed that
  such a plate formed real images of luminous objects, and
  could be used as the objective ofa telescope or as the eyepiece.
  He also showed that in addition to acting as a. condensing-lens,
  the zone-plate acted as a concave or dispersing-lens.       More
  over, he pointed out that the plate has multiple foci at distances
  a2 aa a,2
  X’ 371’ 570 w here a is the radius of the central circle.
      Since the appearance of Soret’s paper very little seems to
  have been done with the subject, though it is alluded to brie<U+FB02>y
  in the textbooks, and it has been pointed out by Lord Rayleigh
  that if it were possible to provide that the light stopped by
  alternate zones were re laced by a phase-reversal, a fourfold
   effect would be produc . After some experimenting I have
I succeeded in producing such a zone-plate, perfectly trans
  parent over its entire extent, which yields an image at least six
  or eight times as bright as those produced with the old form
   of plate. This increase in intensity is greater than one would
   expect, which is probably accounted for by the lack of per
   fection 0f the black zone-plates, the black rings being partly
   transparent and the clear ones not wholly so. Using one of
   the new plates as the objective of a telescope in connexion
   with a low- ower eyepiece, I have distinctly seen the lunar
   craters, and ave constructed telescopes in which both objective
   and eyepiece were zone-plates.
      The largest plate made by Soret contained 98 dark circles,
   and since the scale on which it was drawn was rather small,
   the outer zones could not have been very accurately placed.

  512    Mr. B. W. “food on Phase-Reversal Zone- Plates
 The preliminary drawing which I made contained 115 dark
 rings, and was drawn on a scale three times as large as that used
 by Soret. In order to avoid the errors due to shrinkage and
 expansion of the paper during the progress of the work, the
 following method was adopted. A sheet of heavy smooth
 surface drawing-paper, considerably over a metre square, was
 thoroughly dampened and the edges glued down to a heavy
 drawing-board. The paper was kept damp until the edges
 had thoroughly dried to prevent the shrinkage from tearing
 them loose. On drying, the paper was in close contact with
 the board and as tight as a drumhead. A copper tack with a
 small conical dent in its head was driven into the centre of
 the board to serve as a centre for the beam-compass used in
 drawing the circles. The pen of the compass was accurately
 set for each circle by means of a Brown and Sharp steel
 metre-bar, care being taken to set by the inner and outer edge
 of the pen alternately, in order that no error due to the width
 of the line should be present.   Two hundred and thirty circles
 were drawn in this manner, using the greatest care possible
 to ensure accuracy. The spaces between the alternate rings
 were then blackened by means of the beam-compass and a
broad pen. In spite of every precaution errors crept in which
 manifest themselves as slight shadings at certain places; their
 etfeet, however, is small.
    The labour involved in the preparation of such a drawing
 was so great that it has seemed worth while to publish with
 this paper a reduced photographic copy, from which other
 still more reduced copies can be prepared on glass by anyone.
 I have made photographic negatives of this drawing on
 lantern-slide plates of various sizes, and <U+FB01>nd that they act
very satisfactorily. These copies were made with a very <U+FB01>ne
-Zeiss lens, and had focal lengths varying from haff‘a metre
 to ten metres. Smaller plates could not be made with this
 lens, since the limit in the de<U+FB01>ning power is about '02 millim.
[In order to produce plates of very short focus I made some
 copies with a Beck microscope-objective of about 2 centim.
 focus. The focal lengths of these plates varied from 3 to
 10 centim., and they were found to act admirably as eyepieces.
The central circle of one of these micro-plates had a radius of
                                                          ('158)‘2
'158 millim.; its focus for yellow light is therefore

or 4'1 centim. In spite of its small size, the rings were sharp
 out to the edge, where their width, measured on a small
dividing-engine, was found to be only “005 millim.
    A number of experiments were tried with these plates;
but as they can be shown to a much better advantage with

                     and Difruction- Telescopes.             5 13
the transparent plates, I will postpone the discussion of them
until a little later in the paper. Before taking up the subject
of the phase-reversal plate I may as well call attention to a
very pretty method of preparing a zone-plate to illustrate its
action.
   Ifa pro<U+FB01>le-face or other design is cut out of black paper
and pinned on to the original drawing somewhere between
the centre and the edge, and a photograph of the whole
about 3 centim. in diameter be made, on looking at a point of
light through the plate, the now perfectly transparent pro<U+FB01>le
will appear jet-black on a brightly illuminated back-ground
—that is to say, the space within the design being devoid of
 black lines does not <U+FB01>ll up with light.
   To prepare azone-plate in which the light, instead of being
cut off by the alternate rings, shall suffer a phase-reversal,
the best method appeared to be to prepare a plate with trans
parent zones of a thickness suf<U+FB01>cient to retard the light one
  alf wave-length. Sheets of thin plate-glass with the surface
carefully cleaned were <U+FB02>owed with a warm solution of gelatine
 (strong enough to just set into a jelly on cooling), and set on
 edge to dry. The <U+FB01>lms were then sensitized by immersing
 the plates for about <U+FB01>ve seconds in a weak solution of bichro
 mate of potassium, and dried in the dark. Properly pre ared
 <U+FB01>lms should exhibit no trace of crystallization, and sliould
 have a barely perceptible yellow tint. These plates Were
 placed in contact with the photographic reduction, and printed
in direct sunlight; the exposure varying from 20 seconds to
 1 minute according to the density of the negative. They
 were then removed from the frame, washed for a. moment in
 cold water, and then immersed in rather warm water, which
 dissolved and washed away the gelatine which had been pro
 tected by the dark zones, leaving the alternate rings attached
 to the glass. On drying these plates they were perfectly
 transparent, but by holding them in certain lights the rings
 could be seen .   The effect produced by them far surpassed my
 expectations. 0n viewing a brightly luminous point through
 them, they <U+FB01>ll up with a blaze of light which compares very
 favourably with a lens. They are not uniformly good, how
 ever, everything depending on the thickness of the <U+FB01>lm, and,
 moreover, the exposure must have been exactly right.      I <U+FB01>nd
 that if one of these plates 3 centim. in diameter be set up at
 a distance of 2% metres from an arc-light and a paper screen
 be placed at a suitable distance (3 or 4 metres) behind the
 plate, an exceedingly bright and sharp, somewhat enlarged
 image of the arc is projected; the surface irregularities of the
 heated carbons can be seen, and the blue <U+FB02>ame between them,

  514     Mr. R. W. Wood on Phase-Reversal Zone-Plates
  the small incandescent particles that are thrown off being also
  clearly visible.
     If the screen is near the plate, the image of the carbons is
  orange-red; and as it is moved back the colour changes to
 yellow, green, and blue, the foci for different colours being
 far apart. The best de<U+FB01>nition appears to be in the yellow
 and green. On setting the plates up at a greater distance
 from the arc and placing a sheet of paper in the focus,
'a large part of the light incident on the plate is brought to
 a very small sharp focus surrounded by a dark area, corre
 sponding to the geometrical projection of that part of the
 plate which is effective. With some plates this dark area
 is very small, and the central bright spot correspondingly
 feeble, showing that what little action there is comes from a
 few rings in the centre. This forms a very good method of
 testing the plates; and in general I <U+FB01>nd that about one out of
 four can be considered <U+FB01>rst class. With more care in the
 preparation of the <U+FB01>lms greater uniformity in the results
 could doubtless be secured.
    In making these plates it is necessary to use mirror-glass
 with a ground surface if good definition is to be obtained. 1
.<U+FB01>nd the German mirror-glass which comes with a deposit of
 metallic silver backed by varnish gives very good results.
 The varnish can be removed by alcohol, the silver with
 nitric acid, and the surface cleaned. It is best to prepare a
 large number of plates and select the best, either by throwing
 an image of an arc-light with them on a screen, or by the
 following method which is perhaps better.
    A small hole a millimetre or so in diameter is punched in a
 black card or a metal plate and set up in front ofa bright
 sodium flame; the zone-plate is mounted at a distance of
 three metres from this, and the eye brought into the focus. If
 the plate is good, it lights up brightly and uniformly. Most
 plates, however, show irregularity in the illumination, and
 may even have spots that appear quite devoid of light. These
 dark spots may be caused by the <U+FB01>lm being so thin as to give
 no appreciable retardation, or so thick as to give a retardation
vof a whole wave or a number of whole waves. Plates that do
 not come up to this test often give very good images, how
 ever, and need not be rejected. Those which light up feebly
 and but a short distance from the centre should be thrown
awav.
    Although a large percentage of the light is wasted by a
zone~plate, the focal ima es produced by these plates were so
 sharp and brilliant, that T determined to see just what results
 could be obtained with a telescope constructed with one.

                   and Dzfraction- Telescopes.               515
Removing the objective from my 5 in. Clark, I put a 3 centim.
gelatiiie zone-plate in its place. A low-power eyepiece was
used, and on viewing terrestrial objects, such as distant
chiinney~tops and trees against the sky, with this combination,
the result seemed to be very unsatisfactory ; the ampli<U+FB01>cation
was about 60 diameters and the outlines were shar , but there
was very little difference in light value between t e sky and
dark chimneys. In other words the <U+FB01>eld was bright. The
most suitable objects for a telescope of this description are
small, brightly illuminated ones on a black background; under
these conditions the general illumination of the <U+FB01>eld is reduced
to a minimum. I tried the telescope on the moon, and
although the image was somewhat dim and hazy, as seen
through thin clouds, I could distinctly see a number of tl.e
lurgcr craters.                                               '
   The zone-plate used in this case had a focal length of about
<U+FB01>ve feet; but plates of shorter focus show the principle
equally well, and make more convenient instruments to
handle. If we use an ordinary low-power eyepiece in the
principal focus of the zone-plate, we obtain a highly magnified
inverted image. If now we push the eyepiece in, the image
becomes blurred, vanishes, and a second smaller inverted
image appears ; and on continuing to diminish the distance,
we get images successively smaller and smaller as the eye
piece passes through the different foci of the plate. The best
object to view is an incandescent electric lamp at a distance
of six or eight metres. With the Soret form of plate, I have
never been able to find more than three foci, while the phase
reversal plates easily show six. If instead of the glass eye
piece we use one of the niicro-zoneplates, we obtain both
erect and inverted images ; the inverted when the eyepiece is
in the focus, and the erect when it is between the focus and
the plate—the former image being due to the action of the
micro-plate as a convex lens, the latter to its action as a con
cave lens, as in the Galilean telesco e. In spite of the <U+FB01>neness
of the lines in the micro-plates, I nd that they can be made
to yield very excellent phase-reversal plates by contact print
ing, so that by making both objective and eyepiece on the
new principle, we have a diffraction-telescope wholly without
lenses or mirrors, which is fairly efficient for viewing small
bri htly-illuminated objects.
     tarting with the eyepiece close to the objective and
moving it slowly back, we get a rapid alternation of erect
and inverted images, to the number of eight or ten in all.
As the eye iece moves the colour of the image changes, the
foci being ifferently situated for the different colours.

516     Mr. R. W. Wood on Phase-Reversal Zone-Plates
   I have tried making landscape-photographs, using one of
these short-focus retardation-plates instead of a lens. The
results far surpassed my expectations. There are good
qualities in the zone-plate picture that almost offset the
de<U+FB01>ciencies. Very soft and artistic effects can be produced.
Where there is a mass of twigs against the sky the zone-plate
rubs in a little extra shade for a background instead of cutting
each stem sharp and black against the white sky. The
shadows are massed to a great extent, and yet there is de<U+FB01>
nition enough to prevent the picture from appearing out of
focus. The landscape reproduced (<U+FB01>g. 1) was made with a plate
of 4 millim. aperture and 14 centim. focus, with an exposure of
half a second, which is certainly a great improvement on pin
hole photography. The picture has lost much in reproduction.
The actinic focus of the plate must be found and the image
on the ground-glass is never sharp, owing to the chromatic
aberration.    I have used a blue glass to advantage in <U+FB01>nding
the focus; and a low sun in thin clouds makes an excellent
object to focus upon.
                              big. 1.
   A very simple elementary way of explaining the multiple
foci, both real and virtual, of the zone-plate which I have not

                     and Dijiruction- 'I'clescopes.             517
   seen given anywhere, probably because of its obvious nature,
   is the following:—We may regard the zone-plate asa circular
   grating in which the grating space becomes less and less as
  we proceed outward from the centre, consequently the bending
  or deviation of the diffracted ray from the normal becomes
   greater as we near the edge, and the change in the grating
  space is such as to bring all the deviated rays of a sin le
  colour together in a point. The principal real focus of t e
  plate corresponds to the superimposed spectra of the <U+FB01>rst
  order; the second order spectra being bent more come
  together at a point nearer the plate, forming a second focus,
  and so on—the di<U+FB01>'erent foci corresponding to spectra of
  different orders. There are also spectra of the <U+FB01>rst order
  bent outwards, or away from the centre, and these rays pro
  jected backwards behind the plate will meet, forming a
  virtual focus in a position corresponding to that of the real
  focus on the opposite side of the plate; the second order
 spectra are bent out more, consequently the virtual focus of
  these rays is nearer the plate, and we thus see, that for every
  real focus on the one side of the plate, there is a corresponding
  virtual focus on the other.
     Plates of very long focus are also useful for demonstration.
 I have one 7 centim. in diameter, with a focal length of
 about twelve metres. This plate will project a very good
 image of the sun, about 11 centim. in diameter, on a screen
 placed at the focus. The effect is especially <U+FB01>ne when the
 sun is behind the lea<U+FB02>ess branches of distant trees, for then
 each twig stands out sharp and distinct on the image. When
 this plate is set up at a distance of 3 metres from an arc-light
 and the eye is brought into one of the nearer foci, 3 or 4
 metres behind the plate, the effect is very <U+FB01>ne; the whole
 area. <U+FB01>lling up with a dazzling white light of almost insup—
 portable brilliaucy.
     The diffraction phenomena produced by openin s in thin
transparent <U+FB01>lms were studied b Quincke and pu lished in
 Poggendor<U+FB01>’s Annalen, 1867. (guincke, moreover, prepared
gratin s with narrow strips of a thin transparent lamina
insteaf of the usual dark spaces: these, by retarding the
light, threw the waves out of phase with those which passed
between them. These gratings he prepared by ruling the
silvered surface of a piece of glass on a div1ding-engine,
forming an ordinary grating in which the dark lines were
narrow stri s of silver equal in width to the clear spaces. By
covering t 6 plate with iodine the silver was changed into
transparent iodide. He found that these transparent gratings
gave spectra very similar to ordinary gratings, save in one

     518      Mr. R. W. Wood on Phase-Reversal Zone-Plates
      respect, namely, that with <U+FB01>lms of certain thickness the
      central direct image disappeared entirely when monochro
      matic light was used, and passed through a succession of
      colours when white light was used. By making the <U+FB01>lms
      slightly wedge-shaped and ruling the lines at right angles to
      the thin edge, he obtained a grating in which the thickness
      increased continually towards the bottom. On looking at an
    <U+FB02> illuminated slit through the top of this grating where the
     “thickness of the <U+FB01>lm was zero, the central image alone was
      tbserved. On moving the grating up, the <U+FB01>lm began to have
 /        appreciable thickness, and side or diffracted images appeared
/     on either side of the central one. These increased in bright
   ] ness with increasing thickness of the <U+FB01>lm, while the central
      image became fainter, and <U+FB01>nally disappeared when the thick
       ness was such as to give to the light passing through it a
      retardation of one half wave-length on the light passing by it.
      We thus have a transparent plate which will not allow a my
      to pass directly through it, or, in other words, a transparent
      grating which gives no central image.            I <U+FB01>nd that very
      satisfactory lamina gratings can be prepared in the same way
      as the zone-plates ; by drawing black lines of uniform width
      and with uniform spaces between them on white paper,
      reducing them by photography, and printing on the sensitized
      gelatine. The same effects can be observed by viewing an
      illuminated slit through the outer edge of the lamina zone
      plate held close to the eye.                                       ‘
         Quincke found that if a portion of the hypothenuse surface
      of a right-angle prism be silvered, a ray re<U+FB02>ected from the
   ' metal suffers a phase displacement relative to a ray which is
      totally re<U+FB02>ected from the boundary between glass and air.
      Whether or not this change is a complete phase-reversal or
       not depends on a number of conditions. If polarized light
      is used, the change of phase depends on whether the plane
       of polarization is parallel or perpendicular to the plane of inci
       dence, on the angle of incidence, and on the thickness of the
       <U+FB01>lm. It appeared probable that a silver zone-plate, formed on
       the surface of a re<U+FB02>ecting prism, would give excellent results
       under certain conditions. Such a plate could be ruled on a
       slowly revolving prism, but the process of advancing the knife
      point over the right distances would be tedious in the extreme,
       and I accordingly hunted about for a photomechanical process.
       After a little experimenting I devised a method which yielded
       beautiful results. Plate-glass, carefully cleaned and silvered
       by the chemical method, is coated with an exceedingly thin
       <U+FB01>lm of gelatine : the solution should be just too weak to set
       into a jelly on cooling, merely thickening a little. It should

  be poured while warm over the silver surface, and the plate
 set on edge to dry. This takes place in <U+FB01>ve or ten minutes,
 and the surface now shows interference colours. The <U+FB01>lm is
 now sensitized by a ten-second immersion in a very dilute
 solution of bichromate of potash (plate dipped in it should be
 coloured a very pale yellow only) and dried in the dark *.
    An impression is taken by exposure under a negative, the
 plate is held for a moment in cold water and then washed
 in a stream of fairly hot water. This is the fussy part of
 the operation ; for if the stream is too violent or the water
  too hot it will wash away everythinrr, and if it is too feeble
 some gelatine will be left between the undissolved zones. I
 <U+FB01>nd that pouring from a beaker held at a height of 10 centim.
 gives a stream of the proper strength, and the temperature
 should be about what the hand can bear comfortably. A half
  minute’s washing is enough, and the plate must now be <U+FB02>ooded
 with alcohol and then with ether, to prevent the slow solution
 of gelatine during the drying, which always coats the clear
 'zones with a thin <U+FB01>lm. The plate will dry in a few seconds,
 and if it has been properly prepared the odd zones will be
  clean bri ht silver, and the even ones covered with a thin
  <U+FB01>lm whitii appears white by re<U+FB02>ected light. The plate is
 new covered with iodine crystals, which convert the exposed
 'silver into iodide, and the process can be watched by holding
  the plate above the head and looking at the under side.          The
  iodide zones will appear white, and on shaking off the iodine
  transparent by transmitted light.
     A strong solution of sodium thiosulphate is now applied,
  which dissolves the silver iodide, and the plate is then rubbed
  with the <U+FB01>n ers under warm water until the gelatine is all
  removed.       f everything goes well a most beautiful plate is
  the result. The silver rings are as sharp as if out with a knife,
  and the spaces between them are quite clean, even where
  there are <U+FB01>fty zones to the millimetre.           Such a plate used
  with transmitted light is much better than the usual photo
  graphic type, in that the clear spaces are perfectly clean and
  transparent, and the dark ones perfectly opaque, which, as I
  said before, is usually not the case.
     It is not necessary to make the zones directly on the prism,
  though I tried this <U+FB01>rst. It is essentially the same thing if
  we make them on a plate of glass and fasten this to the
   rism face with Canada balsam, the silver side out of course.
 The brilliaucy of the image produced by this arrangement is
  very great, but since the re<U+FB02>ecting surface is at an angle of

45° the focus instead of being a point is a line. When the
 screen is near the prism we get a very bright vertical line,
 which fades away as the screen is moved 011', being replaced
 with a horizontal line. This is exactly what we get when
 we hold a transmission plate at an angle with the screen, and
 the greater the obliquity the shorter the focus, the increasing
 obliquity decreasing the grating space on the sides of the plate.
    To get a point-focus from a reflecting plate on a prism
 the zones must be elliptical, the major axes being double the
 minor, the whole being so placed that its projection on each
 of the other two faces of the prism is a circle. To make an
 elliptical zone-plate we have only to photograph the original
drawing in an oblique position. A slight error due to per
 spective will of course be introduced, but it is insuf<U+FB01>cient to
 materially affect the results.
    From a negative made from the large drawing set at an
 angle of 45° I prepared a silver-on-glass elliptical plate, and
 cemented it onto the prism with balsam. This combination
 ful<U+FB01>lled every expectation, and yielded a very brilliant and
 sharp image. It furnished, moreover, a very nice means of
 comparing the effect of an ordinary plate with a phase
 reversal one; for by turning it round a focal image was
 formed by the re<U+FB02>exion from the outer surface of the silver
 zones alone, which was many times fainter than that produced
 by the internal re<U+FB01>exion. In making this comparison I noted
 the curious circumstance that the focus from internal re<U+FB01>exion
 is longer than that from external re<U+FB02>exion, but can as yet offer
 no explanation of the fact.

    In order to give some idea of the relative intensities of the
 focal images produced b the plate with and without a phase
 reversal, I photographe an incandescent lamp-<U+FB01>lament, <U+FB01>rst
 from the outside surface of the zones and then from the
 inside, by the arrangement shown in <U+FB01>g. 2. The time of

exposure and development was the same, and both were taken
on the same plate. Reproductions of the two images are
shown in fig. 3. It will be noted that the brilliant one
                               Fig. 3.
 (or phase-reversal image) is larger than the other. This is
due to the increase in the focal length to which I have
alluded, and, other things being equal, would make the
illumination less. The image obtained from the outer surface
of the plate is so faint that it is hardly perceptible.
    I have made a very cursory examination of these phase
 reversal re<U+FB02>ecting plates with polarized light, and <U+FB01>nd that if
the light falling on the prism be plane-polarized, rotation of
the nicol causes <U+FB02>uctuations in the brilliancy of the image.
The effect, however, varies with the angle of incidence; at an
angle of 40° with the normal of the re<U+FB02>ecting surface no effect
is produced by rotating the nicol. When the angle is reater
than this, partial extinction of the image is produce when
the plane of polarization is perpendicular to the plane of
re<U+FB01>exion; when the angle is less than 40°, the reverse is the
case. The <U+FB01>eld about the image grows bright when the
central image weakens, and vice rersd. This requires a much
more complete investigation than I have had time to give it
yet, but is doubtless caused by the variations in the phase
change due to variations in the angle of incidence which
Quincke observed.
   Lord Rayleigh has drawn attention to the fact that if it
were possible to construct a lamina-grating in which an arbi
trary retardation could be introduced at every part of the
aperture all the light could be concentrated in any desired
spectrum. This might be accomplished, as Prof. Crew has
suggested to me, by shading the original drawing : possibly
photographing a. wire-grating on a white ground, illuminated

522         Lord Rayleigh on the Pressure of Radiation.
by oblique light (the shading being produced by penumbrae).
Or a series of wedge-shaped strips of tinted glass or gelatine
in transmitted light might yield results. The gelatine <U+FB01>lms
would have to receive the impression through the glass, I
imagine, if variations in the thickness were necessary.
    If this could be “accomplished, the same principle could be
applied to the zone-plate, all the light being brought to a single
focus.
    Experiments in this direction are now in progress.

 LIV. Note on the Pressure of Radiation, showing an Appa—
    rent Failure of the usual Electromagnetic Equations.             By
    Lord RAYLEIGH, F.R.S.*
       OLLOWING a suggestion of Bartoli, Boltzmann‘l' and
          W. Wieni have arrived at the remarkable conclusion
 that that part of the energy of radiation froma black body at
 absolute temperature 9, which lies between wave-lengths 7t
 and 7t +dA, has the expression
                                 65¢(67t)d>t,       . I . . . . (1)
 where ¢ is an arbitrary function of the single variable 67x.
 The law of Stefan, according to which the total radiation is
 as 64, is thererein included. The argument employed by
 these authors is very ingenious, and I think convincing when
 the postulates are once admitted. The most important of
 them relates to the pressure of radiation, supposed to be opcra
 tive upon the walls within which the radiation is con<U+FB01>ned,
 and estimated at one-third of the density of the energy in the
  case when the radiation is alike in all directions. The argu
 ment by which Maxwell originally deduced the pressure of
 radiation not being clear to me, Iwas led to look into the
  question a little more closely, with the result that certain dis
 crepancies have presented themselves which I desire to lay
  before those who have made a special study of the electric
  equations. The criticism which appears to be called for extends
  indeed much beyond the occasion which gave rise to it.
      A straightforward calculation of the presSure exercised by
  plane electric waves incident perpendicularly upon a metallic
  re<U+FB02>ector is given by Prof. J. J. Thomson §. The face of the

consideration the magnetic force reduces itself to the com
ponent (B) parallel to y, and the current to the component
(w) parallel to z. The waves which penetrate the conducting
mass die out more or less quickly according to the conductivity.
If the conductivity is great, most of the energy is re<U+FB02>ected,
and such part as is propagated into the conductor is limited
to a thin skin at .z'=0. According to the usual equations the
mechanical force exercised upon unit of area of the slice (1.1! of

 taken also to refer to the value at .z=0 just outside the metallic
 surface.

 are concerned only with the mean value. Since the mean

     It only remains to compare with the density of the energy
 outside the metal, and we may limit ourselves to the case of
 complete re<U+FB02>exion. The constant energy of the stationary

  forms. If we estimate it at the moment of maximum mag

    Thus, if the permeability ,u of the metal be unity, (4) and
 (6) coincide; and we conclude that in this case the pressure
is equal to the density of the energy in the neighbourhood of
the metal. This is Maxwell’s result. When we consider
 radiation in all directions, the pressure is expressed as one
thz'rd of the density of energy.
    The dif<U+FB01>culty that I have to raise relates to the case where
,u. is not equal to unity. The conclusion in (4) that the pres
 sure is proportional to ,u. would make havoc of the theory of
 Boltzmann and Wien and must, I think, he rejected. So
 long as the re<U+FB01>exion is complete—and it may be complete
 independently of ,u—the radiation is similarly in<U+FB02>uenced, and
 (one would suppose) must exercise a similar force upon the
 re<U+FB02>ector. But if the conclusion is impossible, where is the
 <U+FB02>aw in the process by which it is arrived at? Being unable
 to <U+FB01>nd any fault with the deduction above given (after Prof.
J. J. Thomson), I was led to scrutinize more closely the funda
 mental equation itself; and I will now explain why it appears
 to me to be incorrect.
     For this purpose let us apply it to the very simple case of
a wire of circular section, parallel to 2, moving in the direction
of 1’ across an originally uniform magnetic <U+FB01>eld            The uni
formity of the <U+FB01>eld is disturbed in two ways:                by the
operation of the current (10) <U+FB02>owing in the various <U+FB01>laments
of the wire, and (ii ) independently of a current, by the mag
netic effect of the material composing the wire whose permea
bility (,u.) is supposed to be great.     In estimating as in (2)
the mechanical force parallel to .z' operative upon the wire, we
should have to integrate 101) over the cross-section. In this 10
is supposed to be constant, and the local value is everywhere
to be attributed to b. We may indeed, if we please, omit
from b the part due to the currents in the wire, which will
in the end contribute nothing to the result ; but we are directed
to use the actual value of b as disturbed by the presence of
the magnetic material. In the particular case supposed, where
a is great, the value of b within the wire is uniform, and just
twice as great as at a distance.       It follows, when the inte
gration is effected, that the force parallel to .z' acting upon the
wire is greater (in the particular case doubly greater) than it
would be if the value of a were unity.
    But this conclusion cannot be accepted. The force depends
upon the number of lines of force to be crossed when the wire
makes a movement parallel to 0:. And it is clear that the
lines effectively crossed in such a movement are not the con
densed lines due to the magnetic quality of the wire, but are
to be reckoned from the intensity of the undzsturbed <U+FB01>eld.

Reduction to Air- Temperature of Plutiuum- Temperature.              525
The mechanical force cannot really depend upon a, and the
formula which leads to such a result must be erroneous.
    As regards the problem of the pressure of radiation, I
conclude that in this case also, and in spite of the formula,
the permeability of the re<U+FB02>ector is without effect, and that the
consequences deduced by Boltzmann and Wien remain un
disturbed.
    Another investigation to which perhaps similar conside
rations will apply is that of the mechanical force between
parallel slabs conveying rapidly alternating electric currents.
_Prof. J. J. Thomson’s conclusion * is that the electromagnetic
repulsion is u. times the electrostatic attraction, so that a
balance will occur only when ,u.= 1. It seems more probable
that the factor ,1, should be omitted, and that balance between
the two kinds of force is realized in every case.
 LV. The Reduction to normal Air-Temperatures of the Plu
    h'num- Temperatures in the Low-Temperature Researches
    of Professors Dewar and Fleming.             By J. D. HAMILTON
     DIUKSON, 31.11., F.R.S. 15.1
Vl‘HE measurement of temperature by means of platinum
          depends upon the two following propositions :—
(1) That for a given piece of pure annealed platinum-wire the
temperature is a single-valued function of the electric resistance.
This proposition is due to Prof. Callendar (1886), and has
been fully veri<U+FB01>ed by many subsequent observers. The
 second proposition is :-—(2) That however different specimens
 of pure annealed platinum~wire may vary among themselves,
nevertheless they agree in giving the same normal air
 temperature of any enclosure in which the may be
 simultaneously placed. This proposition mig t, at <U+FB01>rst
 sight, appear as a logical deduction from the <U+FB01>rst; but a
 little consideration will show that the two pro ositions are
 equally fundamental, and equally necessarily              ac to expe
 riment. We are indebted for it to the careful researches
 of Mr. E. H. Grif<U+FB01>ths.
     Theory has not yet provided the formula referred to
 in the <U+FB01>rst proposition; meanwhile, Prof. Uallendar has
 devised a double formula—or, rather, a formula with a
 correction—which amounts to the expansion of the electric
 resistance of the platinum-wire in powers of the temperature,
 and leads to a somewhat troublesome reduction before <U+FB01>nally

526      Mr. J. D. Hamilton Dickson 0n the Reduction to
obtaining the normal air-temperature required. I have given
reasons * to show that another empiric formula amounting to
the expansion of the temperature in powers of the electric
resistance of the wire, while free from some theoretical faults
attached to other formulae, is at least as good as the compound
formulae of Prof. Callendar, and evades the undesirable idea
of “ platinrim-temperatures.”
     The end I had in view in getting this formula was the
reduction to normal air-temperatures of the platinum-tempe
ratures in which the results were expressed, of the many and
important researches of Professors Dewar and Fleming in
their varied investigations at low temperature. In furtherance
of this end, Messrs. Petavel and Morris, who so ably assisted
them in these investigations, told me that the piece of
platinum-wire which forms the body of the platinum—thermo
meter employed by Professors Dewar and Fleming, and
referred to as “ P1,” is the identical piece of wire whose
Variations of electric resistance with temperature are given
on p. 282 of Phil. Mag. for Sept. 1893, vol. xxxvi.'|' The
experiments'on this wire there recorded range over nearl
300°, namely, from about —200° C. to about + 100° (J.                  The
normal air-temperatures observed are given down to the
freezing-point of water, while lower temperatures are merely
indicated,- Thus, one low temperature which I have employed
 is indicated as “ taken in solid carbonic acid and ether,” and
the other as “taken in liquid oxygen boiling at 760 millim.”
 I have assumed that the former of these temperatures has
most probably Regnault’s value, —-78°‘2 C. ; and there seems
to be a general convergence of opinion towards —182°'5 U. as
the value of the latter.
    With these data, and with the details immediately fol
lowing, the annexed table has been constructed, reducing
the “platinum-temperatures” expressed by means of Pro
fessors Dewar and Fleming’s platinum-thermometer “ P1” to
normal air-temperatures on the centigrade scale.

       LVI. The Thomson Infect in a Binary Electrolyte.

     HE coef<U+FB01>cient a' in the equation de=adt for an unequally
        heated homogeneous conductor may be calculated for an
aqueous solution by means of the theory of electrolytic con
vection developed by Nernst and Planck. Although the
expression for a" is a simple deduction from this theory, the
calculation has not yet been explicitly made, so far as I am
aware; and it may therefore be of some interest to examine
the matter somewhat more closely. For simplicity’s sake we
shall consider a binary electrolyte, the valency of each ion
being to.
    Let e = potential of the free electricity in the system,
         t = temperature (absolute),
        p = osmotic pressure due to positive plus negative ions,

         c = concentration expressed in gram-molecules of salt
                per litre,
         a = degree of electrolytic dissociation.
    The <U+FB02>ow of heat is supposed to be rectilinear, and e, .z',
and p are measured as increasing with t, i. e. from cold to
hot. We have p=2acRt, and the number of gram-ions in
volume element dv equal to 2wdv T. The osmotic force on
the ionized matter in volume element in the positive direction
of .r is — d—pdv. Thus the osmotic force per gram-ion in the

direction per positive gram-ion is —megg, where e is the
(ll-pantity of electricity associated with a monovalent gram-ion.

solution, and the conductor thus ceases to be homogeneous.
The result will be that the RD. between the ends of the
unequally heated conductor will gradually decrease, becoming
zero when diffusion-equilibrium is attained if the electrolyte

     LVII. Evidence that Rb'ntgen Rays are Ordinary Light.
        By G. JOHNSTONE STONEY, MA, D.Sc., F.R.S.*
IN “Nature ’ of the 28th of last April, p. 607, Lord Ray
       leigh calls attention to the fact that under Sir George
 Stokes’s theory of Rontgen rays—that which is known as
the hedge-<U+FB01>ring theory—we are justi<U+FB01>ed in expecting a large
proportion of ordinary light of short wave-length in the
radiation from the shield which receives and arrests the
“ kathode rays.” This he infers generally from the properties
of Fourier’s theorem, without entering into the details which
seem necessary; and I understand him accordingly to put
forward the conclusion as an opinion we are justi<U+FB01>ed in
strongly holding, though not actually proved. It may
therefore not be useless to publish a proof which the present
writer had worked out for his own satisfaction. An explicit
proof seems the more desirable inasmuch as Fourier’s
theorem, except where it can be applied throughout to the
actual conditions which exist in nature, furnishes only
kinematical'resolutions which may differ materially from
the actual physical resolutions effected by nature 1'.
   1* Communicated by the Author.
   't For example, all the resolutions effected by Fourier’s theorem in the
paper beginning on p. 281 of the Phil. Mag. for April 1897, are of this
illusory kind. The component motions furnished by that investigation
do not fulfil the necessary condition that each separately can be propa—
gated by the medium.

              that Rénlyen Rays are Ordinary Light.            533
      In analysing the motion of a vibrating string, the asso
  ciation of Fourier’s theorem with the dynamical conditions
  of the problem is easy; but it is not so simple a matter
  when we have to deal with events propagated through a
  medium in three dimensions.       “lhen, however, those events
  take the comparatively simple form of waves transmitted
 through a uniform medium, whether double refracting or
 isotropic, the analysis of the motion in the medium can be
 made to furnish components that consist throughout of physical
 events, each of which could occur separately under the ope
ration of the forces which exist in the medium.
      This essential condition can be secured by dividing the
 analysis into two parts, in the <U+FB01>rst of which an advancing
 spherical wave (such as is propagated from each centre of
 disturbance in a uniform isotropic medium) is resolved by
 the Principle of Reversal as used by MacCullagh, into the
 coexistence of plane wavelets propagated in all the directions
 towards which the spherital wave travels. In this <U+FB01>rst art
 of the inquiry, we are dealing exclusively with events which
 would spontaneously develop themselves in the medium under
 the conditions which are assumed in the course of the proof,
 and each of which could exist by itself in the medium. This
  preliminary analysis presents the motion of the medium in a
 form to which a further analysis by Fourier’s theorem may
 be applied without travelling outside actual physical events.
 We thus render the whole analysis physically legitimate—
 1'. e. such that it represents what really takes place in nature.
 By a Wavelet is to be understood not a wave which is short,
but one of in<U+FB01>nitesimal intensity.
     The steps of the proof are as follows :—
      Sir George Stokes’s explanation of Rongten rays amounts
 to this—That kathode rays consist of negatively charged
 missiles shot in showers, like hedge-<U+FB01>ring, from the negative
 electrode against the shield which receives and suddenly
 arrests them; and that the Biingten rays are due to the
 independent impulses propagated through the aether when the
advances of the negative charges are thus abruptly stopped
or altered.
     Each impulse is a spherical impulsive wave of some com
plex form propagated throu h the aether from one of the
points of impact. It starte on its journey at the instant
when the advance of one of the negatively charged missiles
was arrested.                                 -
     Each such spherical wave can, by MacUullagh’s method of
using the Principle of Reversal, be resolved into the coexist
ence of innumerable components consisting of plane impulsive
    Phil. Mag. 5. 5. Vol. 45. No. 277- June 1898.        2 O

534             Dr. G. Johnstone Stoney on Evidence
wavelets.      These wavelets are of unlimited extent laterally,
each is uniform throughout, and they propagate themselves
forward through the medium without undergoing change.
 One of them advances perpendicularly to itself in each of the
directions towards which the spherical wave advances (see
 Phil. Mag. for April 1897, p. 273).
    Use polar coordinates and consider some one direction 6gb.
 One of the plane impulsive wavelets is propagated in that
 direction from each of the impacts of the hedge-<U+FB01>ring on the
 shield ; and those which happen to travel from all the
 impacts in the direction 6¢, form an undulation of some
 kind travelling in that direction. It obviously consists of an
 irre ular succession of uniform plane impulsive wavelets.
    TIie whole of this irregular undulation travelling in any
 one direction may be represented by the equations
                              7 = FAT—tit)
                               7'; = FAT—176)}                        (I)
 where 71 and 72 are resolved parts of the transversal in two
 planes parallel to the radius-vector and at right angles to one
 another; where v is the velocity of light; and where the
 forms of the functions F1 and F, vary with the vector 0gb.
    Next let all the events of the Rongten experiment be
 regarded as repeated at de<U+FB01>nite equal intervals of time, say
.at intervals of a day—7'. e. of 86,400 seconds.
    The functions F1 and F2 are thereby rendered periodic
 functions ; the period being
                          T = 86,400 seconds.
 These functions then become resolvable by Fourier’s theorem
 into pendulous terms, of which the periods are T and integer
_submultiples of T.
    Equations (1) when thus expanded by Fourier’s theorem
 represent the plane wavelet component in the direction 19¢
 of the whole motion in the aether due to the radiation from the
 target, along with the same component of previous and sub
 seguent repetitions of this motion in the aether at intervals of
 a ay.
     Each term of the expansions represents physically a com
  plete undulation consisting of an unlimited train of exactly
  similar lane pendulous wavelets of some one wave-length,
  <U+FB01>lling the whole of space *, and advancing with the velocity v
  in the direction 0gb.
    * 1f it <U+FB01>ll the whole of space, what is represented by it includes, in
  addition to the actual radiation, that preceding condition of the nether
  which would have produced the radiation without external aid.

              that li’énlyun Rays are Ordinary Light.       535
    Accordingly the radiation from the target against which
the kathode rays impinge, along with repetitions of the
same at intervals of a day, may be resolved into the coexist
ence of component undulations, each <U+FB01>lling the whole ot‘
space, and each consisting of an unlimited train of uniform
plane pendnlous wavelets. The periodic times of these will
be T and its integer submultiples.
   Next form the series of ascending prime numbers, viz :—
                   2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, &c.,
and call the continued product of the <U+FB01>rst 11. of these
                                  M".
Then instead of repeating the Rongten events at intervals of
a day, let them be repeated at intervals of M,l days. Thereby
the period of the Fourier’s series becomes MnT ; and the
radiation of the Rongten experiment, repeated at these longer
intervals, is represented by the coexistence of series of pen
dnlous terms of which the periods are
                 MnT, and its integer submultiples.
    If n be changed into 11 +1, these series will include new
terms.
    The limit of this process, when n is increased without
 limit, is that the series can contain terms with periodic times
 of any period, whether commensurahle or incommensurable
with T.
    And that it then represents the Rongten event isolated—
i. e. without any repetition. It is obvious that one condition
 which must be ful<U+FB01>lled by a series of the nature of Fourier’s
series in order that it may be competent to represent an event
of limited duration without repetitions of the same, is that it
shall contain terms the periodic times of which are incommen
surable with one another.
    Hence, <U+FB01>nally, the impulses which are propagated through
 the tether, as the consequence of the kathode hedge-<U+FB01>ring
 however irregular, may be resolved into the coexistence of
 component undulations travelling in the various directions,
each of which is a train of perfectly similar plane wavelets,
 and of which there need be only one of each wave-length in
each direction.
     It follows from the known properties of Fourier’s expan
 sions that the more abrupt and irregular the hedge-<U+FB01>ring is,
 the more prominent a place will terms furnishing undulations
 of very short wave-length have in the <U+FB01>nal expansions.
    If we choose we can compound these undulations of short
                                 2O2

536                 lVotices respecting New Books.
wavelets, by working in the inverse direction through the
MacCullagh analysis ; and thus we learn that the more abrupt
and irregular the hedge-<U+FB01>ring, the more abundant will be the
proportion of rays of ordinary light consisting of spherical
waves of short wave-length in the radiation from the target.
     If, as appears almost certain, these are what we know
 under the name of Rongten rays, it follows that anything
 which increases the intensity, the abruptncss, and the irregu
 larity of the hedge-<U+FB01>ring will increase the abundance of the
 Rongten emanations.
     Moreover, inasmuch as a certain amount of abruptness and
 irregularity is present in the emission of light from every
 visible object or luminous source, it follows that Rongten
 rays—i. e. rays of very short wave—length—are present in all
 light throughout nature ; only the quantity present is usually
 inconspicuous.

 Lehrbuch der Algebra. Von HEINRICH WEBER. Zweite Au<U+FB01>age,
     Erster Band: pp. xvi+704. (Braunschweig, Vieweg & Sohn,
     1898)
 'l‘HIS is no hastily composed treatise. The Author t(lls us in
         his Preface (p. v) that he had cherished for some years the
 idea. of writing such a work, and the result is the comprehensive
  one before us. He has traversed the <U+FB01>eld described several times
  in his university lectures. That he has not failed in his attempt
  may be inferred from the fact that the <U+FB01>rst edition was published
  so recently as 1895, and then was limited to 654 pages. The book
  is clearly conceived in plan, and is very thorough in its execution.
  This <U+FB01>rst volume contains three books, which are prefaced by an
  excellent arithmetical introduction which discusses the theory of
  multiplicities, the theory of rational and irrational numbers, and
  further gives aproof of the continuity of real numerical magnitude.
  Here the author refers mainly to Dedekind ( ‘ Stetigkeit und
  irrationale Zahlen,’ and ‘ “(as sind und was sollen die Zahlen ’) and
  to G. Cantor.
      The <U+FB01>rst book, which is headed the Foundations, in six chapters,
  treats of Rational functions of one or more Variables, Determinants,
  the roots of Algebraical Equations, Symmetric functions, Invari
  ants and Covariants, and the Tschirnhausen transformation (the
   application of which to cubic, biquadratic, and quintic equations is
  shown in chapter iv., and in chapter vi. Hermite’s modi<U+FB01>cation
  is   introduced).    The second    book, which is    devoted  to   the
   Roots, is also broken up into six chapters, the <U+FB01>rst four of which
   deal with the reality of the roots of real equations, with their
   number in a given interval, with their superior and inferior limits,
  and with the       numerical   approximation method.     The   eighth

                     Notices respecting New Books.                    537
 chapter, on Sturm’s theorem, is specially interesting. Continued
 fractions and their applications to quadratic irrational numbers
 and to the Pellian equation are discussed in chapter eleven (with
 some departures, in notation, from Gauss and Dirichlet).          In the
 last chapter the elementary parts of the theory of the roots of
 unity, and also the subject of quadratic residues and the law of
 quadratic reciprocity are expounded.
     Alyebraz'cal quantities, the subject of Book iii., are also handled
 in six chapters. These last 200 pages constitute the prime port-ion
 ot' the banquet provided by our Author. The Galois’ Theory is
 discussed in chapters thirteen and fourteen, as to its fundamental
 notions, a more advanced treatment being presented in vol. ii.
 (of the <U+FB01>rst edition). The account is thoroughly interesting, and,
 we believe, original. Chapter <U+FB01>fteen is on Cyrlical Equations,
 chapter sixteen on Cyclotomy, and chapter seventeen contains
  several propositions connected with the Solution of Equations,
 carrying forward the Galois’ theory, and the last chapter treats
 of the roots of metacyclic equations of prime degrees. We have
 given but a bald account of what, possibly, is an epoch-making
 book. It only remains to say that the printers have done their
 work well, for the typography is all that one could wish.

 IN this treatise ProfeSsor Zehnder contributes another to the
already numerous theories of tether and matter. He assumes that
 space is in<U+FB01>nite and three-dimensional, and that it is <U+FB01>lled with
 extremely small material particles which exert a gravitational
 attraction on each other, but more with great velocities ; these
 particles constitute the mther, which therefore behaves as a gas
 and transmits vibrations exactly as, according to the kinetic theory,
 ordinary gases do. The density of this rather and consequently
 the mass of each particle are assumed to be exceedingly small.
 Electricity consists of a vibrational motion of the sether particles,
 positive charges corresponding to translational velocities greater
 than the mean velocity and negative charges to a defect of trans
 lational motion. Matter is composed of particles much larger
 than the tether atoms but of the same material ; these, by reason of
their greater mass, attract round themselves a shell of condensed
tether atoms which serves to communicate the motion arising from
the impact of the particles to the surrounding free zether.
    The author applies his theory to various physical phenomena in
a general non-mathematical fashion.         It is obvious, however, that
no ultimate theory of tether and matter can lay claim to serious
consideration which postulates an attractive force without a medium
for its action, and which assumes the existence of elastic spherical
atoms without explaining the nature of the elastic forces called into
play during their impact.                                     J. L. H.

Text-Book of Physical Chemistry. By CLARENCE L. SPEYERB,
   Associate Professor of Chemistry, Rutgers College. (New York,
   D. Van Nostrand Company; London, Spon, 1898.)
PHYSICAL chemistry is advancing so rapidly, and has become a
subject of such great importance, as to render an English text
book of its more elementary and fundamental principles very
desirable.   It is <U+FB01>tting that the work should have been undertaken
in America, since many researches on the subject, both theoretical
and experimental, are due to American chemists.            The author’s
task has, however, been by no means an easy one, because, <U+FB01>rstly,
it is dif<U+FB01>cult to decide what portions of the subject are suf<U+FB01>ciently
permanent to justify their inclusion in a text-book, and, secondly,
opinions may di<U+FB01>er as to the amount of space which should be
devoted to the exposition of physical principles, such as the
laws of thermodynamics or the elements of current electricity.
Prof. Speyers brie<U+FB02>y sketches the subject of thermodynamics,
apparently assuming that the student is already familiar with the
physical treatment of it, and he recapitulates the de<U+FB01>nitions of
electric units. The chapter on physical changes includes the dis
cussion of fusion, vaporization, solution, and osmotic pressure, and
 is followed by a chapter on the conditions of chemical equilibrium
 in the various systems, solid, liquid, gas, or mixtures of these.
 Chemical kinetics is represented by a brief sketch of the method
of determining the rate of decomposition of the substances con
 cerned in chemical reactions; then come chapters on phases and
 the eifects of variable temperature. The chemistry of ionized
 solutions necessitates a section devoted to electrolysis and properties
 of the ions, including a discussion of the energy derivable from the
 chemical action in any given voltaic cell.
    The book serves a useful purpose by presenting the facts of the
 subject in a collected and logical form ; it requires some revision,
 however, especially in the electrical portion. We <U+FB01>nd, for example,
 on p. 155, and again on the next page, the statement that a volt
 is 108 dynes, which might lead a student to suppose that electro
 motive force is a mechanical force. By an obvious slip on p. 159,
 the signs plus and minus are interchanged, making the cathode
 appear to be the positive electrode, and vice versd. The proposal
 of the author to use the term absorption of electricity for con
 ductivity is open to the objection that the former term is already
 used to indicate a well-de<U+FB01>ned and quite different electrical
 phenomenon.                                                 J. L. H.

Railway between Lincoln and Chester<U+FB01>eld.’       By C. Fox-Strangways,
Esq., F.G.S.
   The portion of the line considered in this paper occupies a distance
of about 40 miles, and runs nearly at right angles to the strike of
all the beds from the Lias t0 the Coal Measures.
   The lower part of the Lias and the Rhmtic beds are entirely
concealed; but grey marls overlying red marls occur about
 a mile east of Clifton Station, and at the station the Red Marl
of the Kcuper comes on in force. The alluvial deposits of the
Trent, pierced to a. depth of from 25 to 30 feet, consist principally
 of loam overlying varying thicknesses of sand and gravel. Horns
of red deer were found at a depth of 25 feet. At Dukeries Station
 white <U+FB02>aggy Keuper sandstones appear from beneath the Red
Marl, and probably represent the eastward extension of the
Tnxford Stone. A deep well here has been bored to a depth
of 644 feet from the present surface, and details of the section
are given in the paper. South of Kirton there is a deep cutting
in the Waterstones, and after leaving the escarpment the line
enters on the great dip-slope of the Bunter Pebble Beds, which
are shown at Ollerton and at intervals for 4 miles beyond this.
There are no sections in the Lower Red and Mottled Sandstones ;
and west of Warsop the line crosses the dip-slope of the Magnesian
Limestone. Details of the sections in this rock are given.
   Between Scarcli<U+FB01>' and Bolsovar the line crosses the Permian
escarpment in a tunnel, the whole of which is in the Coal Mea
sures; these are high up in the series, and contain no coal-seams
of value. They are not stained red.
   West of Arkwright’s Town Station is a very complete section of
beds representing the Middle Coal and Ironstone series (the most
valuable part of the Derbyshire Coal<U+FB01>eld), of which full details are
given, most of the important coal-seams being readily recognized;
and the author describes some remarkable features in the relation
ships of some of the sandstones to the other deposits.
   The absence of Glacial beds is of much interest; not a trace of
genuine Boulder Clay has been seen along the whole line.

   1. ‘ On some Gravels of the Bagshot District.’                 By Horace W.
Monelrton, Esq., F.L.S., F.G.S.
   The author refers to his papers on Gravels South of the Thames
published in the Quart. Journ. Geol. See. for 1892 (p. 29) and 1893
(p. 308), and gives some additional details.
   He suggests that the occurrence of stones which have been very
little rolled 0r waterworn in gravels at certain localities a<U+FB02>'ords
evidence of the presence of ice in the water by which those gravels
were deposited, and that the position of some sarsens which he
describes is due to the same agency.
   He gives details and exhibits photographs of a number of sarsens
which he has seen in situ.
   2. ‘ On the Occurrence of Chloritoid in Kincardineshire.’                By
George Barrow, Esq., F.G.S.
   The rock containing the chloritoid was <U+FB01>rst found in site at the
entrance to the little gully at the head of Friar Glen Burn, near
Drumtochty Castle. It has since been observed at many places
along a belt of country extending from the coast north of Stone
haven nearly as far as the North Esk.
   The rock is easily recognized by the presence of numerous white
spots, which are always present and are larger than the chloritoid.
The chloritoid and the spots vary in size, being largest when
the rock is most crystalline (a schist), and smallest when it is least
crystalline (a slate). The mineral appears as minute glistening
scales in the schist, but in the slate it can be recognized only with
the aid of the microscope.
    The optical characters are described, and shown to be identical
with those of the mineral from the Ile de Groix, and with those of
the ottrelite from Ottré and Serpent.
    An account of the methods adopted to obtain a pure sample is
 given. Several analyses were made, and it was proved that as the
 puri<U+FB01>cation increased the analyses approximated more and more
 closely to the analysis of the mineral from the Ile de Groix.

                   Glacial Geology of Spitsbergen.                 541
         February 20d.—Dr. Henry Hicks, F.1t.S., President,
                             in the Chair.
    The following communications were read :—
    1. “Contributions to the Glacial Geology of Spitsbergen.’ By
E. J. Garwood, Esq., M.A., F.G.S., and Dr. J. W. Gregory,
F.G.S.
    The extent of glaciation of Spitsbergen has been exaggerated,
for there is no immense ice-plateau, but normal glaciers with some
inland sheets and Piedmont glaciers. These differ from Alpine
glaciers, as they are not always formed from snow-<U+FB01>elds at the head,
and though some of the glaciers (as the Baldhcad Glacier) have
tapering snonts in front, most have vertical cliffs. Chamberlin’s
explanation that the latter are due to the low angle of the sun is
insufficient, and they seem to be caused by the advance of the
ice by a rapid forward movement of its upper layers. The ice of
these upper layers falls off and forms talus in front, over which the
glacier advances, carrying detritus uphill with it, and producing
a series of thrusts. The Booming Glacier illustrates cases of
erratics carried in different directions by the same mass of ice.
     The deposits of the Spitsbergen glaciers are of four types:—
(1) moraines of Swiss type ; (2) those formed mainly of intraglacial
material; (3) those formed of redeposited beach—material; (4) de
posits of glacial rivers, and re-assorted drifts. The materials of the
 second are subangnlar and rounded; scratched and polished pebbles
 and boulders are abundant, and the <U+FB01>ne-grained matrix, which is
 frequently argillaccous, is often well-laminated and false-bedded.
 Some of these drifts are strati<U+FB01>ed, others unstrati<U+FB01>ed, and contorted
 drifts occur. This type of moraine is remarkably like some British
 Boulder Clay. The third class is sometimes formed by land-ice, at
 other times beneath the sea ; the latter shows strati<U+FB01>cation.      The
 superglacial and intraglacial streams, so far as seen, were usually
 clear of drift. Under the fourth head an esker in a tributary of
 the Sassendal is described.
     The direct geological action of the marine ice is of four kinds :—
 transport of material, contortion of shore-deposits, formation of
 small ridges of boulder-terraces above sea-level, and striatioa,
 rounding, and furrowing of rocks along the sea-shore.
     Traces of former glaciation are described in the case of the
 Hecla Hook beds, and of certain beds of late Mesozoic or early
 Cainozoic age in Bunting Bluff.
     Under the head of general conclusions the authors state that
 they have discovered no certain test to distinguish between the
 action of land-ice and marine ice; that there is no evidence to
 prove that land-ice can advance far across the sea; and that
 there is evidence, which they regard as conclusive, of the uplift of
 materials by land-ice. They note that the mechanical processes
  connected with the advance of the glaciers are of three kinds.     All
  the material seen transported by the glaciers was superglacial or
  intraglacial, and not subglacial. Some striation of intraglacial
 material is caused by differential movement of different layers of ice.

  542                       Geological Society.
  The advance and retreat of the Spitsbergen glaciers is very-irregular,
  and apparently due to local changes. The observations of the
  authors support the vieWs of those who ascribe a limited erosive
  power to glaciers. Lastly, the theory that glacial periods occurred
  as a consequence of epeirogenio uplifts receives no support from
  Spitsbergen.
     2. ‘ On a Quartz-rock in the Carboniferous Limestone of Derby—
  shire.’ By H. H. Arnold-Bemrose, Esq., M.A., F.G.S.
     The paper describes the occurrence in the <U+FB01>eld and the micro
  scopic structure of a rock consisting essentially of quartz, which is
  found in the Mountain Limestone in several localities. It occurs
 in irregularly-shaped bosses and veins, and shoWs no signs of
 strati<U+FB01>cation.
     Its close association with a quartzose limestone, which in turn
  passes into an ordinary limestone with few if any quartz-crystals,
  leads to the inference that it is a silici<U+FB01>ed limestone.
     The microscopical structure of a number of thin slices of these
 rocks is described. The quartz-rock is seen to be made up of
 quartz-grains which generally interlock closely, but sometimes
 possess a crystalline outline and contain zones of calcite. Fluor
 is occasionally present.
     The quartzose limestone is usually a foraminifcral limestone
 containing a large percentage of quartz, which occurs as separate
 crystals and as aggregates of crystals. The latter and the small
 quartz-veins have a structure similar to that of the quartz-rock.
 The former often contain zones of calcite and penetrate organisms.
The residue consists of quartz-crystals.
    The author considers that the quartz-rock is not a gritty lime
 stone, altered by the growth of crystalline quartz around the detrital
grains, but that it is a limestone replaced by quartz. The gradual
passage from the quartz-rock through a quartzosc limestone to an
ordinary limestone, the presence of chert, of part of a foraminifer,
and of pieces of quartzose limestone in it, support the Opinion that
it is an altered limestone.

    1. ‘ On some Submerged Rock-Valleys in South \Vales, Devon,
and Cornwall.’ By T. Codrington, Esq., M.Inst.C.E., F.G.S.
    The author describes various valleys in which the solid rock
is reached at a considerable depth below sea-level, 0n the sides of
Milford Haven and in the Haven itself; beneath the Tivy, Tawe,
and Neath, the Wye, the Severn, the Bristol Avon, the Dart, the
Laira, the Tavy, the Tamar, and other rivers. In the case of the Dart
the rock-bottom has been found at one place at a depth of 110 feet
below low-water level, and in the case of other rivers at varying
depths less than this. The deposits show that some of the in<U+FB01>lling
took place after the period of submerged forests, and much before

               Intelligence and llliscellaneous Articles.           543
this, for frequent cases of glacial deposits <U+FB01>lling the bottoms of
these submerged valleys are recorded.
    The fact that in the Solent and Thames the Glacial deposits
border the sides of the valleys, and do not occur at the bottom as
in the case of the valleys described in the paper, indicates that the
latter are older than the former, though they present features
similar to those of some of the valleys of the North-east and North—
west of England.
    2. ‘Some New Carboniferous Plants, and how they contributed
to the Formation of Coal-Scams.’ By W. S. Greeley, Esq., 1111.8.
    The author, in a paper published in abstract in the Society’s
Quarterly Journal for May 1897 (vol. liii. p. 2245), argued that certain
brilliant black lamina) in coal, and similar materials found among
 some mechanical sediments of the Coal Measures, pointed to the
former existence of an aquatic plant. In the present communication
 he describes structures in the pitch-coal lamina: of bituminous coal
 and in the glossy black layers of anthracite which he believes to
 he indications of two other kinds of plants, and states that he
 has examined structures which may be due to some other kinds of
 vegetation.

                         LIQUID HYDROGEN.
 AT the Meeting of the Royal Society yesterday afternoon
        Professor Dewar contributed a preliminary note on the
 liquefaction of hydrogen and helium.
     Professor Dewar said that in 1895 he described apparatus for
 the production of a jet of hydrogen containing liquid, and showed
 how such a jet could be used to cool bodies below the temperature
 that could be reached with liquid air, though all attempts to collect
 the liquid hydrogen failed. So far no investigator had improved on
 the results described in 1895; and as the type of apparatus em
 ployed in those experiments worked well, it was resolved to con
 struct a much larger liquid-air plant, and to combine with it
 circuits and arrangements for the liquefaction of hydrogen. The
 apparatus took a year to build up, and many months were occupied
  in testing and in making preliminary trials. The many failures
  and defeats need not be detailed. On May 10 an experiment was
  started with hydrogen cooled to —205° C., and escaping conti
  nuously under a pressure of 180 atmospheres from the nozzle of
  a coil of pipe at the rate of 10 to 15 cubic feet a minute, in a
  vacuum vessel doubly silvered, and of special construction, sur
  rounded with a space kept below —-200° (3. With these arrange
  ments liquid hydrogen began to drop from this vacuum vessel into
  another, doubly isolated by being enclosed within a third, and in
  <U+FB01>ve minutes 20 cub. centim. of liquid were collected. The hydrogen
  jet then froze up from the solidi<U+FB01>cation of air in the pipes of the
  apparatus. The yield of liquid was about 1 per cent. of the gas.
  In the liquid condition the hydrogen was clear and colourless,

 showing no absorption-spectrum, and the meniscus was as well
 de<U+FB01>ned as in the case of liquid air. The liquid must have a rela
 tively high refractive index and dispersion, and the density must
 be in excess of the theoretical values, viz. 0'18 to 0'12, deduced
 respectively from the atomic volume of organic compounds and
 the limiting density found by Amagat for hydrogen gas under
 in<U+FB01>nite compression. Professor Dewar’s old experiments on the
 density of hydrogen in palladium gave a value for the combined
 body of 0'62 ; and it would be interesting to <U+FB01>nd the real density
 of the liquid substance at its boiling-point. N0 arrangements
 being at hand to determine the boiling-point, two experiments
 were made to prove the excessively low temperature of the boiling
 <U+FB02>uid. In the <U+FB01>rst place, when a long piece of glass tubing, sealed
 at one end and open to the air at the other, was cooled by im
 mersing the closed end in the liquid hydrogen, the tube immediately
 <U+FB01>lled, where it was cooled, with solid air. The second experiment
 was with a tube containing helium.            The Cracow Academy
 ‘ Bulletin ’ for 1896 contained a paper by Professor Olzewski
 entitled “ Research on the Liquefaction of Helium,” in which he
 stated that, as far as his experiments went, helium remained a
 permanent gas, and apparently was much more di<U+FB01>icult to liquet'y
than hydrogen. Professor Dewar, however, suggested that hydrogen
and helium would probably be found to have about the same vola—
tility, as was the case with oxygen and <U+FB02>uorine. Having a specimen
of puri<U+FB01>ed helium, extracted from Bath gas, sealed up in a bulb
with a narrow tube attached, he placed the latter in the liquid
hydrogen, whereupon a distinct liquid was seen to condense. From
this result it would appear that there could not be any great di<U+FB02>'er
ence in the boiling-points of hydrogen and helium. In conclusion,
Professor Dewar pointed out that all known gases had now been
condensed into liquids which could be manipulated at their boiling
points under atmospheric pressure in suitably arranged vacuum
vessels, though even so great a man as Clerk-Maxwell had doubts as
to the possibility of ever liquetying hydrogen. With liquid hydrogen
as the cooling agent, a temperature could be reached within 20" or
30° of the zero of absolute temperature; and its use would open
up an entirely new <U+FB01>eld of scienti<U+FB01>c inquiry. No one could pre
dict the properties of matter near that zero. Faraday lique<U+FB01>ed
chlorine in the year 1823. Sixty years afterwards Wroblewski
and Olzewski produced liquid air, and now, after an interval of
<U+FB01>fteen years, the remaining gases—hydrogen and helium—were
obtained as static liquids. Considering the step from the lique
faction of air to that of hydrogen was relatively as great in a
thermodynamic sense as that from liquid chlorine to liquid air, the
fact that the former had been achieved in one-fourth the time
needed to accomplish the latter proved the greatly accelerated rate
of scienti<U+FB01>c progress in the present age. The paper ended with
an acknowledgment of the aid rendered by Mr. Robert Lennox,
without whose engineering skill, manipulative ability, and loyal
perseverance the present successful issue might have been inde<U+FB01>
nitely delayed—The Times, May 13th, 1898.

                    WILLIAM F. DENNING, ERAS.
   “ Mr. Denning gives an interesting historical account of the recorded periodic
returns of the November meteors, discusses the connexion between meteors and
comets, and concludes with a consideration of the points to which observers
should specially direct their attention. He writes in a clear and simple style,
which should be intelligible even to those with a limited knowledge of astro~
nomy.”—- The Times.
   “Upon the subject of meteor-observation, Mr. Denning teaches ‘as one
havin authority, and not as the scribes.’ ' " ‘ “ Every astronomical observer
shoul      possessacopy of the pamphlet, for the perusal of it will show him
exactly what points require attention, and will thus.increase the value of his
observations.”—Nature.
