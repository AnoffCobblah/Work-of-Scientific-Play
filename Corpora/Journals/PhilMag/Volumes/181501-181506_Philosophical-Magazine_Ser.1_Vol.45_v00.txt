   I. On   the Nourishment produced to the   Plant   by its Leaves.
                      By Mrs. Agnes Ibisetson.
                           To Mr. Tilbch.
Sia, —   I shajx   now continue the account begun in my last let
ter, tending to prove the different manner which nature pursues
in distributing the nourishment the vegetable world requires in
four different ways; viz. by a common root, by the agency of a
bulb, by the cuticle of leaves, and by a sort of pump inserted
into another plant. I have shown in evergreens, in fire, and in
water plants, that no nourishment whatever is by them taken
in by any other vehicle than the root, though some points and
hairs may assist them in receiving those various juices that pro
duce the Bark mixture, and supply the oil to humectate and lu
bricate the spiral wire.
    In trees, shrubs, herbaceous, annuals, and all those of the kind
which prove luxuriant plants, i have given examples of those
fed by the root and atmosphere ; where the size of the plant,
the quantity of their leaves, and the consequent evaporation
and exhaustion are such, that they must require all the nutriment
that can be bestowed by both. Here the root not only does its
office thoroughly, but the leaves also, expanded and stimulated
by light, are constantly receiving nourishment from the bounteous
dews, as well as a variety of liquids and gases from the hairs and
Tetorts: yet so admirably is the exterior managed to guard them
from the too copious evaporation, that every single leaf is co
vered by many skins, two or three of which being impervious
to water, allow air alone to exude.        Thus all that passes out
 from the leaves is converted into oxygen for the benefit of man
 and animals, and only assumes its watery form when it escapes
confinement.       This circumstance alone might prove to those
    Vol. 45. No. 201. Jan. 1815.           A 2                  who

who cannot or will not take the trouble to make use of their
eyes, that all vegetables must be covered with an impervious
skin ; since without this no such quantity of oxygen gas could
be retained within the cuticle ; and without this protection most
 leaves would evaporate all their moisture in one single hot day.
 In the grassy leaves of early spring flowers, I gave an example
 of those leaves which are wholly supported and fed by their in
 terior matter laid up for them in their bulbous roots, and re
 quiring from the time of being taken out of the ground neither
 earth, water, or rain, (at least very little of the latter,) till after
 flowering they are replaced in the earth to receive and form the
 seeds and flowers of the next year; as bulbs will not continue
bearing or forming, seed or flower except they are replaced in
 the earth to renew the seeds; while the rock plants, wholly dif
 ferent, are fed by the cuticles of their leaves alone, and deprived,
of most of the impervious ones which in all other plants shut out
 moisture ; these receive rain and dew from a variety of pores
with which the excrescences on their leaves are filled, and which
form nourishment enough even to sustain very large plants.
    Having now given a sketch of the preceding letter, I shall turn
to the subject of the present; which will describe the manner in
which sand plants are fed ; also how the parasite tribe receive
their nourishment; nor shall I leave out those leaves which flower
in the leaf, as most admirably drawing the line between those
parts requisite to form the flower, or those adapted to the leaf
only.     I shall then give the description of the cuticle of wet
plants, and fmish by detailing the changes operated on plants
from soil and situation, moisture and dryness, with a few other
matters appertaining to the subject. ,
    The real sand plant very frequently possesses a black, dry, and
shrivelled root, which sends up but little nourishment except at
its first shooting : when it is an annual, it is often discovered
with its root half decayed, as if having conveyed the seeds to
this their proper destination, at the summit of the plant : the
root was no longer wanted, hit to yield that trifling degree of
sap required to support the stem; all its other juices'and nourish
ment proceeding from the cuticle of the leaf.
 '
    The leaves of sand plants have three cuticles above and two
below; two of each being impervious to water or any liquid.
The pabulum, scarcely thicker than the bark juices, is filled with
a glutinous matter, which however hardens as the age of the
leaves increases. But of all the vegetable tribe no plants possess
so many hairs as the sand plants : sometimes they are laid hori
zontally in layers both above and below the leaves, as at Plate 1,
fig. 1 . the chenopodium olidum ; sometimes standing perpen
dicularly as in the turnip leaf, fig. 2, but in that case it has al
                                                                  ways

                       (
      On the Nourishment produced to the    Plant ly its Leaves.     5
  ways a shining cuticle above the impervious one, into which
  points or pockets are so contrived as to receive the moisture
from the atmosphere : see fig. 8, 4. It is a shining net very fre
 quently taken for perspiration, indeed it is continually filling with
 water, but instead of giving it out it is taking it in. The
 quantity of water or different liquids received by means of the
 cuticles of this species of sand plant is excessive ; but they not
 only draw nourishment from the hairs and the cuticle, but the
 side of each leaf is a reservoir for accumulating nutriment round
 the plant: see fig. 5, 6. In the turnip they are a sort of retort,
 filling and emptying into the vegetable every three or four hours;
 fig. 6, full; empty 7. I often find them all empty, on generally
 one side of the leaf at a time ; and these when thus situated
 plainly show how the hairs are formed: see fig. 8, 9.            The
 glazed matter with which they are made, appears to me ex
 actly to resemble the impervious skin (so often mentioned) at
 the exteriw of each face of the leaf.     The texture is the same,
 and it is also exactly like the shining skin which forms the cuti
 cle of the sand plant I have just described ; which, whether full
 or empty, makes so shining and brilliant an appearance in the
 microscope, that without taking it off it cannot be ascertained
 whether it is full or not of moisture ; but the hairs, as soon as
 they empty themselves into the plant, grow as flat as their valves
 will let them. When vacant, they often draw up like a cork
 screw, if they have many valves ; but if only two, one at each
 end, they hang like a wet rag till refilled.     I have found this
 species of gauze both striped and spotted, and in some plants it
 b so thick as wholly to disguise the colour of the liquid it con
 tains. But wherever seen, and in whatever plant found, it is the
 same matter, with trifling variations, always impervious to water,
 and, though so very slight, capable of bearing even detonation —
 which I have often seen two liquids, on meeting, produce in the
 retort while under my eye.       These innumerable hairs are the
 principal marks of a sand plant.
     To give a perfect idea of the means used in nourishing a pa
 rasite plant, I need only describe the method by which innume
 rable loads of small muscles fasten themselves so forcibly on the
 rocks upon our coast.      The muscle has a broad round part,
 hollow in the middle ; the shell is laid on the rock with a ge
 latinous matter which fills up all the interstices of its scollop
 except the middle cavity, which is full of air: this the fish either
 exhausts or draws inward for its own use and support, thus
 leaving a vacuum, which fastens down the shell more powerfully
 than any glutinous liquid could do. In the same manner is the
 pump of the parasite plant composed; it has a Iroad piece which
 is held down by means of a vacuum, managed on the nurse plant :
                               A3                                  but

6    On the Nourishment    produced to the   Plant ly its Leaves.
but besides this it has a hollow pointed vessel or instrument which
only fills up the very centre of the middle, the rest between
the centre and broad piece rernaining a perfect vacuum.            This
point runs deep into the supporting plant, drawing from it a per
petual stream ; and thus possessing itself of all the nutriment re
quired, while the vacuum surrounding it is perpetually main
tained by the superior force of the larger vegetable.        I have ex
amined the pointed part inserted into the mother plant (see
fig. 9) at different degrees of depth ; and in the dodder tribe it is
so very clear that its insertion is most easily to be perceived, though
entering far into the plant, especially if the furze is young and
tender. This description will, I fear, appear rather obscure ; but
 the drawings, see fig. 8, 9 and 10, Will I hope elucidate it.
    There are a great variety among the parasite plants : some, like
                    '
 the ivy, are half Jed by the root, half by the nurse plant to which
they cling. Some, like the orolanche, fix their root on I he nurse
plant that is to feed it. But though it seems to draw all its
nourishment from the plant to which it adheres : yet much of
its support is gained from the earth, on which its large and
spreading roots repose : it has many fixed appendages growing
from the root, which appear to me to play the office of a sponge,
and suck up much moisture, which it undoubtedly yields to the
plant, since all the vessels of communication with the real root
appear. But there is a peculiar circumstance belonging to this
plant which should not be overlooked : it possesses such a
quantity of tannin, that my hands were absolutely dyed for a
long time after dissecting it.       I am well assured that the quan
tity of tannin is not always proved by the excess or depth of the
colouring matter, and that there may be much of the latter,
with little of the former, as in the alder : but I believe when it
is fixed and difficult to eradicate, and that it has a glazed ap
pearance, the quantity, of tannin always predominates.              The
orobanches (especially in a sandy soil) grow in such quantities,
and their roots are so large, that to collect them might be
no bad speculation, since there is often a pound of root to each
small plant.
    The dodder tribe presents another variation of the parasite.
It soon loses its root, and depends on the joint aid of the nurse
plant and atmosphere ; its pump is nearly the same as that in
the ivy, but it is only a small piece of the stem that draws mois
ture from the atmosphere.          The flower itself, however, never
closes after it has once opened, and constantly exposes its most
curious pointed nectary    (it   should seem) for this purpose, since
it   isalways   loaded   with   diminutive   specks of water on the
projecting points.     Thus   there are various meaus of nourishment
made use of   by   nature in this species of plants
                                                  :    some gain from
                                                                    the
      i

  the root and nurse plafit, some from the atmosphere and nurse
 plant.      There are however others, that, not satisfied with draw
 ing from the exterior or bark of the tree, dive deep Into                it,and*
 running large vessel from one pump to another, lay asort of claim
          a
 on the wood, that must be highly prejudicial to their nurse. Of
 this kind is. the viscum, and many West India climbers                   ;•which,
 will often bind the wood as cruelly within, as the ivy does at the
 exterior of the plant.         There  is   besides  a   peculiarity belonging
 to most parasite plants that deserves notice; they will often'
 show,    by   some change of form, how much support they gain or
 lose from their nurse.         Thus the ivy alters its leaves the moment
 the pumps are no longer suspended on the side of the tree, be
 cause then the greatest quantity of food comes from the root,
 and the juices of that part are no longer balanced             by  those which
it   received from its pumps.          The orobanche draws much from
 the atmosphere the last few weeks of its existence              :    the taller,
 therefore,    it grows, the more unlike itself       it  often becomes       and
                                                                               ;
I   found three last year, whose upper leaves were almost her
 baceous, and had lost all that stringy woven appearance the
 orobanches are so famous for.            But the most curious alteration
I   ever experienced in a parasite plant was that produced in an
 ophrys nidus avis, which had fixed its principal roots on the roots
 of a birch, and was covered some inches above the ground with
 dead leaves, to which its quantity of small sponges adhered.                      It
 exceeds the orobanckes in these appendages, but they are always
 above the ground, instead of under         ;   but they were not as in that
 plant loose,      one   side  adhered   to  birch   and one to oak leaves,
 and each side of the plant          not  only differed in colour, but the
 scaly sheath was of different texture.
                        a                        I     was never so happy as
 to find the plant but once, and         I     hope next year to be more
fortunate.
     All the pumps of the parasite plants proceed from and are
formed in the wood only, and may be traced directly to               it5   there
fore   the  juices   are  evidently  drawn   in  to supply   the place    of sap   :
another convincing proof that the sap runs only in the wood-
But when its pumps proceed as far as the wood to acquire its
juices from the nurse plant, then indeed                 it  does very great
damage, and this            always the case in the viscums            then soon
                      is                                      ;
                                                              it
spreads    the   rot   through   the  body    of  its  supporter.      As to the
formation of the leaves of the parasite plant, this generally de
pends on the circumstance, whether the leaves do or do not re
ceive moisture from the atmosphere.             If    they do not, as in the
ivy, their leaves are then formed like the evergreen           ;  if    they do,
they are formed like the sheaths of the orobanche.
 I     must now mention       a    species of plants which     I     did not at
                                  A 4                                        first

first consider, but which, from the extraordinary difference of thfr
formation of .their leaves, well deserves a place here.             I hare
long     before shown,    that plants flowering   in the leaf  teach  more
 than any     other vegetable    I am  acquainted with,    as  drawing an
 exact division between those ingredients wanted to Jorrn the-
flower, and those merely required for the leaf only. It was
 the thorough study of these plants that first taught me the com
 plete distinction between them, which has been of more use to
 me than almost any dissection          Icould name, as drawing a very
 exact and precise line never infringed by nature, and enabling
  me to avoid that confusion perpetually to be observed in many
  authors in describing the flower and the leaf.           The leaf alone,
  as I have shown before, is formed of much bark ; a very trifling
  degree of wood ; a pabulum composed of the bark juices ; qxian-
  tities of spiral wire; and much of that impervious skin often de
  scribed, and which prevents the leafs loo great evaporation :
  but when the flower is to be placed within                it,
                                                          then the line    of
  life    is added,      great deal
                              a       more   wood, and the pabulum de
  creased      and in its place the flowers and seeds fill up the in
                  ;
  terior see fig. 12. This sort of leaf
              :                              isalways stiffer and harder,
  as having such           quantity of wood to convey the sap to the
                              a
  flower; and          proves this to be its purpose,
                       it                                    the manner in
                                                                  by
   which the sap vessels lie.       In the xylopkylla (which flowers in
  the contour        the leaf) all the sap vessels run from the midrib
                       of
   to the edge,     with    an open mouth at the bud.         In the ruscus
   (which flowers     in  the middle of the leaf) the sap vessels, after
   running in the shape of a heart, arrange themselves in the centre            ,
   and stop at the middle point, while in the fern (where the leaf
   flowers in the direction of the spires) the sap passes on to the
   line of the flower, and there stops. This description may ap
    pear trifling; but a minute knowledge of the formation of every
    part of the vegetable, clear and without confusion, can alone
    enable us to profit by every accidental fact nature presents us
    with, and to which perpetual watching makes me                   witness.
                                                                       a
I      have seen so much confusion arise from endeavouring to ac
    count for facts without this acquirement, that          shall never but
                                                                  I

    ever think       can be too minutely exact, or too perfect, since
I      am convinced that that knowledge can alone serve as a foun
    dation for the more useful studies of gardening and agriculture.
    It    the first step of the ladder.
         is                                 I cannot leave this species of
    plant without mentioning how completely they prove that sub
    ject have so much at heart, that

the midrib of the leaf, in a manner too plain to be denied: before
the flower has at all appeared at the exterior of the leaf, it may
be seen under the skin in knots, and down the midrib of each
leaf; and    if that   is divided, they may be taken, and, if placed in
the microscope, show the seeds           and baskets.  It is still more
evident in the xylophylla.
   I now turn to the cuticle of water plants. I showed in a for
mer letter, that there are two sorts of water plants, those which
lie on the surface, and those which rest below it : sometimes
they are joined in the same plant, as in the water lilies.   It is
the latter sort which rise each day to the top of the water to
fill themselves with air, nor could they carry on their interior
mechanism       but for this resource.      The water ranunculus and
many of the potamogeto?i9,      if watched, will be seen, though often
loaded and twined together into a real weight, to rise by de
 grees with a sort of undulatory motion, till the whole has ap
 peared for a few seconds above the surface of the water. I have
taken them in the very act of rising-, and found them almost void
 of air : but when, after giving them a little time, I have allowed
 the part to rise, and sink again, and then taken them quickly
from the water, I have always found them loaded with air,
 one large bubble being constantly attached to each bud, and
 absolutely necessary to its existence ; for, if taken away by pres
 sure, the bud directly decays.      I have long been convinced that
 air is as indispensable to vegetable as to animal life. All the trials
 that have been made to oblige plants to grow in an exhausted
 receiver prove this, but do not try the experiment half so well
 as pressing those bubbles of air out of water plants, because the
 vacuum is not to be maintained perfect enough or sufficiently
 long for a plant to shoot.      But in order to be assured whether
 the buds could live under water if each was robbed of its bubble
 of air, I took some ranunculus aquaticus to grow in a deep tub;
 then seized a piece about an inch or two ; and after pressing
  away the bubble, I tied it at each end, so that the air could not
 return ; but the bubble would not leave the bud without breaking
  the skin which contained the air, so completely was it linked to
 that which it was to support.         I replaced the piece directly in
 water,   but  the buds  were  dead   and  the line of life black in less
  than an hour.     It is inconceivable how soon a fresh -water plant
 dies, if taken from its element ; quite as quickly as a fish, and
  decays much sooner, for it grows putrid almost directly.           May
 it not be the same thing that kills      it, which kills the fish ?  viz.
  the want of inward air to sustain the excessive weight of the
  outward atmosphere.        There  is undoubtedly a very strong simi
  litude in their interior formation.        But what brings on that
  immediate decomposition      ?    There  is  certainlya    very curious

40 On the Nourishment        produced to theVlanl    by its   Leaves,
fact respecting the putridity of one part of        a vegetable, well
 worth the attention of a good chemist. When       a plant is gathered
 or cut down, the line of life rarely lives a few hours, but the
 gatherer of the leaf grows black sooner, and even precedes it in
 decomposition. Behold that of the French bean, or phaseolus vul
garis ; the acacia; plane tree: indeed any leaf whose gatherer
is large enough to show it well, and it will be found to begin its
decomposition almost within the hour.           I used to fancy it was
the quantity of oil taken in by the hairs to lubricate the spiral
wire ; but it has so much resemblance to the general decay of
the water plant, that I think 1 must be mistaken; a fresh-water
plant soon decays in salt water, and a sea-weed soon decom
poses in fresh water.      We know that a fish carries down a large
bladder of air to support      it,and so does the fresh-water plant         ;
but there must be some very curious reason for its decomposing
so quickly.    I    have read (but   I   cannot recollect my author)
that the fresh-water plants at the side of the rivers in Africa lie
down like the sea-weed, and recover again when the rainy sea
son restores the waters  :   I think it  must bea     mistake, for then
they must be wholly free from all interior vessels, as are the salt
                  '
water plants.
 I    shall now endeavour to show the curious changes produced
on   the cuticle of leaves,    by the excess of humidity or dryness.
When   a   semi-water plant loses the rill or ditch that sustained its
moisture,  I   have before shown that its air-vessels         bydegrees
contract till they scarce deserve the name, gaining also addi
tional quantities of hairs on their leaves, to make them some
little amends for the moisture their root used to dispense. Thus
they continue to grow like land plants, as long as the ditch re
mains dry that used to feed them.
    Viewing quantity of circcea hisilanica,
            a                                  I    observed that those
which grew in or near the stream had (as usual) their stems and
leaves full of air vessels, and that they were almost wholly free
from hairs ;    but on examining some higher up the bank, they
were   not  only entirely free from air-vessels but had also quanti
ties of hairs to supply them with water, and at the summit of the
bank their upper cuticle was crippled with points. Now this                 is
a sort of succedaneum          have so frequently discovered, when
                         I I                 the common resource of
dissecting plants, that       believeit   is
nature either in very dry or very wet weather.         I    have often
on these    occasions  (when wet weather has long prevailed) taken
up roots, and found them (especially in herbaceous plants) partly
covered at the exterior, with    a  thin layer of air vessels, as    toif
protect them from the too great humidity of the ground             ;and
when, on the contrary, nature has been oppressed with          a super
abundance of dry weather,    I   have found the roots equally covered
                                                                       with

pedient.
    Thus far Nature assists ; but I have in vain sought for some
cure, some indication of change, to remedy to a plant the altera
tion of soil.    I cannot find that she adopts any plan to enable
a sand plant to endure a clay, or a chalk plant to support a
sandy soil.    These are therefore far more fatal transformations
to vegetable life, than any humidity or dryness can produce.
I have repeatedly traced disorders (which appeared to me to
arise entirely from that source) that afterwards tainted the very
means of life in a plant.     But how bountiful has Nature been
to us in this respect ! leaving however to cur own industry the
care of culling each different species, and adapting it to the
right soil. There is scarcely a plant necessary to the food of
man or beast, that has not so great a variety in its species, as to
enable the industrious groiuer to choose that which best suits his
own ground.       Com of every kind, vetches, clovers, grasses, have
all their different sorts properly fitting the soil from which they
first came, and in which they originally and spontaneously grew.
Thus there is a clay clover, and a sand clover, a chalk clover,
one suited to a poor land, and one that grows well in rich land
only ; one that will not support moisture, and one that growsi
only in wet land ; one that prefers hills, and one that can only
do well in valleys; one that likes the sun, and one that avoids
it. Nature has been equally bountiful in most other plants pe
culiarly adapted to agriculture ; and in wheats also, of the many
I have tried in different soils, I have found them remarkably
well answering this plan, and regularly attaching themselves to
that sort of ground from which each came, and especially lie-
longed : and, in wheats it is of the utmost consequence to dis
cover those which suit the soil, and, having found two or three,
change only from one to the other when the alteration of seed
becomes necessary.     Custom is of astonishing use in plants; and
though the ground, for an excellent reason, should not continue
too long receiving one plant, yet it always grows better for be
ing accustomed to the soil.      What is meant by growing sick of
the ground, is, that it exhausts after a time that peculiar juice
which is necessary to the plant ; but give it a season or two
cessation, and it will always grow better for being used to its
situation.
    I have been showing how much plants, especially leaves, gain
by the atmosphere.       Let me now revert to the use it is of to
the ground itself, which it may truly be said to manure, and, be
ing done by nature, has a much greater effect than any dressing
we can bestow on it.     Much has been said lately against the ex
travagance   and  bad husbandry of fallows: surely this is not just.

12    On       the Nourishment   produced to the     Plant   hy   its Leaves.
The ground must be manured by some means. No earth has as
much salt and oil as is required for a proper cultivation ; this
must be added. — It is hardly possible to conceive the gain of a
winter fallow, if the ground is well opened to receive it ; but
then it must be free from weeds, that they may not rob the soil
of that benefit it would otherwise receive ; and it should be
turned over frequently, that the salt and juices by lying too long
above may not evaporate.     Poor earths require even more than
rich ones ; as wanting it more, it has a greater effect.
   Dr. Dickson, in his most excellent book on Agriculture, ad
vances a proposition which I must (though with all humility) dis
sent from.   He says, " the red clover affords a large produce of
leaf and blossom, on which account the land is kept in a more
perfect state of closeness and shade."         This I do not deny ; but
I do the inference drawn from            when he adds, "
                                               it,            has there
                                                                   it
fore much more influence in ameliorating and improving the
soil, and affords better preparation for wheat crops." What
                       a
is    ameliorates the soil? the being shaded from the atmosphere?
     it
This     so exactly the contrary, that that very circumstance makes
          is
it a more exhausting crop        :shading from the atmosphere would
                                     if
be sufficient to better the ground, then         fallow must impoverish
                                                     a
it. The earth, the water, and the atmosphere bestow on each
alternately nearly the same juices, but the atmosphere               the  is
richest  source   of gain.  If. we  cover   the earth   with   vegetable
                                                                    a
which receives all these bounteous dews, the plants alone profit
by it, and the soil possesses not itself of any part.              thinkI
the idea must have arisen from some sand plant, such as the
turnip and the farmer finding that the ground was always bet
          ;
ter, rather than worse, for the crop [though heavy), and not
knowing the difference that exists in the quantum of nourish
ment some plants receive from their leaves, concluded that every
plant that equally shaded the ground must have the same effect.
Now       it   sand plant alone that can do this, taking, so little
               is
               a
from the root, and of course from the soil.           If has very large

                                          is
the leaves, and the bark juices, that, running down into the stem,
it enters the root, and probably dispenses to the earth that super
abundance of nutriment          could not contain within. But this
                                 it
is far from being the case in other vegetables; for all herbaceous
plants, (which take more than two-thirds of their support from
the root,)       they have large leaves, exhaust
                  if                                    ground greatly.

cannot be a better preparation for wheat than turnips.             But          I
turn again to a fallow, or receiving that from the atmosphere

    On the Nourishment              produced to the         Plant      by its Leaves.     IS
into the ground, the cuticle of the sand plants would take ; nor
is it the least important gain in a fallow, that much less dung
is necessary, since nature herself manures the soil. Calley is
 of opinion that dunging naked fallows is better dispensed with,
and has often in tolerable loams made the crop to fail.  This is
almost the only instance        I have been able to collect where too
much manure has                 deemed a defect.
                             been                          Sinclair gives also
 an example where potatoes were placed, drilled between three
 rows of fallow ; and though the former was dunged much more
 than the latter, there was infinitely more wheat in the naked
fallow. A winter fallow is an excellent thing in light ground,
 and as a preparation for spring wheat ; but it will not do with
 clays, which require a thorough drying and pulverizing, before
 they can profit by the falling juices, which would only render
 the earth more hard and compact.             A summer one is therefore
 more proper for this soil.
    The idea of letting a crop of any kind grow, in order after
 wards to plough it in, and benefit by what it has received from
 the atmosphere, and the rich juices it may possess, is                   may     (if

 humbly    offer  my  opinion)   the  worst   way   of enriching   the ground

 Sir, — 1 he       following had been several years ago composed, but
it  is only a few months since the approbation it received from
some friends well qualified to appretiate it induced me to send
it to you for publication, if you should judge it worthy.           Sine*
it was written I have seen the work of Maria Agnesi, the cele
brated female professor of mathematics at Bologna. She has
in the part relative to subtraction made use of a reasoning si
milar to .that adopted by me ; but she has not extended it to
multiplication. A friend pointed out to me the work of Mr.
Woodhouse, entitled Principles of Analytical Calculation.
    In this excellent work, peculiarly valuable for the clearness'
and precision with which it is written, I found with great plea
sure that the mode of treating the subject of multiplication was
in effect similar to my own, though expressed with more con
ciseness, and perhaps not so evident to mere beginners. I there
fore have still thought that what I now send you may be of
use to that class of readers, and in that hope transmit it to
you.      I am, sir,

 16          On the Rules       for Algebraic Multiplication.
       Numbers
             are abstract representations of quantity, and have no
particular meaning till applied to some object.     Thus 10 may
mean ten feet, ten apples, ten pulsations, ten distances of the
»un from the earth ; but they have one clear and distinct idea
 attached to them, that the unit, whatever it be, is taken ten
 times.      Every sum is therefore in fact a multiple of unity ; and
 in common multiplication, the multiplicand being considered as
 nnity, the primary and fundamental idea is the same as in the
 simplest figure or figures written down.
     But in pure symbolic algebra the abstract is carried much
 further; for the letters are not only, as in numbers, general signs
 of quantities, but do not even represent any definite numbers of
 unities ; and therefore are rather receipts or directions for the
 performance of operations, than real operations themselves: just
 as a man who has written a perfect receipt for making a pud
 ding cannot be said to have made a pudding, but told how that
 pudding has been or may be made.
  ,  a + b only means, that when instead of those letters some de
 finite quantities are used, they are to be added together, not that
 they are now incorporated ; and to call this by the name of ad
 dition, seems an abuse of terms, or rather a confusion of defini
 tions.     In like manner a — b means that b, being less than a, is
 to be taken from it when by the substitution of some real quan
 tity this can be done. And this is so true,- that, if improper or
 dissimilar quantities are used, the expression remaining the
 same, absolute nonsense ensues.
       If,
         for example,      be supposed to represent ten shillings, and
                            a
    seven miles,  it   isobvious that nothing but absolute nonsense
is b talked when we speak of —      a   b.
     In what has been called geometrical multiplication, the abs
 traction, though very analogous to that of algebraic notation,
is    not however precisely the same.          In this a  superficies   is
 considered, having its four angles right angles, and its sides the
 two given lines which are thus considered as multiplied by, or
 drawn into, each other        and the results of this operation are
                                ;                                      ri
 gorously true,      and  may be as logically reasoned on when the
values of them are inexpressible             by
                                           numbers, or are incommen
surable, as when they are commensurable.            The properties, for
example, of the area formed             by
                                        the side of  a  square and its
diagonal may be investigated, though no numbers can express
them.       In this respect the abstraction is' very similar to that of
pure    algebraic   symbols, which may be supposed to represent any
quantities    of  the  same kind, whether expressible    by numbers or
not. In another point of view          the  abstraction of geometrical
investigation    is very similar to algebraic. The figure drawn   is  not
                                                                      the

 tKbugh crooked, the angles though not right angles in the figure
 drawn, represent straight lines and right angles, to the reasoner                                               ;
 and still further, the figure which he thus contemplates has no
 determinate magnitude to his mind, and indeed cannot have
 any; for,     ifhad, the deductions would not be universal, but
                    it
 particular.       would,
                        It  believe, be of great advantage to the

 young student to consider these matters attentively on his first
 outset, as many false ideas would be thereby prevented from
 entering his mind.
    Perhaps too much has been said on this even for a learner —                                           :

  be compared with some other quantity either greater than itself

Thk composition of the atmosphere is still but imperfectly un
derstood.      It is said that it consists of 21 per cent, of oxygen
gas and 79 of nitrogen ; but it is well known that hydrogen and
carburetted hydrogen gases arise from various species of vege
table and animal decay and putrefaction, and in great abundance
from marshes and stagnant pools of water, especially in hot
weather.      Consequently those gases would soon contaminate
the atmosphere to such a degree, as would render a country un
inhabitable, were it not for the natural means by which those
gases are decomposed and returned to the earth.                      Hence it is
probable that the upper parts of the atmosphere generally con
 tain a large portion of those gases.
    The air upon the tops of mountains is much colder than in
the valleys, because hydrogen gas, being much lighter than at
mospheric air, rises in great abundance into the higher regions ;
but oxygen gas cannot ascend so high, in consequence of its
being many times heavier than the other.
    Hence, the temperature of the air in the higher regions can
not be equal to its temperature upon the surface of the earth
where those gases are in a more condensed state*.
    " In every case of combustion there must be present a com
bustible and a supporter ;" nor can the temperature of a body
be increased without these two elements be united.
    To illustrate this position by experiment ; Let two pieces of
dry wood be smartly rubbed together, and an increase of tem
perature will be generated long before combustion takes place f.
Consequently combustion and increase of temperature are effects
of  the same cause,

     But this theory does not rest merely upon the hydrogen gai,
which rises from the surface of the earth into the atmosphere,
 to supply it with one of the elements of combustion ; for it ha»
 lately been proved that nitrogen is a compound of oxygen and
 hydrogen.
                Decomposition  of Azotic   Gas or Nitrogen.
      Since the departure of Professor Berzelius from England, he
 has written to a chemical friend in London, announcing that he
 has succeeded in decomposing nitrogen, which he has reason to
 suppose, from his analysis, to be composed of about 45 parts of
  a new species of inflammable gas, and about 55 of oxygen*.
      And Mr. Mires, a young chemist in London, has proved, by a
  series of very ingenious experiments, that azote is a compound of
  Oxygen and hydrogen, nearly in the proportion of those an
  nounced by Professor Berzelius f.
      Now let it be supposed that 100 parts of atmospheric air are
  composed, by weight, of 21 parts of oxygen gas, and
                                 79         of azotic gas.
                                100
      And    if the azote be composed of 45 per cent. of hydrogen
  and 55 per cent. of oxygen, then 79 parts of azote contains
             35 -55 of hydrogen, and
             43-45 of oxygen.
             79-00
       For, as 100 : 79 : : 45 : 35-55 hydrogen.
       And, as 100 : 79 : : 55 : 43-45 oxygen.
       Consequently if the hydrogen gas contained in the nitrogen
   be   taken into the account, 100 parts of atmospheric air con
   tains 64 '45 of oxygen = 21 +43'45, and,
           35-55 of hydrogen.
          100'00 x.
       Whence it appears that the atmosphere always contains the
   two elements of combustion, and these being acted upon by
    the influence of the sun, the temperature of the air is increased § ;
    and as his influence increases or decreases, the temperature of
   bodies, in which these elements are united, varies accordingly.
    Hence we may infer that all the variations of temperature

    being abstracted, and the remaining quantity entering into combination
    with hydsogen.          § Phil. Mag. vol. xliv. p. SSI.

 Sir, —The        annexed table contains the precession, abberation,
 nutation and solar variation, both in right ascension and declina
 tion of Polaris, for the year 1815.           It has been computed with
 great  care, and   will serve  with sufficient  accuracy to the year 1 S20.
 The    mean     right   ascension   and    declination of that star from
  1815 to 1820, appear, from the best observations, to be as fol
 lows :

     The general rule for finding the corrections that are to be ap
 plied to the mean right ascension and declination of the star,
is, to enter the table with the sun's longitude, which is given for
 every day in the year in the Nautical Almanac, and take out the
 precession    and aberration in the 2d and 4th columns of the
 table.    In like manner with the longitude of the moon's node,
 had from the same Almanac, take out in columns 3 and 5 the
nutation.       Apply these corrections respectively to the star's
mean right ascension and declination, and the apparent right
ascension and declination are obtained.
    Although the table gives the corrections only for every 10° of
the sun's longitude or moon's node, it is easy to make propor
tion, and find them for each degree.

Sir, — A.       fact stated by Dr. William Henry in the last Num
ber   of Thompson's Annals, of the oxiding of a metal (cast iron)
by the combined action of charcoal and steam ; brings to my
mind a similar effect which occurred to our ingenious acquaint
ance Mr.T. T. Hawkins, several years since ; who, in employing
powdered charcoal placed between two perforated leaden plates,
for the purpose of filtering water, found the water had become
considerably impregnated with lead, which led him to take the
filtre to pieces, when it appeared that the joint action of the wa
ter and charcoal had converted much of the lead into a white
oxide, which interspersed with the charcoal, occupied the en
tire space between the plates, and therefore he was under the
necessity of laying them "aside, and substituting others in their
places not liable to that defect ; by which means he perfectly
attained his object, that of employing charcoal as a filtering
medium, for which, owing to its great porosity, it is admirably
 adapted.        I am, with much respect, sir,

   VI. Account      of a Fall of      Uranolytes   ("Aerolites) near Agen.
                        By M. De Saint Amans*.
 On     the 5th    of September IS 14, a few minutes before mid-day,
 the wind     being northerly, and the sky perfectly serene, a violent
 detonation was heard in the communes of Montpezat, Temple,
 Castelmoron, and Montclar, situated in the first, second, and
 fourth arroudisiemens of the department of the Lotand Garonne.
 This unusual detonation was, -immediately followed by three or
 four others at an interval of half a second successively; and
 finally, by a rolling noise at first resembling a discharge of mus
 ketry, afterwards the rolling of carriages, and finally, that of a
 large building falling down.             These detonations, which took
 place towards the centre of the department, were heard with
 more or less intensity within a circle of several leagues.            Thus
  at Agen, four        leagues off,      they were sufficiently strong to

alarm some persons, and the concussion of the air was such as
to snake the doors and windows of certain houses ; while at Pay-
mirol, two leagues to the eastward of Agen, these effects were
less sensible ; and at Mezin, St. Macaire, Basas, and Condon,
situated five or six kilometres from the focus of the explosion,
it was heard in a very indistinct manner.
   At the end of this phenomenon, which, considering the state
of the atmosphere, could not be occasioned by any storm, we
were led to expeet a fall of these meteoric stones, which has al
ways been preceded by similar detonations.         We soon learned,
in fact, that this fall, accompanied by a kind of lightning, had
taken place in the communes above named.             From the written
and verbal reports which have reached us, the number and vo
lume of these stones appears to have been considerable.          Some
were sent to the prefect who has communicated them to the mi
nister of the interior: others were distributed among the curious
in various parts of France, while many were picked up by the
peasants and venerated as reliques. Two are mentioned as weighing
eighteen pounds each.       It seems that they were not found warm
at the moment of their fall : the heaviest were sunk into a com
pact soil to the depth of eight or nine inches, and one of them
rebounded three or four feet from the ground.         It is added, that
these stones fell obliquely, making an angle of from 65 to 70 de
grees with the horizontal line ; finally, that they diverged in
their fall, affecting various directions in the different communes
where they fell.     Like all those which have come from similar
meteors, they appeared to be fragments of more considerable
masses, and are perfectly homogeneous.           All the specimens of
these stones which I saw, present no character to the eve which
can make them be distinguished from those which I have hi
therto had occasion to examine, or which I have in my cabinet :
they merely seemed to be more friable and more porous than
the latter.    I have remarked in some fragments globulous bodies,
similar to those which Mr. Howard found in a great quantity in
 the uranolites of Benares, and which are composed, according
to him, of abundance of silex with a little oxide of iron.          We
 observed also in the interior of those stones, that the pyrites which
 they contain are sometimes crystallized in a group. 'All of them
 are covered externally with a black crust of the thickness of a
 quarter of a line nearly, which announces the action of fire, as
 we see in all the stones of the same kind. Two of our corre
 spondents inform us that one of them exhibits singular im
 pressions at the surface, but it is necessary to verify this.      • .
    In fact, of all the peculiarities which the phenomenon pre
sented, the most remarkable is the very simultaneous appear
                                                                   ance

                   Account       of a Fall of Aerolites.                   2S
ance of a small cloud, which seems to have accompanied the
meteor, and even to have preceded it a few seconds.               This small
white cloud, grayish in the centre, appeared to move with the
greatest rapidity over the district where the meteor fell.                In
other parts, and particularly from the spot where I observed               it,
it  seemed stationary before the explosion.            It has been generally
admitted that this small cloud had             a roundish form.     Scarcely
was  it perceived  in  the communes where the uranolites fell, when
the explosion, accompanied               lightning, was heard. At the
                                        by
very instant the cloud appeared to be divided into three or four
parts which were rapidly precipitated towards the ground, leaving
iiehind them irizations of            ablueish colour and the point         of
which was red.       From the position which occupied,
                                                   I              itwas seen
directly  in the north,  inclining  a  little to  the north-west.     It
                                                                     seemed
then to be immoveable        ;but at the moment of the detonation          it
 seemed to advance very rapidly towards the south, forming two
points which were prolonged             the sky, and which the peasants
                                        in
unanimously compared to long cords.                After this sudden move
ment, the small clouds which had attained nearly my zenith,
considerably diminished, stopped, became immoveable, and ended
by being insensibly dissolved at the same place.                 Itcannot be
doubted, think, that the instantaneous appearance of this cloud
          I
insulated in a sky absolutely deprived of all vapour,             isnot con
nected with the meteor.            has been observed under the same
                                   It
forms, nearly in every place where the detonation was" heard,
ftnd its immoveability, notwithstanding the strong wind which
then blew, proves that         must have been very high in the air.
                              it
 We cannot,   I  think, refrain from regarding         it  as the produce of
the gases emanated from the stoney mass which, when heated
by the .friction which   it underwent in traversing the atmosphere,
allowed them to escape under the form of a condensed vapour.
 The nebulous appearance which resulted must have given rise to
several optical illusions on the part of the spectators, who before
the explosion had no interest in observing it.            To those who were
 close to the place where        fell,
                                 it       itseemed to move with a great
 rapidity: to those who were like myself, four or five leagues
towards the south       it   appeared stationary.          In advancing    di
rectly opposite to the latter,           must in fact have appeared to
                                        it
 them without motion, until the explosion made               assume another

form, and until, as     it approached their zenith, they must have
perceived its progressive motion.           This cloud must therefore have
been the result of the gases developed in the bosom of the mass,
 which must have in the first place formed around a spherule of
 vapours, and which being more , and more rarefied, as the mass
 approached the surface of the earth, must have caused its ex
 plosion,
                                                                       -
                                                                          To

                     On the Sounds      of the  Gases.
    To conclude: this explosion must           have been effected, as    I
have already said, in a high region of the atmosphere, since the
wind had not reached the small cloud, and since the fragment*
of the mass were dispersed, diverging over four communes in a
radius of five great quarters of a league.         If similar clouds have
not always been remarked simultaneously with meteors of this
kind, since they have been observed with care, this has arisert
from few of those meteors having been seen in such a serene sky,
mid other clouds must have been confounded with the peculiar
cloud which accompanies them.
    Here let me direct the attention of my reader for a moment
to the term aerolite, which is commonly given to meteoric stones.
This denomination does not seem to be the best which may be
employed.       In fact, it is far from certain that these stones are
formed in the air or with air. The elevation of the meteor
which produces them having been observed to be at least thirty
leagues from the surface of the ground, proves that they have
nothing in common with the fluid which supports life on the
surface of our globe.       The name of uranolyte has long appeared
to me to     be  better suited to bodies whose origin is unknow n to
us, but which tend towards the earth through that boundless
space in which the stars move, and which is unanimously called
the heavens.       The term therefore which is formed of the Greek
words ougavoj and \tQo;, deserves the preference to aerolite, as
being more definite.        Some writers have even adopted the term
 vranelile, since the publication of a Memoir which I read to the
 Society of Agriculture, Arts and Sciences of Agen, in i SOS.
 VII. Calculations of        the  Intervals and Beats of the Sounds
     yielded   by  various    Gases in the corrected Experiments of
     Messrs. F.    Kirbv,   and A. Mkrrick, recorded in Mr. Ni
     cholson's Journal.         By Mr. John Faiiey, Sen.
                              To   Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir, — In     your xxxviith volume, page 3, you did me the favonr
 to insert   some    extracts and particulars, of an interesting series
 of experiments, by Messrs. F. Kirby and Arnold Merrick, of
  Cirencester, extracted from Mr. Nicholson's Journal, on the dif
 ferent pitches or degrees of sound, yielded by the same organ-
  pipe, when successively blown by eight different kinds of gases,
  in a suitable apparatus.       Since that period these gentlemen have
  repeated   their  experiments     with an improved apparatus for pro
  ducing   the  sounds,   and    with  additional care; having also ex
                                                                    tended

                   On  the Sounds  of the Gases.                27
tended the number of their gaseous bodies (or mixtures of such
to seventeen) without however adopting in these repetitions, the
hints which I gave at page 5, for determining the pitch in
future experiment, by the beats made between the gaseous sound
and those of other pipes, previously and carefully tuned to fixed
Diatonic Notesy near enough to them, in each case, and blown
constantly by atmospheric air, in the same manner as the stan
dard C pipe in their experiments was blown.
    I recommended this course to Messrs. K. and M. in order to
avoid the great uncertainty, which practical timers have found,
in unisons even upon sounding bodies of the same kind, as
strings and strings, pipes and pipes, &c. and much more so in
tuning strings from pipes, or vice versa, &e. It is for enabling
 future Experimenters to resort to this more accurate method
than the monochord, that would doubtless remove, or much
 lessen, the very considerable disagreements that still exist,
between the repetitions of these gentlemen's experiments, and
between their average results, on the present and former occa
 sion, that I now trouble you with, an extract of their general re
 sults (from Mr. Nicholson's Journal, vol. xxxiii. p. 171) in the
 two first columns of the following Table ; only reversing the or
der, that I might place the most acute sounds towards the
 top, as the notes are placed on the music stave.
     The third column shows the intervals in my notation reckoned
 each way from atmospheric air ; the fourth column shows the
 excess or defect of these, compared with the nearest Note on
 the Rev. Henry Liston's Enharmonic Organ (which remains
  yet on view at Messrs. Flight and Robson's); the method of tun
  mg which Notes by means of perfect concords only, I have fully
  explained in your xxxviith volume, p. 275, and xxxixth volume,
  p. 374 and 421.      And the 6th and last column shows, the
  Seats in one second of time, and whether flat or sharp, that
  these mean results (as indicated by the monochord lengths in
  column 2) would make with Mr. Liston's Notes in the preceding
  column, respectively, when Tenor-clif C is yielded by the stan
  dard experiment pipe, blown by common atmospheric air, and
  excites just 240 complete vibrations therein, in one second of
  time.

able Magazine, to some accounts of men of genius and real
merit, permit me through the same medium to pay a tribute of
respect to the memory of the late Edward Hussey Delaval, Esq.
of Parliament Place, Westminster, who died on the 14th of
August last, aged 85 years, and was buried in Westminster
Abbey.
       This gentleman was of a very ancient and noble family, and
•the only surviving brother of the laic John Hussey Lord Delaval,
 .which title is now extinct.
       Edward Hussey Delaval was Master of Arts and Fellow of
 Pembroke Hall, Cambridge ; an excellent classical scholar, and
  well conversant in most languages both ancient and modern.
  Chemistry and experimental philosophy were his favourite
  pursuits.     He was a great judge of music and the polite arts ;
  and the completest set of musical glasses ever produced in Eng
  land, w:ere made under his direction many years ago, and com
   municated by him to Dr. Franklin.
       On the 28th of June, 1764, he published an Account of the
   Effects of Lightning in St. Bride's Church, Fleet-street, which
 •happened       on the 18th of that month.         It was addressed to
    B. Wilson, Esq. F.R.S. with explanatory plates, and was read
    at the Royal Society, of which Mr. Delaval had been elected a
    Member in December 1759.
  -
        On June 7, 1769, by desire of the Dean and Chapter of St.
  •
    Paul's, a Report was delivered to the Royal Society from
    W. Watson, B. Franklin, B. Wilson, and E. Delaval, on the
  .
    means of securing St. Paul's Church from Lightning ; and mea
    sures were in consequence taken for that purpose.
        On the 22d of March 1772, St. Paul's Church was struck
    with lightning, it was examined by Mr. Delaval about a week
     afterwards, and the effect stated to the Royal Society.
        Soon after this period a difference of opinion arose amongst
   •
     the philosophers who had paid attention to electricity relative
     to the choice of pointed or blunt conductors for the safety of
     public buildings ; and on February 20, 1773, Mr. Delaval in a
     letter to Mr. Wilson, published his observations on the subject,
     and gave the preference to the use of blunt conductors ; stating,
     that the intent of conductors is to guard the building from dan
      ger rather than to solicit it ; and adding the following remark
                                                                     on

30                   Biographical Memoranda
on the subject.     " But although our conductors are inadequate
to so great a power as that which is necessary to exhaust clouds
of an immense size, yet they may be applied with great proba
bility of success to carry off with safety as much lightning as
may at any given time be contained in the metallic parts of a
building, provided a complete communication be formed be
tween them and sufficiently large conductors."
    Impressed with a high opinion of Sir Isaac Newton's disco
veries in optics, and by a close attention to those experiments
which Sir Isaac Newton made, and has detailed in his Book of
Optics. Mr. Delaval showed by a series of experiments, and
minute observations that Sir Isaac Newton's doctrine is equally
applicable to permanently coloured bodies ; and on January 24,
1765, a Letter addressed by Mr. Delaval to the Earl of Morton,
President of the Royal Society, was read there, containing Ex
periments and Observations on the Agreement between the
specific Gravities of the several metals, and their Colours when
united to Glass, as well as those of their other Preparations.
This paper is published in the fifty-fifth volume of the Royal
Society's Transactions, and for it Mr. Delaval was honoured with
their gold medal.
    In 1775, Mr. Delaval and Mr. B. Wilson were engaged in a
Series of Experiments relative to phosphoric and the prismatic
Colours they are found to exhibit in the Dark.        The account
was published by Mr. Wilson, who stated that the experiments
were made in Mr. Delaval's house on the side of the Thames at
Westminster.
    In 1777, Mr. Delaval published in quarto, An experimental
Inquiry into the Cause of the Changes in opaque and coloured
Bodies, with an historical Preface relative to the parts of philo
sophy therein examined, and to the several arts and manufactures
dependant on them.
    On the 19th of May 1784, Mr. Delaval produced his experi
mental Inquiry into the Cause of the permanent Colours of
opaque Bodies, which was presented and read at the Literaryand
Philosophical Society of Manchester, and honoured with their
gold medal.     It is published in the second volume of the second
edition of their Memoirs.
    In testimony of the great merit of Mr. Delaval's discoveries
and observations, I adduce the approbation they have generally
experienced amongst men of science, and which is evidenced by
their having been translated into most of the European lan
guages. I beg leave to quote the following instance, transcribed
from the Nouveaux Memoires de V Academie Royal des Sciences
et Belles Lettres, noted by M. Le Professeur de Castellon, re

                          " Re'cherches experimentalcs sur le Cause

done k ("experience qu'il faut recourir si l'ou veut connoitre les
causes des phenomenes de physique.            C'est le nu'thode dont
Bacon a si bien trace la theorie et dont Galileo et Newton ont
si bien montre* la pratique.      C'est le mi'thode que M. Delaval,
Membre de la Societe Royal de Londres, et mon confrere a
cet egard, a exactement suivie dans le Memoire qu'il m'a fait
l'honneur de m'adresser afiu que je presentasse k cette illustre
assemble. Je le crois digne de son attention, et je vais le
commettre a son jugement ; j'ajouterai seulement que j'ai
repe'te avec le succes le plus heureux plusieurs experiences con
 tinues dans cet ecrit."
     Mr. Delaval's company was much courted by j)ersons of genius.;
and besides the other gentlemen whose names have been already
 mentioned, he was intimate with Dr. Lewis, Dr. Ingenhoux,
 Mr. Magellan, Mr. Kirwan, Mr. Cavallo, and most of the men
of science of his time ; though he visited little, his house was
always open to men of abilities.        He was ever ready to give
information and elucidate it by facts in their presence, and in
 the accuracy of his experiments no man was his superior.         No
 arts were made use of by him to trumpet forth his publications,
 but they were left to stand or fall by the test of experiment.
 The Royal Societies of Upsal and Gottingen, the Institute of
 Bologna, and the Literary and Philosophical Society of Man
chester, unsolicited iiirolled him amongst their members.
     It may be necessary to note that Dr. Bancroft, in his publica
 tions intitled, Experimental Reserches concerning the Philosophy
 of Colours, has differed greatly in opinion with Sir Isaac New
 ton, and Mr. Delaval.        Dr. Bancroft, in page 27, of the first
 edition of his work, makes the following remark, after long cri
 ticisms on Mr. Delaval's publications.      " I also think it may be
  deemed a matter of excuse and consolation that he has only
 erred with Newton."        It seems extraordinary after this asser
  tion, that Dr. Bancroft, in his late publication, in two volumes,
  octavo, has so puzzled the subject, that in the Monthly Review
  enlarged, for September last, it appears that the Reviewers have
  concluded that Sir Isaac Newton and Mr. Delaval differed i^
  opinion.    This is not the first time that Dr. Bancroft has been
  unfortunate in his explanations, as may be seen in Dr. Robert
  Jackson's Letters to the Commissioners of Military Inquiry,
  page 5, where Dr. Jackson, in his Answer, saith ;
                                                           " He (Dr.
  Bancroft) has attacked my writings, and in doing this he has
 *o mixed and garbled my words, so perplexed and perverted my
                                                              meaning

 32       Biographical Memoranda of Edivard Hussey Delaval.
 meaning on different occasions, that without reference to my-
  own text, I should scarcely know myself what I mean.
       If Mr. Delaval had lived, I think he would have made precisely
  the same observation on Dr. Bancroft's attack upon his Treatise
  on Colours.       I am of opinion, that if Dr. Bancroft would in a
  future edition of his work, give a detail of many important im
  provements made within the last thirty years or more in the
  practice of dying and printing, which seem to have escaped his
  notice, or of which he has not yet acquired a knowledge, he
  would render more service to the public than by his theories.
       As Dr. Bancroft in his publications has commented very freely
  on the Theories and Opinions of Sir Humphry Davy, Sir Isaac
  Newton, Mr. Delaval, and many other English and foreign
  philosophers, I hope my present observations will not be deemed
  any seeming incivility towards him, but be considered as the
  frank effusion of a zeal for truth, an earnest wish to benefit the
 .public, and a justice due to Mr. Delaval.
       To enter into minute accounts of Mr. Delaval's experiments
  and theory would trespass too far upon your useful pages ; but
  it is certain that whoever will attentively peruse Mr. Delaval's
  publications above mentioned, will find a series of very correct ex
  periments, and a fund of most valuable information on the sub
 jects they treat upon, and be pleased with the modesty and
 -candour with which they are related.
       An uninterrupted intimacy of forty years which I enjoyed
  with Mr. Delaval, continued to furnish me till his decease, con
  stantly with fresh proofs of his strength of mind and great abi
  lities.- The various brilliant artificial gems made by Mr. De
  laval, the curious samples of his mode of abstracting the fluor
  from glass, which remain in the family, and the neat Gothic house
  in Parliament Place, in which he resided till his death, the in
  terior of which is elegantly formed of artificial stone under hi»
  immediate direction, in order to be perfectly secure from fire,
  will long remain durable testimonies of his knowledge as a che
  mist, and of his taste as a gentleman,
r                    I remain, with much respect and esteem,

hours each ; after which the clock was moved back again, ex
 actly to its former place, and another series was tried with the
 long pendulum of three hours : after this series was completed,
 the clock and maintaining power were both taken away, and a
 series of vibrations were observed with the simple pendulum as
 it hung from the clamp, and it was found that in 61 minutes of
 sideral time, the pendulum made 2560-24 vibrations.               After
 this series of the long pendulum one of the simple vibrations of
 the short pendulum was tried, for which purpose the point of
  suspension was lowered 60 inches ; and in 32 sideral minutes it
  made 2708 vibrations, also in 72 sideral minutes as tried again
  it made 60i)4 vibrations, but the last number being a little doubt
  ful, another trial was made, and in 62 minutes were made 5248
  vibrations:    a trial of the long pendulum was then repeated,
  which in 65 sideral minutes made 2728 simple vibrations.
      After these trials were finished, a series of experiments were
  made by changing the quantity of maintaining power, and also
  by altering the height of the adjusting ball to the pendulum, as
  will be seen by an inspection of the columns.          It is necessary
  that before each trial the adjusting ball should be so situated
  that the beater should vibrate in the same time as the pendu
   lum ; but I am not aware that this was strictly attended to in the
  above series ; indeed, I believe the weight was not so proportioned
   as to give an accurate result in this respect, as I remember Sir
   George intended to repeat the series at some future period : but
   his death put a stop to all further research.    The clock is now in
   the hands of the Hon. C. Jenkinson, in consequence of his mar
   riage with the daughter of the late Sir George, and I have no
   doubt he would be happy to give to any gentleman or society of
    gentlemen, who may be desirous of prosecuting these valuable
    experiments, by which the length of the seconds pendulum
   might be determined to almost any degree of exactness. A series
   of such experiments made in different latitudes would determine
   better than any other means the figure of the earth ; the clock
    will admit of considerable improvement, and proportional and
    invariable impulse may be easily given to each length of pen
    dulum ; also various lengths might be tried, besides these se
    lected by Sir George, and given above.
    X. On    the Phcenomena   of Electricity. By      J. Murray, Esq.

                              To Mr. Tilloch.
    Sir, — Some of      my experiments are recorded in the pages of it
    your  Journal, which  go far to establish the existence of a current \
                                                                      and

                  On the Phenomena       of Electricity.            39
and counter current as exhibited by the discharge of an electric
sphere.    In reverting to these phenomena, I would be under
stood as referring particularly to the wires deposited upon cards
with intervening patches of tinfoil, and the opposing halls ob
scured with China ink. I have now the pleasure to adduce an
additional illustration on the same side.        In this experiment I
employed the electrical forceps with its insulated stand, de
scribed in a late number of your Journal, a very good sub
stitute for an universal discharger.       Here one of the joints of
the instrument was attached to the outside of the charged elec
tric, and the other connected with the insulated discharger.
A ball made of the pith of elder (about half an inch diameter)
was placed in opposition, in contact with each end of the pla-
tiria wires, the distance between the points varying from two to
four inches and an half ; when the discharge was made the balls
were propelled in opposite directions, and when modified, they
exchanged sides.
    The propulsion of a pith ball introduced in evidence of a cur
rent from the charged to the opposite side is thus proved to be
inconclusive.     If we except the divergence and convergence of
radii from opposing electricities, the inclination of the flame of a
candle is the only experiment which cdn give the least colour to
the theory of a maximum and minimum electricity.             As to the
unipolarily fas it is called) of the flame from this source, it is
a well sounding word, but void of meaning, considered with
regard to the view it is meant to establish ; for it can, if I ap
prehend aright, receive a fairer and more philosophical elucida
tion from considering the phenomena displayed in the Voltaic
circle, viewed in connexion with the recent experiments of Mr. .
Brande.      Here it may be said, that the flame generating car
bonic acid gas, ought to be attracted by the charged surface
 (pos.) ; whereas it is the reverse — my opinion is decidedly
against this view.     So long as it is flame, it is merely carhon in
the act of dissolving in oxygen, for such is its constitution.       It
is not of an acid nature, but carbonous oxide, for carbonic acid
gas is uninflammable,       though charcoal and carbonic oxide (a
gaseous body) be combustible.         It becomes not carbonic acid
gas until ejected beyond the sphere of flame, when being sub
jected to a. further exposure relative to atmospheric air, it be
comes acid by abstracting an additional portion of oxygenous
gas\
    Light and electrical   phenomena appear analogous: both are
material.     I know that this has been denied to the first of these,
but the momentum of light as proved by the experiment of
 Mr. Mitchell, in that projected against a delicate plane of cop
per, from a reflecting speculum, strongly supports the opinion ;

and is not tT5e action of light on the photometer a proof of the
same kind ?       My friend Capel Lofft, Esq. judiciously remarks, in
his correspondence with me, If light were not material, but. the
undulation of an elastic medium, then the smallest aperture ad
mitting light into a darkened room, should illuminate the whole
apartment equal with the greatest, as a spark ignites any quan
tity of gunpowder however long the train.           That electrical phe
nomena are produced by a material agent, appears beyond a
question, from the exhibition of its effects on our senses.         If the
taste is operated upon, it is singularly affected. A snapping noise
and loud explosion are communicated to the ear.                Light and
colours, and its effects on masses of matter are the circumstances
embraced by the orb of vision ; — our feeling is sensible of its
power.      In the spark drawn from an insulated conductor, the
aura electrica from acuminated rods, and the shock from ac
cumulated electricity ; and it is impossible to mistake its pe
culiar odour. There is an experiment which, I think, confirms
this statement ; connect the external coatings of two jars, and by
forming a communication between the inside linings, a charge
may be transferred at a single contact from a jar charged in the
usual way to another, and the density in each will be as the
ratio of the capacity.          Those substances which become pho
 sphorescent by solar light, are precisely those which are similarly
illuminated hy electricity ; for this assurance, I am indebted to
the polite communication of Mr. Skrimshire, of Wisbeach : an
 opportunity of repeating- his experiments has not occurred to
me.     The circle of prismatic rings, afforded by the electric dis
charge directed against a polished metallic plate from a point 5
 and the concentric coloured zones exhibited by decomposing
 electric light, by means of the prism, are appearances allied to
 the supposition of the identity.         A view of their corresponding
 chemical effects will come in hereafter.
    Light moves with a velocity which is truly great, reaching the
 orb inhabited by us, a distance^ from the sun of 95 millions of
 miles, in less than eight minutes of time.          The velocity of the
 agency   of  electricity   harmonizes     with that of light.   The vast
 circuit traversed by it in the experiments of Dr Watson, was
 performed quick as the lapse of thought.              Caloricis,  on the
 contrary, slow in its movement, and Mlver, the best conductor
 among the metals, proves its tardy progress, and sound itself in
 its propagation       bythe elastic shells of air percurs space, only at

 XI. Letter from M. Ampere to Count Berthoixet, on the
    Determination of the Proportions in which Bodies are com
    bined, according to the respective Number and Arrangement
    of the Molecules of which their integrant Molecules are
    composed   *.
 You     have been long since informed that the important disco
very   of  M. Gay Lussac, on the simple proportions observed be
 tween the volumes of a compounded gas, and those of the com
 ponent gases, gave rise to the idea of a theory which explains
not only the facts discovered by this eminent chemist, and the
analogous facts observed since, but which may also be applied
to the determination of the proportions of a great number of
other compounds, which in ordinary circumstances do not affect
 the gaseous state.
    The memoir in which I enter upon this theory in detail, is
 nearly finished ; but as occupations of another description do not
 admit of my finishing it now, I hasten to comply with your wish
 of giving an abstract.
    Consequences deduced from the theory of universal attraction
 considered as the cause of cohesion, and the facility with which
 the light traverses transparent bodies, have led natural philoso
 phers to think that the latter molecules of bodies were held by
 the attractive and repulsive forces which are peculiar to them,
 at distances as it were infmitely great relative to the dimensions
 of those molecules.
    Hence their forms, with which no direct observation can
 make us acquainted, have no more any influence on the pheno-
 mena presented by the bodies which are composed of them, and
 we must seek for the explanation of these phenomena in the
 manner in which these molecules arrange themselves with respect
 to each other, in order to form what I call a particle.           Accord
ing to this notion we ought to consider a particle as the assem-

Wage of a (feterminate number of molecules in a determinate si
tuation, containing among them a space incomparably greater
than the volume of molecules ; and in order that this space may
have three dimensions comparable between each other, a particle
must consist of at least four molecules.       In order to express the
respective    situation  of the molecules in a particle, we must con
ceive by the centres of gravity of these molecules to which we
may suppose them reduced, planes situated so as to^leave on one
and the same side all the molecules which are beyond each
plane. Supposing that any molecule is not contained in the space
comprized between these planes, this space will be a polyhedron,
of which each molecule will occupy a summit, and it will be
sufficient to name this polyhedron, in order to express the re
spective situation of the molecules of which a particle is com
posed.     I shall give to this polyhedron the name of representa
tive form of the particle.
    Crystallized bodies being formed by the regular juxtaposition
of particles, mechanical division will therein indicate planes pa
rallel to the faces of this polyhedron ; but it will be able to in
dicate others resulting from the various laws of decrement : be
sides, there is nothing to hinder the latter from being frequently
more easily obtained than a part of the former ; and hence me
chanical division may rather furnish conjectures, and conjectures
only, for the determination of the representative forms.          There
is another way of ascertaining these forms : i. e. to determine
by the relation of the component parts of a body, the number of
molecules in each particle of this body.        For this purpose I set
out on the supposition that in the case where bodies pass to the
state of gas, their particles alone are separated and removed
from each other by the expansive force of caloric to distances
much greater than those which the forces of affinity and cohe
sion have an appreciable action, so that those distances depend
only on the temperature and pressure which the gas supports,
and at equal pressures and equal temperatures, the particles of
all the gases simple or compound, are placed at the same di
stance from each other.          The number of particles is on this
supposition in proportion to the volume of the gases*.            What
ever may be the theoretical reasons which seem to support             it,it
can only be considered as an hypothesis        ;but on comparing the
consequences which necessarily result with the phenomena, or
the properties which we observe;            if   agrees with all the

are confirmed       by  ulterior experiments,     may acquire a de-

    gree   of probability    which will approach to what we call in
    physics   certainty.   Supposing  it to be admitted, it will be suffi
    cient to know the volumes in the state of gas of a compound
    body and of its components, in order to know how a particle of
    the compounded body contains particles or portions of a particle
    of the two components. Nitrous gas, containing for instance
    the half of its volume in oxygen and the half in azote, it follows
    that a particle of nitrous gas is formed by the union of half a
    particle of oxygen and half a particle of azote ; the gas formed
    by the combination of chlore and of the oxide of carbon, con
    taining volumes of these two gases which are equal to its own,
    one of its particles is formed by the junction of a particle of
    chlore, and a particle of oxide of carbon ; water in vapour con
    taining, according to the fine -experiments of M. Gay Lussac, an
    equal volume of hydrogen, and the half of its volume in oxygen,
    one of its particles will be composed of an entire particle of
    hydrogen, and the half of a particle of oxygen : for the same reason
    a particle of the gaseous oxide of azote will contain an entire
    particle of azote, and the half of a particle of oxygen : fmally, a
    volume of ammoniacal gas being composed of a half volume of
    azote, and a volume and a half of hydrogen, a particle of this
    gas will contain the half of a particle of azote, and a particle
     and a half of hydrogen.
        If we admit as the most simple supposition, (a supposition
    which appears to me sufficiently justified by the harmony of the
     consequences which I have deduced from             it,
                                                         with the pheno
    mena)    that  the particles of oxygen,   of azote,  and  of hydrogen
     are composed of four molecules        we shall conclude, that those
                                           ;
     of the nitrous gas are also compounded of four molecules, two
     of oxygeu and two of azote those of the gaseous oxide of azote
                                   ;
     of six molecules, four of azote and two of oxygen        those of the
                                                              ;
    vapour of water of six molecules, four of hydrogen and two of
     oxygen  ;  and those of ammoniacal gas of eight molecules, six
     of hydrogen, and two of azote.
        The supposition that the particles of chlore are also compounded
     of four molecules, cannot agree with ihe phenomena presented
     by  this gas in its various combinations      we are necessarily led
                                                   :
     to account for these phenomena, to admit eight molecules in
     each of its particles, and to suppose either that these molecules
     are of the same nature, or that the particles of chlore contain
     four molecules of oxygen, and four molecules of an unknown
     combustible body.
        The first hypothesis simplifies so much the explanations which
     are about to follow, that   it would be a sufficient reason to use    it
     for that purpose alone, even      we did not regard
                                      if                       as the most

There        are two-fundamental errors into which people endowed
with different proportions of certain mental faculties commonly
fall, whenever they consider any new doctrine — 1st, that of be
lieving it before they have examined the evidence in its favour ;
and, secondly, that of condemning it anterior to investigation.
These two states of mind are equally injurious to the advance
ment of science : they are opposed to each other, but are equally
hurtful to the progress of truth —just as the rage for novelty, as
 well at the outcry against innovation, are both prejudical to real
improvement.       New discoveries too suffer from a variety of other
 reasons — the jealousy of the selfish and covetous, who envy their
 contemporaries the merit of invention, and the bigotry of igno
rant persons, who imagine that some mischief will arise to their
favourite creeds, as well as the great mass of imbecility and ig
norance which pervades mankind, are stumbling blocks in the
path of science, which nothing but steadiness and perseverance
will overcome. There      is, too, another and   a very rational mo
tive for persons to fee) at first a prejudice agaist a new science,
 namely, that there have been such a number of impostors      in  the
 world from time to time, and the public have been so often,
 duped  by  pretenders to philosophy, that cautiousness in admit
 ting any thing new seems the natural and necessary conse
 quence.    This latter consideration operated powerfully on my
self when first I  heard of the discoveries of Gall and Spurzheim
respecting   the  functions of the organs of the brain    ; but
                                                              I  was
 determined to investigate for myself the facts whereon the ap
parently new and peculiar notions entertained        bythose anato
 mists were founded.
    During my studies of comparative anatomy, and while dis
secting different animals when a boy,        was much struck with
                                             I
the generic forms of the crania of animals, and have often felt
surprised that among the many boasted comparative anatomists
whose volumes fill bur shelves, none had made out any relation
between the brain and the character of animals       :they described
minutely enough the number of vertebre — they named with
precision the bones of limbs — they measured the intestines to
feet and inches others counted the articulations on the backs of
                 :
insects, the rings of the caterpillar, and the legs of the scolo-
pendre ;   but no one made accurate researches into the most
important of organs.       The difficulty attending these investiga
tions of file brain, the laziness of individuals, and, gtoove all,
that execrable plan of yielding to authority, whereby people
                                                               cease

cease to inquire    into that which some great name had pom
pously declared    to  be unattainable, are the reasons why this in
teresting science had not been more successfully studied before
the present day.       These ideas frequently passed in my mind,
but I was unacquainted with any mode of investigating minutely
the brain and nerves.        Constant presentiment, however, that
in them would be found the material principles of our actions
 and character, prepared me, as it were, for the reception of the
facts which came in a loose sort of form from Germany several
years ago.      I had always considered too, that the nature of man
was never properly studied, and that a host of prejudices had
 deterred philosophers from the task.            There were several
 other facts which occurred to me, by which I anticipated, some- ,
 thing like what Dr. Gall afterwards promulgated.         These sub
jects became additionally interesting from a curious observation
 I had made, namely, that the exercise of particular faculties
 violently and continuedly appeared to produce sensations in parti
 cular parts of the head. The violent action into which any or
 gan may be called, frequently produces, I am persuaded, a sen
 sation in the part, as Dr. Spurzheim has recently shown in his
 lecture on the physiognomical expression of the organs of the
 mind,     and which is a very interesting fact, as it tends to
establish the locality of action of the different parts of the brain.
 From these circumstances, and from many curious facts 1 no
 ticed in diseases, I was then just in a state to be interested by
 the discoveries of Gall ; and the meeting with his learned col
 league in London, and hearing so many of my own crude notions
 detailed in the scientific manner in which they were treated
 •f by Spurzheim, constituted by far the most interesting period
 of my life.
     1 had scarcely begun the investigation of the anatomical part
 of their system, when I exclaimed, All I have hitherto known
 of the anatomy of the brain and nerves is mere' child's play ; -
 and the demonstrations of it given in our schools is merely dwel
 ling on a blank in the science, and reminding us of the futility
 of inquiry !
     As I consider this science not merely with reference to the in
 terest it must excite as a means of knowing the principles of the
 diversification of the human character, but also with regard
 to the important influence which a general knowledge of          it,
  shouldit   be proved true  by    time, will have on society,
                                                            I    shall
 proceed to point out the useful results of    it   under the several
 heads, as an encouragement to persons to pursue and convince
  themselves of the truth of statements which the vulgar hastily
  consider as the chimerical effusions of theoretical fancy, as one
  of the ephemeral manias of our days.         During the inquiry we
                                                                shall,

46      Observations on   Gall and Spurzheim's new System
shall, I think, remove many objections against the leading doc
trines of the system which popular prejudice and misconception
have imagined to exist; and shall see that it is a most beautiful
and perfect system of anthropology.
                     Anatomy and Physiology.
    Although on a superficial inquiry, many people may doubt of
the physiology of the organs or the general results of the system ;
yet the anatomical discoveries into the structure of the brain
and nervous system are matter of absolute demonstration, and
will remain a memorial of the industry and perseverance of Dr.
Gall and Spurzheim, before whom the anatomy of these organs
was wholly unknown.         By means of these discoveries we now
see the great consistency of Nature in all her productions
throughout the creation.        Animals endowed with similar facul
ties have corresponding parts of the brain.           Indeed till now
comparative anatomy has been a very confused and imperfect
science : probably in future a more philosophical arrangement will
be made of animals founded on the particular structure of the
brain of each class, order, genus, and species.
               Of  the Plurality and Place of Organs.
    The division of the parts of the brain into different organs of
the faculties of the mind, and their local arrangement, is strictly
philosophical, though the facts on which it is founded were dis
 covered by accident, from time to time.         The propensities are
 all at the lower and back part of the brain and cerebellum. The
 sentiments at the upper part of the brain, and the knowing and
 reflecting faculties constituting the intellectual part of our minds,
 are placed in front.     All the organs have been discovered by
 observing that where a person had this or that part of the head
most developed, the same person had particular faculties in a
high degree ; the particular faculty always corresponding with
the organ.      It was by such accidents that the local develop
 ment as connected with particular functions was found out.
 But though we have this positive proof of the necessity of the
 development of the parts to the special faculty assigned to
 them ; yet we have not the same proof of local action. Analogy,
 and the physiognomical expression of the feelings constitute,
 I think, the greatest proof we can obtain of this fact. To those
 who dispute the locality of the organs, it may be asked.         Have
 not people in all ages considered the brain as the organ of the
 mind ?    Is it not, therefore, more rational to regard it as an
 assemblage    of different organs corresponding to the different
 manifestations of the mind, than to suppose one simple organ
 performing such various functions ?

               of the Anatomy and Physiology of the Brain.               47
       It seems indeed surprising to me that the brain was not re
  garded in this light, even before observation had pointed out the
  particular seats of the organs.
  Of    the  Philosophical Tendency of the Physiology of the Organs.
      It may be of use to advert to the metaphysical results of the
  recent investigations into the physiology of the organs of animal
  life, with a view to lead to that comprehensive system of the
  philosophy of the mind, which is the legitimate deduction from
  premises which an examination of these functions has established.
   It tends to show,
       I. The nature and limits of      the influence of external impres
  sions in the production of our ideas ; which result, 1st, from the
  reaction of the organs in consequence of external impressions,
  adapted by nature to them, constituting perception : — or, 2dly,
  from the inherent or internal activity of the organs, acting by
  themselves without external impressions, or from some internal
. stimulus, constituting variously, as modified by mutual influences,
   and by the nature of the internal action of the original concep
   tions of particular genius ; which are as it were revelations of
  sciences and arts from the great size and activity of particular
   organs.      This consideration also explains visions and dreams,
  which are the consequence of the internal activity.             Indeed a
  very    curious  history  of the varieties of dreams  and other   internal
   affections, might be made from considering what organs are ac
   tive in different cases, and by noticing the effect produced to
  wards waking, when the organs of the reflecting powers begin to
   act.
       II. We see from the physiology of the organs the nature of true
   and false perceptions.         True ideas or perceptions result from
   the conformity of the action of the organs to the nature of the
   impressions from without, to which they are adapted.              Memo
   ry, —   a repetition  of  actions originally excited by external things.
   Imagination, — new combinations produced by the influence of a
  distinct and separate faculty on other organs. Genius, or original
   composition, — the great internal activity of an organ ; this is
   influenced more or less by the organ of ideality, &c.                And,
   lastly, we see that false ideas or impressions must be referred to
   irregular or disordered action of the organs ; which disordered
   health and misguided education may excite on an organization
  erroneous in the proportionate development of the different
  •rgans.       This leads to the consideration of the different mental
  derangements hereafter to be spoken of.
       III. The physiology of the organs shows where certain meta
  physical philosophers were right and where wrong in certain opi
   nions ; explains the relation between the Berkleian philosophy,
                                                                       which

48      Observations on   Gall arid Spurzkeim's new System
which denies external matter ; and the materialism of Priestley.
 In other words we hereby see where was the defect of consider
ation in the disciples of Kant, who were divided about objective
and subjective reality.    Long before I became acquainted with
eraniology, these subjects engaged much of my attention, and
I felt convinced that a radical difference in the conformation of
the mind must be the cause why certain people only regarded the
objectivity and others only the subjectivity : and why others saw
clearly the reality was the result of the reaction of the impressions
•f the object on the subject. I know persons who are defective
in the organ of Individuality, who, when they are ill of nervous
affections, have told me that they felt as if the external world did
Dot exist, but that all ideas were entirely within themselves. All
these things however must now be superficiallv treated of as va
rieties of insanity, as connected with particular organization and
established natural influences. — I mention these facts in a hasty
and imperfect manner ; they will become the subjects of future
consideration of persons more qualified.
                             Of Insanity.
   In Dr. Spurzheim's recent excellent work,        he has said, ad
verting  to  the treatment  of lunatics  and the places of their con
finement,   that   they may    more   peoperly be called madhouses
than houses for madmen.        The treatment of insane persons is
certainly at present very defective and often disgusting to huma
nity. The discoveries of Gall and Spurzheim seem- really to
promise some amelioration of their medical treatment.            They
constitute the only scientific source of knowledge about the va
rieties of these interesting kinds of diseases.
                            Of Education.
   The application of the physiology of the brain to the educa
tion of youth, consists in the cultivation of the intellect, and in
the regulation of the moral character ; and is founded on the
proof we have already obtained from experience, that we can
ascertain from the external form of the head the principal and
basis of education ; namely, the relative development of the
different material conditions of the faculties.
    I. With regard to the intellect. — Education consists in exer
cising the faculties.    Phrenology, by pointing out' the strongest
faculties of individuals, will assist us in choosing professions for
youth suitable to the genius of the individual ; and teach us, lsty
to cultivate those faculties in the exercise whereof he is likely to
become eminent ; or, 2dly, to give additional excitement to
those which, though naturally weak, may be roused into com

      II. With regard to the moral      character. — In education   we
 shall be enabled by phrenology to see where, from a preponde
 rance of some particular faculty, there is greater necessity of a
 counteraction by excitement of antagonist faculties.         We learn
 also how the superior sentiments ought to control the lower pro
 pensities, and how the organs of the will should in all cases be
 exercised early, to give them the greatest range of power over the
 propensities.      We learn also another important branch of edu
 cation in observing, that to strengthen and render habitual any
 good feeling, as benevolence for instance, we must not only in
 culcate it but must expose the child to objects of charity, and
 enhance it by setting before him instances of mercy.             Thus
phrenology comprises the sentiment the wise have held in all ages,
 of the poverty of precept when compared with example, as an
  incentive to moral excellence.
                            Of   Punishment.
     Phrenology will lead to important considerations regarding
 criminal punishment ; particularly in houses of correction.         It
will enable us to distinguish, not only between those who have
naturally strong evil propensities, from those whom distress or
 other contingence3 may have hurried          on to crime ; but will
 point out the particular nature of many evil propensities to be cor
 rected.     It is hoped that the learned authors of this' system will
 more fully develop, in some future publication, its particular ap
plication to punition.
                               Conclusion.
     Having shown some of the particular useful purposes of the
 study of the anatomy and physiology of the organs of the mind,
 I may observe, in conclusion, that while, from the most accurate
and continued examination of the subject, I feel fully convinced
 that the conclusions are legitimate deductions from demonstrable
facts, and ought for that reason alone to be studied and applied,
whatever might be their supposed tendency ; I am nevertheless
convinced that the objections raised against the deductions, by
persons who fancy they will be injurious to the religion and morals
of mankind, are wholly unfounded, and are the result of a very
superficial examination of the subject; and that, on the contrary,
it is the wild metaphysical dogmas of the modern schools against
which the shafts of this accurate scrutiny into the nature and
functions of mind are most successfully levelled.     That, in short,
the moral results of the system constitute a scientific explanation,
and therefore confirmation of doctrines which common sense has
always inclined to, which religions have inculcated, and which the
popular and proverbial philosophy of the common people have

     P. S. — I have omitted entering into the particular                proofs of
 the doctrine, as this would be trespassing                on   Dr. Spurzheim's
 lectures, which every candid inquirer should attend himself be
 fore he makes up his mind on this subject.                Even if the doctrine
 were false, these lectures contain sufficient interesting matter to
 repay the trouble of attending them.               I have only to apologize
 for these very hasty and imperfect observations, which the time
 allotted for a periodical publication will not allow me to revise,
 and to which I should not affix my name, had not several persons
 carelessly ascribed many unsigned letters on this subject from
  artists and medical and other persons, on its particular bearings,
  to its authors themselves, and have thus accused them of an
  anonymous encomium of their own discoveries.                     I publish them
  only  to  invite   students    to examine    the   facts  for  themselves,   and
  verify  their   truth   or falsehood  by their   own    investigations.
  XIII. Dr.       Spurzheim's demonstrative Course of Lectures on
     Drs. Gall and Spurzheim's Physiognomonical System.
                        f Continued  from vol. xliv. p. 3TO.J
      Lecture 10.      Having       finished the knowing or perceiving
  faculties which are common to all animals, Dr. ?. proceeded
  to the reflecting faculties ; philosophers call the latter reason,
  and the former understanding.               Animals have understanding
  and some reason.            Examples    of dogs ; one mentioned in the
  French translation of Locke's Essays, where a dog that was se
  cluded by others from the fire, went out and barked so as to at
  tract the attention of all the rest, and immediately returned and
  then took possession of the best place near the fire.                 Other in
   stances of reasoning in animals were also mentioned, furnishing
   unequivocal proofs that animals reason, but in an inferior degree.
   Man is more than an animal.            Men use facts ; one states a fact,
   and is satisfied; another adduces a similarity or analogy, and
   convinces all who bear him.             Men of fact have the lower part
   of the forehead prominent over the eyebrows ; men of analogy and
   parable have a kind of inverted pyramid at the top front of the
   forehead ; popular preachers have this part developed, parables
   and similes being the best means of conveying knowledge to the
   vulgar, and was adopted by Christ.

    *>n Drs. Gall and Spurzkeim's Vhysiognomonical             System. 51
    This faculty compares, it    is the XXXth configuration or organ
 of comparison.      Animals   have   it in a certain degree; it is ne
 cessary for reasoning to compare, and men love comparisons.
    If the upper part of the forehead be prominent, or an elevated
 ridge traverse it horizontally, it is what Gall called the organ of
 metaphysics ; but all men are more or less metaphysicians. The
lateral prominences Dr. S. considers as indicating the relation
between cause and effect; while the centre elevation compares,
the side ones reflect on causes and effects.      Metaphysicians go too
far, they pretend to know God whom it is impossible for man to
know; they take virtues only for causes.           It is injurious to the
progress of science to inquire into causes instead of observing1
facts.    This is the XXXIst organ of causality ; it appears in every
artist, and mechanic, &c. all excellence in any art or calling i»
indicated by this organ ; Dryden, Milton, Shakespeare, Locke,
late Mr. Pitt, &c. had it. Philosophical minds have individuality,
facts and analogy or relation between cause and effect ; i. e.
knowing, comparing and examining the cause : these are con
fined to the centre ; it is not necessary to have the whole fore
head prominent ; the mere front is sufficient.             Instance of..*-
shepherd with highly developed reflecting faculties.
    XXXII. Organ of wit; it is situated in the lateral parts,
which must be prominent over the eyes, as appears on Sterne's
temples.     What is wit ? it is very difficult to define ; many
writers have vainly attempted to give the definition in words; wit
and humour are only different degrees of the same faculty.            Wits
have a peculiar moile of comparing ; wit is often false, yet it
stimulates to laughter.
    XXXIII. Organ of imitation; it was discovered by Gall on
examining the head of a player who had a deep furrow on the
top of his forehead.       Instance of a deaf boy, who imitated or
mimicked the manner of all the patients brought to the hospital
in Vieuna where he was. Bust of Shakespeare having this organ,
that of benevolence and adjoining parts high ; it is useful to
artists, sculptors, &c. it gives them the power of producing ex
pression.    Sculptors ought also to have the organs of construc
tion and imitation.       Children do much by imitation, and the
majority of   men    live all their lives by imitating others, instead
of reflecting for themselves. — Having finished the defini--
tion and demonstration of the organs, Dr. S. observed that of
some he had spoken positively, of others only as probable, and
of some again as very likely. The entire system is founded on
facts and experience ; prove the facts false and it is annihilated.
Dr. S. has added three organs to the number proposed by Dr.
Galli and made them thirty-three. Philosophers proceed one
Way, naturalists another ; the latter inquire, on seeing any new
                                    D   2                          subject,

52     Dr.     Spurzheim's     demonstrative       Course    of Lectures
subje ct,  To what order, germs,         species   or variety   does it belong   ?
He, in like manner, begins by inquiring how many                      '."''-"  are
indicated by the mind ? It is necessary to multiplv organ ' M all
the primitive faculties are explained.             The applications of -.ese
faculties are indefinite.        There are thirty-three organs ; and as
the letters of the alphabet are sufficient to indicate sounds and
form words, so are they to signify the faculties.                  The propen
sities influence the character ; sentiments also influence the rea
soning faculties.       Man is a determinate being ; education is not
capable of making the character, and teachers all know this.
Animals likewise have a determinate nature ; the faculties are
innate ; " he who has an eye can see ; it is given to him," ac
cording to the Scriptures.            God has done for man what he did
for other animals, given him instinct, however he may be too
proud to allow it.       Education, indeed, is nevertheless necessary to
put the faculties in action.         That genius is born, is a trite truth ;
education never creates, it only cultivates and directs the faculties.
All faculties and moral feelings depend on organization.                      The
organ   of   language   is  a transverse    convolution      of  the  brain   very
distinct from the anterior lobes.             Every faculty has a peculiar
organization.        No feeling is learned by the understanding. Un
derstanding and order may exist without good feelings ; others
without great genius have good feelings ; hence the reason why
men appear weak in some particular and not in others.                       Some
persons    reason    better   and   feel  more    when    sleeping   than   when
awake ; this fact is explained by the circumstance of some fa
culty acting with more energy when alone than when all the
others are engaged.             For instance, we retire to quietude to
reflect ; we adopt some means or other to aid us in every un
dertaking.       Hence, animal magnetism.               We do not yet know
the vital power, nor the extent of the influence of mind on mat
ter.    All nature is regular. Animal magnetizers are ignorant
of nature ; they pretend to great knowledge, but have never dis
covered any thing; they know nothing new.                    But everyone has
 his gift.
    Led.     11.    The organs of all the faculties are situated to
gether    in   subservience    to tlieir mutual influence ; thus, the re
flecting     faculties  are   together ; the knowing ones together ;
 and the propensities, &c. in like manner.              The organs of know
 ing and reflecting are in the fore part of the head ; those of the
 propensities and sentiments in the upper and posterior part.
The faculties peculiar to man occupy a very small space ; those
 common to man and animals much larger, and some faculties
are more important than others.               It is very difficult to find pro
 per terms j those of affection, passion, memory, &c. are not

       on   Dis. Gall and Spurzheim's       Thysiognomonical          System. 53
    facts, they are only names of modes of the primitive faculties.
     In like manner quietness, temperance, &c. only mean the different
    degrees of activity in the faculty.      Passion is the highest degree of
    activity of any faculty ; a man devoted to music, painting, &c. 13
•
    passionatelv fond of those arts ; and so of all others.      Pleasure or
    the state of being pleased does not indicate the faculty or the
    activity of the faculty; it is therefore only a mode of activity.
    A religious man is pleased with religion, &e. a faculty unoccupied
    is displeased; hence men are displeased with every thing which
    does not engage their faculties, or, in the familiar phrase, for
    which they have no taste.         No faculty peculiar to man .can be
    angry; anger is only a mode of action, an affection of combative-
    ness ; anxiety, sorrow, &c. belong to cautiousness, and com
    passion to benevolence ; jealousy arises from covetiveness and
    self-love, from amativeness if relating to women, or from appro
    bation if disappointed in praise ; envy is jealousy uninfluenced
    by benevolence ; shame is a compound affection arising from
    self-love and approbation.         Attention is different in different
    animals ; every creature has its peculiar attention to some things.
     If faculty is active, then there is attention which only indicates            .,
    activity.    We cannot command attention to any thing at all
     times ; there is no faculty of attention, but an attention to every
    faculty.    Perception is the knowledge of an object carried to the
    brain, reflection reproducing this perception is memory; one
    remembers names, another forms, a third numbers, &e. there
    being different kinds of memory according to the particular in
    dividual. Men who reflect remember better than those who do
    not; this is occasioned by the mutual influence of the faculties.
     Perception is the first degree of activity, memory or remembrance
     the second ; difference between memory and remembrance, vie
    remember a fact without having memory sufficient to repeat all
     the circumstances ; many persons remember having learned a
     song, but cannot repeat it ; others know the name of any person
    or thing, yet cannot mention      it,  but they recollect some circum
    stance which proves their knowledge of the fact remembrance
                                                             ;
     belongs to the faculty of individuality memory to the percep
                                                    ;
     tion only.     Imagination belongs to the third or highest de
     gree of activity ;     there are only three degrees of activity,        al
    though Gall made four in each organ.             Internal propensities    in
     man are instinct in brutes.       Judgement        found
                                                        is       the highest
                                                                 in
     and lowest degree of activity     ;    a  good judgement often exists
     without good memory, and vke versa
             a                                      ;  hence it   is
                                                                  a mode of
    activity. The relation between the knowing faculties and ex
     ternal objects  is   judgement; every intellectual faculty has           a
    judgement    ;  but because the reflecting faculties are more active,
     we call him who judges
                          '       correctly,    aperson of good judgement.
                                      D3                              Hatred

54       Dr.   Spurzheim's      demonstrative Course        of Lectures
Hatred is a disagreeable affection of all the faculties ; revenge is
the activity of the vindictive passions, of combativeness without
benevolence, the presence of all the bad and absence of all the
good propensities.
    Led. 12. Those who wish to study this system, to know the
development of the organs, must consider every dimension ; look
at the forehead if high or broad, then in profile, and draw lines
from the ear to the eyes, top of the forehead and crown and
occiput; next divide the head into three divisions, which are
called the upper, middle, and lower regions. — Diversity i» the
development of the feelings common to men and to animals
according as there are diverse characters among men.            Some of
the five senses are more indispensable than others ; men can bear
being told that they are destitute of one talent cr another, but
none can patiently bear to be called stupid.            There are three
kinds of faculties with respect to their actions, or rather three
kinds of action; one assists men and animals, another is auxiliary
to those faculties, and the third or superior directs the whole.
Throughout nature all the superior laws govern the inferior;
hence the animal part of man, i.e. all the faculties common to men
and brutes, should be governed by those faculties peculiar to
man only. — Examination of human liberty and moral good and
evil.    " All faculties are given ;" this is the language of Scrip
ture : but, Does this truth lead to fatalism ? St. Augustin and
the Christian fathers all contend for            it,
                                              and deny that      has any

make him       amachine " Every one according to his talent

                                        ;

not therefore impelled to act.       Pleasure     not freedom when
                                                       is              :             a

as the understanding           active men are free, the more under
                                is
standing the more freedom.          Yet, having understanding         not       is

      or Drs. Gall and Spurzheim's Physiognomtinical System. 55
  aiid  the feelings. Animals are free, but man has moral liberty.
   Free from the inferior feelings you are the slave of the superior
  ones, as observed by St. Paul.         No religion makes man answer
  able for his inclinations but for his actions ; feelings are not ex
  cited by the will — we may desire to be vctv pious, very benevo
  lent, &c. but cannot create such feelings in ourselves by means
  of our will. The instruments on which the feelings act render
  man responsible ; hence, as libertv or freedom commences, so
  does moral good or evil.         Physical and moral evil exist, but
  whence the origin of evil ?        No tenable theory of this problem
  has yet been produced ; it is not from two creator*, it is not from
  freedom, — this cannot be the cause, as there is nothing in na
  ture bad : evil is not a substance, it is not the name of any
  thing, but the bad use of a faculty.         Neither is there any bad
  faculty, yet evil exists. Animals do the same things as men, yet
  they are not called evil.     Sin exists in man as the animal predo
  minates oyer the human.         Man is inclined to evil as the animal
  organs are much greater than the human ones; hence evil exists,
  has existed, and will exist.      It is the human or higher faculties
  only,  which   give laws;   the  virtues  are commanded, the vices
"
  prohibited ;   " thou shalt love the Lord;" " thou shalt not kill ;"
  one eommatids the higher faculties, the other prohibits the infe
  rior ones ; hence, we sometimes do by the impulse of the inferior
  feelings what we do not like, and what is condemned by the su
  perior ones.     Man sometimes does without law because the ani
  mal is small in him, his mind is his law ; hence we see that vir
  tue is possible ; but it is now impossible to abolish law, and
  therefore it is not to be abolished but fulfilled, till men be born
  again, till the reigu of love arrives, as they are now in general
  more governed by the animal than the human faculties.           Who is
  entitled to give laws ? he who has the superior feelings in the
  highest degree. What is the aim of our faculties ? many of them
  are given for our preservation and that of society ; neither is our
  aim all selfishness,    as many modem philosophers,        particularly
   Helvetius, pretend. Others attribute all to Christian charity : this
  is no less untenable ; some again reduce all our actions to faith.
  These are merely individual and not general opinions.          No ac
  tions are good by faith; there are several motives for our actions;
  men in general act from their feelings, very few by their will or
  understanding.      All our judgements of men are the result of
  moral feelings and not of the will ; it is the feeling which dis
  poses men to religion, as the greatest intellect is not necessarily
  the most devout.       Hence it may be determined whether this
  doctrine of physiognomy be dangerous to morality and religion in
  general, or whether it does not furnish new and convincing proofs
   of both being natural to man, We also see that it elucidates
                                      D 4                             the

the meaning of many parts of the Christian revelation, the sense
of which was nearly lost or very inadequately comprehended.
     Led. 13. With respect to the mutual influence of the fa
culties, the difference between the organs and the conditions
under which they act must be considered.            There are four con
siderations relative to mutual influence ; first, every faculty in
every individual is modified, not only in different individuals but
also in the same individual ; in like manner different parts of
different animals are modified in the five senses, and also in the
faculties of the mind ; habitivenes, constructiveness, destructive-
ness, &c. are modified in all animals ; some birds construct their
nests according to circumstances ; others have their singing-
 powers modified and different from those of the same species ;
 some tastes are peculiar ; various idiosyncrasies, &c.          The same
 diversity takes place in the mind.       Some comprehend or under
 stand matters when the facts are duly arranged ; in others the
 faculties themselves are modified.       Two mothers having equal
 affection for their children, but one having more destructiveness
 and less benevolence than the other, will treat them very differ
 ently.    Maternal love never acts alone ; if a mother, shows a par
 tiality for one child, it is not that she has no affection for the
 others, but because this favourite is the most congenial, the most
 similar to her own disposition.        Here size is not sufficient to
 determine the actions ; destructiveness however prominent is
 modified by benevolence, justice, veneration, &c. in various de
 grees.    Self-love is not in itself bad; in the man who esteems
 justice, feels benevolence and veneration, it is very good as it
 respects only those qualities either in self or others j but self-love
 without benevolence, the forehead low and little faith, venera
  tion, or justice, is very bad. We may thus discover whether jus
  tice be predominant or feeble in legislators.          Veneration alone
  without energy produces credulity and superstition, one who will
  worship any thing that is offered to him.           When veneration is
  prominent   and   the posterior parts  of the  head   projecting, it pro
  duces   more    than  piety, it makes   an   inquisitor, (the Professor
 exhibited a real portrait of one,) who will murder his fellow men
  for the glory of God ! A true Christian minister has the fore
  head very large, posterior very small.        The intellectual faculties
  are also modified; thus, among musicians one has a genius for
  poetical or ideal, martial, philosophical,       or tender music.      An
  author or writer with covetiveness is a plagiarist ; without bene
  volence forms a satirist, with benevolence it is not satirical.
  The faculty of language never acts alone ; it belongs first to na
  tions and then to individuals of a nation.         One nation has more
  feeling and peculiar ideas than another. Individuality is the first
  developed faculty j nouns and verbs are the first words used by
                                                                  children,

    on  Drs. Gall and SpurzJieim's Physiognonutnical System.            57
children, and Home Tooke reduces all words to these two classes.
The French language has no analogy, no comparison, no classi
fication ; Frenchmen's organ of individuality is most developed ;
they always begin a discourse with the fact, and never with the
cause; they say this or that happened without ever saying because
it was so or so ; there is no connection or chain of analogy and
causation in their discourses or minds.         All the faculties act in
conjunction and not alone.          This appears even in their abuses.
He who has covetiveness with veneration never steals in a church,
never commits sacrilege ; no, he observes, " it is not good to
steal in a church ;" another who has covetiveness with benevo
lence says, " it does harm to no one," and steals there.                We
may also distinguish the chief of a banditti by his pride and firm
ness, which he must possess in a high degree.              But no faculty
can be judged alone.        It is extremely difficult to judge ; all men
hitherto judge others according to their own associations ; in
 fact they judge themselves in others.       Even God is made, accord
ing   to their  own  feelings,  a warrior or a peace-maker.      This ap
pears even in the Scriptures ; St. Peter's God is fear, St. John's
 love. But we must henceforward judge men by the predominance
or remissness of the superior faculties, whether the faculties pe
culiar to the animal or those peculiar to the man have the as
 cendency.      Hence we have a measure, a standard of judging.
 Faculties may be excited by circumstances, and some are taught
 music as a trade, and not bv innate genius : yet Handel would have
 composed had none existed before him, and Zerah Colburn cal
 culates by some process not yet taught by men.             The world or
sphere of action is in relation to the quantity of active faculties ;
 he who has most active faculties has the greatest world.           Indul
gence must be extended to all persons for their contrariety of
opinions ; they cannot help it.         The doctrine of association of
 ideas has occasioned many erroneous conclusions.            As evil is not
a substance but an action, so likewise an association takes place,
but it is not a thing ; one propensity excites another, one senti
 ment another, and one intellectual faculty another ; seeing an
 object excites the faculty of language ; places excite the organ
of space, &c. Hence the basis of all mnemonics. Colour is always
present to Frenchmen. — Characters : — a modest man has benevo
lence, cautiousness, and little self-love ; a candid one, all the su
 perior feelings, and a roundish outline; a serious, grave with firm-       \
ness ; a   "   touchy character" has much self-love and approba
tion ; one who never bows, self-love, destructiveness, firmness ;
one who never pardons, vindictiveness,         distrustfulness, &c.      In
all languages there are more names for bad than good characters
in men. — Sympathy and antipathy; every faculty desires to be
satisfied, and so far as it is satisfied we like or dislike others.
                                                                      Some

 58      Dr. Spurzlieim's demonstrative Course of Lectures
 Some faculties are social, some antisocial; the former are human,
the latter brutal.    The selfish will not go with the selfish, nor
the proud with the proud ; no proud man likes pride, and hence
the origin of antipathy. The credulous, modest, or circumspect,
never love the selfish, extravagant, &c. Similarity or congeniar
lity is the basis of friendship. The more faculties a man has the
more happy he is ; but if these faculties cannot be gratified,
then he is in the same proportion miserable.
   Led. 14. The Professor now proceeded to unfold the second
part of his system, the external expression of the activity of the
faculties.   This has been called physiognomy, pathognomy, mi-
miekry, &c.       Dr. S. denominates it pathognomy or natural lan
guage.     Whenever any faculty is active it manifests itself by
external signs, called pathognomical.         Lavater admitted to the
number of 30 signs, every one of which formed a kind of ex
ception to the others ; but the laws of nature are certain and
have no exceptions.       Physiognomy is a very ancient study ; So
lomon's Proverbs contain examples of it. Pathognomy or natu
ral language manifests the internal activity of the faculties. Here
the Professor took a retrospect of the principles he had advanced,
described the connection between the spinal marrow and the
brain, and that the latter acts on the body by means of the
nerves. The five senses are influenced by or act on the external
world.     Whenever any propensity is active the necessary means
also enter into action, the five senses and voluntary motion ;
hence mimickry or pathognomy gives the proper attitude.           Na
ture always adopts the best and easiest mode, without any re
flection ; it is perfectly instinctive. — Examples of false attitudes
given to their statues by the ^neients.       Throughout all natme
the faculty is conformable to the action and the action to the fa
culty, and the motion or gesture is always in direction with the
peculiar organ or faculty in action, whether it be seated upwards,
downwards, or on the side. Attachment or friendship manifests
itself by inclining the body and shaking hands, &c. ; combative-
ness instinctively puts itself in an attitude of defence, contracting
the forward muscles, drawing in the arms, &c. ; destructiveness
when in action both in men and animals, opens the hands and
claws like grasping, shakes the head, &c. ; a man having se-
cretiveness wishes to conceal himself, knocks gently at the door,
walks on tiptoe, speaks low, and when departing contracts him
self ; cautiousness looks and listens on all sides, pauses, looks,
and listens again ; in approbation all is slight, delicate, atten
tive ; but self-love is stiff, reserved, careless, unbending, and the
reverse of approbation ; the reflecting faculties withdraw from
the external world, shut the eyes, become still, &c. When dif
ferent faculties are in action, all similar parts are also active.

   on  Drs. Gail and Spurzheim's Physiognomonical             System.   59
  It is very difficult   to make two different motions       at the same
 time. No one can restrain the external manifestations of hi»
 internal feelings ; a general concordance with the feeling like
 wise takes place in the voice, hands, &c. and voluntary motion. —
 Examples of deceit : when a person assures another of his friend
 ship with a voice and tone not in concord, the voice indicate*
 the feelings ; approbation is insinuating, self-love indifferent.—
 The different manifestations are also modified by the different si
 tuation of the organs ; adhesiveness or attachment inclines the
 head and to one side, as a mother to her child ; self-love holds
 the head up and backwards, in reading is erect, with difficulty
bows the head, and then it is only a nod ; the humble man bows
 lowly, your very humble servant ; approbation or vanity turns and
 smiles on both sides looking for attention; firmness stands up
steady ; veneration turns the eyes and hands upwards and for
 wards, this cannot be explained by the tradition of God being
above us, for he is every where ; neither by our position, for every
 twelve hours we are antipodes to ourselves, but by the sympathetic
influence of the act and the organ at the top of the head ; it is the
 faculty which gives the internal impulse.        In the reflecting facul
ties whenever we are puzzled to recollect'a name or circumstance,
we immediately ruh our eyes, within which is the organ of memory,
and never the top of the head ; when a man cannot comprehend
a thing he strikes his forehead exclaiming, " how stupid I am !"
Travellers put their finger on the organ of space. When an ar
tist looks at a facade he first considers the order and symmetry,
then the construction, and immediately turns his head from side
to side, as this organ is on both sides.       Sterne is represented with
his finger on the organ of wit. The essential character is similar
in all countries, and is only modified by nationality.          Characters
however are not to be pronounced from the action of one faculty
at one moment.         Mimickry orpathognomy may be permanent or
transitory.    Pathognomy is natural language, pantomime is arti
ficial ; thus washing the hands to indicate innocence or freedom
from guilt is pantomimic, it is a thing previously agreed on and u
artificial ; whereas pathognomy is natural and involuntary.         Artists
attend to grace and neglect truth. The study of physiognomy i*
difficult, as there are many signs and those compound to be un
derstood ; they are less numerous than the terms in botany and the
species of plants.      Neither is it so difficult when reduced to rule
as now attempted.         Physiognomy is accused ef cruelty to indivi
duals of adverse configurations ; but natural truth can never be
injurious or unjust.       He who knows man best is more indulgent
than he who knows him least. The deaf and dumb have the same
affections as others, and understand their characters as well.         Ex
press anger   or  pride,   and the deaf or dumb    will instantly feel and
                                                               understand

 €0       Dr. Spurzkeim's        demonstrative     Course  of Lectures
 understand it. Actors and artists should know this, to make the
imitation of what is desired. — Expressions of agreeable and dis
 agreeable; we inspire an agreeable smell, we expire a disagree
 able one, and so with all other senses and faculties.         All disagree
 able things contract the body.          Yes or No.     The former inclines
 the body forward, the latter reclines back and shakes it off.
    Led 15. The important subject of education now engaged
the Professor's attention.          The nature of man is determinate. —
 He may reduce all knowledge to two ideas; external circum
stances and education.          Savage or wild men are said to be ignorant
 because they have received no education, but it is because they
 are deficient in natural faculties.          The wild boy of Avignon is
still ignorant and silly. Idiots sometimes wander into the woods
 and become like savages feeding on vegetables, &c. It is want
 of talent and not education that occasions this state. But, edu
 cation is extremely important, although it is given.             Are we all
 of the same species ? Caribs and Negroes are different, yet in
them all the organs of the brain are found, and therefore they
 cannot be a different species.            In future, the nervous system
 must   be  the  basis  of  all classification; the nerves we find similar,
,aud accordingly some Negroes are mathematicians, &c. and con
sequently not of a different species. —All men in general similar;
 then how shall we perfect man ?             Nature is the same now as in
 ancient times ; we can neither take away nor give a faculty ; we
 can only cultivate one and suppress another, and by this means
 not only individuals but whole nations may be so far perfected.—
 It must be admitted that very little success has hitherto attended
 our efforts in education, notwithstanding what has been written
 on the subject.       The knowledge of man is still very backward,
 and consequently so is education ; the cause is obvious ; we have
 pursued an erroneous method.              We must begin where we now
 end.     How do we improve the species of animals ? by innate-,
 ness. It has long been deemed desirable to belong to certain fami
 lies where there are no hereditary diseases.           If there be heredi
 tary  diseases   then    there    must  be   hereditary organization, and
 therefore   innateness.      In  improving plants we consider the seed ;
 sow it in the same soil and nature furnishes genuses, one plant
 is very fine, another is indifferent ; we preserve the seed of the
 good and reject that of the bad.           Ingrafted trees are used to im
 prove   the  quality  of  the  fruit;  yet they ultimately degenerate and'
 die, as  the  stock  is unsound     on  which the graft was placed.      To
 improve wool, we begin by improving the breed and blood of the
 sheep, and not by changing their food ; here we begin with birth
 and race ; we should do the same with man.               The ancients were
 attentive to this in their marriages.            Moses speaks of sons of
  God and daughters of men ; Aristotle and Plato            '
                                                               observe it. —
                                                                       There

  on Drs.       Gall and Spurzheim's Physiognonionical System,                                    61
There     is,indeed, great difficulty in establishing other modes of
education, owing to external circumstances.               Nevertheless we
must expect the same effects, while the same causes exist.
Education        commonly but not correctly divided into physical
                    is
and moral we divide
                :            into, first, whatever contributes to greater
                                      it
energy  ;   and, secondly, whatever contributes to the direction of
the faculties.     The first      effected by innateness, by family or
                                                is
lineage ;   the second       physical education, commonly so called.
                                      is
All that contributes to improve the body, perfects the develop
ments of the mind (not mind itself)            all external circumstances
                                                                 ;
regulated according      to   the   real  nature   of man. Food       very                   is
important,     as in feeding   cows    we   perceive a great difference in
their milk      the flesh of sheep fed on mountainous districts
                ;                                                                                 is
better than that fed in valleys          now, Why may not similar ef

fects of food take place on the nervous system             This   properly    ?         is
what  is  called temperament, which gives energy.            Climate may
also have its effects. We find the fruits of warm climates are
more savoury than those of England, where they are cultivated
in hothouses which they cannot bear in warmer climates.               One
climate may suit the development of one faculty better than an
other ;   certain meats may have the same effects on the nerves,
and there       no reason why food should not be classed according
                is
to its effects, or be found to produce certain effects, the same as
drugs are classed according to their effects on the different parts
of the body in the diseased state, as stomachics, diuretics, emme-
                                           is is,
nagogues, &c.       There       however, some difficulty in fixing this
point our knowledge
      ;                        defective      yet external circumstances
                                                                 ;
are essential, as contributing mediately to improve the energy of
the mind.
   The third condition        exercise is  what         putting in action.
                                                             ;        it

The propensities and sentiments are never taught in schools, but
only exercise of the intellectual faculties. Yet           you continually     if
speak of music to a student, and at the same time withhold all
instruments from him, you will never make him                    musician.          a
Speak to       boy of hunger, but till you withhold from him food,
                a

                                                     ;
feel it.   Benevolence       more common among the poor than the
                                      is
rich, because the latter have this feeling less excited they have                   ;
lass opportunity of knowing and feeling misery.             Bad company
exercises the faculties and inferior propensities.           Veneration                           is
not taught in      gambling-house.
                         a                 Example      ever more impor   is
tant than all the precepts of education.           You cannot exercise all
the faculties at the same time.           Some faculties are late, others
early developed       some last during life, others diminish with
                             ;

 tue consists in governing the propensities or faculties when they
 we most active, and not when they become dormant.        Children
 soon develop benevolence, approbation,      cautiousness, indivi
   duality, eombativeness, and even destructiveness.            Veneration
   is generally later of being developed ; but some one faculty oc
   casionally appears at an early period.        There are other condi
   tions, such as the mutual influence of the faculties, as a mean
   of inducing their greater activity; the faculties may act from
-
   external impulse, but much oftencr from the mutual influence of
   the parts. Does exercise increase the dimensions ? It is possible
   and probable, as we know it improves agility. We occasionally
   see heads which we regret had not- been exercised in youth.
   The basis of all moral actions is submitting the animal to the
   human faculties; man governs, the animal executes.             Men ne
   ver act without motives, which are generally very different.           If
   actions cannot be produced by love, and the higher faculties,
   then the animal ones must be called in to their aid.          Will con
   sists of the faculties of individuality, perceiving and comparing ;
  lience a reflecting man has more will, as he anticipates things,
   and is therefore not the slave of motives.         His feelings furnish
   the motives, but his will has the direction of them, although not
   of his feelings. If in a youth benevolence be developed, use this
   faculty and not veneration, as exercise cannot take place before
   the organs be developed ; if approbation, you may exercise and
   modulate, but cannot extirpate it. Teachers and parents often
   put children in circumstances to exercise approbation at the
   very moment when they are speaking against it. Direct, but
   seek not to destroy the inferior faculties.      If mature persons are
   to be taught, use their most developed sentiments ; if benevo
  lence use    it,  veneration, religion, &c. to enable them always
                     if
  to direct and govern the animal faculties, keeping them subor
   dinate to those of the man. There are a few individuals who may
  be called elect naturally
                     ;        it   isvery difficult for them to do much
  evil, as they have all the human faculties, and very few of the
  animal ones   ;  such persons are, as St. Paul says, the slaves of
  righteousness, they are a law to themselves, and are elect.
   Children often have great combats between the animal and the
  man ;    and even where the animal prevails, yet noble actions
  sometimes appear.       Some children can never lie prevented from

who reflects will always be a better tradesman than he who acts
by imitation and habit ; all men should be taught to think. Pro

culiar organs, but a philosophical judgement does not. Edu
 cation on these principles would diminish crimes, but not make
 men angels ; for this they must be born again.            In the actual
 state of man it is impossible to prevent errors entirely.          Here
the Professor exhibited six skulls of Germans, six of Frenchmen,
 and six casts of Egyptian mummies, Caribs and Calmucs, all of
'Which were dissimilar ; hence the impossibility of determining
pational character from such skulls ; nor has Dr. S. ever seen six
 skulls of one nation in any of the cabinets of those naturalists
 who pretend that the native country of any subject may be dis
 covered by the figure of the skull.         In general, however, there
 is a national configuration.

Jan. 12.   The President      in the chain — The conclusion was read
of Mr.Travers's elaborate and ingenious paper on the mechanism
of the eye, and the means by which this organ obtains distinct
vision of obiects at different distances.       In concluding, he took
a summary view of the principal hypotheses formed to explain
this phenomenon, such as the muscles of the eye, the ciliary
processes,    aud the supposed muscles of the lens itself, by which
it was capable of receiving distinct images of objects at different
distances.      All these opinions Mr. T. showed were totally in*
compatible     with   the facts demonstrated by anatomy ; he also
proved    that  the  supposed influence of the will over the muscles
of the eye, impelling them to contract or dilate at pleasure,
 can have no better foundation, as the mechanical action of
light on the eye produced this effect without any regard and
often even in direct opposition to the will, and is attended with
a painful sensation in the eye : besides, this supposition assigns
two causes for one effect, which is unphilosophical          as well as
contrary     to  physical experience.       Mr. T. then described the
anatomical structure of the eye, observed the muscular appear
ance of the iris (Berzelius in his Animal Chemistry considered
this organ as muscular), inferred that there is a sphincter mus
 cle, and that this muscle produces an external pressure on the
lens, which' alters its shape, and thus effects distinct vision by
 adjusting the pupil to different foci. The contraction or dilata
 tion he considered as being always in proportion to the quantity
 of light reflected from external objects, and not according to
 the will of the observer.      The crystalline lens, being more fluid
 in youth than in old age, sufficiently accounts for the diversity
 of vision in those stages of human life. As the nearer objects
 are to the eye, the more they reflect light on       it,and hence the
 painful   sensationis   occasioned by continued looking in this       si
  tuation.

            A    letter from Dr. Brewster to the President was read,
  containing an account of some more experiments,               by

 fatigable philosopher, on the effects of compressing animal sub
  stances which depolarize light.       The principal experiment was
  on calf's foot jelly cut into      columnar form and compressed
                                       a
 between two plates of glass       :at first no depolarization of light
  took placej     but after the jelly had remained ten days between
  the glasses, and acquired   a   consistency almost approaching that
  of caoutchouc, the edges evinced the commencement of depola
  rization; and when the whole mass had attained           uniform den-

  quired   the property   of depolarizing light in every direction, like
  other objects before operated on by the author.
      A letter from Dr. Storer was read, describing the nature and
  circumstances of a spring of fresh water discovered in the har
  bour of Bridlington, Yorkshire, a few years ago, when boring
  in order to ascertain the practicability of making some improve
  ments in the harbour.        The tide here flows to the height of
  fourteen feet, and the boring was commenced near the low>
  water mark ; the soil is a stiff blue clay, and when the auger
  had passed through about twenty-eight feet, it struck on a very
  hard rock, and the operation was discontinued.            At first theTe
  was no appearance of water ; but after a few hours fine fresh
  water began to rise, and rose so rapidly that it flowed over the
  side of the works raised for the experiment.           As Bridlington
  was not well supplied with water, a tube was inserted in the
   bore, the parts around it covered over, and the conveyance
  made for the water to run into reservoirs when the tide flowed.
  This spring has now continued to flow with the tide some years,
  and supply the town with good fresh water ; when the tide ebbs
  it ceases to flow, and as the tide rises so does the water in the
  spring. In summer many of the wells in the neighbourhood are
   dry, but this remains permanent.          When great floods occur in
   consequence of the rains at the end of autumn, the water of
  this well rises higher ; which is the only change that it experi
   ences.     The explanation of this appearance offered by Mr.
   Milne, the architect of the works, is, that the whole bay ex
   tending to a considerable distance is covered with the same stra
   tum of blue clay which ultimately terminates in the sea on the
   rock which runs under the spring, and that the rise or flow of
   the water in the well is occasioned by the superior gravity and
   pressure of the tide, acting like as the two arms of a syphon
" charged with       two fluids of different specific gravities.       Dr.
: Storer admits this explanation as generally satisfactory ; but ob
   serves that, according to this theory, the well instead of flowing
   higher during floods should not rise so high, as there must be a
   greater quantity of fresh to resist the action of the salt water.
       The Doctor's objection seems founded on the notion that the
   increased quantity of fresh water should also increase its spe
   cific gravity ; but it is the volume only which is increased, and
    hence an increased flow from the well.

    Signor Zamboni presented to the Society an instrument of his
own construction, being an attempt to exhibit a perpetual mo
tion.      The principle on which it acts has been known in this
country several years.         It merely consists of two of De Luc's
electrical columns or galvanic piles, placed perpendicularly at
the distance of about six inches, and each glass tube is sur
mounted with a brass ball; between these pillars a steel needle is
placed to move on an axis; the longer arm of this needle touches
the upper end or ball of each pile, and receives from it a suffi
cient repellent force to drive it to the adjacent ball, and vice
versa : in this manner the motion is continued.               No apparatus
to measure time has yet been connected with this simple mo
tion, which is protected from the atmosphere by a glass frame.

EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM M. VAN MONS TO MR. TlLLOCH*.
 Sir, — "    You      are probably acquainted       with  the new discove
ries made      at Milan, by Messrs. Moscati and Maury, relative to
the sun,     its diurnal or rotatory motion, its volcanos, &c.              I
send you     a translation of the report published on this head ; I
also send    you a note to what I have said on the metallo-fiuores,
and another on my new theory, which is that of caloric consi
dered as a constituent part of all bodies containing oxygen, dis
placed in the combinations        and displacing itself in the decombi-
nations.      Afterwards I admit hydrogen reduced into its ga« into
all the combustible bodies, and into the metals, and sub-satu
rated in all bodies which can, in their quality of bases, contract
combinations.        Hydrogen gas is a simple body ; oxygen gas is
composed of equal parts of oxygen and of caloric : the primi
tive material of the globe, and without doubt the substance of
the other planets, also consists of equal parts of oxygen and hy
drogen, without the least quantity of caloric, which would break
this relation : water is oxygen gas displaced in the ratio of -f-
from its caloric by two of hydrogen, and there result in this
way 15 parts of oxygen, 13 of caloric, and 2 of hydrogen. The

      Much valuable scientific information    from various parts of Europe
will tic found in this communication ; and we are happy to be able to state,

  metals compose the primitive matter of the globe, ^ith more or
  less hydrogen, and still without the least portion of caloric. The
  acidifiable combustibles are dry acids and hydrogen ; the salifiable
  combustibles, or metallo-fluores, are an acid and the metals; the
  acidifiable burners (comlurans) are dry acids and oxygen ; the
  common acids are dry acids and water ; and the dry acids them
  selves are peculiar combustibles in which the hydrogen is satu
   rated by at least double the quantity of oxygen that it is in
  water ; which may combine with all the other bodies, but which
   cannot be put out of combination. All the other bodies are com
   pounded of the latter.      Water is decomposable by luminous ca
   loric only ; and when it oxidates bodies, it puts itself in the place
   of the equivalent of its contents in hvdrogen, in the same way
   as, when hydrogen reduces bodies, it puts itself in the place of
   the water.      I embrace the whole domain of chemistry in this
   manner : Will you have the goodness to submit my ideas to the
   penetration of men of science in ycur country ?
       " M. Dobereiner, of Jena, not Having found any soda which
    contained iodine, sought for this substance in sea water ; where
    he found it.     The intactile powder is iodate hyperoxygenated by
    ammonia, as detonating oil is muriate hyperoxygenated with the
    same alkali.     The iodate of ammonia may be formed by simple
    oxygenation,    whereas-  the muriate of ammonia requires to be
    hyperoxygenated.
        " You will be soon made acquainted with an experiment in
    which muriate of ammonia, obtained by the combination of its
    gaseous elements, deposited all the water from its acid, taking up
    in its stead muriate of mercury and oxydule. This fact is deci
    sive for the existence of oxygen in chlorine, and triumphant for
    Mr. Murray.
        "  You will also find that the Prussic acid gas, and water and

              ACCOUNT OF SOME ELECTRICAL PHENOMENA
     Recently communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
      In the year 1767, M. de Saussure, M. Pictet, and M. Jalabert
  ascended to Mount Breven, which is situated nearly in the mid
  dle of the valley of Chamouni, and almost exactly opposite to
  Mount Blanc. Their object was to take a general view of the
  form and position of the glaciers which descend from Mount
  Blanc. When they reached the summit, M. Jalabert began to
  take a drawing of the glaciers, M. Pictet was engaged in the
  geographical part, and M. de Saussure was preparing to make
  his experiments on natural and artificial electricity.          When M.
  Pictet was laying down upon his plan some particular mountains
  by means of a graphometer, he had occasion to ask the names
  of them from the guides, and was therefore obliged to point out
  the individual mountains with his finger.           Every time that he
  raised his hand for that purpose, he felt at the extremity of his
  finger a kind of tremulous and prickly sensation, similar to that
  which is experienced upon presenting the linger to a globe of
  glass highly eleetrified.      M. Pictet soon perceived the origin of
  this phenomenon.       He observed a stormy cloud in the middle re
  gion of Mount Blanc, directly opposite to Mount Breven, mid it
  instantly occurred to him that he had been affected with the
(
  electricity of the cloud. He then requested MM. de Saussure and
  Jalabert to make the same experiment ; and as soon as they ex
  tended their hands, they experienced the same sensation, which
  they described as resembling a number of small electric sparks ;
  but fearing that they might be seduced by their imagination, they
  made their guides and their servants stretch out their hand, and
  they felt the same sensation.      The electricity of the atmosphere
  having   now  begun   to increase,   the sensation became stronger,

and was even accompanied with a kind of whistling noise.         M.
Jalabert, who had a gold band upon his hat, was alarmed with
a buzzing noise about his head ; and having taken off his hat,
and put it successively upon the heads of Pictet and Saussure,
they heard distinctly the same sound, and even obtained sparks
  rom the golden button of the hat. The thunder cloud had now
moved across the valley, and was directly above their heads. The
thunder was loud, and the flashes of lightning so frequent, that
the travellers found it prudent to descend about twenty or thirty-
yards, where no electricity could be perceived.         The guides,
ho'wever,   were   so much  delighted with  the experiments, that it
was with great difficulty they were persuaded to abandon such a
dangerous amusement.        A shower of rain soon afterwards fell,
and the storm ceased. The travellers re-ascended to the summit;
 and although they elevated an electrical kite, they were unable
to perceive any indications of electricity in the atmosphere.
    Electrical phenomena, much similar to the above, were very
 recently observed by a party of Englishmen,        when they were
descending Mount /Etna during a storm of thunder and light
ning.     The following particulars were communicated by Mr.
 Gillies, surgeon, who not only read an account of the phenomena
in a journal entitled Specchio della scienza e Giornale Tuncyclo-
pedica de Sicilia, which was published in July 1814, but received
an account of them from Mr. Tupper, one of the party, coin
 ciding in every respect with that which was given in the Sicilian
 journal.    On the 2d of June, Mr. Tupper and Mr. Lanfiar, ac
 companied by a guide, ascended Mount iEtna. — During their
 descent, when at a little distance from the place called the
 English House, in the regio deseria, they were overtaken by a
 storm of thunder and lightning, accompanied with a heavy fall
 of snow ; and while running over an extensive field of snow,
 they were struck by a flash of lightning, from which, however,
they experienced no serious injury.       Mr. Tupper felt a painful
 sensation in his back, which gradually ascended towards his
head, and occasioned a sensation as if his hair was moving,
 an effect exactly similar to that which is. produced either when
 a person is electrified upon an insulated support, or when his
 head is presented to a prime conductor of an electrifying ma
 chine.    This sensation induced Mr. Tupper to raise his hand to
 his head, upon which he was surprised to hear a buzzing noise
 proceeding from his finger.       Upon raising and extending his
 arm the noise still continued ; but upon moving his hand and
 fingers in different directions, and with different degrees of ve
 locity, he found that he could produce, at 'pleasure, a great va
 riety of harmonic sounds, differing in their tone as' well as in
                                                               their

 their intensity, and so loud as that they could be distinctly heard
 zX the distance of forty feet.  The Sicilian guide witnessed these
 phenomena with extreme dismay; and imagining that Mr.
                                                         >
 Tupper produced the sounds in virtue of some supernatural
power, he immediately began to cross himself, and invoked the
protection of his saint.     His alarm, however, speedily subsided,
 when> upon being desired to elevate his own arm, he found it as
musical as that of Mr. Tupper.        Mr. Lanfiar, who was a little
behind the rest of the party, now joined them, and found that
his fingers possessed a similar property.       In the course of five
minutes, reckoning we presume from the arrival of Mr. Lanfiar,
their fmgers lost their acoustic property, the cloud having by
this time passed to a considerable distance.      Mr. Tupper had re
ceived an injury in his left shoulder joint by a fall from his horse ;
but he never experienced any return of the pain after the copious
electrization which he received on Mount /Etna. .
   The preceding phenomena admit of a ready explanation, upon
the simplest principles of electricity.      As snow is a conductor
next in order to water, and verv little inferior to it in its power of
transmitting electricity, it is quite obvious that the bodies of the
travellers were not overcharged with the electric fluid in conse
quence of any difficulty which it experienced on passing into the
earth. Their fingers therefore acted like so many points in draw
ing electricity from an atmosphere highly charged, just in the
same manner as when the hand or the head is presented to an
electrified prime conductor.      The variety in the character, as
well as in the intensity, of the sounds which were produced at the
 points of their fingers, arose from the different velocities of their
fingers, and may be readily imitated by any other species of sound.
The buzzing noise which M. Jalabert heard round his head had
a different origin, having been produced by the discharge of the
electric matter which had been accumulated in the gold band,
and which found a readier escape into the atmosphere by the
numerous points of gold thread, than by the imperfect conduct
ing power of the hat which it encircled.
     SOCIETY FOR PREVENTING         ACCIDENTS IN COAL-MINES.
   A society under the    above  denomination was established in
Sunderland in 1813, which has for its objects to ascertain with
 more precision than has hitherto been effected, the causes of
those explosions which so frequently occur in coal mines, pro
ducing extensive and deplorable calamities; and the measures
which may be best calculated to prevent them.
   The first Report of the Society was published a few weeks ago.
 The Committee state with regret,      " that hitherto no suggestion
                                E4                                has

has pointed out any adequate mode of destroying, or of pre
venting the generation of, the inflammable gas ; or of so com
pletely ventilating the pits, as to secure them from its dreadful
effects.  They are not, therefore, in possession of sufficient in
formation, fully and exactly to specify all the circumstances
which are necessary to be attended to, in promoting the disco
very of any general measures of correction for the evils lamented :
and they are compelled to add, that they must look to a more
extensive support than they have hitherto received, to enable
them to hold out such encouragement to scientific and practical
men, as may stimulate their attention to the subject : for, not
withstanding the general approbation which their designs have
obtained, and the liberal subscription which they have received
from the noble and respectable individuals who have counte
nanced the Society, their funds do not yet impower them to
offer a premium, suitable to the object, for th«*best production
that may be procured.      They still, however,- flatter themselves,
that as their proceedings shall be further disclosed, they will
obtain a more ample support, which may give' effect to their
views."  .                                 \
   The Committee              published in their Report a valuable
                            have
communication made to the Society by Mr. Buddie, a gentle
man of great celebrity and intelligence as a viewer of coal mines,
detailing the means adopted in some extensive collieries under
his inspection.
   The only method at present followed to prevent accidents by
explosion is by ventilation of the several passages and workings
of the mine — that         is,
                        a mechanical application of the atmospheric
air to remove or sweep away the inflammable gas as                   ge  it   is
nerated in the workings, or as         issues from the several fissures
                                           it
which the workings intersect in their progress. To assist in
this operation     furnace

horizontal   hot cylinder fixed in a furnace of brick-work on the
surface.   The cylinder (any old one of            steam engine) being
                                                       a

of the mine       inregular

end of  it    made to communicate

that hydrogen gas is never inflamed at hot iron. Another mean
resorted to for ventilation is an air-pump on a large scale,
wrought by a steam engine.        It is made of three-inch plank,
with a piston five feet square: the stroke is eight feet long; and
the suction pipe and valves about one-third of the area of the
piston.     At twenty strokes per minute it will draw 8000 cubic
feet or 778 hogsheads of air in that time; but allowing a waste
of one-fourth it will draw 584 hogsheads per minute.
     Mr. Buddie's paper is accompanied with ten engravings illus
trating the apparatus, and the methods employed to direct the
 course of the current of air in the workings, which may be com
 pared to alleys crossing each other at right angles.       By a ju
 dicious arrangement some of these are closed at particular in
 tersections, while others are kept open.     We cannot doubt that
 this communication will prove of great service to mine viewers.
 It is written with great perspicuity, and by means of the en
 gravings is rendered very intelligible.
     We cannot close this notice without an expression of regret
 that there should be any want of friends to enable the Society to
 prosecute with desirable efficacy the great object of their asso
 ciation.    We confess that we are surprised at the fact, when we
  consider how many rich individuals there are who are so deeply
  interested in the result of the Society's labours — not in Sunder
 land only but in other counties.     Let us hope that ample means
 will soon be provided, and that the publicity which the Society
  gives to its labours will be a mean of turning the attention of
  men of science to a subject of so much importance.
                        STATE OF MEDICINE IN CHINA.
  M. Page, a physician of Orleans in France, has published a
work on this subject.   The following short account of the
Chinese medical practice will probably amuse some of our
 readers :
      " The   Chinese employ emetics and purgatives, but very rarely             ;
 clysters are almost never used, because they regard them as too
 European, but they make a free use of cordials.   The importa
 tion of opium is prohibited under pain of death.
      The Chinese in the treatment of the itch and eruptive dis
      (i.
 eases employ camphor and cinnabar also, with sulphur dissolved
 in woman's milk.    They make use of boras in inflammations of
 the throat   ;   reduced into powder, and blown upon the dis

 missionaries.

   " Like most Indian nations, they make a free use of aphro
disiacs, baths and mineral Waters.     They have springs saturated
with alum and iron, but the greater number contain sulphnr.
Their physicians are not able to analyse them.         Chemistry as
well as natural history is in its infancy in China.    But the Chi
nese have the good fortune to possess a species of mesmerism or
animal magnetism, as practised by certain sects of illuminati in
Germany.     The Chinese literati strive to put down this sect by
ridicule; but they nevertheless find proselytes daily, to what
they are pleased to call the science of sciences.
   " The Chinese are not acquainted with the making of bread,
for which they substitute boiled rice or maize : their wine is a
strong liquor extracted from honey or fermented rice.      They do
not drink either coffee or chocolate  — they have delicious melor.s,
the species of which is unknown to us, some very delicate kinds
of small onions, and sever;ii delicious plants ; but they have no
olives, strawberries, gooseberries, or potatoes.
   " The diseases of stone and gravel are wholly unknown to the
Chinese — in consequence, as they tell us, of the great quantity
of tea which they drink *.
                               TANNIN.
   M. Pelletier has published in the Annales de Chimie some ob
servations with a view to show the imperfect state of our know
ledge of this substance and its combinations with gallic acid.
The various kinds of tannin which have been successively pro
duced from various processes, are different in the greater part of
their properties : they have nothing indeed in common, but
the property of several animal substances, and forming with
them insoluble combinations which are not susceptible of pu
trefaction, and have also the power of precipitating in a manner
nearly similar even metallic solutions ; but they are different in
their taste, colour, solubility in water, &c.      Pure tannin does
not exist : the properties which are attributed to      it,
                                                       and        by
                                                              which
itis characterized, belong  to several combinations which vegetable
substances form. Why then, asks M. Pelletier, shall we continue
to consider this as a distinct principle       ?         -
   Is  itbecause it precipitates several metallic oxides from their
solution    ? Almost all vegetable extracts have the same propertv,

and we know that these extracts are at least triple combinations
of acid, the colouring substance, and of vegeto- animal matter,
because the precipitates which form the tannin matter in those
soluti ius are constancy coloured and sometimes very brilliant. But
if we reflect that gallic acid always accompanies tannin, and that
the colours of the precipitates furnished by the tanning matter,
and the metallic solutions, are the same with those manifested
by the addition of the gallic acid, and the same metallic solu
tions ; may we not conclude with M. Thenard, that the colour-
in!;' of these precipitates is owing to the gallic acid, from which
we can never entirely separate tannin?          or is it the property
which tannin has of combining with animal matter and pre
serving it from putridity ? A multiplicity of combinations of
vegetable matter also possess this property ; and without men
tioning the astringent matter formed by the action of mineral
acids on charcoal and several vegetable substances, or the ex
periments of M. Chevreul on hemai'me (which acquired this
property) and who disbelieves the existence of tannin ? I shall
mention some facts to prove that gallic acid can combine with
several vegetable substances, and thus acquire the properties of
tannin.      If we put a solution of pure gelatine in gallic acid, no
precipitate is formed : this acid does not produce any turbidness
in the gummy solutions, but they cannot be resolved without im
 mediately becoming turbid in white flakes which are soon pre
 cipitated.     Among the pharmaceutical extracts there is a great
 number which do not contain the astringent principle, and
 which form no precipitate in the solution of gelatine ; but by
 the addition of gallic acid they acquire this property.     The same
 phenomenon       does not take place  with the  other vegetable acids,
 which on the contrary seem to oppose themselves to the preci
 pitation of gelatine.
     We know that pure gallic acid forms no precipitate in a so
 lution of sulphate of iron at the maximum, but it there becomes
 a beautiful deep-blue colour.      Infusion of nut-galls produces, on
 the contrary, a precipitate which is attributed to tannin; but gallic
 acid of itself acquires the property of partly precipitating the
 iron from this solution when it is combined with extractive
 matter : most of the vegetable infusions unite with gallic acid
 and gelatine, the same as the extractive substances, for which
 we can assign no reason.       The pheenomenon is very perceptible
 with the cold infusion of saffron : the properties of these pre
 cipitates cannot be absolutely identical ; they must differ ac
 cording to the nature of the substances which enter into each
 combination: that formed by gum arable, gelatine and gallic
 acid is the only one which I have hitherto been able to examine:
 it differs from the ethers by its extreme adherence to water, with
                                                                 which

 which it assumes an oleaginous form, and partly passes through
the paper filter. This combination, it appears, may exist in different
proportions, which I have not been able yet to determine ; ex
cept that it does not putrefy: whereas in the others, a fetid
smell arises in a few days, and much later than if the gelatine
was pure.        The combinations of the gallic acid with gelatine
and extractive matter unite less freely with water, and resemble
much the precipitates formed by the infusion of nut-galls in the
gelatinous solution.
                          A CAPTION TO CHEMISTS.
    M. Schartnger, an eminent chemist of Vienna, died lately,
from the fatal effects of a chemical experiment.             While preparing
the prussic acid (acidum borassicum) and the most powerful
poison known, he spilled a considerable quantity on his naked
arm, and died in a few hours in great agonies.
                                   VERDIGRIS.
 .
    Senor Orpila has found that great quantities of dry sugar taken
into the stomach of a patient who had recently swallowed ver
digris, or eaten food prepared in untinned copper vessels, have
proved an immediate and effectual antidote to the cupreous poi
son.    In cases where the poison has remained so long in the
stomach as to produce inflammation, the usual remedies for the
latter must be conjoined with the sugar.
                              DETONATING OIL.
   The original       discovery of this substance, which has been
claimed by M. Dulong, and actually discovered by Davy, appears
to belong to M. Van Mons of Brussels.                     This distinguished
chemist, whose discoveries have often been appropriated                       by
others, observed in 1793 the combination of ammonia with)
oxygenated muriatic acid.             Nineteen years before the experii-
ments of Dulong or Davy, he announced his discovery to Gren,
in the following terms, dated Messidor, An 4 (1796) : " I have
succeeded in combining ammonia with oxymuriatic acid without
any decomposition whatever of these two bodies.                  This new salt
detonates at a certain degree of heat, whether in the open air,
under water, or under other liquids by which it is not decom
posed*."       The same facts were stated in Dandolo's Italian
translation of Van Mons's Chemical Philosophy, " II muriato

    During the period comprehended in the       above observations,  a
 remarkable changeableness characterized the weather ; the sud
 den vicissitude of frost and rain, cold and warmth ; all some
 times occurring within the twenty-four hours, afforded a striking
 specimen of the changeableness of our climate.
    Not having had an opportunity of daily noting down the
 weather myself, I give instead the above journal, made by a re

 XVII.    Observations on ike Geology of Northumberland and

     tion of the Strata, with a Sketch of the physical Structure of
    that Part of England, from the German Ocean to the Irish

                            To  Mr. Tillock.
 Sir,— r promised        to   send   you some   observations   oh   the
geology of the north-eastern part of England, which various cir
 cumstances    have  prevented    me from  performing, and the fol
lowing account       may now      perhaps be considered superfluous
 Dr. Thomson having recently published what he denominates
 A geognostical Sketch of the Counties of Northumberland and
 Durham.       Such, however, is the imperfect state of our informa
 tion on various subjects of geological inquiry in our island, that
 it cannot be deemed presumptuous in any one to suppose that
 he may add something to what was before known ; and 1 trust
 the present letter will not be construed into an attempt to
 disparage or undervalue the obsertations of those who have pre
ceded me : — nothing can be more remote from my intention.
 In proportion to the increase of observers will be the probability
 of attaining certainty, in our conclusions.    In a letter I received
from Dr. Watson, the venerable Bishop of Llandaff, on the pub
lication of my Introduction to Geology in 1813, this sentiment
 is so clearly stated, and is so applicable to the present subject,
 that I shall be excused for transcribing it.
    " The surface of the globe consists of three parts water and
but one of eprfh, yet the accurate delineation of the one part
would occupy the labours of all the philosophers in Europe for
fifty years.    Nothing less than such a delineation can ascertain
the connections, interruptions, and mutual dependencies of the
several strata which compose its surface.        Some are apt to in
quire, What is the use of such investigations ? I esteem these
men to be as simple in their notions as the academic youths,
who being puzzled in attempting to pass the Ass's bridge in
Euclid, ask, Where is the use of going over it ? For my own
part, I am so confident of the utility that would attend an accu
rate knowledge of the stratification of this island, that I think
a work of this kind ought to be undertaken at the public ex
pense.     The beds and veins of metallic ores, and the beds of
coal, limestone, marble, slate, &c. are of such high importance
in the present state of society, that every encouragement should
be given to the discovering of them where they are not at present
known ; and nothing can more contribute to this end, than an
accurate knowledge of the manner in which the strata appear to

    I visited the coal districts of Northumberland and Durham in
the summer of 1813, and had frequent communications with
several of the most intelligent coal proprietors and agents, and
with gentlemen who were interested in geological inquiries.
Much has been already done to elucidate the geology of part of
these districts by Mr. Westgarth Forster, whose section of the
strata taken in great part from actual admeasurement comprises
the coal districts on the eastern and middle parts, and the metalli
ferous limestone districts on the west, an extent of forty miles,
and an actual depth of nearly 1400 yards.            This section, per
haps the most important and extensive that has ever been made,
was taken by a person educated as a practical miner, who had
spent the early part of his life in that district ; as such I consider
it particularly valuable. It was published in 1809. I am a lit
tle surprised it has escaped Dr. Thomson's notice when describ
ing the geology of Northumberland and Durham. If the present
paper have no other merit than that of making Mr. Forster's
section 'more generally known, it will render an acceptable ser
vice to English geologists, and do some justice to a person
whose labours have not been sufficiently appretiated.
    The mineralogical district to which the present observations
relate, is bounded by the river Tees and the Cleveland Hills on
the south, by the German Ocean on the east, by the porphyry and
amygdaloid of the Cheviot Hills on the north, and by the mountain
of slate porphyry, gray-wacke, and sienite of Cumberland, on the
west. The general arrangement of the strata in Northumberland
and Durham is such as prevails on the eastern side of England,
as represented in the map prefixed to my Introduction to Geo
logy, namely, the upper calcareous strata with magnesian lime
stone on the east, the strata containing coal range through the
middle part, and the metalliferous limestone districts rise to the
west.      The strata on this side of England generally dip towards
the east, and rise gradually towards the west or south-west, when
the descent becomes abrupt; which is also the case in Yorkshire,
 Derbyshire, and the north part of Staffordshire.         We may con
 sider this district as divided into three parts, consisting, 1st, of
 calcareous strata with magnesian limestone ; 2dly, of the coal
strata ; and 3dly, of the lower metalliferous strata.
    The first, or magnesian limestone district, on the east, was not
 described or msasured by Mr. W. Forster, as it contains neither
 metallic ores nor coal *.       It presents, however, many features
 particularly interesting to the mineralogist, of which I shall en-
    * This mast  be taken with some Uiaitalioo, as we shall presently have
 to observe.
                                                                 deavour

                    of Northimlerland               and Durham.       83
deavour   to give   brief account from my «wn observations.
                    a                                                  It
may be proper      to remark     previously,  that the  strata  in these
counties are frequently broken and deranged by numerous nearly
perpendicular walls or dvkes both of clay and whin-stone (basalt)
of vast extent ; besides which, numerous blocks of whin-stone, of
a different kind from any which these dykes furnish, are scat
tered over the surface of the country.
   The calcareous strata and magnesian lime, which for the sake
of conciseness I will denominate the Sunderland limestone, (be
ing there most extensively quarried,) is lost on the south-east
under the alluvial ground of the river Tees, and cut off in that
direction by the lofty range of the Cleveland Hills : but the same
formation makes its appearance on the south-western side of these
hills, and is continued through Yorkshire into Nottinghamshire
and Derbyshire and through the south-eastern counties.               The
chalk and roestone, which are the upper series of these strata in
other situations, are stripped off, if they have ever covered the
magnesian limestone of Northumberland and Durham.
   The Sunderland limestone formation extends along the coast
north of the Tyne, bui not in a continued line. The whole thick
ness of this limestone has not been measured ; nor would it be
easy to acertain        as some of the rocks are very indistinctly
                        it,
stratified.    Ithink    cannot be less than one hundred and fifty
                          it
yards.     Two hills on the west of Sunderland, containing nu
merous marine organic remains,           am inclined to consider as of
                                            I
subsequent    formation.
   On the banks of the Wear, about two miles west of the Iron
Bridge, the lower beds of the Sunderland limestone are very ex
tensively quarried to the depth of at least one hundred and thirty
feet from the surface         :  here most distinctly stratified, rising
                                  it   is
in large tables and slabs well suited for building stone, being
compact and extremely durable.            In one instance, and in one
only   thatI  could  hear  of,  have  any organic remains been found
in the limestone of this quarry. The perfect impression of the
head and vertebre of -a flat fish about seven inches in length, was
discovered in dividing       slab of this stone
                               a                   one side of the im
                                                         :

                               J.
quarry.   I   am more inclined to believe that the rare occurrence
 of organic remains in these rocks           to be attributed to some
                                                    is
process of nature         by
                          which they have been obliterated, than to
 conclude that they never were imbedded in them.
    Near the quarry      have just mentioned, an attempt was lately
                         I
 made     by Mr. Goodchild to search for coal                by
                                                        boring through
 the limestone.      Itwas attended with much expense, but with

84                  Observations on the Geology
complete success.       After perforating the whole of the subjacent
limestone rock, they bored through a lower bed, which Mr. G.
described to me as a dark-coloured argillaceous shale with oc
casional hard stones which he considered as loose whinstones.
I have unfortunately mislaid the note lespecting the absolute
depth of this bed given me by Mr. G., but 1 think it was not
less than 130 yards, and the whole depth of the upper good
workable coal not less than 260 yards. At a greater depth under
this was another valuable coal bed.         I mention this fact, as it is
of some geological importance, and        is,
                                           I   believe, the only instance
in the district of coal having been actually found        by
                                                           boring through
the magnesian limestone. Some of the mining agents at Newcastle,
who were unacquainted with the above circumstance, gave me
their decided opinion that the coal cropped out, or was cut off
 by dykes, before  it  reached the limestone of Sunderland.            may It
perhaps deserve future inquiry, whether this thick bed of shale
above mentioned be not        a continuation of the aluminous schistus
 from the Cleveland Hills on the south.
    The limestone of Building Hill near Sunderland and at Fulwell
is particularly deserving notice, frorri the remarkable configura
 tions which  it  presents.
    The beds at the former place are of considerable thickness the          :
limestone    is imperfectly crystalline,   is of    yellowish-brown co
                                                     a
lour, and yields a foetid smell when struck with         ahammer, being
that species called      by   mineralogists swinestone.            It
                                                                  contams
 nearly  the  same   proportion   of    magnesia  as that   of Breedon    in
 Leicestershire, first analysed    by   Mr. Tennant.
    The limestone in some of the beds           divided into small cells
                                                is
uniting with each other, and pretty regularly arranged this has        :
 received the appellation of honeycomb limestoue, a name which
 conveys a   tolerably correct idea of its appearance.             A
                                                                superficial
 observer might suppose from the form that this was the organic
 remains of some species of madrepores           but
                                                 ;       it  evidently the
                                                              is
 result ofa   tendency   to  crystalline arrangement.       This  arrange
 ment has proceeded still further, and disposed distinct masses
 of the honeycomb limestone to assume determinate forms in the
 substance of the rock itself.          The crystallization of some of
 these masses appears to have diverged from              acentre laterally,
 until the radii were met         by  those of other diverging masses,
 and both became compressed on the sides. The most striking
 of these forms nearly resembles a papal mitre they are from
                                                          :
 six to nine inches in length or more, and may be detached from
 the rock. Several of these mitre-shaped masses appear also to
 have come in contact during their formation, and to be com
 pressed at the place of junction, the convexity of theone having
                                                                    formed

                  of Not thumlerland and Durham.                     85
  formed a concavity in the sides of the other.      We must either
  admit, with the late Mr. Gregory Watt, that a crystalline ar
  rangement of the particles can take place in solid bodies at the
  common temperature of the earth, or that these rocks have been
 softened by heat, or some other cause, subsequently to their for
 mation.    Nor will even the latter opinion, I conceive, be very im
 probable ; for on the elevated ground at a little distance to the
 north-west of Building Hill, I observed immense blocks of
 extremely hard and very black basalt lying on the surface of a
 ploughed field.    On inquiry, the men who were working in
 formed me that numerous blocks of the same kind were buried
 under the soil, which impeded their operations in ploughing so
 much, that, when they were too large to be removed, they were
 obliged to break them by blasting with gunpowder.         I therefore
think it extremely probable, that an immense whin dyke has in
 tersected this formation of limestone.       The quarry at Fulwell
 is close by the turnpike road to Newcastle, and about two miles
from Sunderland.        The limestone here presents little of the
honeycomb appearance of that at Building Hill ; but it is not
 the less remarkable : it is covered by a stratum of calcareous
 marie, or rather sand ; some of the beds are also divided by the
 same pulverulent marie or calcareous sand, in which are im
 bedded numerous detached spheres, spheroids, and also botry-
 oidal and stalactitical masses of limetone : but the latter are at
 tached to the rock.      The upper stratum of calcareous sand
 also contains numerous balls and clusters of balls of a similar
 kind, varying in size from that of a pea to ten or twelve inches
in diameter.     That these balls are not water-worn is most evii
dent : many of them have a crystalline diverging radiated structure,
others are curvedly lamellar.      The most striking circumstance
attending these balls remains to be noticed : many of them ap
 pear to have come in contact at a certain stage of their forma
tion : they present the appearance of two or more balls with a
segment cut from each, and closely united at the place of sec
tion ; in other instances a number of balls appear to have pressed
laterally on each other and flattened the sides, thus forming
polyhedral prisms convex at their upper and lower extremities.
This singular conformation had not escaped the attention of
that sagacious young philosopher the late Mr. G. Watt. It is
indeed a fact analogous to what took place in the experiment
he made by melting seven cwt. of basalt, and suffering it to cool
slowly. A number of small globules formed in the mass, and en
larged till they compressed each other into a prismatic shape.
The formation of these balls of limestone in the soft strata of
this rock would, I conceive, if properly attended to, throw some
                                F3                               light

86                    Olservations   on the Geology
light on the globular and columnar structure common to many
rock formations.
    Nearer to Sunderland, below the garden of the rectory, there
is another remarkable quarry.           If the limestone here once ex
isted in continuous beds, it has been subsequently broken and
thrown into the utmost confusion ; large shapeless masses being
piled together, and the intermediate spaces filled with calcareous
sand similar to that before mentioned at Fulwell.
    The limestone of this district, though abounding in magnesia,
is sent in prodigious quantities to Scotland for agricultural use ;
which offers a further confirmation of what I have stated before
in my Introduction        to Geology, that magnesian limestone, so
far from being prejudicial to land, is preferable to any other
where it is to be sent to a distance ; for the same quantity will
produce an equal effect to a larger quantity of the common
kind*.
    The coal district of Northumberland          and Durham is bounded
by   the  magnesian limestone,     or  by  the  sea, on the east, and by
the metalliferous limestone on the west.            Dr. Thomson has di
vided this district into two formations : the one he calls the
Newcastle coal formation ; and the other the independent coal
formation : but for this division there does not appear to me any
sufficient reason, nor would it be easy, or indeed possible, to se
parate these formations by any well-defined characters; for the
former is only the upper series of strata to the latter. The circum
stance of galena veins occasionally occurring in the lower series
will not entitle it to be considered as a distinct formation, by any
one practically acquainted with the coal district of our island
south of the Tweed.
    When coal strata approach the metalliferous limestone, very
strong veins of galena will be found occasionally to penetrate the
coal, or to send up branches or strings of ore ; the more power
ful veins generally rising the highest into the upper strata.              Si
milar instances might be cited in Derbyshire, Staffordshire,
Lancashire, and other parts of England. As the whole of this
district has been mined, and the succession and thickness of the
strata ascertained, I shall proceed togive an account of JVIr.Forster's
section, which includes, as before stated, a measurement of nearly
fourteen hundred yards. But as the earth has nowhere been per
forated to that depth in any one situation, persons not familiar
   * It is only necessary to use this lime more sparingly.     Inattention to
this circumstance gave rise to the opinion of its prejudicial effects on land.
I was informed by a farmer in Derbyshire, that though no vegetation will
•pring up for twp y«ars, where a heap of the burnt magnesian limestone
has been laid, after that time the place is always covered wich an abun
dant and vigorous crop of white clover.

                   of Northumberland and Durham.                        8ft
  with such inquiries     may find  it difficult to conceive how this
  measurement was effected.      I shall therefore add an explanatory
  sketch, which will", I trust, make the subject intelligible.          By
  extending the line east and west beyond Mr. Forster's line of
  section, it will cross the whole island in that parallel of latitude,
  presenting a section of England which I believe will convey a to
  lerably correct idea of the geological arrangement of the rocks
  and strata from the German ocean to the Irish sea.            The ge
  neral dip of the strata on the eastern side of the island, as before
  stated, is to the south-east : and of course each stratum rises to
  the surface in the south-west, when not cut off by a fault.
     The line LL is supposed to represent the level of the sea front
  which the beds of magnesian limestone rise on the east marked
  A. The coal formation commences at B, rising from under the
  magnesian stone. A perforation at 1 will measure the thickness
  of all the strata to the bed of coal marked a. By proceeding
  further west, the bed a rises near the surface at station 2, where
  another pit may be supposed to sink to stratum' b. The depth
  of this added to the former will give the thickness of the whole
  strata from B to stratum b 2. Proceeding in a similar manner at
  station 3, we obtain the thickness of all the strata as far as C and C,
  on the west of the mountain at C. Here the strata making their
  appearance may be measured On the surface, due allowance being
  made for the angle of inclination.        The section of Mr. F. be
  gins  west  of the magnesian   limestone.     The first bed is the clay
  and soil on the surface, under which is a bed of hard siliceous
  sandstone called provincially post, and at the depth of seventeen
  fathoms the first thin seam of coal, under which the various
  strata of slate clay or shale.     Bituminous shale and variously
  coloured sandstones succeed each other ; the most remarkable of
  which are designated by their provincial names, and those of
  minor importance by the letters a or s, to denote that they are
  principally argillaceous or siliceous,         An inspection of the
  plate will render any further explanation unnecessary, besides
   that of the provincial names which are given below.
      More than thirty beds or seams of coal succeed each other, which
  are sufficiently well marked to be distinguished in different situ
  ations where they occur ; each bed of coal generally preserving its
  own strata above and below it in its whole extent. It may be
  observed that all the principal coal beds are comprised within
   200 fathoms, or 400 yards, from the beginning of the section.
   Though some few beds occur in the lower strata, they are of
  inferior quality and generally not workable.         In a similar man
  ner in the Yorkshife and Derbyshire coal fields, there are a few
  thin seams of coal in the great mass of sandstone and shale which
, lie under the principal coal beds, between them and the metal-
                                    F 4                            liferout

88                    Observations on the Geology
liferous limestone.      The most valuable coal beds are called the
 High main coal and the Low main coal, which are six feet or
 upwards in thickness on the Tyne ; but on the Wear, if they be
 the same strata, their thickness is considerably less. Each stra
 tum of coal generally, but not invariably, preserves nearly the
 same degree of thickness throughout its whole extent : but there
 are instances here, as well as in Staffordshire and Yorkshire, of a
 bed of coal dividing      into two parts, having different degrees
 of inclination ; or, perhaps, to speak more correctly, two beds of
 coal in descending meet and unite. The separating strata having
 disappeared in such instances, the bed will be much thicker than
 before the junction.
      The other strata also vary in thickness in different parts of their
 course, but the limestone strata are observed to be more uni
 formly regular than the rest.        The very hard strata which are
 obliged to be sunk through by blasting, are called whinstone by
 the miners ; but these are not the proper whinstone, or basalt,
  similar to that of the dykes.         There is however one bed of
 true whinstone of vast thickness called the great whinstone (sill)
 or bed, which is found to vary from 16 to 60 yards in tkickness.
  This bed lies far below the principal coal strata. It is considered
  by Mr. Forster as the same which appears on the banks of the
  river Tees, where it forms magnificent basaltic columns, some of
  which are not less than 40 feet in height.           It extends to the
  mountain called Cross Fell, on one side of which, I am informed,
  there is a deep nearly circular excavation called High Cup, sur
  rounded by lofty basaltic columns.         An intelligent gentleman
  well skilled in mineralogy, who has resided long in the county,
  and paid particular attention to the subject, informed me that
  he did not consider the great whin sill as a regular stratum, but
  as a wedge-shaped mass of basalt, probably formed by the ex
  pansion of basalt from one of the great basalt dykes which intersect
   that district.    The provincial word post signifies a very firm
  siliceous sandstone, and is differently named according to
   its colour, as gray post, white post, &c. Hazle is also a name
   given to some kinds of siliceous sandstone.       Coal shale and the
   clay slate of Werner are called plate.    Gray beds are series of thin
   alternating strata of siliceous sandstone and shale.       It would be
   tedious to enumerate the provincial names of all the beds ; it will
   be sufficient to mark them by the letters S and a, to denote
    their predominating      characters, as siliceous or argillaceous
   strata.    In  the rooms belonging to the Philosophicial and Li
    terary Society at Newcastle, sections of some of the principal
    coal mines are kept, with series of mineral specimens of the dif
    ferent strata, and their provincial names affixed.     It is deserving
    notice, that in some of the coal mines there are brine springs

                       of Northumberland         and Durham.                    89
containing about 5 per cent. of common salt.                   At Long Benton
in Northumberland, the proprietors have obtained by act of
parliament the exclusive privilege of extracting soda from the
brine, without the payment of the regular duties. Another spring
rises in part of the river Wear*.
      At the depth of about 300 yards below the lowest principal
beds of coal, the beds of metalliferous limestone commence, par
ticularly what are provincially called the Little and the Great
 limestones.         There is a bed below these sometimes called the
 Great limestone, or the Melmerby Scar limestone, which is much
 thicker than the upper great limestone bed. The Little limestone
is the first of the metalliferous limestones. Between this and the
 first great limestone are strata of sandstone and plate, with two
 seams of sulphurous coal.              The first great limestone is about
  2 1 yards in thickness, and is the most productive of lead of any
 limestone on the Wear or Tees.                 About four yards of the upper
  parts    of this  limestone   in  Northumberland        are called the Tumbler
  beds ; they      contain  entrochi     and   other    organic remains. There
  are in all not less than nineteen beds of limestone, of which the
  most remarkable are called the Four fathom limestone ; the Five
  yards limestone ; the Three yards limestone ; Scar limestone
   (five fathoms) ; Tyne bottom limestone, so called because the
  river Tyne runs in this limestone nearly all the way from Tyne
  head to Garrygall gate, a distance of about four miles.                      It is
  stated by     Mr.   Forster  to  be  the   lowest   limestone   of Alston Moor,
  and the uppermost stratum at DuftonFell in Westmoreland: its
      * The difference in the thickness of the upper coal beds on the rivers
  Tyne and Wear may perhaps make it doubtful whether they are the same
  (according to Mr. Forster);
                                   " the first eight small seams and the high main
   coal on the river Tyne are scarcely noticed on the river Wear.         The not
   below called the metal coal on Tyne, makes part of the five quarters coal
   on Wear; then the next called the yard coal on Tyne forms the high main
   coal on Wear six feet thick; then there is a small scam six inches thick,
   from which we come to the Bentham seam on Tyne three feet three inches
   thick, which forms the Maudlin seam on the Wear four feet thick. The
   next below is a coal called the six quarter coal on Tyne three feet six
   inches thick, part of the low main coal on Wear.           Underneath is a small
    «eam nine inches thick, from whence we come to the low main coal on
   Tyne six feet six inches thick, which forms the llutfon seam on Wear
    four feet three inches thick. From thence wc find live seams, as will appear
    by the section, when we come to, the Hervey seam three feet thick on Tyne,
    and to Wickham stone coal on Tyne six feet thick.           From thence to the
    Brockwell seam, which is little known on Tyne, is totally unknown on Wear,
    and is the lowest seam discovered either on the river Wear or Tyne." In
    a section so extensive as this taken by Mr. Forster, over a country broken
    and disturbed by numerous faults, it is possible that there may be some
    uncertainty with respect to the identity of the strata in particular situa
    tions ; but the section may be regarded as a valuable approximation to
    truth.
                                                                            average

 90                   Observations on the Geology
average thickness is about nine yards.       Below this limestone the
great mass of whinstone in some parts makes its appearance :
the thickness is from sixteen to sixty yards.
    The lowest great limestone called the Melmerby scar lime-
atone is by far the most considerable, being 42 yards in thick
ness.      It is so called from its occurrence at Melmerby scar (or
cliff) in Cumberland.        This bed nearly equals in thickness the
rast beds of limestone in Derbyshire, and Craven on the north
west of Yorkshire.         Some few beds of limestone, but of minor
importance, lie below the Melmerby scar limestone.          The total
thickness of the strata between the latter and the red sandstone
is about one hundred and twenty yards.            The red sandstone
called by the Germans the old red sandstone, or the first fleetz
sandstone of Werner, I believe, has no where been directly sunk
through, nor is its exact thickness known.
    Mr. Forster's section comprises, as before stated, both the coal
and the metalliferous limestone districts, closing with the red
sandstone. I have extended the horizontal sketch beyond the
schistose and porphyritic mountains westward, where we again
meet with thick beds of stratified sandstone and coal dipping
into the Irish sea.
    It is foreign to the purpose of the present letter to enlarge the
account of this side of the island.         I shall only observe that
the rocks which compose the mountains near the lakes are well
known to geologists to belong to that class which present few re
gular features of stratification (and I might add, with few excep
tions,) nor any regular order of succession.    The beds and tabular
masses where these mountains are schistose are very elevated, or
nearly vertical.      Mr. Forster, whose observations appear to have
been principally confined to stratified parallel rocks intersected
occasionally "by perpendicular veins and dykes, describes the
                                      mountains cutting through the
stratified rocks, as an enormous dyke or vein of what he calls
blue rock. " The most remarkable dyke (he says) that we find
in the north of England, is the great blue rock at Keswick, which
in some places is ten or twelve miles wide, and may be traced
into Wales to the southward and into Scotland northward." Ex
travagant as this description may at-first appear, it coincides in
substance with the system of those geologists who suppose that
primary and transition mountains have been melted or softened by
subterranean fire, and thrust through the superficial covering of
the globe.        I should not have thought it necessary to quote a
description     involved  in the language of hypothesis ; but I con
sider the opinions of practical men on any department of nature
with which they are familiar, as deserving some attention, whether
such opinions coincide with or oppose the fashionable theories
of cabinet philosophers.                                         The

   The metallic veins which intersect the lower beds of thi«
lection are always most productive, as they pass through
the limestone, and of the numerous beds of limestone that
called the Great limestone is by far the richest in ore.          The
general  direction  of the principal veins is  from east to west ; but
there are other veins which run from north to south, and inter
sect the above nearly at right angles.        These are called cross
courses.    The first are called right running veins. The cross
courses sometimes produce ore at their junction with the north
and south veins, and at a little distance on each side of the latter.
 A curious fact is stated by Mr. Forster, that most of the east and
west veins on Wear dale throw the strata on the north side or
cheek of the vein up, and the vein declines to the south ; but -
most of the veins at Alston Moor and Allen Dale thr^ow the
strata on the south side or cheek up, and the vein declines to the
north. The beds of rock in this mining field being composed
of different strata, calcareous, siliceous, and argillaceous ; it is
found that the nature of the rock affects the contents of the vein.
In the calcareous the ore is most abundant ; in the siliceous or
sandstone beds the veins are seldom very productive of ore, and
in the argillaceous strata, or plate, ore is scarcely ever found in
the vein.    It is also to be noticed, that the vein in passing the dif
ferent  beds  becomes much narrower in the hard siliceous strata,
and is sometimes nearly closed as it passes through them, but it
again becomes wider in the limestone and plate.            The inclina
tion (or what is called the hade) of the vein is the greatest in
passing through the soft strata, but in the hard strata above or
below it takes its former inclination again, so as frequently to have
a kind of zigzag course as it descends.          It is also particularly
deserving attention, that when the beds on one side of a vein are
thrown up, and rocks of adifferent kind face each other, so that one
side of the vein will have a wall of limestone and the other of sand
stone or plate, the vein is seldom, if everyso rich in ore as when
both walls are of the same kind of rock; on which account it is
found that the most productive veins are those where the rock on
either side has but a small throw up, and of course the walls or
cheeks of the veins (as they are called) are formed of the same
stratum on both sides.
    The almost invariable change in the quality or in the contents
 of metallic veins, as they pass through different rocks,     is,
                                                               I   con

      a   demonstrative proof of the fallacy of Werner's theory,
which represents veins a? open fissures filled with metallic solu
tions from above, either by an aperture at the top or through
openings in the sides. Were veins filled in this manner, the qua
lity of the rock could have little influence on the ore.        Werner
quotes an instance at Kingsbergh     in  Norway,    as

                                         that so far from this being      rarea

I  believe, mining operations have been carried on to a far greater
extent' and with more capital and skill than                any part of Ger

many.      The principal substances which fill the veins                  thisin
mining     district,  besides   galena     or  the  sulphuret   of lead,  and
blende   or  the sulphuret    of zinc,   are  quartz,  fluor spar, calcareous
spar, iron pyrites, and pearl spar,               soft unctuous iron ochre
                                                   a
which stains the fmgers, and sulphate of barytes. Carbonate                            of
barytes and carbonate of lead more rarely occur; copper pyrites
is  found in some of the veins, but not in sufficient quantity to be
worked for that metal. Emerald green crystals of fluor spar
occur in some of these mines, more beautiful perhaps than any
that have elsewhere been met with.               The carbonate of barytes              is
principally found in large detached balls, which have                radiated
                                                                          a

The vein in the sandstone strata contains sulphate of barytes
(caulk) but when
         ;               itenters the great limestone, the carbonate                   of
barytes becomes the matrix.
    The cubic crystals of fluor are sometimes very large, and often
beautifully coated with minute brilliant rock crystals and with
pearl spar.       The phenomenon of quartz formed on cubes                             of

these perpendicular fissures or rents' being generally filled with
mineral matter harder than the roeks, it remains when the sur
face is in part worn away, rising up like a wall.         Some of the
dykes are of great extent, filled with whin-stone or basalt : but
there is one which extends from the sea, running in a south-west
direction, and has thrown down the strata on, one side 180 yards :
this is more properly a fracture of the strata than a dyke, the
fissure being narrow and filled with clay.      This fault passes near
the town of Newcastle.        It may deserve notice, that little if any
appearance of the dislocation of the strata presents itself on the
surface.     Mr. Farey was, I believe, the first who particularly
 called the attention of geologists to the fact of the frequent dis
 appearance of a whole series of strata on one side of a fault ; in
 this instance it is truly remarkable.
     There is a very powerful whin-dyke extending across the
 county of Northumberland from the sea in a direction westward :
 it rises to the surface, passing about four miles north of New
 castle, where it is extensively quarried, .as well as in many other
 parts of its course.    It is to be regretted that the information
 Dr. Thomson received respecting it was so erroneous, as it ap
 pears to have prevented him from examining it at Coaly Hill,
 where he might have seen its effects on the coal strata as it
 passes through them.         Coaly Hill is not more than about four
 miles from the town of Newcastle : it is not a hill of basalt, but is
 composed of the regular strata which accompany coal.               The
 whin-dyke     is worked    along  a line  of several  hundred    yards
 in length for materials to lay on the roads. The width of this
 dvke I do not accurately recollect ; but there is a cart road
 along it where it has been worked, and a considerable space
 left between the road and the natural walls on each side.             I
 am informed it becomes wider in the western part of its course.
 As it intersects the strata perpendicularly, and is worked to the
  depth of forty or fifty feet ; the excavation forms a deep trench,
  on the sides of which the strata of sandstone and coal may be seen.
  I examined the coal which had been in contact with the basalt,
  it was charred, or reduced to a black powder. Wishing to obtain
  some information, from the man who was working in the dyke,
  respecting the general effect produced by the contact of the
  basalt with the coal, I requested my friend the Rev. W. Tur
  ner, of Newcastle, who was with me, to make the inquiry in the
  common language of the miners, and in such a manner as
  might not lead him to anticipate what were my own opinions.
  To the question : What has the whin-dyke done to the coal ?
  The answer immediately was, ' She (meaning the dyke) has
  burnt the coal wherever she has touched it.'          This man had
  worked at the quarries in the same dyke many years, and had
 .. .                                                          frequent

94                  Observations on tks Geology
frequent opportunities of seeing the whin-stone in contact with
coal.    Similar effects, I am informed, may be noticed in many
if not in all the coal mines of this district, where the whin-stone
immediately cuts through the coal.          The whin-stone is inter
sected by fissures, and divided into blocks and balls: in some
parts it graduates from basalt into an iron clay, which in one
situation I saw formed into groups of minute regular pentagonal
prisms : some of these 1 brought away with me.             The whin-
stone of this dyke contains numerous small cavities filled with
olivine ; but in no specimens that I have seen from the dyke at
 Coaly Hill are there any cavities filled with chalcedony.       I am
therefore inclined to believe that the basalt laid on the' road
which Dr. Thomson saw, was not from this place, as a great
variety of basalts and other stones are constantly brought from a
 distance as ballast to Newcastle, and employed for the roads.
 In some of these I have seen both chalcedony and zeolites.
     There is a dyke filled with loose sandstone or rubble, which
 crosses a considerable part of the coal field without any disturb
 ance of the strata.     This, I believe, has been a mere fissure filled
 from above by materials washed into it. A similar dyke or
 fissure occurs in the Bradford coal field near Manchester, of
 which I have given an account in the second volume of the
 Transactions of the Geological Society.
     Though I have spoken of the east and west basalt dykes as ex
 tending from the sea westward, I believe it would be more cor
 rect to describe them as streams of basalt diverging from a cen
 tral focus in the mountains of Cumberland and Westmoreland
 beyond the mountain called Cross Fell.        The summits of some of
 the mountains near Ulswater, particularly Swarthfell, are covered
 with basalt of a similar kind. On the western side of Northum
 berland the basalt rises in vast masses to the surface, and assumes
 the columnar form.       In a direction towards the same focus may
 be traced the most considerable basalt dyke at present known in
  England, extending through the county of Durham and the
  north riding of Yorkshire to the sea between Whitby and Scar
  borough, of which a further account will be given in the second
  edition of my Introduction to Geology, now in the press.          It is
  the same dyke which passes through the coal mines at Cockfield,
  and has produced the remarkable effect of charring the coal, and
  coating the under surface of the stratum above the coal with
  crystals of sulphur described in Mr. Bailey's Survey of Durham.
  The apparent agency of fire upon the coal extends to fifty yards
  on each side of the dyke.        The Burtreeford dyke runs nearly
  north and south.    These dykes, and the remarkable peculiarities
  of the metallic veins on the western side of Northumberland and
  Durham, offer a rich field to the labours of future geologists,

                   of Northumberland    ana Durham.                  95
but a transient or occasional visit will not suffice.     A long resi
dence in the district, and the free communication of numerous
intelligent observers, are necessary to a complete investigation;
oa which account, the establishment of a Geological Society in
that part of England would be particularly desirable.       It is to be
regretted    that  many gentlemen fully competent    to  observe,   and
to describe their observations, have been deterred from doing it
by the appearance of the Wernerian Geognosy. The introduction
of a new language, and of unfounded or undiscoverable distinc
tive characters, together with the loftiness of tone and manner in;
which these novelties were ushered to the world, terrified men of
plain understandings from continuing or from publishing their
own observations.       Endeavouring, but in vain, to find in nature
that regular conformity to the system of Werner, or, to use the
words of an acute geologist*, distressing themselves "because they
 could not see what was invisible," they abandoned their labours
in despair.
     It remains to describe more fully the sketch, fig. 1, which I
have drawn partly to explain the manner in which Mr. Forster's
 section was taken, by measuring the sinkings in different mines ;
and also to show the general arrangement of the rocks and strata
beyond Mr. Forster's section.        In a sketch of thislund extend
 ing   more  than  one hundred    miles, it was necessary to give the
 elevation of the mountains on an enlarged scale.       Had the same
 horizontal and perpendicular proportions been retained, the
highest point could not be more than the l-20th of an inch
 above the line LL, supposed to represent the level of the sea.
 Notwithstanding the disparity on the scales of proportion, I trust
 the present sketch will convey a tolerably correct idea of the
 physical structure of this part of England, which is all I propose.
  I may be allowed to add, that I hope it will be received with
 some indulgence, being the first attempt that I am acquainted
  with to give a geological sketch of the succession of rocks across
  the island from the Irish channel to the German ocean.
      The magnesian limestone A, which covers the east side of Dur
  ham, does not extend far into Northumberland, but can be traced
  in different situations along the coast; it has probably been
  washed away, as there are existing records of the great encroach
  ments of the sea.     By proceeding from B westward, the different
  strata  rise to the surface till we come to the limestone district
   C C. The strata still continue to rise in the same direction, but
   are occasionally broken by dykes, one of which (the Burtreeford
   dyke X) has thrown down the strata on the west 160 yards.

with the mountains of slate, porphyry, gray wacke, hornstone,
&c. marked E, that surround Ullswater and Keswick. The
highest of these mountains, Sea-fell, is 3166 feet above the level
of the sea.       The summit is hornstone schistus.         Further west
we meet with siliceous sandstone marked F ; and lastly, the Cum
berland coal strata bordering the Irish channel G.
    The limits of the present letter will not allow me to enter in
to the subject of the explosions in coal mines : but I think it
proper to add, that I perfectly agree with what Dr. Thomson
has said respecting the management of these mines, and the too
great apathy shown by many of the proprietors to the waste of
human life which annually takes place.           I was informed that in
two years six hundred persons were destroyed in the different
coal mines of Tyne and Wear.              By one explosion ninety-two
persons were killed in the mines of Mr. Brandling in 1812; and
the very week before the first meeting of the Society for preventing
Accidents in Mines, twenty-three men and boys lost their lives
in a pit belonging to Sir Ralph Milbank.           At the request of the
latter,  and  of  the  Rev. Dr.  Grey  of  Sunderland, I attended that
meeting.      But I saw with regret, that the good intentions and
exertions of the gentlemen most active in its establishment were
viewed with jealousy by some of the coal agents and proprietors,
as interfering with the rights of private property and tending
to alarm the workmen.           By the request of one proprietor the
number of lives destroyed was erased from the resolutions, for
fear of giving offence.      I took the liberty of observing    " that if
all had been done which circumstances permitted, to prevent
these fatal accidents, no one could be offended by a plain state
ment of facts : and in order to meet the difficulty fairly, and in
terest the public in promoting the object of the Society, it was
necessary that the nature and extent of the evil should be fully
made known."         To render the mines secure would be attended
with additional expense and labour ; but the evil is of such mag
nitude, that, if a remedy be not applied, it will claim the serious
attention of the Legislature,

XVIII.    Observations on Mr. Donovan's 'Reflections on the In
   adequacy of the principal Hypotheses to account for the Phe
   nomena of Electricity.     By G. A. Deluc, Esq. F.R. S. &c.
                            To  Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, — 1 .  This    paper of Mr.   Donovan will, I hope, be very
useful in settling the doctrine    of electricity, against which he
finds the objections detailed in   his paper, upon its true foun
dation.
   2. The doctrine of positive      and negative electricities, first
published by Franklin, is true in itself ; but by the manner in
which he had expressed it it was involved in many difficulties
which he had not foreseen.      I shall have occasion hereafter to
relate the opportunity which I had, long after, to demonstrate
to him personally, by an experiment, what kind of influence the
air has in the propagation of the electric fluid.
   3. Franklin's theory was first attacked by Dr. Peart, who
pointed out some phenomena of electric motions absolutely in
consistent with his statement of his own system.          I shall not
enter into that discussion, but point out directly the source of
an insurmountable difficulty in that theory, as it was first ex
pressed by its author, which circumstance (as I shall successively
prove) has been the only cause of its rejection by Mr. Donovan.
The error was this: Dr. Franklin considered as the standard of
plus and minus, or middle point between them, a certain natural
quantity of electric matter belonging to all the bodies of the
earth : he called negative the bodies from which some part of
that quantity was abstracted, and positive those to which a new
quantity was added.
   4. This error of Franklin has created all the just objections
of Mr. Donovan ; but from this circumstance I may judge that
the latter has not had the opportunity of knowing two works
which I have published, one in England in 1 787, in two volumes,
under the title of Idees sur la MSteorologie : the other was
published at Paris in 1804, also in two volumes, under the title
of Traiti tUmenlaire sur le Fluide electro-galvanique.              In
both these works I have applied Volta's system to the motions
of a pair   of balls, which motions are the most immediate test
of electrical theories.
   5. The essential and characteristic difference of Volta's theory,
compared to that of Franklin, consists in the standard between
plus and minus.       Volta has demonstrated that there is no other
standard, or middle point between these two opposite electric
states, than the actual electric state of the air, which possesses
                                                             r

98       Obseivations on  Mr.  Donovan's    Reflections,   &c.
electric matter as well as the bodies which it embraces.          But I
must first relate the opportunity   which  I have   had  to  learn  that
system from its author himself.     Being at Paris   in the year   1782,
I made that very interesting acquaintance, and M. Volta was so
good as to explain to me completely his system. The same
year he came to London, and directed me in the construction of
a more extensive set of electrical instruments, with which 1 made
all the experiments related in the above mentioned works.
    6. The principle of Volta with respect to electric motions, be
ing that they have for their true standard the actual electric
state of the ambient air, it came into my mind to submit that
principle, as the foundation of the whole theory, to an experi-
mentum crucis.
    7. This experiment is related from p. 55 to 57 of the first
volume of the Traile elemenlaire sur le Fluide electrico-
galvanique ; where I first mention, as an indispensable condi
 tion for the success of that experiment, that the air be very
dry; and I had the means, by my hygrometer, to determine the
necessary degree of dryness, which is about 43° of my scale.           As
 these   experiments require some time, a greater quantity             of
 aqueous vapour mixed with the air, dissipates       too  fast the  elec
 tric fluid accumulated upon bodies, and transmits too fast some
 electric fluid to those which have been rendered negative.
     8. I made this series of experiments in two contiguous rooms,
 separated by a short passage and a door.        In one of the rooms
 I placed a very strong electric machine, by which the air could
 be modified without affecting that of the other room.           I had a
 pair of pith halls with long conducting threads, suspended to a
 brass cap at the extremity of a varnished glass rod, and thus
 thoroughly insulated, as well as the ferrule to which the bails
 were suspended.      Before the electric machine was put in motion
 in its room, the balls had no divergence in either of them.
     9. In one of the experiments, I fixed a point at the extremity •
  of the prime conductor of the machine, the rubber being placed
 in communication with the ground : a luminous brush appeared
  at the point, indicating that the electric fluid escaped from it
  and was communicated to the air of the room.            Now, when I
  brought the pair of balls from the next room, where they did
  not diverge, they strongly diverged in the room of the machine;
  and by the test of a rubbed stick of sealing-wax they were found
  to diverge negatively, because the air had acquired some electric
 fluid by the action of the positive point, and thus was made po
  sitive; but when the balls were brought back to the other room,
  they ceased to diverge.
      10. I made the inverse experiment, by fixing a point to the
  rullcr of the machine, its prime conductor being placed in com
                                                              munication

                 respecting Ike Phenomena                   of Electricityt               99
munication with the ground.         The machine being worked iin
this state, a luminous point was seen at the extremity of the ,
point fixed to the rubber, indicating that some electric fluid
passed from the air of the room to the ruhl/er, and thus that air-
was made negative.         Now the pair of lulls, which did not
again diverge in the next room, being brought into that wherein
                                                                       '
the machine was, they strongly diverged, and by the test they
diverged positively, being brought into an atmosphere rendered
negative by the point fixed to the rubber.
    11. These experiments cannot leave any doubt, on Volta's
theory, that in the divergence of a pair of balls, the standard of
phis and minus is not, as Franklin had determined             natural         it,   a
electric stale of bodies     but that
                               ;              the actual and variable
                                                  it       is
electric state of the ambient air.       Had Mr. Donovan been ac
quainted with that theory of Volta, still retaining the fundamental
theory of positive and negative, first announced         Franklin, but   by
changing the standard from          fixeda to    changeable state well
                                                                a
defined, he would certainly have retained the fundamental doc
trine of positive and negative with that correction.
    12. As to the theory of iEpinus, that electric atmospheres da
not exist, which Mr. Donovan seems to prefer to that of Franklin
corrected    by Volta, — have shown in one of my works, that
                           I
iEpinus, instead of simplifying the theory, has fallen into greater                 a
complication of hypotheses, even contrary to some general laws
of nature. But shall not enter into that discussion, as Volta's
                      I
system renders        it
                     unnecessary.
    13.It   is   by
                 this influence of the air, receiving its share of the
electric fluid possessed       by
                               the bodies which       surrounds, that
                                                                    it
Volta explained the motions of electrified balls, and the following
is his explanation.     " When two balls suspended near each other
are ina   positive state comparatively to the air of the place, they
loth communicate some electric fluid to the air between them                              ;
while each of them communicates alone the electric fluid to the.
outward air. Each of the balls therefore moves towards that
outward air on each side, not                by
                                       repelling each other, but                              by
moving towards the air possessing less electric fluid.
    14. During the course of my experiments to demonstrate, in
various manners, the certainty of Volta's system on the cause of
motion of electrified balls,    came into my mind that an analogous
                                   it
phenomenon might be produced, in which the cause of the mo
tion might be visible and  ;      having succeeded, have described
                                    it                                   1
this experiment from p. 116 to 119 of the same volume, of
which  it  will be sufficient to give here an extract.
    15. An accidental observation led me to that experiment,
which those who shave themselves and employ soap powder will
easily repeat.        the basin used happens to be covered with
                      If

100         Observations on          Mr.   Donovan's Reflections, (s*c.
dust, this swims over the water ; but it is very easily swept, by
scraping a small flake of soap, taking it on the point of a knife,
and endeavouring to let it fall on the middle of the surface of
the water with its convexity undermost.            As soon as that flake
of soap swims on the water, the dust recedes from                    it,
                                                            and ascends
to the edge of the water on the side of the basin, where           forms       it
a  thin fringe.
    16. Having taken notice of that motion of the surface of
water made visible         by
                           the dust,     attempted to imitate the mo
                                               I
tion   of two  electrified balls     two disks of soap half an inch in
                                          by
diameter, and about 1-1 0th of an inch thick, in the centre of
which   I   fixed with gum        very thin thread four inches long,
                                     a
and I   suspended these disks to a slip of wood at such         distance   a
that they slightly touched each other. When that little appa
ratus was prepared, and the two disks made to rest at the same
time on the surface of the water, they began to recede from each
other, and the motion of the dust on the surface of the water
visibly demonstrated that the disks                 of
                                              soap moved both towards
the water which had not yet dissolved soap.
    17. Lastly,     have demonstrated by direct experiment, which
                       I                                a

                                                   a
sential interference of air in the motion of pair of electrified balls.

    18. Another essential part of Volta's system, with which Mr.
Donovan          not acquainted, and which when fully understood
                 is
removes all the difficulties he has found,         that which Volta has
                                                            is

conductor,       gives more tension to the electric fluid at that end
                 it

                                          it                         This
principle removes all the difficulties that Mr. Donovan has found,
and in particular that which seems to arise from his experiment
related in p. 338, of       apith-ball suspended to glass rod, and
                                                                 a
an excited glass tube brought under it. The excited tube occasions
a  slow retreat of electric matter along the thread.         While that
 matter remains together in the ball, the thread, and at the point
of suspension, the ball repelledis          the excited tube but at last
                                                   by                      ;
the suspended ball loses some electric matter, and being then
negative,    it    attracted
                      is         by
                                 the excited tube.
    19. The author attacks with reason the cause assigned bv
Franklin to the luminous brush which appears at the extremity
bf, a   pointed body fixed to the prime conductor of an electric
 machine in motion.        But Volta has also explained this pheno-
 meaon in satisfactory manner, as have explained in pp. 60 and
             a                                 I
 61. Suppose         conductor positively electrified, and to which
                       a                                                            is
 presented another conductor          communication with the ground,
                                          in

             respecting the Phcenomcna            of Electricity.            101
but   the surface   of which   is   of    a certain extent ; the particles    of
air in motion, returning        from the electrified conductor, and
  thus possessing more electric fluid, might transmit some to the
 other body ; but their mfluence on it producing a diminution of
 tension in the fluid proceeding from the conductor, at the same
 time that they increase the tension in the fluid of the body,
 there is thus a very small disposition of the electric fluid to
 abandon the particles of air.       But if it be a point, the electric
fluid belonging to it is in too small a quantity to increase the
 tension of that belonging to the body: thus, every particle of air
 which comes in contact with that body discharges its electric
 fluid, returns instantly, and, as it takes the shorter way, thus is
 produced a current of air. The same alternate motions take place
 in the particles of air, whether the point is negative or positive.
     20. The difficulty concerning the impermeability of glass
 to the electric fluid, which the author opposes to the pheno-
 niena of the Leyden vial, as accounted for by Franklin, has also
 been removed by Volta, by supposing the electric fluid composed
 of two ingredients, to one of which only glass is impermeable,
 but the other passes readily through it.        If the jar is coated on
 both sides with tin-foil up to a certain height, it will not receive
 a charge, unless the outside coating is in communication with
 the ground.
     21. On the explanation of this common phenomenon rests
 the whole theory of positive and negative electricities, which Volta,
 having placed on its true foundation, has thereby clearly explained
 the phenomena of the Leyden vial; and it is his theory which has
 led me to my systems on the nature of the electric fluid.           This
 fluid, considered in its common phenomena, is composed of two
 ingredients; one, which does not possess expansibility by itself; the
 other, which, united with     it,
                                 gives expansibility to the compound,
 Of this union have given an example in the aqueous vapour,
               I
 which  is   composed of particles of water,     substance not possess
                                                   a
 ing expansibility, and of particles offlre, which gives expansibility
 to the compound. — That analogy, with all its particulars,          have
                                                                     I
 explained in p. 77, section          with this title "Analogies and
                                     I.                   :
 Differences of the Electric Fluid, and the Aqueous Vapour."            In
 consequence    of  this analogy,    I have  given  the name   of electric
 matter to that ingredient of the electric fluid to which glass               is
 not permeable, and deferent fluid to that ingredient which trans
ports the electric matter, and which alone passes through the
 glass.
    22. In this system Mr. Donovan may find the solution of his
 difficulties concerning the charge and discharge of the Leyden
 vial.     Franklin's system    istrue so far as he supposes that the
                                          G   3                          vial

102       Observations on   Mr.      Donovan's         Reflections,   &c,
vial  possesses (nearly) the same quantity of electric Jluid, both
when it is in its natural state, and when it is charged ; but the
electric fluid is not distributed in the same manner in both cases.
When an electric machine tends to produce an accumulation of
electric fluid on one of the surfaces of the vial, it cannot accu
mulate except the outside of the vial can part with an equal
quantity, its coating being in communication with the ground.
But it is not the identical electric fluid which pervades the glass,
the electric <matter thrown in remains fixed on the inner surface;
the deferent fluid alone pervades the glass, and, uniting with the
 electric matter on the outward surface, forms there an equal
 quantity of electric fluid, which is transmitted to the ground if
it finds a conductor.       This is a complete analogy with one of
the phenomena of the aqueous vapour mentioned in the above
 quoted section.      The maximum of charge is attained, when the
 quantity   of electric matter accumulated on the internal surface
is in equilibrium with that transmitted by the electric machine.
    23. So far this system might appear only an hypothesis to
 Mr. Donovan, as he does not know the work to which I refer,
where I have given a peremptory demonstration of                derived   it,
from the electric motions, proving          a direct experiment, that

these motions refer only to the electric matter, without inter
ference of the deferent fluid, except to transport the electric
matter.                                      *

                                 I
very much struck Mr. Cavallo, in presence of whom             made    at
                                                                      I         it

                                                              is
a  plate, in my work  ;   it consists of   conductor supported in an
                                             a
horizontal position on an insulating pillar.        At one end of this
conductor are suspended,         by
                                  brass wire, two cork-balls half an
inch diameter going down so as to hang opposite to the centre of
two insulated brass disks two inches diameter, brought to about
.3
 1   inches of each other, and the balls hung at equal distance
from them.     1   give
                      a   spark to each of the disks with       Levden    a
vial  : the deferent fluid of the disks, thus rendered positive, and
giving more expansive power to the fluid of the balls,          part of    a
it   iscarried towards the other extremity of the insulated con
ductor; and the balls losing thus        part of their electric matter,
                                         a
they diverge    as being in a  negative state, and are carried on both
sides towards the positive disks, which they would strike, were
they not prevented    by     kind of bridle, placed at the end of the
                          by a
conductor, showing           small motions as       were an avidity to
                                                         it
move towards them.
    25. In that state of the apparatus         which the influence of
                                                  in
the disks, being positive, gives   more  expansive power to the elec
                                                                                tric

trie fluid of the halls, they are certainly negative comparatively
to the ground and the ambient air ; but the deferent fluid of the
 positive disks giving more expansive power to their electric
 .mailer, a conductor communicating with the ground may be
 brought into immediate contact with them without effect : their
 negative divergence still continues.     The same phenomenon is
 produced by inversely electrifying the horizontal insulated con
 ductor and the disks : when the balls, then positive, are made to
 communicate with the ground by a brass conductor, they con
 tinue to diverge, being under the influence of the negative at
 mosphere of the disks.
    26. These phenomena much interested M. Cavallo, who was
 a very liberal-minded man.          He persisted in his opinions as
long as he found reasons to defend them, but was ready to aban
don them whenever his arguments appeared to be contradicted
 by facts, to which he was very attentive.         Having made some
stay at Windsor, he came often to me and proposed some altera
tions in my apparatus, which he thought could change, the phe
nomena.      I foretold him what would happen by the changes,
some of which would change the effect on account of causes
which I pointed out, and others would produce the same effect.
At last he saw and acknowledged that those phenomena could
 absolutely not be explained but by admitting the composition of
the electric fluid of two ingredients, one of which only, which I
had called electric matter, produced electric motions, and the
other, which gave expansibility to that matter in proportion to
its relative quantity, which I named electric deferent.          Thus
Volta-'s theory, applied to all the electric phenomena which were
opposed to Franklin's theory, in his own expressions, have cleared
the system of positive and negative electricities from the objec
tions of Mr. Donovan, arising from the erroneous principle which
he admitted in   it,   of a natural quantity      electric matter be
                                                    of

                                   •
    27.
      I    come to another very important object in the science
of electricity, that of the effect of friction, which in vol. xxxiii.
of Mr. Nicholson's Philosophical Journal         have explained in
                                                  I                    a
manner different from that of Mr. Donovan in p. 337.               His
hypothesis  is   this:
                        " That during attrition between bodies, one
of which must be an electric, the pores of the latter being open
will receive the plus quantity, and will give        out again when
                                                         it
the pores close."    — In this respect have proved, that there
                                   I                              isno
other distinction between bodies than that of conductors and non
conductors;    the latter of which only can be excited by friction,
because the electric fluid, thus set in motion on the surface,
moves slowly to make its escape        by   conductor offered at a di-
                                            a
      .i         ,               G   4                         stance.

 104     Observations on   Mr.  Donovan's Reflections,  &c.
stance.    While, if both bodies which exercise friction on each
other are good conductors, the equilibrium is incessantly restored ;
but if one has more dispositipn than the other to attract the
electric fluid thus agitated, with the faculty of transmitting it to
its remote parts, when the bodies are separated before the equi
librium is restored between them, one is found positive and the
other negative.
    28. These effects are distinctly demonstrated by a small elec
tric machine, the figure of which is at the head of my paper in
Mr. Nicholson's Philosophical Journal for January 1 8 1 1 , under
the title of " Experiments concerning the Electric Machine,
showing the Effects of Friction between Bodies."
    29. M. Cavallo has given a table containing the results of his
experiments of this kind, wherein we find that certain bodies
become either positive or negative by friction, according to those
by which they are rubbed ; but the manner in which his experi
ments were made did not indicate the effect produced on the
rubber itself, because it was not insulated.     I thought it there
fore very important to the doctrine of electricity, to have both
effects indi«ated by electrometers.    This I obtained by the ap
paratus described in that paper ; in which the bodies rubbed are
spindles turned by a winch, and various rubbers made to press
on the spindles by proper springs.       A small insulated prime
conductor is connected by one of its extremities to the spindles,
and by the other with a gold-leaf electrometer.      The rubbers are
insulated, and each of them when applied is made to commu
nicate with a similar gold-leaf electrometer.
    30. The constant result of these experiments was, that the
quantity of plus on one side was equal to the quantity of minus
on the other.      Now the friction being reciprocal, the supposi
tion of the opening of the pores cannot explain that phenomenon,
since they ought to be opened equally in the rubbing as in the
rubbed bodies.
    31. The effect of friction, as I have said above, is to set in
motion on the surface of the bodies, and that, if the body which
 recedes from the point of friction finds in its way a pointed con
 ductor, it transmits to the latter a part of that fluid, which is
 the effect of tht; common electric machine : but the same phe
nomenon extends further ; for that effect takes place between
 bodies of the same kind, if they be non-conductors.         This is
 proved by Exper. 3, p. 9, of the same number of the Philosophical
 journal.
    32. A flat piece of the same glass as the spindle, being held
 at the end of a brass spring, and used as a rubber on the spindle,
 holding the brass part in my hand near the glass, in order to
                                                              restore

             respecting the Phcenomena     of Electricity.          105
restore from the ground the electric fluid carried away to the
prime conductor by the spindle, the gold' leaf of the electro
meter diverges as positive, though the rubber is of the same sub
stance as the spindle.      This is a peremptory demonstration that
the effect of friction is not to open the pores for receiving more             '
electric matter, which is discharged when the friction ceases, as
 Mr. Donovan conceives it : since both bodies, which in this case
exercise friction on each other, are of the same glass.
     33. Exper. 4, p. 10, shows that sealing-wax, used as rub
 ber over the glass spindle, becomes strongly negative, and renders
 tiie glass strongly positive.   And thus it is directly proved, that
 the cause of sealing-wax being rendered negative by friction
 with the glass, is that the latter takes some electric fluid from
 sealing-wax, which effect could not have been ascertained with-           .
 out the two electrometers.
     34. Now, in Exper. 1, a brass rubber applied to the glass cy
 linder is seen to become negative, and the glass cylinder made
positive; but in Exper. 6, having covered a glass cylinder with
 a thick coating of sealing-wax, producing in fact a sealing-
wax cylinder, the same brass rul'ber was rendered positive. These
experiments compared with each other, further demonstrate the
real electric effect of friction. But the next experiment will
place it beyond all doubt.                                          >
     35. Exper.   8 is made  with what    is called India beads, the
size and colour of a cherry : they are made, as I have been in
formed, of an inspissated vegetable oil, very elastic, not soluble
in water. I placed one on a glass spindle, and fitted to its shape
two narrow rubbers, one of naked brass, the other of brass co
vered with sealing-wax. With a very small motion of the winch,
that bead became negative, and the naked brass rubber became
positive; but the same bead became positive when the brass
rubber was covered with sealing-wax and this rubber was made
negative.
   36. These experiments afford a true analysis of the electric
effects of friction.    Its general effect, as I have stated, is to set
in motion the electric fluid residing on the surface of the bodies
which are rubbed ; and the consequence of that effect        is,
                                                               that the
body   which recedes  from   the point of friction  carries along with
it a part of that electric fluid; which effect extends even to the
case when the rubber and the body rubied are of the same sub
stance, when the latter suddenly recedes, and meet in its way a
conductor, before returning to the rubber.
   37. These experiments remove the difficulty which Mr. Do
novan found (p. 339) to reconcile the (supposed) equal distri
bution of the electric fluid with the impermeability of glass. The
                                                                   equal

106       Observations on   Mr.  Donovan's Reflections,   &c.
equal distribution is gratuitously supposed, since glass is but
an imperfect non-conductor when not covered with some resinous
varnish.
   38. Mr. Donovan says (p. 345) : "As to the fact whether
glass is actually impermeable, many experiments have been
made; but they all appear to be of doubtful force, and may be
explained in some manner, without supposing that electricity
passes   through."                   .                               i
   39. I have made in this respect some decisive experiments,
proving that when a glass rod transmits the electric fluid, it is
only by its surface.    I used for that purpose three glass rods of
the same glass and the same diameter — one remaining naked —
another covered all over with sealing-iuax — the third covered         ,
with sealing-wax, with only an interruption in the middle of its
length.     These rods were supported horizontally on insulating
pillars, which left their extremities accessible to the knob of a
Leyden vial. I used three very sensible electrometers, each
having a long brass conductor in order to connect them with
 the rods.
    Exp. I. Having placed the naked rod on the pillars, with
an electrometer at each end and one in the middle, and applied
the Leyden vial to one extremity, the electrometer near it first
diverged, then that in the middle, and soon that of the other
extremity, showing that some time was required for the propa
gation of the electric fluid even on the naked surface of glass.
    Exp. 2. Having used the rod entirely covered with sealing-
wax, a small motion was produced in the next electrometer,
by the influence of the vial, but none in the remote electro
 meters.
    Exp. 3. The rod with an interruption of the sealing-wax in
the middle of its length was to be the test. If glass were permeable,
the electrometer applied to that part ought to have been put in
motion ; but if it moves only along the surface of the glass, bet
 ing stopped by the sealing-wax, the electrometer applied to the
naked part in the middle cannot be put in motion.          The result
 of the experiment was, that, whatever time the Leyden vial re^
mained applied to that extremity, no motion was produced in
 that electrometer, any more than in that of the other extremity.
 It is therefore demonstrated that glass is absolutely impermeable
 to the electric fluid.
    40. A very specious objection of Mr. Donovan against Frank
lin's doctrine is thus expressed, p. 349 : ". Franklin supposes
that no electricity can be received on one surface, unless the
other can part with an equal quantity.      In the case of excitation
of the common cylinder, the inner surface having no communi
                                                               cation

                      respecting the Phenomena         of Electricity.               107
cation with conductors, can part with none.              How then can its
outer surface receive the great quantity we find in it ?" _ The
answer is however obvious, for this is the common effect of fric
tion.    The cylinder receives constantly electric fluid from the
rubber, especially when this is covered with a metallic amalgama ;
for it is in communication with the ground.              In that case it is
not necessary     that the opposite   surface  of  the    glass should part
with any electric fluid ; the whole process takes place on the
outward surface.        The rubber gives electric fluid to the glass
cylinder, which parts constantly with                   it,
                                                  in meeting the prime
 conductor; but the rubber communicating with the ground, fur^
 nishes also constantly     new quantity of the fluid.

    43. Having expressed this idea to Dr. Franklin, he proposed
 to me an experiment, very difficult to execute, but which he en
 couraged me to undertake.        The -apparatus consisted of glass              a
 syphon, the legs of which were about three feet distant from each
 other    the curve began about three inches above the point at
             ;
 which stood the common barometer at that moment.                     When
 the syphon was filled with mercury          was inverted, with its two
                                                  it
 legs plunged into separate cups, each resting on an insulating
 stand    these cups received the mercury descending from the
             :
 upper curve, and the column thus separating, there were two
 barometers with a common vaccum.
    44. In that situation, when        spark was given with

   vial to one of the cups, a luminous arch was seen filling the top
   of the syphon, and a spark could be drawn from the other cup,
   thus showing that it was not a conductor of the electric fluid.
      45. There remained to be performed the second part of the
  experiment and the most difficult, namely, to have the mercury
  loil in that long syphon. I succeeded in this operation; and when
  the syphon was placed with its legs in the cups, that complete
  vacuum ceased to be a conductor.       The rain sparks were given to
  one cup, none was drawn from the other.
      46. This experiment convinced Dr. Franklin of my system,
  that the electric fluid was a sort of parasite substance, which, on
  our globe and its atmosphere, was distributed on all other mat
  ters, and nowhere accumulated so as to produce lightnings, and
  their common attendants thunders ; but that these phenomena
  proceed from the decomposition of the atmospheric air by a
  certain process, which manifests that the electric fluid enters into
  the composition of that air, a fluid s?ii generis, and not a mix
  ture of different kinds of air, as it was supposed in the new che
  mical theory.      Which conclusion of my long course of experi
 ments serves as the basis of my work under the title of Introduc
 tion a la Physique terrestre par les Fluides expansibles.

 Sir, —    H aving read in     a cotemporary journal,  that Nathaniel
 Wynch, Esq.     has presented to the Geological  Society an account
 of the Geology of Durham and Northumberland, and has men
 tioned therein, that the " grind-stone sill" furnishes the cele
brated Newcastle Grindstones (dug on Gateshead Fell, as I am
 informed) : now on reference to Mr. Westgarth Forster's

 tise on a Section of the Strata," pages 149 and 31, I find him

 XX. Letter from M. Ampere             to Count    Berthollet,   on i/te
     Determination of the Proportions in which Bodies are com-
    lined, according to the respective Number and Arrangement
     of the Particles of which their integrant Molecules are
    composed.
                           [Continued from p. 43.]
If    we now     proceed to consider the primitive forms of the cry
stals recognised by mineralogists, and regard them as the re-,
presentative forms of the most simple particles, admitting into
these particles as many molecules as the corresponding forms
have summits, we shall fmd that they are five in number ; the
tetrahedron, the octahedron, the parallelopipedon, the hexahedrat
prism, and the rhomboidal dodecahedron.
    The particles corresponding to these representative forms are
composed of 4, 6, 8, 12 and 14 molecules; the three first of
these numbers are those which we require to explain the forma
tion of the gases to be immediately cited.          I have shown in my
memoir that the number 1 2 is that which we must employ in
order to express the composition of the particles of several very
remarkable combinations, and that number 14 accounts for
that of the particles of the nitric acid, as it will be if we can
obtain it without water, for that of the particles of the muriate
of ammonia, &c.
    Let  us now see how the molecules        may be united    according
to these different forms :
    Two molecules being supposed to be united on a line, to give
a clearer idea of their respective position ; if we add thereto
                                                                    two

                                                     at first in one
two other molecules united in the same manner,
                                                    cut  each other
and the same plan, so that the two linea mutually
into two equal parts ; and if we afterwards remove them, by
                                                  that which they
keeping them always in a situation parallel to
had on this plan, we shall obtain a tetrahedron, which
                                                              will be
regular in the case only where the two lines were  equally   perpen
                                                                from
dicular to each other, and where they have been removed
each other to a distance, which is to their length as 1 : V 2.
   Let us new conceive three molecules joined by lines form
ing any given triangle;      let us place in the same plan an
other triangle equal to the first, and of which the situation is
such that the two triangles have their centre of gravity at the
same point, and their equal sides respectively parallel. Separating
these two triangles, so that the three sides of each triangle
                                                                  we
may remain constantly parallel to their primitive position,
shall obtain six points placed as they ought    to be   to represent
the six summits of an octahedron, which will be regular only
in the case where we have thus joined two equilateral triangles,
and where we have separated them perpendicularly to their plan
from a quantity which is to one of their sides as */ 2 V 3.
       If we suppose in the case of the tetrahedron which we draw
by the two lines of which we have spoken, two plans parallel
between them, and we place in each of them a line which re
presents the position in which will be found the line of the other
plan before they had been separated, the extremities of these
 two new lines will be the four summits of a symmetrical tetra
 hedron at the first, which shall have its centre of gravity at the
same point, and the eight summits of those two tetrahedrons
joined in this manner will be those of a parallelopipedon.          It  is-
 thus that the parallelopipedon form results from the union      of  two
 tetrahedrons.   It   is easy to see that when the two tetrahedrons
 are regular the parallelopipedon becomes a cube;        a  rhomboidal
 parallelopipedon     when   the tetrahedrons  are  regular  pyramids;
    astraight prism with rhomboidal bases when four ridges of everv
 tetrahedron are equal to each other      ;   and finaHy, the base    of
  this prism becomes    a square when to this condition   is  added the
  equality of the two other ridges.    In the case of the octahedron,
    ifwe place in the same way in the plans of two triangles,         of
 which we have spoken, those which represent the position in
  which will be found the triangle of the other plan before they
  had been separated, the six angles of these two new triangles
  will be the six summits of an octahedron symmetrical to the
   first, which shall have its centre of gravity at the same points     ;
   and the twelve summits of those two octahedrons, thus joined,
   will be those of a   hexahedral prism  :  this form results, there

                         in Chemical Comlinations.                 Ill
fore, from the junction of two octahedrons.            The hexahedral
prism     will not be straight, unless so far as we shall have removed
the two first triangles in a direction perpendicular to their plan,
and it will have for its base a regular hexagon only in the case
where those two triangles are equilateral.        We may remark, that
iu the hexahedral prism formed in this way with two regular oc
tahedrons, the height is to the sides of the bases as V 2 : 1 .
     In general, the examination of the circumstances which re
 sult from the regularity or irregularity of the particles which
 are united to each other, as two tetrahedrons are in order to pro
 duce a parallelopipedon, and two octahedrons in order to give
 birth to a hexahedral prism, requires very complex considerations,
 which are of no use to the explanation of the theory which I am
 describing, while we are merely occupied with the number of
 the molecules of each particle, and cannot have an application.
 But when we study under this point of view the primitive forms
 of the crystals given by observation, I shall put them out of
 consideration in this extract ; and as it will only be necessary to
 speak of the number of the molecules of which the particles
 formed by the union of other particles already known are com
 posed, I shall consider as regular all the tetrahedrons and octa
 hedrons, the various combinations of which I shall examine.
 It will be easy, by the help of a few reflections, to form an idea
 of the modifications which the results of this examination will
 undergo in cases where these polyhedrons are irregular.
      It is evident, that by placing at the same point the centres
  of gravity of two tetrahedrons and an octahedron, so as that
  the two former should make a cube, and the situation and di
 mensions of the octahedron are such that the ridges of this cube
  and those of the octahedron mutually cut each other at right
  angles into two equal parts, the polyhedron with 14 summits
  which will result from their junction will be the dodecahedron,
  the last of the primitive forms given by the mechanical division of
  the crystals ; for we ought not to reckon among these forms the
   double pyramid with hexagonal bases, admitted at first in order
  to explain the crystallization     of quartz, and brought back after
   wards to a parallelopipedon.
      It appears from what we have said, that when particles are
  united into a single particle, it is by placing themselves in such
   a way that, the centres of gravity of the component particles
   being at the same points, the summits of the one are placed in
   the intervals left by the summits' of the others, and vice versa.
   It is in this way that I consider chemical combination; and here
   it differs from the aggregation of similar particles, which takes
   place by simple juxtaposition, as is seen in that elegant theory
   of crystallization which the sciences owe to M, Hauy,            It is

112                  On Numerical Proportions
also in this way that \ have obtained, by combining other num
bers, tetrahedrons and octahedrons, the various representative
forms required for the explanation upon the same principles of
all the combinations in a determinate ratio which are known to
me.
    On attempting to join tetrahedrons and octahedrons in all
possible ways, we find that there result from most of them re
presentative forms in which the various molecules are arranged
in an irregular manner, and that there are some in one direction,
without there being any in another direction corresponding to
the first.   All these forms ought to be rejected, and we observe
in fact, that the proportions which they suppose in chemical
combinations are not met with in nature.          If we try, for in
stance, to combine tetrahedrons and octahedrons, so as that the
number of the former shall be the half of that of the latter, we
find only awkward forms which do not present > any regularity,
or any proportion between the relative sizes of their different
faces.     Hence we ought to conclude that a body A, the particles
of which have for their representative form tetrahedrons, and a
body B, of which the particles are represented by octahedrous,
will not unite so as that there shall be in the combination one
                                                                     '
proportion of A and two proportions of B : on the contrary,
this combination will be easy between two proportions of A and
one of B, since two tetrahedrons and one octahedron form by
their junction a dodecahedron.       In the same case, A and B will
unite in equal proportions by means of two forms which I shall
 describe, and in which the number of the tetrahedrons is equal
to that of the octahedrons.
    1. An octahedron     may be joined with a tetrahedron,        by
placitig the summits of the octahedron on the prolongations of
the lines which, issuing from the centre of gravity of the tetra
 hedron, pass by the middles of its six ridges : we thus form a
polyhedron with ten summits and sixteen triangular faces, four
 equilateral and twelve isosceles, to which I shall give the name
 of hexadecahedron.
    2. Two octahedrons joined in a hexahedral prism mav be
joined with two tetrahedrons forming a cube, in a manner ana
logous to that in which an octahedron is united to a cube in the
 dodecahedron.      In order to form a clear idea of this combina
 tion, we   must  consider one of the diagonals of the cube as the
 axis of this polyhedron, and elevate for it a plan perpendicular
passing by the centre of the cube.        This plan will cut six of
its ridges into two equal parts, the points of division being si
tuated like the six angles of a regular hexagon, by placing
 thereon the middles of the six vertical ridges of a hexahedral
prism formed by the junction of two regular octahedrons : the
                                                             twenty

                    in Chemical Combinations*                     113
 twenty summits of this polyhedron will be those of a new poly
hedron which will have 30 faces ; viz. six rectangular parallelo
grams and 24 isosceles triangles : I shall give it the name of tri-
 acontahedron.
    It is easy to see from this construction that the diagonal of
the cube is equal to that of the prism, and that in this way
all the summits of the triacontahedron- are in one and the same
spherical surface.
    It will be in vain to endeavour to form other combinations
presenting some regularity by combining two of the foregoing
polyhedrons.
                *
                  Let us proceed to another mode of combination.
 If we consider twelve points placed with regard to each other
as the middles of the twelve ridges of a cube, these points will
be situated by fours in three rectangular plans : hence it fol
lows, that if we place at the first four the four angles of the
square base common to the two pyramids of which one of the
octohedrons is composed, to the other four the four angles of
the base of a second octohedron, and to the other four those
of a third octohedron, the summits of the three octohedrons
Will be two and two in the intersections of the three rectangular
plans, and these 1 8 summits will be those of a polyhedron with
32 triangular faces, eight of which will be equilateral and 24 iso
sceles i I shall give to this polyhedron the name of trioctohe-
dron, which refers to its generation.
    The trioctohedron may, like the octohedron, be combined
with two tetrahedrons forming a cube : for this purpose we shall
prolong the plans of its triangular isosceles faces from the side at
which they are joined with the equilateral faces until these plans
meet by threes outside of the polyhedron opposite those last
faces.    The eight points thus determined are evidently situated
with respect to each other like the eight summits of a cube :
hence it follows that we might thereon place the eight summits
of two tetrahedrons, the union of which with the trioctohedron
 will form a polyhedron with 26 summits and 24 equal quadrilateral
faces.    The trapezoidal form of the mineralogists is a particular
case of this form, which results from a certain proportion between
the axis and the sides of the square bases of the straight octo
hedrons, of which we may conceive the trioctohedron to be
formed.     I shall in general preserve the name of trapezoidal,
as expressing a property always belonging to        it,
                                                     whatever are the
dimensions of these octohedrons.
  It   isnot with tetrahedrons as with octohedrons        :we cannot
juiite three of them in a    polyhedron  which   presents some   regu
larity but there exists one formed
       ;                                   the combination of four
                                          by
tetrahedrons. In arder to obtain    it, we shall consider four points
    Vol. 46. No. 202. Feb. 1815.               II             situated

114                  On Numerical Proportions.
situated as the four summits of a tetrahedron equal to the four
which we wish to join, and we shall conceive that at each of
these points is placed one of the summits of each tetrahedron ;
whereas the three other summits of the same tetrahedron are in
the plan which passes by the three other points, and correspond
to the middles of the intervals which they leave between them.
I shall give to the polyhedron resulting from this combination of
four tetrahedrons so united, the name of tetra-tetrahedron.
This polyhedron has sixteen summits and twenty-eight tri-
isosceles.
     We shall easily demonstrate, that if we prolong the plans of
the twelve isosceles faces adjacent to the four equilateral faces of
the side where they join to those faces, the prolongation of those
plans will meet by threes outside of the tetrahedron, in four
points corresponding to the middles of its four equilateral faces,
and which will be the summits of a fifth tetrahedron equal to
the four preceding ones : by uniting it with them, we have the
twenty summits of the polyhedron which I have called penta-
tetrahedron, and which has twenty-four faces ; viz. twelve qua--
drilaterals and twelve isosceles triangles.
     If we again consider twelve points situated with regard to
each other as the middles of the twelve ridges of a cube, and
place a tetrahedron so that, its centre of gravity being at the
same point with that of the cube, two of its ridges opposite pass
by four of these points ; and if we do the same thing in succes*
sion with respect to five other tetrahedrons, in order that the
number of the summits should be the same in all directions, we
shall obtain a polyhedron with 24 summits and 14 faces, six
squares, and eight hexagons, which I shall call hexa-tetrahe-
dron.
     These hexagons, all equal to each other, will have each three
sides greater and three smaller, which will be to each other as
 1 i  a/2-1.
     This polyhedron  is evidently an octohedron only, of which
the summits are truncated by plans perpendicular to its three
axes : its combinations with other representative forms are more
numerous than those of any of the preceding polyhedrons.
     We may at first combine it with an octohedron situated in
such a way that, having its centre of gravity at the same point,
all the faces and all the ridges of this octohedron shall be pa
rallel to those of the octohedron ; from which we may conceive
that the hexa-tetrahedron is the result of truncatures, by being
solely subjected to the condition of its dimensions being less than
those of the latter, in order that the polyhedron thus formed
                                                                may

                     in Chemical Combinations.
 may not have re-entering angles.       This polyhedron only differs
 from the hexa-tetrahedron in having, besides the latter, regular
pyramids raised on its square faces.     I shall call it a pyramidated
 hexa-tetrahedron .
    We may also combine the hexa-tetrahedron with a cube, by
 uniting it to the very cube which has served for its construction.
 The polyhedron which results from this combination               being
 formed by the union of a cube and a hexa-tetrahedron,         I gave it
 the name of cube-hexa-tetrahedron        ; it has 32 summits and
 54 faces ; viz. six squares, and 48 isosceles triangles.
    If we prolong in this polyhedron the plans of the twenty-four
 triangular faces adjacent to the square faces on the side where
 they join those faces, until they cut each other by fours outside
 of the polyhedron opposite to those squares, we shall obtain a
 new representative form, produced by the union of a hexa-tetra
 hedron, a cube, and an octohedron which will have 38 sum
 mits and 48 faces, the half of which will be equal rhombs> and
 the other half isosceles triangles also equal among each other.
 In order to designate it by a name derived from this property,
 which distinguishes it from all the other representative forms in
 which we find at once tetrahedrons and octohedrons, I shall call it
 amphihedron.
     In order to form a simple idea of the combination of the
hexa-tetrahedron with a hexahedral prism formed by the union
 of two regular octohedrons, we shall conceive the hexa-tetra
 hedron placed in such a way that two of its hexagonal faces shall
 be horizontal, when the middles of its six square faces will be
 placed as the six summits of one of the octohedrons of which
 the prism is composed.     We may then place those six summits
 on the perpendiculars elevated in the midst of these faces.        The
 six other summits of the hexahedral prism will answer to the
 six hexagonal faces of the hexa-tetrahedron different from those
 which we have placed horizontally, i. e. in a direction perpendi
 cular to the axis of the prism.     If we determine the respective
 dimensions of the two polyhedrons, so that each side of the bases
 of the prism shall meet the ridge of the hexa-tetrahedron, which
 separates those of its faces to which the two extremities of this
 side answer, we shall obtain a representative form composed
 of six tetrahedrons and two octohedrons which will have 36
 summits and 50 faces ; viz. two hexagons similar to those of
the hexa-tetrahedron,     12 quadrilaterals, 24 isosceles triangles,
and 12 scalene triangles.    I shall give it the name of pentaconta-
hedron.
    In order to unite a hexa-tetrahedron with a trioctohedron, it
is sufficient to place one of the three octohedrons of which the
latter is composed in the same way as the octohedron which we
                               H  2                                have

116              On Fire Damps in Mines,             &c.
have joined to the hexa-tetrahedron    in order to change it into
a pyramidated hexa-tetrahedron.      The result of this combina
tion is a polyhedron with 24 summits and 80 triangular faces.
I shall give it the name of octocontahedron.

                          To    Mr.   Tillock.
Sir, —   I  have to regret that none of the many practical coal
masters, viewers, or agents, who are readers of your useful work,
have attended to the requests that I veutured to address to them,
in page 303 of your last volume, for communications on the
causes and prevention of the enormous evils arising from fire
damp in coal mines.        Since then I have read • in a periodical
work, to which I there alluded, a long paper by the Editor, giving
a Geognostical Sketch of Northumberland,             Durham, &c. — ou
which I beg to remark, that most of the facts therein mentioned,
which are useful, and numerous others such, respecting the geo
logy of this district, were already before the public, in the sections
and writings of Millar, Forster, Bailey, Farey, Wynch, &c. ; but
of whose prior labours in the same field, not a hint escapes the
learned Editor : he has however thought proper in a long note
(written in his peculiar manner) to notice my former letter to you,
referred to above ; and assuming therein, without sufficient rea
son, that his Newcastle correspondent and myself meant to
assert, that sulphuretted hydrogen gas occasioned the repeated
explosions in Felling Colliery ; proceeds to say,
                                                       " Now I do not
see, how iron pyrites can contribute to the formation of carlu-
relted hydrogen       a thing never asserted by us, but, thai probably
pvrites and bad small coals might contribute to the dangerous
accumulation of inflammable gas ; being well aware that a part of
it, at least, issued in    blowers or jets, from newly opened joints
in the coal and in its roof and floor, as Mr. Buddie has so well
described.
   The geognostical sketch alluded to, mentions, among the late
discoveries of its author in the mines of this district, that cubes
of fluor spar have been entirely removed therefrom, without his
being able to tell how or where           he says, " The change took

surface of the earth, surrounded on all sides by walls of solid

mentions also, icicle-like masses of fused galena, being found
suspended in cavities in some of the veins that in some districts

knotty geognostic points, lie truly remarks,they show us, that t( we
are much further from an accurate knowledge of the constituents df
bodies, than is generally believed, and that several of our element*

are still going on in the internal parts of the earth, which are
totally beyond our comprehension."     I ask no more of the learned
Editor, than to apply these, his own maxims, to the causes of the
evolution of inflammable gas in coal mines.
   Notwithstanding the long period this Editor boasts, of having
spent in coal countries, and his late high gftognostic pretension*,
he must submit to be told by practical colliers, that such great
numbers    of persons having been killed at once, on the too frequent
explosions of late years in the Newcastle pits, has arisen from
 the magnitude of their under-ground works, and the small num
ber of shafts they sink for separate works, owing to their great
expense ; and has not been owing to the mere circumstance of
their great depth beneath the surface ; much less so, to the ex
treme ignorance of the art of coal-mining, with which his "de
licacy*," great as it          is,has not permitted him to neglect
charging on them    :   mixed indeed, with certain sly hints, that he
himself has something new and wonderful to propose, whereby
collieries may " be constructed on more scientific principles,"
when the funds of the new Society shall enable them,              by
                                                                 pre   a

 " the numerous lives

   If   the learned Editor would condescend to, inquire properly of
 the practical men, the facts through six or eight times as many
coal-districts as he seems yet to be sufficiently acquainted with,
and to consult the published accounts of violent explosions in
coal-pits, which have been recorded in English publications,
from the earliest ones mentioned in the Philosophical Transac

ficiency in information, ona subject in which he seems so fond of obtrud
ing himself; but let me assure him, from exteusire experience among the
class of men whom he thus asperses, that the very reverse   is the case, and
that his cause of complaint (if just?)is  to be sought in his oan manner of
communicating: this' at least   is the explanation offered by several of his
personal acquaintance.

     Mr. Buddie has stated_, that some pits not long opened, are
subject to very destructive explosions ; What then becomes of
our Editor's alleged accumulation of gas through ages, in the

reverse is the case.

viz. "both the sand-stone and slate-clay form the roof and floor
 of coal-beds, but the latter much more frequently than the for

 that sand-stone, properly so called, was ever observed by the
 writer as the immediate floor of a coal bed ? If so, he wjll confer
 an obligation on myself and many others, who have never seen
 the like, if he will mention the particular pit and coal bed, in as
 many instances as he may be able.
     Before I conclude, let me remark, that however clearly the

 quiesced in, the positions contained in the first twelve pages of
 his last number, and two plates, as to " rents ;" to men of my

   In   examining   the changes which light undergoes during its
   passage   through transparent bodies, we not only receive infor
   mation respecting the properties of that mysterious agent ; but
   we are in some measure made acquainted with the composition
   of the substances themselves, and with the manner in which their
   ingredients are combined.         The optical phenomena, therefore,
   which bodies exhibit in their action upon light, are so many
   tests, to which the philosopher may have recourse, either in sup
   plying the place of chemical analysis, or in correcting and mo
   difying its results.    A difference in the optical properties of two
   bodies,  is generally  an infallible indication of a difference in their

elementary principles ; and whatever confidence we may place
in the skill of the chemist, or in the accuracy of his methods, the
mind can never rest satisfied with the results of an analysis which
is directly opposed by optical phenomena.
     It is highly desirable, therefore, that the chemical philosopher
would avail himself more frequently of the agencies of light in
the prosecution of his inquiries.       The various products to which
 his attention is constantly directed, cannot always be preserved
 for subsequent examination, and can seldom be procured by the
 experimental philosopher.        An opportunity is thus lost of con
 firming    his  own  results, and of contributing most essentially to
 the progress of optical knowledge.        It is by the alliance, indeed,
 of chemistry with optics, that great revolutions are yet;to be ef
 fected in physics ; and the time is probably not very distant,
 when, by their united efforts, we shall be able to develop those
 mysterious relations among the elementary principles of matter
 which hypothesis has scarcely ventured to anticipate.
     In the following paper, I propose to describe the optical pro
 perties of sulphuret of carbon, carbonate of barytes, and nitrate
 of potash, and to illustrate the conclusions to which some of these
 properties lead, respecting the structure of doubly refracting
  crystals.
                          I. Sulphuret of Carlon.
     This remarkable       fluid was lately discovered by Lampadius.
  It  is- pure    and colourless like water ; has a specific gravity of
  1*272 j is remarkable for its extreme volatility; and is composed
  of 85 parts of sulphur, and 15 of carbon. .
      Owing to the great length of spectrum which this substance
  produces, I found considerable difficulty in measuring the mean
  index of refraction.        By taking the bisecting ray beyond the
  green rays,     and very considerably advanced upon the blue space,
  I obtained the following results :
               Angle of the prism                         8° 10'
               Angle of refraction                        5° 38'
                Refractive power                          1*687
   By considering the bisecting ray, as passing through the green
  space, and near its confines with the blue, the following mea
  sures were obtained :
                Angle of the prism                      8Q   10'
                Angle of refraction                     5° 27'
                Refractive power                        1*6632
   As the sulphuret of carbon has nearly the same action upon the
   red and green rays, as balsam of Tolu, I have no doubt but
   that the bisecting ray is considerably advanced upon the blue
   space, and that the mean index of refraction is nearly 1 -680.
                                      H 4                         A prism

 120                   On the Optical Properties
    A prism of flint glass, with a refracting angle of 20° 53', cor
rects the colour produced by a prism of sulphuret of carbon,
having a refracting angle of 8° 10'; the light being incident
perpendicularly upon the fluid prism.          Hence it follows, that
the dispersive power       of the sulphuret,   or the value of —— -
is 0* 1 1 5, R being the index of refraction, and d the part of the
whole refraction to which the dispersion is equal ; and that the
refractive power of the extreme red ray is 1*623, and the re
fractive power of the extreme blue ray 1 "737-
    From these experiments we conclude, that the sulphuret of
 carbon exceeds all fluid bodies in refractive power, surpassing
 even flint-glass, topaz and tourmaline; and that in dispersive
power, it exceeds every fluid Substance, except, oil of cassia,
 holding an intermediate place between phosphorus and balsam
 of Tom.
    These relations will be better understood      from the following
 short tables :

    Although    oil of cassia surpasses the sulphuret of carbon in its
 power of dispersion ; yet, from the yellow colour with which it
is always tinged, it is greatly inferior to the latter, as an optical
 fluid, unless in cases where a very thin concave lens is required.
 The extreme volatility of the sulphuret is undoubtedly a disad
 vantage to which the oil is not liable ; but as this volatility may
 be restrained, we have no hesitation in considering the sulphuret
 of carbon, as a fluid of great value in optical researches, and
 which may yet be of incalculable service in the construction of
 optical instruments.      All other fluids are separated from these
 two, in their optical properties, by an immense interval ; and
 hence we are of opinion, that oil of cassia will yet be found to
 consist of ingredients as remarkable as those which enter into
 the composition of sulphuret of carbon.       . .

                         of Carbonate of Barytes.                  121
                       II. Carbonate of Barytes.
     The native carbonate of barytes possesses, like the agate, the
remarkable faculty of forming two images, one of which is bright,
and the other nebulous.       The shapeless appearance of the agate ;
its heterogeneous and imperfect structure, and its anomalous
character in the mineral kingdom, corresponded well with the
singularity of its optical properties, and discouraged the antici
pation of-analogous phenomena, in minerals of a more perfect
structure.      I was, therefore, surprised to find the same charac
ter in carbonate of barytes, a mineral which has a regular cry
stalline form, and possesses two distinct refractive powers.      The
 index of refraction for the perfect or least refracted image is
  1 '540 ; and its dispersive power 0*0285.
     In order to observe with accuracy the phenomena presented
by the carbonate of barytes, I formed nine prisms, cut in different
directions, from the same specimen.          In one of these prisms,
 which was bounded by planes parallel to the strie or longitu
dinal joints, the least refracted image was extremely distinct,
while the other was a faint nebulous image, of a brownish-red
 hue.     It was small and round, and the intensity of its light was
inconsiderable, when compared with that of the bright image.
     When the image of a candle polarized by reflection, was
viewed through this prism, having the longitudinal joints pa
rallel to the plane of reflection, the light which formed the bright
 image of the candle was wholly reflected, while the nebulous
 light alone penetrated the mineral.       But when the longitudinal
joints were perpendicular to the plane of reflection, the light
 image became extremely distinct, in consequence of the nebulous
 light having now. refused to penetrate the prism.
      In a second prism, the nebulous or most refracted image was
 more luminous than in the first, and approached to a definite
 form ; the general shape of the candle being distinctly visible.
      In a third prism, the nebulous image was more luminous than
 in the last case, and the form of the candle still more distinctly
 seen ; but it had now the appearance of an assemblage of in-
 coincident images.
      In a fourth prism, in which the plane of refraction was pa
 rallel to the longitudinal joints, both the images were imperfect,
 and the most refracted image was extremely faint.        By inclining
 the prism, an image appeared on each side of the least refracted
 image; but they were polarized in the same manner, and were
 probably analogous to the two images which are frequently seen
 in specimens of calcareous spar.
     In a fifth prism, which was formed by planes nearly perpendi
cular to the longitudinal joints, four images were plainly visible,
all of which were imperfect, and consisted of circular arches of
                                                             -nebulous

                      On Ike Optical Properties
nebulous light.    The two middle ones, which were the principal
images, were equally luminous, and were polarized in an oppo
site manner, like all other double images ; but each of the two
outer images was polarized in the same manner as the bright
image furthest from it.      The most refracted of the two prin
 cipal images was in this case the more perfect of the two, and
exhibited a degree of prismatic colour so much greater than the
 other, that it obviously belonged to a higher dispersive power.
 When the light enters the prism, and emerges from it at equal
 angles, the four images are not distinctly separated, and are ex
tremely imperfect.      When the angle of incidence at the first
 surface of the prism is increased, the images become more and
 more distinct, and better separated ; but, by diminishing the
 angle of incidence, all the images approach one another, and
 are confounded into one mass of nebulous light.
     With a plate of carbonate of barytes, which was about two-
 tenths of an inch thick, and which had its surfaces at right an-
 gles to the direction of the longitudinal joints, the image of a
 candle was a large circular mass of light, when the incidence was
 perpendicular.     By inclining the plate, this mass was changed
 into an annular image : by increasing the inclination, it assumed
 the form of a crescent; and at a considerable angle of incidence,
 it was separated into three imperfect images, or circular arches
 of nebulous light, similar to those which were seen with the
 fifth prism.    The middle image, which was the brightest, con
 sisted of the ordinary and extraordinary image, which were not
 separated, in consequence of the parallelism of the refracting
 surfaces.    In one position of the plate, these arches were crossed
 hv other three similar arches, inclined to the first at an angle of
     '
  10 or 12=.
     The phenomena which have now been described, differ          jii
                                                                    se
 veral respects from those which are presented      by  the agate.   In
 the carbonate of barytes, the two images are distinctly sepa
 rated, and are, therefore, formed        by  two separate refractive
 powers ;   whereas in the agate, the bright image      isplaced in the
  centre of the nebulous mass.      In the carbonate of barytes, the
 imperfect image occupies    a  small space; but in the agate,      itis
 an elongated mass of light, extending about 7|° in length, and
  about 1°   7'in breadth, on each side of the bright image. These
 differences, however, are probably owing to the different ways
 in which the two minerals have been cut but   ;    it   isnot easy to
  submit this point to direct experiment, on account of the diffi
  culty of procuring  a   mass of agate, from which          variety of
                                                              a
  transparent prisms   could be obtained.   It  follows, however, from
  the theory of the depolarization of light, which  I   have explained
iu   another plucej and which     is  supported    by all the evidence
                                                                  which

                          of Nitrate of Potash.                  123
which any theory can possess, that the specimens of agate which
depolarize light must necessarily form two distinct images, — a
phenomenon to which we have found a rapid approximation in
the carbonate of barytes.
    The property which has now been explained, forms a simple
and infallible mineralogical character of the striated carbonate
of barytes ; and is particularly valuable to those who have been
perplexed by the numerous marks with which some writers have
laboured to distinguish it from its kindred minerals.        The as
sistance, indeed, which optics afford in discriminating minerals,
is of the most extensive kind ; and it is much to be wished, that
mineralogists would exchange many of their vague distinctions
for those unambiguous characters which bodies exhibit in the
 modifications they impress upon light.
     The Abbe Haiiy has, in some measure, begun this reforma
 tion, and has set a brilliant example of what may be effected by
 the aid of mathematical and physical acquirements.        In his ad
 mirable work on Crystallography, which has never been duly ap
 preciated in this country, he has created a new science, in which
 he has shown how to determine the integrant molecules of cry
 stallized bodies ; a»d how, from a few primitive forms, may be
 derived that endless variety of secondary crystals which adorn
 the mineral kingdom.        The recent discoveries which have been
 made in optics, enable us to give a new direction to these in
  teresting inquiries ; to determine the forms and even the angles
 of crystals from their optical properties ; and out of a mass of
 shapeless fragments, to reconstruct an artificial crystal, of which
 all the parts shall have the same relation as they had in nature
 to the axes and sides of the primitive crystalline form.
                         HI. Nitrate of Potash.
     This salt  possesses  the most remarkable optical properties of
  any crystal that is at present known, and its various actions upon
  light are of the most anomalous and instructive character.
     The crystals which I employed were all equiangular hexaedral
  prisms ; and the light was transmitted through two natural
  faces, separated by another face, so that they were inclined to
   each other at an angle of about 603. This inclination is by no
   means convenient for measuring refractive and dispersive powers ;
   but I attempted in vain to form artificial faces inclined at a less
   angle, and those means which I had found successful with other
  soft crystals, completely failed when applied to this salt.
      When a candle was viewed through the nitrate of potash, I
   observed a double refraction very much greater than that of cal
   careous spar, — a phenomenon which gave me the more surprise,
   as the Abbe" Haiiy, who examined many splendid crystals of this
   salt, ascribes to it the property of simple refraction.
                                                                   The

   124                   On  the    Optical Properties
      The least refracted image was a circular mass of white nebu
  lous light, condensed at its centre into a very faint image of the
  candle, but without any strong prismatic tinge ; while the light
  which had suffered the greatest refraction, formed a distinct and
  highly coloured image.           The great interval between the two
  images ; the achromatic      nebulosity      of the first, and the distinctness
  and deep colours of the second image, formed altogether a singular
 phenomenon, and, at the same              time, afforded an ocular demon
                                     '
  stration of the existence of two dispersive powers in doubly re
fracting crystals.
     The following measures of the refractive                powers of the two
  images were taken with the greatest care:
           Angle of the prism                                     60° 21'
           Angle of refraction for the 1st image . . 24° 8'

           Index of refraction for the 1st image . 1-3374
           Index of refraction for the 2d image.. 1'5156
     In order to confirm these results, I formed a new prism, and
 obtained the following measures :
           Angle of the prism                                     621 12'
           Angle of refraction for the 1st image . . 24° 48'
           Angle of refraction for the 2d image . . 40" 39'
           Index of refraction for the 1st image . .              1'3326
           Index of refraction for the 2d image . .                 •

     By taking a mean of these results, which are extremely near
 to each other, we obtain for the
           Least refractive power                                 1-3350
           Greatest refractive power                              1'5145
     Hence it   follows,   that    the   least   refraction    of nitrate   of pot
ash is almost exactly the same as that of water which is 1'3358,
—a result of such an extraordinary nature, that I felt it necessary
to confirm it by repeated observations.
    In measuring the dispersive power of this salt, we cannot ex
pect the same accuracy of result on account of the great angle
of the prism.        Owing to the nebulosity of the first image it is
impossible to measure its dispersive power ; but it evidently cor
responds with its low power of refraction.                    In order to cor
rect the dispersion of the second refraction, it requires a prism
of flint glass with an angle of nearly 60°.                   With an angle of
66°,   the   dispersion   is more      than   corrected    ;  but  with an angle
of 56° the correction is not nearly completed.                    The dispersive
powers due to these different angles are contained in the fol

  By taking  a mean between the two extreme observations, we
obtain  0'058 for the approximate dispersive power, — a result
which could scarcely have been anticipated from the substances
which enter into the composition of nitre.      The following table
will show the relation which this measure bears to the dispersive
powers of other bodies :

    In order to examine the character of the rays which form the
two images, I polarized the light of a candle by reflection from
glass, and viewed it through two of the parallel faces of a hex-
aedral prism of nitre.     When the edges or common sections of
its faces were parallel to the plane of reflection, a bright image
of the candle was seen in the middle of a mass of nebulous light,
exactly similar to what happens in the agate when its veins are
parallel to the plane of reflection.   But upon turning round the
crystal  of nitre,  the bright image gradually vanished, while the
nebulous light increased ; and when the edges of the crystal
were perpendicular to the plane of reflection, the bright image
was extinguished, and the nebulous light a maximum.           When
the reflected image of the candle is viewed through two inclined
faces of the nitre, the two images Vanish alternately, like those
formed by all doubly refracting crystals.
   A prism of nitrate of potash, having its refracting surfaces
equally inclined to the axis of the hexaedral crystal, possesses
the faculty of depolarizin'g light ; and hence it follows, from the
theory of depolarization, that the prism must, in this case, form
two distinct images.
   The two neutral axes of this salt are parallel and perpendi
cular to the sides of the hexaedral prism; and the depolarizing
axes are parallel to the diagonals of the square base common to
the two pyramids which compose its primitive rectangular oc-
taedron.     The least refracted image is that which is produced
by the extraordinary law of refraction.
   The beautiful coloured rings which I exhibited to the Society,
as produced by the action of topaz upon polarized light, and
which I have also discovered in the agate, and in a great variety
of other bodies*, exist also, but in a very singular manner, in
the nitrate of potash.
   By comparing in a rude manner the coloured rings formed by
different bodies, with the thickness of the plates by which they
were produced, I concluded that the conjugate diameters of the
              * See Phil. Trans. Lrmtf.   ISM,   part i.   fj.   218.
                                                                        ring-,

rings were nearly as            ^-p-, m being the index           of refraction.    In
the nitrate of potash, however, their magnitude is quite anoma
lous, as it produces along the axis of the hexaedral prism a series .
of miniature rings, nearly eight times less than they should have
been according to the preceding law.           The beautiful generaliza
tion of the phenomena      of  coloured    rings, which we owe to the
genius of the celebrated Biot, may perhaps afford an explanation
of this apparent anomaly.
   The carbonate of potash forms also two images, one of which
is bright, and the other nebulous.            They are polarized in an
opposite  manner,  like  those  formed    by the nitrate of potash, but
the nebulous image    is  more    distinct   in the carbonate.   With a
prism bounded by natural faces, and having a refracting angle of
49° 53', I obtained the following measures of its mean refractive
power   :
        Index of refraction for the nebulous image                  .     1'379
        Index of refraction for the bright image .                  .     1'482
        IV. On the Structure of doubly refracting Crystals.
   Notwithstanding the numerous discoveries which have recently
appeared respecting the polarization of light, no attempt has
been made to apply them in solving the problem of double re
fraction. They furnish us, indeed, with a variety of beautiful
phenomena, analogous to the polarization of light, which always
accompanies the production of two images ; but they afford no
ground of conjecture respecting the separation of the pencil into
two parts.
   When I discovered the property possessed by the agate, of
forming a bright and a nebulous image, and of polarizing them in
an opposite manner, like all doubly refracting crystals, I was suffi
ciently aware of the conclusions which it authorized*; but as
no other crystallized body exhibited analogous phenomena, I
contented myself with stating these conclusions as mere conjec
tures, which required the sanction of numerous experiments.
   In the carbonate of barytes, however, and in the nitrate and
carbonate of potash, we are presented with properties analogous
to those of the agate, and are therefore enabled to resume this
subject, with that confidence which can only be derived from
multiplied observations.                                        , ..
   When we examine the two images formed by calcareous spar
and other perfectly transparent crystals, we find that they have
the same magnitude, and are equally luminous and distinct..
There    is,
          therefore, no circumstance which can lead, us to sup
pose, that the light which forms the one image passes through a
               *
                   See   Phil, Trans. Lond.   1813, part   i.   p. 101.
                                                                                  part

                       of doubly refracting Crystals.               1 27
part of the crystal, having a different structure from that which
transmits the light of the other image.            In the carbonate of
barytes, however, where the transparency of the crystal is imper
fect, one of the images is nebulous and imperfect; and as the
same phenomenon is exhibited in the agate and in the im
perfectly transparent crystals of the nitrate and carbonate
of potash, we are entitled to conclude, that the light which
forms the imperfect image is transmitted through the imperfect
structure ; while the light which forms the bright image is
transmitted through a structure of a more perfect kind.             The
imperfect transparency, therefore, of the crystal, and the nebu
lous character of one of the images, can be considered in no
 other relation than that of cause and effect.
     From the optical properties of the agate, this conclusion de
rives a still higher degree of probability.     The two images formed
 by   this mineral   are  not similar to  each other, like those of cal
 careous spar, though they possess exactly the same properties.
 One of them is bright and distinct, and the other is a mass of
 nebulous light.       Now it happens that the agate possesses two
 different kinds of structure, corresponding to the characters of
 its two images, and distinctly perceptible even to the naked eye.
 One of these structures is composed of small serpentine lines
like the figures 3333, resembling the surface of water ruffled by
 a gentle breeze ; and I have a specimen in my possession, one-
 half of which has much larger serpentine lines than the other.
 The light which passes through the serpentine lines, is that which
 forms the nebulous image ; while that which passes between
  them forms the distinct image.         This may be demonstrated by
 a variety of experiments.
     When the light is transmitted through a part of the agate that
  has the largest serpentina lines, the nebulous image has an ap
  pearance different from that which it has when the light is
  transmitted through the other part where the serpentine line*
  are smaller.     If the agate is inclined in the direction of the ser
  pentine lines, so as not to prevent the rays from passing between
  them, the bright image will be distinctly visible as before ; but
  when the agate is inclined in a direction at right angles to this,
  so as to prevent the rays from passing between the serpentine
  lines, the whole of the transmitted light is nebulous.        Hence it
  follows, that the nebulous image is produced by          the imperfect
  structure of the agate, indicated by the serpentine lines ; while
  the bright image is produced by a structure the same as that of
  all other transparent bodies.
      The curvature of the nebulous light, in some specimens of
  agate with incurvated veins, and its constant parallelism to the
                                                                 lamine,

  12&       On the Structure     of doully refracting Crystals.
 lamina?, and to the direction of the serpentine lines, give addi
 tional probability to this conclusion.
     Here, then, we have a case of the most unequivocal kind, in
 which one image of a doubly refracting crystal is produced by
 one structure, or by one part of the crystal, while the other
 image is produced by another structure, or another part of the
 crystal ; and hence we are led to conclude, in general, that the
 two images exhibited by all doubly refracting bodies, are formed
 by two different structures, related to some axis or fixed line in
 the primitive crystal.       Whether this difference of structure is
 produced by a difference in the arrangement of the elementary
 molecules, or is owing to a combination of different ingredients,
 is a point which still remains to be determined.
    The phenomena presented by the agate and the carbonate of
 barytes, convey still further information respecting the structure
 of these imperfect crystals.      In one direction, the light trans
 mitted by the agate is wholly nebulous; the perfect image being
 converted into a shapeless cloudy mass, and confounded with
the nebulous image.         In another direction, one of the images is
 distinct and perfectly formed ; and in one specimen, which has
the faculty of depolarization, there must necessarily be two per
fect images.      In a prism of the carbonate of baryti.s, both the
images were imperfect.          In a second prism, the one image was
nebulous, and the other distinctly formed ; while, in other prisms,
there was a rapid approximation to two perfect images.            Hence
it follows, that the imperfect structure, which, in general, trans -
mits only a mass of nebulous light, allows a distinct image to be
formed, when the rays are incident in one particular direction ;
while the perfect structure, which in general gives a distinct
image, allows an imperfect image to be formed, when the light
penetrates it by a particular path.
    These inferences, which I conceive to be irresistible, have a
higher degree of importance than we may at first be disposed to
attach to them.       They form a real step in the explanation of
double images, and indicate a part of that structure which is
necessary to their formation.         The other phenomena of double
refraction are still involved in obscurity.       The opposite polariza
tion of the two pencils may be explained by supposing the crv
stal to consist of lamine inclined in various directions ; and, as
I have shown in another place *, the same phtenomena may be
actually produced by an artificial crystal composed of bundles of
glass plates.     The most perplexing point, however, is the extra
ordinary   refraction   which takes place at a perpendicular inci
dence. Whether this phenomenon is the result of an extract

 of these causes, which I have discovered in mother of pearl*,
present an analogy, by no means remote, to the phenomena of
 double refraction.

     Thomas     Forster, Esq.
                                To   Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir, — In     a former paper I endeavoured to point out some of
the practical applications of the new discoveries into the struc
ture and functions of the brain, with a view to show the various
means in which it might become useful to society.                 For I consi
der every inquiry as to the particular utility of any science to be
merged in the general question, Whether or no it be the illus
tration of truth ? Yet it is of use to particularize the special pur
poses for which it may be employed.                  I proceed to mention
briefly a few curious facts relative to the history of certain kinds
of aberration of mind, and to their connexion with particular
organization.
     It seems to me, that we cannot obtain any accurate knowledge
of the nature of this mental disorder, till we have first become
acquainted with the mind in its healthy state.              Insanity consists
in the erroneous or inordinate energy of the functions of the mind
in general, or of some of the faculties in particular.                To learu
the physiological history of these, we must previously know what
aTe the primitive faculties of the mind in a healthy condition ;
we must first know the passions, learn what are the results of
primitive and uncompounded organs, and what are compounded
   * This substance, whose remarkable
                                           optical properties I  have explained
in another place, resembles the agate,    the carbonate of barytes, and the
nitrate and carbonate of potash, in giving a bright and a nebulous image,
when the light is transmitted in one direction, and two bright images, when
the light is transmitted in another direction; but it possesses this property

Bnder circumstances of such an extraordinary nature, that could not with
propriety have introduced any account of it into this' paper,
    A number of soft substances; of animal and vegetable origin, have like
wise the faculty of forming a bright and a nebulous image, under various
 singular modifications.   A full account of the results which I have obtained
 with this class of substances, will be found in another paper.
     Vol. 45. No. 202. Fel. 1815.                  I                          of

of two or more separate faculties ; what are the mutual influences
of the different faculties ; and lastly, what external stimuli, or
what particular stages of digestive disorder and bodily ill-health
in general, excite particular sentiments and propensities of the
mind more than others.        At present our knowledge of these
data is very imperfect ; and consequently our view of the aber
rations of mind is very limited, and the little knowledge gained
from the experience of apparently incongruous and unarranged
particulars forms as yet the basis of the medical treatment of
maniacs.     My own very limited knowledge of their diseases
prevents me from applying the knowledge of the organs and func
tions of the brain, which I have obtained from continued obser
vation, to the elucidation of madness on such an extensive scale
as might be practical for many others, whose experience of the
conduct and history of madmen might enable them to be of
great service in elucidating their sort of diseases ; if they would
patiently investigate the facts whereon the new views of the
cerebral functions are established. 1 shall proceed to mention only
a few considerations of some common disorders of mind, which re
flection and observation of the connexion between the forms of the
brain and the disorders it occasions the subject of have suggested.
We cannot describe manias without adverting to the passions of
which they are frequently exaggerations, differing also in the mode
of the affection.   Maniacal fury, for example, seems a disordered
action of the organ of combativeness, more or less catenated
with disorders of other organs. When the organ of destructiveness
is much excited in madness, it causes many of those horrible
murders and acts of destruction committed by the insane, of
which cases are familiar to all keepers of them.      Pride is often
strongly excited in madmen, when the organ         of  haughtiness is
largely developed.     In short, where there is a decided character
in the mania there is a large development of the corresponding
organ.    There are instances of men mad in the organ of bene
volence, who give away all to the poor.     In the organ of religion
there are innumerable maniacs, as there are likewise in my
sticism.   The great development then of particular organs points
out the particular nature of many lunatics ; while ideality pro
duces tht strange imaginations of all. There is the late well known
instance of a person mad from constructiveness, who imagined
machines constructed under ground to destroy him.           Madness
too mav be onlv on one side of the head in some cases ; as in
that related by Dr. Spurzheim.        I merely hint at those things
now, for subjects of future observation.          I shall conclude
with an observation I have made on melancholy and hypchon-
driasis.   Melancholy seems to be a disordered action of the
organ of cautiousness ; ive always find it accompanied with fear

        Of the   Physiology  of certain Disorders of Health. 1.3 1
and anxiety of some    kind ; and I have noticed that those persons
who are subject to fits of this disorder       have that organ much
 developed.     I have indeed observed this to be the fact in cases
 too numerous to doubt of the connexion between the two cir
 cumstances.      The fear of death, the fear of hell, of demons, of
accidents, &c. are the result ofithis organ; education, external
impression, and the mutual influence of other faculties modify
the affection, and determine the object dreaded : but the in
trinsic character of the disease is the same ; fear and anxiety are
its characteristic    marks.    In hypochondriacism, the organ of
ideality suggests the whimsical and delusive ideas, for fear, or the
organ of cautiousness, to act upon.         But as persons thus or
ganized are not always hypochondriacal and melancholy, some
state of bodily ill-health must be necessary to the production
of the disease. I think the opinion of antiquity, the sanction
of ages, and facts well known to modern practitioners, warrant
the notion that disorders of the organs of digestion, and particu
larly hepatic irritation, exercise in general their morbid feelings.
If so, the disorder of the chylopoietic viscera must have a special
sympathy with the organs of ideality and cautiousness ; for, if
they merely excited the brain in general, the organs of the re
 flective powers would have a commensurate action, and the er
roneous ideas would not prevail ; which is far from being the
case.     The reflecting organs grow weaker, and at last the pa
tient ceases to reason against feelings at first known by the reason
ing powers to be fallacious.      Sometimes, when the organ of indi
viduality   is weak  from  smallness  and disease, the patient fancies
 that external bodies have no real existence : when it is too Large
 and diseased, he fancies he has heard every new thing before.
 In other cases of defective individuality, I have known single con
sciousness destroyed, analogous to double vision.           These and
 many    other facts are curious,  and lead me  to regard individuality
 as concerned in single consciousness, and other functions attri
buted to the commissures of the brain alone.           For it seems to
 me that the commissures cannot be the cause why we conceive
one object to exist externally, and to excite vision and to act at
the same time ; and there seems to me a great analogy in the funcr
 tion of mind whereby we conceive unity of existence from double
impressions of the same organ, and that whereby we identify the
sensations of different organs, and regard them as qualities of one
external body. — Little however, indeed, is known about these
things at present: but, little as it  is,
                                        it   must be studied and im
proved on. Reasoning only on theories, and blind respect for the
                                              a
doctrine of the schools, have already caused metaphysics to ap
pear absurd, philosophy in general vague, and medicine con

                         [Continued from p. 63.]
Led. 9. Certain functions are mediate, others immediate.
    XXIV. Organ of space. This teaches the relative position              of
objects to     each   other,   and   enables     us   to  recollect  places.
Gall is so deficient in this faculty that he often forgets the par
ticular apartment of his patients, where there are, as in Vienna,
many inhabitants in one house.          This organ consists of two ele
vations over the eyebrows at their inner end.                 Astronomers,
travellers and voyagers      have   this   organ highly developed, as in
Newton, Captain. Cook,       &c.     Animals     also possess it, and find
their route from very remote places.            Instances of dogs carried
in coaches from Vienna to Petersburg, and to London, from
Paris to Marseilles and Naples, and yet they found their way
back to their original homes.          These facts are inexplicable on
the supposition that animals smell the paths of their masters.
 Cats have likewise been known to travel several miles and carry
their kittens.     Pigeons were taken from Liege to Paris and suf
fered to escape: one returned to Liege in two hours, another was
a day, and a third returned after three days. Some authors
have considered this a sixth sense.            Swallows, storks, quails,
starlings, nightingales,   &c.  These    fowls not   only come back to the
same climate    and   country,  but  to   the same window, bush, chim
ney, or tree.     These migrations are not from want of food, as
they frequently occur when food is abundant, and certain birds
 often arrive in certain climates before their proper food is pro
duced.     Nightingales in cages become uneasy and disquieted at
the period of emigration ; which proves an internal feeling. This
faculty makes the traveller, geographer, landscape painter; it
 recollects localities, judges of symmetry, measures space and
 distance, and gives notions of perspective.          The primitive faculty
is space, as all things have localities,
                                                                 XXV. Or-

   on  Drs. Gall and Spurxheim's        Physiognomonical    System. 133
    XXV. Organ of order         is an elevation at the outer extremity
of  the eyebrows.     Dr. S.   has discovered this organ since his ar
 rival in this country, and consequently its position and functions
 are not sufficiently determined.       It induces habits of regular ar
rangement, system, &c, and is more common in England than
in anv other country. Cleanliness belongs to this faculty ; but, says
the Professor, observe the fact and the organ, and then decide.
    XXVI. Organ of time. Some persons are fond of chronology,
others never think of it. There is more connection between
order and number than between time and number, and more
between time and order than time and number ; order has a re
lation to objects, time to events or facts ; the organ of time there
fore is situated above that of colour, and laterally over that of
 space.
    XXVII.     Organ of number, or of mathematics; this organ
consists in the external angle of the eyebrow being lower and
more full than the internal.         Children of five years old often
manifest this faculty, which relates to number, unity, and cal
culation.     Gall called it the faculty of mathematics ; but it does
not appear to extend beyond arithmetic and algebra, as geometry
and other branches of mathematics require the organs of form,
size, colour, &c.     It is well developed in Newton, Euler, the
late Mr. Pitt (a financier), and Jedediah Buxton, who amused
himself by counting the number of words Garrick spoke on the
stage during a night's performance.         Negroes are very deficient in
this faculty, many of them being able to count only to five.
 Magpies, it is said, can count only three ; but Dupont of Ne
mours alleges they can enumerate nine.
    XXVIII. Organ of tune ; neither ear nor voice is sufficient
for musical talent ; men hear as well as women, yet the latter
sing ; animals hear better than man, but do not sing.               Some
persons.almost    deaf have  musical   talents; others have a good  voice
and no musical talent, while others again            have musical  talent
and no voice.       Birds sing without instructions.         This organ
gives the forehead a square appearance, as it forms an angular
ridge from the temple to the top of the forehead, and the eyes
are slightly depressed inwards.
    XXIX. Organ of languages. Gall, observing that those with
large prominent eyes, especially if below them there appeared a
swollen circle, like that in the heads of Locke, Milton, Voltaire,&e.
had always a good verbal memory, supposed that there were two
organs, one of words and the other of languages.              If is true,
some persons easily acquire the spirit of different longuages
Without having a great memory of words, and others easily learu
words without knowing the spirit of any language.             Neverthe
less, Dr. S. thinks this but one faculty.        Judgement he considers
                                   1 3                               only

  134      Dr.   Spurzheim's    demonstrative   Course  of Lectures
  Only a mode of action, as pleasure and pain are modes of feelings
  every faculty having a good or a bad mode ; hence he concludes
  that the memory of words and philology in general originate in
  the same faculty.       If in a skull we fmd the sockets of the eyes
. deep, it proves that the brain had not been large there ; on the
  contrary, if the sockets be shallow, it indicates the greater develop
  ment, the brain having literally pushed the eye-balls forward.
  Here Dr. S. took a masterly review of the question respecting the
influence of words on ideas. In France the opinion has re
  ceived academical rewards, that words give ideasj and that per
  sons are incapable of thinking without words !          But have ani-
. mals a language ?       The term idea is ambiguous, some taking it
  according to its etymology, others metaphorically. Dr. S. .calls
  every conception of the knowing faculties an idea, and reflection
  every function of those faculties which compares.         Every faculty
  exists by itself 5 we feel without knowing the name of the feel
  ing ; we perceive external objects without knowing that the
  medium is light: therefore the idea exists without a word.          Pro
  pensities    and  feelings  exist without   the knowledge    of  words;
  these only serve to communicate a knowledge, of them to others.
   Individuals communicate their feelings and sentiments to each
  other ; one uses artificial, and another natural language.          The
  feeling of anger always shows itself, and is intelligible even in
  man to animals ; it is the natural language, and is consequently
. intelligible   to every being capable of similar feeling.         A dog
   knows when his master is angry, because he possesses the same
  faculty : but he cannot understand the natural signs of adoration
  to God ; yet dogs have sometimes known a few things in three
  languages.      This natural language is common to all animals ;
  the young cry, the mother hears it and gives them food ; this is
  known by the difference in the sound of the voice ; the male
  calls the female ; hence animals have a natural language.          Arti
  ficial language is peculiar to man ; he observes, compares, and
  imitates; animals cannot imitate their sensations or multiply
  their enjoyments ; man only makes a language 5 the same fa-
 .culty enables him to produce fire, make clothes, &c.          The voic«S
  is the general means, the senses are only the media ; the dumb
  use gestures, the deaf want only one sense.          The organ of lan
   guage therefore is the capacity to learn signs ; some cannot learn
  languages ; it is a partial idiotisrh ; others acquire only sufficient
  knowledge of abstract signs to form single words.         Some hydro
  cephalic patients have the eyes prominent, the same as if the
  organ of language was highly developed, and are nevertheless
  destitute of memory.         On the other hand, some persons haw
  beea known to speak without a tongue.

      Lecture 16. The termination of education is in civil artd
  criminal legislation.         Those who form institutions should know
  man, otherwise they cannot be permanent.                  Have then physio*
  gnomical inquiries a tendency to influence legislation ? What is
  legislation ? Subordination of the faculties ; one must be sub
  mitted to the others.           Very few act morally or do good merely
 .by   love, but   great    numbers    do by law.      Legislation if defective
- cannot be universal, and there can be no contradiction between
  divine and civil legislation ; the happiness of this world is not
  contrary to that of the next.              All faculties proper to man are
  the foundation of legislation ; it must be just, charitable and
  firm ; if only charitable, the aim is not fulfilled ; if severe, we also
  fail.    What is the aim of criminal legislation ? Certainly not re
  venge but, 1st, to prevent crimes ; 2d, reform criminals ; and,
           ;
  3d, secure society against incorrigible malefactors.                   How are
  crimes prevented ? We punish, but it does not prevent them ;
  preventing crimes in adults is the continuation of education.
  Certain punishments are not feared, and are therefore useless ;
  education is more powerful than punishment ; idleness, laziness,
  and sometimes the laws create crimes, as some laws are not
  against crimes, but are only peculiar perceptions of some minds.
  Educate and keep down the animal, and confme incorrigible
  criminals ; but how ? The houses of correction in their actual
  state are houses of perversion.            If children be taught or treated
  as animals are, they must also be perverse.                 Suspected persons
  and children now often live in prisons with the greatest criminals,
  where, being idle and ignorant, they learn nothing but how to
  commit crimes.           If men are designed to be honest, treat them
  so ; educate and enable them to earn a living rather than to grow
  worse.     Many charitable institutions are positive rewards for
  crimes; criminals should be corrected, but not rewarded ; such
  arrangements are unnatural, and must be temporary. Bentham's
  ideas of criminal legislation are very good, so also are the insti
  tutions in Philadelphia.            Correction is the end and aim ; and
  until criminals are corrected, they should not be allowed to be
  at large in society.         It is very unjust to punish all crimes with
  the same punishment ; death does not prevent crimes ; legisla
  tion should think of other means.                 It is difficult, indeed, but
  should be studied.          Some criminals are incorrigible and guilty,
  others incorrigible and innocent ; the former must be punished,
  the latter being idiots must be confmed.               Idiots may have some
   parts  of mind,     but    not a will,   and   are  consequently not to be
   punished; there are idiots in propensities and in sentiments, as
                                           I 4                                well

well as in intellects; some of them have a talent for music, and
 Cretins have had construed veness.             Diseases of the mind inter
mittent; -and hence partial insanities which are difficult for a
judge to recognise.          Absolute and individual justice ; the former
 results   from   the   sentiment    of justice united to the superior fa
 culties,   the  latter   is followed   by legislators.     St. Augustin ob
serves, The letter kills, the spirit preserves.            Grief weakens the
faculties more than passion, and the strongest feelings may be
 perfectly quiet.        Here Dr. S. took a survey of the different
 crimes of murder, suicide, and infanticide* : the latter, he ob
 served, was the only crime on which men legislated without being
 capable of a condition to commit           it,and consequently they should
 proceed with great caution.           Such     crimes are often occasioned
 by  diseases of the mind.         This term the Professor considers un-
 philosophical  ;'   the derangement       is in the body and organization    ;
 tjie mind cannot manifest itself without an organ, as we cannot
 see without eyes.        In future we must consider the diseases of the
 brain   like  those in   the  other parts of the body, and that some of
 them    are  curable and others incurable.            Such diseases must be
 divided according to their cause, and receive             aphysical and mo
 ral treatment.       The propensities are to the brain what food             is
 to the stomach, air to the lungs, or light to the eye           ;   they must
 not be aggravated or indulged to excess, any more than excess to
 any other organs.        If  the brain of children be too large, then do
 not exercise their minds too much                ; the mind sometimes in
 creases so that children die.            Irritability is periodical   ; friends
 or persons of similar dispositions experience this feeling at the
 same time all over the world,         in   Vienna, Paris, or London. All
 phenomena have periodicity; plants increase more in spring,
 and children grow more at one period than another.                  Every one
 feelsa     noli me (angere once       a month, when he wants appetite,
is  disgusted and peevish with every thing. Some persons ex
 perience this twice every 28 days then     ;         it passes off, and they
 become cheerful as before. Medical men then say they have
 cured such    a    person, but nature has done it.             Derangement
 occurs at certain periods, when suicides are more numerous                   ;
 these attacks can' be anticipated.              To cure such diseases, the
 period    must   pass,  and   then  the  irritability subsides. Thus, ob
 served Dr Spmzheim, in his concluding lecture to an audience
 of British, philosophers,        have demonstrated the truth announced
                                   "

      XXV. On       the Rules for Algebraical Multiplieatioft.
                           By Mr. J. Dillon.
                               To       Mr. TUloch.
 Sir, — Having seen in your Magazine for January some re
 marks  by Sir H. Englefield, tending to explain the algebraical
 theorem,    at once so necessary for the young mathematician to
 master, and yet so difficult for him fully to understand, that a
 negative quantity, multiplied into a negative quantity, gives a
 positive result, I beg leave to add a few observations which have
 occurred to me upon the subject, and which may perhaps in some
 degree tend to place the matter in a clearer point of view.
     The signs + and — appear too generally (at least in ele
 mentary works) construed to mean plus and minus; a sense
 which, though perhaps always included in, does not appear to
 constitute the whole of their definition.    The sign + signifying,
 in fact, that the term to which it is prefixed is positive, and the
 sign — that such term is negative, that the one should be plus,
 (or the object of addition,) and the other minus, (or the object
 of subtraction,) when addition or subtraction with other quan
 tities is in question ; these are rather consequences flowing from,
 than essential parts of the nature of, such signs of + and — .
     The fallacy of considering + and — as merely meaning plus
 and minus, will plainly appear where multiplication or division is
 intended, as — a     x   b,                where it is evident neither plus
                               ot^-^,
  nor minus can be meant by the signs + and — ; and it is in this
  fallacy, as it appears to me, that all the difficulties of the present
 question have their origin; for, by always affixing the sense of
 positive and negative to these signs, nearly all the obstacles which
 impede the progress of the learner on this subject will vanish.
     I scarcely need previously to observe, that the algebraist is as
 conversant with the idea of a negative as of a positive quantity.
 Considerable confusion appears, however, to have arisen from at
 tempts to render this idea familiar to minds not accustomed to
 abstract reasoning. Thus, therefore, it is frequently represented
 that — a is not so much the negative quantity a, as it is the
positive quantity a with a mark affixed to               it,
                                                       signifying that       it
is   to be subtracted from some other quantity either actually
known, or to be discovered; whereas,            fact,
                                                    in    should be con
                                                               it
sidered as strictly a negative quantity, capable of destroying or
counteracting   a   positive quantity of equal value, when         comesit
in  contact with such, and existing in the mind in way perhaps      a
somewhat similar to the ideas of darkness, silence, or vacuum,
                                                                   which

138      On the Rules   for Algebraical Multiplication.
which may be considered as abstract negative ideas, expressive
of the absence of light, sound, or matter.
    To apply these premises to the subject under consideration,
namely, the multiplication of algebraical quantities, under all
the varieties of the signs + and — : of this multiplication there
are three cases.
    1st. When the terms are both positive, + x +.
   2d. When only one of the terms is positive, — X + •
   3d. When both the terms are negative, — x — .
   For the first then, to take an instance, + a x +           we have
only to remember the well known principle that the multiplier is
merely an abstract quantity, expressive of the number of times
the multiplicand is to be added within itself, and we shall im
mediately perceive that the result must be +, as it is merely pro
posed that + a should be taken b number of times, without any
alteration of the signs, which are indeed expressly affirmed by the
sign + affixed to b.
   For the second case, — a x + b ; it is equally evident that
 — o taken b number of times must on the other hand always
 remain — , whatever may be the value of b.
   For the ihird case,   —ax       — b, where the difficulty is sup
 posed to rest, it may be previously remarked that if — a when
multiplied (as in the second case) by b or + b gives a negative
result, then may it beforehand be expected that this same — a
when multiplied by — b will give a contrary, that is a positive
result.
    It is a well known position in logic that two negatives make
an affirmative ; to say that a thing is not not so, is in fact but a
more circuitous manner of saying that it is so, and exactly this
process appears to take place in the case before us.       The result
of   —  a X  —   b is + ab for this reason j a X b    as ab, and the
negative sign of the a is (if I may so express it) itself negatedby
the negative sign of the b.    The quantity a had, we must sup
pose, become negative by some previous process ; the reversal
therefore of this sentence of negation must be as necessarily
the consequence of its being multiplied into a negative quantity,
as the continuing subject to that sentence would have resulted
from its being multiplied into an affirmative or positive quantity:
in other words, the sign — prefixed to the b   is, in fact, the nega
tion of the sign belonging to a, (the quantity to be multiplied,)
whether the sign of such quantity be positive or negative .
    The origin of the error, and the consequent existence of the
difficulty in question, appear to be this:    that the affirmation of
 a positive quantity, (as a x + b,) and the negation of a negative
 quantity (as — a     x — b,) are supposed to be the contrast, or
 antithesis of each other;   whereas, in fact, so far from being op
                                                              posed,

                      Notices respecting New   Booh.              139
posed, they are but the same thing stated in other words ; or
rather they tend, by different methods, to a similar result : the
real contrast will be found to exist in the affirmation of a posi
tive quantity, (as a x + b,) and in the affirmation also {not the
negation) of a negative quantity, (as — a X + b;) and this con
trast is exemplified in the contrary results of the first and second
cases stated above.
    Two observations only, in the way of elucidations, further
occur to me: it should be remembered that in the multiplica
tion, as in other processes of algebra, the signs only affect the
signs, and the quantities the quantities : in the multiplication
 — a x — b to perceive the separate effect of the one sign upon
the other, let us suppose    I equal to unity, and we shall find, ac
cording to the foregoing principles, — .1 x — b = + a ; then
taking any other value of b, as 10, the result will be — ax — b
 s±= + 10 a = + ab.        To show that the result of + a x +        I
must be similar to that of — a x — b, it may be observed that
as a new result of the multiplication + a X + b is produced by
the alteration of one of the signs, as — a x + b, so the original
result will again be equally and indifferently brought about either
by the restoration of the original sign belonging to a, when it
will stand, as before, + a x 4- b; or by the further additional
reversal of the sign of the remaining term ( + b,) when the same
product will be represented by — a X — bi hence + a X + b
 — — a x — b ; and hence a
                                    negative quantity multiplied into

                          however, the compiler has successfully ar-.
 ranged and condensed the scattered researches of various authors,
 and united the theory of ancient with the practice of modern
 discoveries, he has perhaps done all that could reasonably be ex
pected."    It   isbut justice to say, that the author has done all
this, and done    it well.     The work       divided into ten sections.
                                               is
 The 1st contains preliminary remarks on the nature of the
terrestrial globe, its circles, axis, poles      on latitude, longitude,
                                                    ;
 and the positions of the sphere           the 2d presents preliminary
                                           :
 observations on maps and charts.           These serve very naturally
 to introduce the student to the 3d section, in which " the prin
 ciples of the orthographic,      the stereographic, and the globular
projections of the sphere are fully demonstrated             and the last
                                                             ;
of these   is  investigated       a manner entirely new, to prove its
                                 in
 superiority and admirable fitness in the construction of maps.
    " In the 4th section theory descends to practice and, as     ;
 certain combinations are proposed to be effected, the projections
 are handled in the form of problems."           The 5th section      de
                                                                     is
 voted to Mercator's projection       ;the origin and properties of the
 rhumb line occupy the 6th; the th embraces the meridional,
                                           7
 equatorial, and horizontal construction of maps. The principles
 of developing a spheric surface on a plane are investigated              in
the 8th section.      In the 9th, which unfolds numerous projec
tions of particular maps, the constructions are presented in         po
                                                                     a
pular form, and include everything of essential service in modern
practice.    In the 10th section       shown the extensive application
                                      is
 of the orthographic projection of the sphere in the construction
 and use of the Analemma — an instrument which, with the assist
 ance of good maps, will not only solve many curious problems,
 but he almost equivalent to a terrestrial globe.
    The Appendix contains various methods of drawing large cir
 cles and ellipses    ;directions for. colouring maps    ; a catalogue of
 some of the best maps, and general rules and observations for
judging of the accuracy of maps.          In the notes and illustrations
with which the work concludes, various useful historical and cri
tical remarks occur, drawn from numerous sources, some                    of
 which are difficult of access.

              jlge of Science — Philosophy — Bacon,       and others.
;
      uWe must now speak of Science : for the period from Eras
mus to   Bacon may be called the age of literature ; that from
Bacon   to  Newton, of science and philosophy.      And Cambridge
feels a pride in ranking both Bacon and Newton among her sons.
    " Bacon has been called the restorer of science, by raising it ou
a broader basis, and, in contradistinction    to the ages which pre-*
ceded him in this country, by deducing it from experience and
observation, rather than uncertain rules and precarious ratioci
nations.    He was of Trinity College.      He, at length, rose to
be lord chancellor of England : but, from his ch^dhood, was
                                                         ~
so generally conversant in books, and of such comp          >nsive in
tellect, that queen Elizabeth, to whom he was kn              hrough
his father, Sir Nicholas Bacon, used to call him, w             seven
years  of age,  her young  lord keeper.
    " Sir Nicholas is well described by one, who had well studied
the characters of queen Elizabeth's ministers, as " an arch piece
of wit and wisdom ; as a gentleman and a man of law; and of
great knowledge therein, whereby, together with his other parts
of dexterity and learning, he was promoted to be keeper of the
great seal :" such, too, was the literary character, and such the
political progress of the son* ; and both were of Cambridge.
      "Lord Bacon's aim was to point the readiest way to universal
knowledge ; to shew how what the ancients had done might
be rendered more perfect, and the human mind directed to new
discoveriesf.     With these views he published, in 1605, his two
books on the Advancement of Learning, and dedicated them to
James I.     But the aim of this extraordinary performance;]; is best
described in his own language.       " I have taken," says he, in a
 letter to lord treasurer Burleigh, " all knowledge for my pro
 vince ; and if I purge it of two sorts of rovers, whereof, the one
 with frivolous disputations, confutations, and verbosities, the
 other with blind experiments, and auricular traditions and im
postures, hath committed so many spoils, I hope I should bring
 in industrious observations, grounded conclusions, and profitable
 inventions and discoveries, the best state of that province."        A
 few years afterwards he sent these letters to Dr. Playfair, Lady
 Margaret's professor, to be translated into Latin : but herein he

the specimen returned him of Playfair's Latinity.                        They were,
however, translated afterwards hy other hands.
    "    In the year 1629, he published his Instauratio Magna,
called Novum Organon, a title taken from his great predecessor
Aristotle*, to the materials of whose writings he was greatly in
 debted, though he raised them on his new foundation, as Locke
was greatly indebted to Hobbes's foundation, though he shaped
his materials into a different form.                   Bacon, in a letter to the
                  of  his  Novum                       ' I
king, says                             Organon,            hear njy former book,
of the Advancement of Learning, is well treated in the Univer
sities here, and the English colleges abroad, and this is the same
argument and deeper.'
    "   In             he published his famous work, de Augmentis
Scientiarum, which, however, can scarcely be called a new
book, it being an enlargement of his Advancement of Learning,
put into a Latin dress ; in the adjusting of which George Her
bert, the Cambridge poet, and Hobbes, the philosopher of
Malmesbury, gave their assistance: which reminds me, that
Bacon's practice was much imitated by Hobbes, some of whose
after -works were but enlargements of former experiments.

The Governments of 162 cities.           Some Fragments of this work were collected
from ancient writers by Isaac Casaubon, and published.
   Of Metaphysics (iura raw tputixui), as he terms them, he has treated at large.
Of Grammar and Logic, it does not appear that Aristotle treated, as tbey have
since been formed into systems or aits, and taught in the schools.         The works of
Aristotle, read by the Scholastics, at Cambridge, were Latin Translations by the
Arabians, incorrectly made, and often crudely w rought into their own theories.
   At, and since the revival of letters, various arts of Logic were published by
Ramus, Crellius, Bertins, Hunnseus, Molineus, and Keckerm3n, and after them
by Bergersdicius.      Of these, some profess to follow Aristotle; others, to hold
him iu contempt: hut as Aristotle has not treated distinctly of method, the 4th
instrument in Logic, and a?, probably, the Categories, or Predicaments,            were
not his ; and as he never formed his Treatises into a system, or Art of Logic, we
may be often led into mistakes about Aristotle.             I say the Categories were
probably not Aristotle's, because Diogenes Laertius mentions only one book of
Categories, KuT^y^im ; ed. Diog. Laertius, ut sup. p. 517 : whereas, the Cate
gories as we now have them, consist of three parts, regularly divided into chap
ters.   Aristot. Op. omnia, vol. i. edit. Du Vail.
   Bacon's Novum Organon may be considered as levelled against all those several
arts ; but more particularly against the Analytics and Topics of Ari«totle, which
treat so largely of Syllogisms.     It should, however, be observed, that though we
are in the habit of speaking of Induction, as Bacon's, that Aristotle, also, has

  "   The literary character of Bacon, and the uses to which his
writings have been put at Cambridge, (for his principles have
been most successfully followed there,) are admirablv      expressed
                                                 ' One of the most
by an elegant genius of our sister university :
extensive and improved geniuses we have had instance of in our
own nation, or in any other, was that of Sir Francis Bacon, Lord
Verulam.      This great man, by an extraordinary force of nature,
compass of thought, and indefatigable study, had amassed to
himself such stores of knowledge as we cannot look upon without
amazement.       His capacity seemed to have grasped all that was
revealed in books before his time ; and not satisfied with that,
he began to strike out new tracks of science, too many to be
travelled over ny any one man in the compass of the longest
life.    These, therefore, he could only mark down, like imperfect
 coastings on maps, or supposed poitits of lands, to be further
discovered and ascertained by the industry of after ages, who
should proceed upon his notices or conjectures*.'
     " Bacon's new' philosophy deranged the old, which, in truth,
 at least as it had been long taught in the schools, was putting
the cart before the horse, and has occasioned Horn Tooke to say,
                                                  ' If
justly, in the sense he there uses the term,           they give up
their doctrine of language, they will not be able to make a battle
for their metaphysics, the very term metaphysics being non
 sense ; and all the systems of       and controversies concerning
                                          it,
it,   that are, or have been in the world, being founded in the
 grossest ignorance of words, and of the nature of speechf.'
     " Bacon's new philosophy, then, aspired to derange the old
 metaphysics and logic, and with them the old natural philoso-r
 phy, the subtleties of the former being the foundation of the
 latter. It, however, left space open for a more liberal philo
                                   a
 sophy, founded in the operations of nature, and uniform expe
 rience.    As far as logic and metaphysics went, that place was
 filled up  by Locke's Essay on the Human ynderstanding — his                 ;
 inquiry being,     in
                    fact,  guide to general metaphysical reasoning,

   "  Locke's book being expelled from Oxford, found a more
ample reception at Cambridge : for, though a Fellow of Emma
nuel College ventured to write a sturdy volume* against his
Essay, it soon became a text book in the University, and the
ablest metaphysicians' were proud to be its critics and commen
tators.    Hartleyf was a disciple of Locke's school : his doctrines
of the Mechanism of the Human Mind, and of the Association
of Ideas, are but an enlargement of Locke's, or rather a de
duction from it.     His Doctrine of Vibrations is considered more
           J
his own ; and though Hartley's Observations has not been made
a Lecture-book in our colleges,        has been much read in the
                                            it.
University. Dr. Law, late bishop of Carlisle§, published                           in
 1777  a fine edition of all Locke's Works, together with          Life       a
and Preface     ;and the Moral Philosophy of Dr. Paley         fruit     is        of
the same tree, though damaged in the gathering.
   " As Logic (and with Metaphysics) had been so greatly
                                  it
taught at Cambridge, prior to the revival of letters,         may be   it
proper to observe, that the Scholastics considered thought as
making no use of       bodily organ, and, indeeed, as having no
                          a
communication with the body.         They conceived the soul to be
the place     ideas, rows rtov ileiav, and logic, like experimental
               of
philosophy, as having instruments corresponding to the third
operation of the mind, judgement, and with them comparing
together those ideas, and making inferences                  by
                                                    the assistance                 of
Syllogisms.
    " The art therefore was supposed Bacon and Locke to have
                                                  by
been exercised in the schools with too many subtleties and
fleeting uncertainties, deduced from Aristotle, who, making                        it

 consist too much in artificial rules, fell short of the philosophy of
 the art.       Such, indeed, was the authority of this philosopher
  (an extraordinary man after all), that in logic and metaphysics
 he for many years entirely swayed the English and Scottish uni
 versities, as he did those of all Europe, till they came to the
 chapter of Ethics, where, having, according to the theology of
 most of the reformed churches, embraced the doctrine of Original
 Sin, they abandoned the Aristotelian for another standard*.
 Then Bacon came ; and with his powerful thoughts, varied
 reading, and brilliant compositions — and never perhaps in the
 same man was there a more extraordinary combination, so rich
 and multiform — and gave irresistible weight to the cause ; a phi
 losopher, often too much of a politician, and, in his turn, not
to be uniformly admired, nor explicitly followed.
     "   But though Bacon's and Locke's writings proceed upon a
 larger scale, for the purpose of philosophical inquiry, logic is
still incidentally taught in our colleges, and syllogism still fol

 in the veneration of the incomprehensible Being, God, that

      " A word or two on grammar. But as we have had occasion
 to speak of a philosophical logic, higher than the mere vulgar
 art of scholastics, so here, in contradistinction to the grammar
 of the schools, I must be understood to mean Philosophical
 Grammar.         Nor will the reader be surprised to hear it .spoken
 of in a history of university literature, if he recollects, that not
 only in our ancient monasteries, and colleges derived from them,
 there were regular grammar schools*, but that as late as th.e
time of archbishop Parker, students graduated in grammar di
 stinct from artsf, as well as in theology, or canon and civil law.

      "  There has been an attempt at Philosophical Grammar,
written by one duly related to our Alma Mater, and it is in im
 mediate reference to our own language : the attempt has suc
ceeded.        The object of the Diversions of Purley (as the book is
entitled) is explained by the author himself in a few words :
speaking of his abbreviations, or winged words, he savs,
                                                                            " I
imagine it is in some measure with this vehicle of our thoughts,
as with the vehicles of our bodies.              Necessity produced both.
Abbreviations are the vehicles of language, the wings of Mer
cury."       In contradistinction, therefore, to the eight parts of
speech, as taught in our ordinary grammars, Mr. Tooke main
tains, that, strictly and philosophically speaking, there are only
two, the noun and verb : the remaining parts of speech he con
siders merely as abbreviations of these.
      " The author of The Diversions of Purley lays claim to the
notice of his Alma Mater, by the following singular address,
prefixed to his book —
                             " To the University of Cambridge, one of
her grateful sons, who always considers acts of voluntary justice
towards himself as favours, dedicates this humble offering};."
      " It is true — The Diversions of Purley is not a lecture-book,
any more than many other works already mentioned.                        Being,
however, recommended by a plea of such filial feelings, and
being itself a powerful performance, a characteristic work, it
claims a place in a History of Cambridge literature.

patetics; and, having been implicitly adopted by the schoolmen,
has been since called the Scholastic Philosophy : they affirmed
that each effect of bodies flowed from its individual nature ; but
whence the several natures proceeded, they did not show ; thev
were defective in observation and experiment, dwelling rather on
the names of things, than on the things themselves.               According,
therefore, to the Newtonians, whose words I borrow, they had
 invented a philosophical language, but could not be said to have
taught philosophy*.
      " Some, indeed, according to the statement of the Newtonians,
 had, emerging somewhat from this obscurity of mere words,
 maintained that all matter was of the same kind ; and that all
 the variety of forms, which we see in bodies, arises from the
  most simple affections of their component parts : but to those af
 fections they assigned other modes than what, it appears, have
 been assigned to them by nature, indulging themselves in a li
 berty, which, however plausible to the imagination, was not
 founded in reality ; they conceived certain unknown figures and
  magnitudes, positions and motions of parts, together with certain
  occult fluids, which, by entering the pores of the bodies, agitated
  them with great subtlety and force : here, too, it was insisted,
  they had no authority, from observation or experiment, their
  theory being all founded on conjecture : the Newtonians, on ad
  vancing these objections, had in view the doctrine of atoms and
  vortices of Descartes and his followers.          The accuracy of many
  of their mechanical laws and deductions was admitted ; but their
                                                             ' fabulam
  speculations were considered as mere hypotheses,                        (said
  the Newtonians) elegantem forte et venustam, fabulam tamen
  concinhare dicendum esse.'
       " Thus was Newton led on to that third way of philosophizing,
  called experimental : he assumed no principle that was not
  sanctioned by phenomena, and from the most simple principles
  he aimed to arrive at general causes, and original laws : hypo
   theses he laid down not as systems to be believed, but as ques
   tions to be tried ; and he proceeded by a twofold method, which
   he called analytic, and synthetic : he deduced the more simple
   powers and laws of forces from certain select phenomena ; this he
   called analysis; and then proceeding from those single pheno
   mena to more general and comprehensive forms, he established
   synthesis.    Not that this way of proceeding by analysis and syn
   thesis are novelties, they are noticed by Aristotle.         But these are
   the rules followed by Sir Isaac Newton, in his way of philoso
   phizing, and by these he established a theory, which was said to
    explain and illustrate the system of the universe.
       "  According to this theory, then, it wap maintained, that all

bodies    had a tendency to gravitate, mutually, and to some
centre ; that they had a twofold force, one urging them to move
forward, in a straight line, the other downward, to a centre;
the two forces combined forming a curve : thus he accounted for
the motion of the heavenly bodies, and all proceeded on mathe
matical demonstrations, accompanied with the calculations of
algebra.
    "   The other branches of philosophy, as well as astronomy,
were, in like manner, brought to the test of experience, and
subjected to mathematics and algebra.
    "   Such was the philosophy of Newton.
    "   The science which had been laid down by this great man in
the profoundest speculations, was opened in a more popular
manner by others, particularly by Whiston, as already observed,
in the public schools. — What has been said above upon tliis sub
ject, has been delivered nearly in the Newtonian's own words ;
and it is not necessary to proceed further : suffice it that this
 philosophy, made up, as we have said, of mathematics and
 algebra, constitutes now the principal discipline, and prime
glory, of the University of Cambridge."

  clusion of    Mr. Cooke's paper on Nautical Charts was read.
  The paper was divided into three parts, accompanied with dia
  grams and mathematical demonstrations : the author dwelt par
  ticularly on a mode of making graduated circles or charts, so
  that angles might be taken on the charts simply by means of a
  common rule, and also sextant observations at any place.              It
  does not appear that the author is acquainted with the graduated
  circle in use among the French mariners, but which is not much
  esteemed by the English.
      Part of a long elaborate and curious paper by Dr. Wilson
  Phillip of Gloucester was read, detailing a series of experiments
  made to ascertain the relative influence of the nervous system
  on the functions of the heart.        The ultimate object of these in
                                   effects- of poisons,
  quiries  was to determine    the                      and their manner
  of destroying animal life : the present experiments were only
  preliminary.
      Feb. 9.   Dr. Phillip related the result of twenty-four experi
  ments made on warm and cold-blooded animals by various modes
  of removing or destroying the brain, or cutting off the commu
  nication between it and the heart or spinal marrow.             The ten
  first experiments were on rabbits, and the remainder on frogs.
   He found, contrary to the statement of M. Le Gallois, that the
  circulation of the heart was not arrested by blows on the occiput
  so as to crush the brain without greatly injuring the spinal
  marrow; that the heart retained its irritability for twelve hours
   after the nerves of the head had been completely detached from
   it ; and that the spinal marrow has some influence on the heart.
   The author next tried the effects of opium and other stimuli on
   the spinal marrow, &c. of a frog, and found that the muscles of
   the heart of frogs could be stimulated till irritability was com
   pletely exhausted.      He concludes, that there are three distinct
   powers in the animal body ; the sensorial, which exists in the
. cerebrum ; the nervous
                              properly so called, which belongs to the
   .spinal marrow j and the muscular power, which exists in the
   muscles 5 and that these powers exercise a mutual influence on
   each other.     With M. ' Le ' Gallois, he thinks that the spinal
                                     , .                           marrow

     marrow is acted on by the brain in the same manner as the
    muscles of the heart are acted on by the spinal marrow. Never
    theless, although the heart retains its contractibility after the
    nerves of the brain are removed, he admits that violent joy will
     destroy its functions quicker than decapitation.         Respiration
    appears to depend on the nervous system ; the heart is capable
    of contraction like all other muscles; the involuntary muscles
    obey the same law as those of voluntary motion.
        Feb. 16.     Mr. Cliff, in a letter to Sir E. Home, described the
    effects of several experiments made to ascertain the influence of
    the spinal marrow in fishes, particularly carp.        The hearts of
    two carps were laid open, and the fish immersed in water : in an
    hour the fins ceased to move, but the gills continued to act ; in
    two hours the latter became motionless, and in three hours and
    forty minutes all action of the heart had entirely subsided.        In
    another experiment, the heart was laid open and exposed to the
    air, when its pulsations were from twelve to twenty in a minute.
   A red hot wire was passed up the spinal marrow to the brain of
    a carp : still the action of the auricle and pulsation continued for
   six hours and a half.       It appeared that the heart's action when
   laid open and exposed to water is sooner destroyed than when
   left in the air : exposing the heart accelerates its action or
   quickens the pulsation for a time, which gradually subsides. In
   these experiments the removal of the brain produced no imme
   diate effect on the action of the heart.
       A letter from Dr. Brewster to the President was read, de
   scribing some of this philosopher's experiments on a new pro
   perty of light from the second surface of reflecting bodies.
       Feb. 23.     Part of an erudite paper by Sir Humphry Davj was
   read, On the Composition of the Paints used by the Greeks. Sir H.
   in the introduction took a review of the progress of painting among
   the Greeks, a people who had an innate taste for the beautiful
   and the magnificent ; he next traced the march of the arts from
   Greece to Rome, and lastly proceeded to an analysis of the colour
   ing matter of the remains of the Greek paintings found on the
   walls of Herculaneum and Pompeii.             The principal colour in
   these paintings, it appears, consisted of carbonates of copper pre
   pared and blended in different proportions.

ancient nations, Mr. B. proceeded to the age of Alchemy, the
chief origin of which he referred to the new Platonists, whose
rise marked the declining age of learning towards the end of the
third century. — The mysteries of transmutation and the season
for the elixir of life were so well adapted to the genius of pro
fessors of demonology and magic, as to acquire among them ra
pid celebrity ; and the historv of their wanderings is not unim
portant, as connected with the subsequent advances of chemistry.
 The best specimen of alchemical jargon is to be found in works
written by or attributed to Geber, who is supposed to have been
an Arabian prince of the seventh century.        Dr. Johnson derives
(.he word gibberish from the language of Geber and his tribe.
    As characteristic writers of the thirteenth and three succeeding
 centuries,   Mr. B. selected Roger Bacon, of Somersetshire ;
 Basil Valentine, of Erfurt ; Paracelsus, of Switzerland ; and Van
 Helmont, of Brussels.
    Entering upon the seventeenth century, the Professor furnished
 a sketch of the life and writings of Lord Bacon, and of the new
 turn which he gave to experimental philosophy.         It was not till
then that science shook off its deformed and sickly aspect, and
acquired new and healthful vigour. Glauber and the Honourable
 Robert Boyle were cited as leading authors of the seventeenth
century : the writings of the former are full of keen observations :
 the claims of the latter to origuiality were not great ; but the
 benefits which his patronage conferred upon science were nu
 merous and lasting.       He brought Hooke into notice, and put
 him in the road to eminence.
    After a rapid glance at the discovery of the air pump and ba
 rometer, Mr. Rrande noticed the foundation of learned societies.
 The Academy del Cimento was established in 1651 by the Duke
 of Tuscany; the Royal Society in IG62; and the Royal Aca
 demy of Sciences in 16b'6.       Charles the Second, though not
 quite indifferent to the welfare of science, conferred but empty
 honours on the Royal Society, but Louis the Fourteenth was
 more generous to the Parisian establishment.        This liberality is
 not only highly honourable to his memory, but in the eyes of the
 ingenious part of mankind has ever been regarded as no insigni
 ficant atonement for the multitudinous errors of his reign. — Hap
 pily for the scientific character of Britain, said the Professor, the
 genius, talents, and exertions of less exalted individuals have
 ever counterbalanced such advantages ; and thus protected, the
  growth of science lias been as vigorous, and perhaps more healthy
 than in the sunshine of royal favour.

and a recapitulation of the prominent events of the period. When
alchemy     was at its acme, during the -fifteenth  and sixteenth cen
turies, manv useful members of society were entrapped by it*
golden prospects. Among them was that admirable artist, Mas-
zuoli of Parma, better known under the name of Parmegiano :
sickness and beggary were the reward of him and his associates.
    The zeal. and activity in scientific pursuits, which has since
marked its progress in Europe, became manifest early in the se
venteenth     century,   and the causes which    Mr. Brande unfolded,
contributed to the splendour which it began to acquire, about
 the end of that important era, in the general history of the world.
     Mr. Brande' s second lecture embraced an account of the state
 of chemistry at the opening of the eighteenth century, in which
 the theories of combustion invented by Beccher, Stahl, Rey,
 and Mayow, were principally dwelt upon, and experimentally
 illustrated. The system of Beccher, as enlarged and embellished
 by his pupil Stahl, supposes inflammable bodies to contain a pe
 culiar volatile principle called phlogiston; flame is produced by
 the escape of this principle.         Rey in 1630, and Mayow in
  1674, objected to the conclusions upon which the phlogistic
 system was reared ; for bodies in general, they observed, became
 heavier by combustion.         Tin, lead, and other metals, burn when
 heated to redness ; and the residuum, or result of combustion, is
  heavier than the metal they set out with.        Combustion, there
 fore, said they, consists not in the separation of phlogiston,
  but in the fixation of air, and substances refuse to burn when air
  is excluded.
      Mr. Brande illustrated these positions by many of the original
  and curious experiments detailed in Mayow's treatise on the ni-
  tro-uric spirit. In speaking of Rev's publication, the Professor
   observed that its present scarcity was enigmatical, it having been
  reprinted at Paris in 1777; but it contained many doctrines to
  which the new French theorists have laid claim, as he should
  prove in detailing the history of the antiphlogistic theory, when
  t he neglected merits of Rey and Mayow would again call for at
  tention.
       Having paid   a just tribute of praise to the labours of Hales
   and Boerhaave, the founders of pneumatic chemistry, Mr. Brande
   gave an accoimt of the invention of the thermometer, an instru
   ment which tended materially to the progress of that difficult
   end refined branch of chemistry, relating to the nature and pro
   perties of heat.    Santorio was the first who constructed the air
   thermometer, which was much improved by Van Helmont. The
   Florentine Academicians used smaller tubes filled with spirits of
   .wine ; the instrument was perfected by the dexterous ingenuity
   •of Fahrenheit, a.bankrupt merchant of Dantzic.

    The lecture concluded with some observations upon the ano-~
 malous expansion of water under the 42d degree of Fahrenheit's
 scale, and its importance in retarding congelation.
    " Chemistry," said Mr Brande, " was tardy in its progress,
 until the period at whjch he had now arrived in its history ; in
 the dross of the alchemical furnaces many scattered treasures
 were discovered, of which the value was greatly enhanced by ar
 rangement and systematic combination : the science thus ac
 quired a prosperous aspect — it was applied to the arts, and to
 them it gave an unexpected and vigorous impulse ; it was di
 rected to the investigation of nature, and there it displayed new
 beauties — it found

    Dec. 28. The reading of a paper was commenced, contain
ing " A new Theory of Galvanism, with its Application to cer
tain chemical Phenomena," by M. Donovan, Esq. Secretary.
    The paper commenced with a review of the explanations of
metallic arborizations offered by Bergman, Lavoisier, Vauquelin,
Berthollet, Sylvester, and Grotthiuss.         The theory of the two
first-mentioned    philosophers    had been shown to be insufficient
by Berthollet ; and the view suggested by this last was conceived
to apply well to some of the phenomena, but with much less
effect to others which were adduced.         The theories of Sylvester
and Grotthiuss were stated to be the same in result : both sup
pose the commencement of the arborization to be chemical, and
its progress electrical.     It was observed, that the theory of the
commencement lies under the objections which apply to Ber-
thollet's view ; and that both stages of the process should be
                                                             referable

referable to the same cause.       It was also considered improbable
that the continuance of the arborization should be dependent on
the decomposition of water.        •
    Several arguments and experiments were then adduced to
show that these phamomena depend upon laws of chemical af
finity which have been hitherto overlooked.          The affinity of one
body for another will be modified, and even        altered  in a singular
manner, by the contiguity of a third.         This law of affinity was
supported by a copious collection of experiments.          Arborizations
in several of their varieties and circumstances were investigated,
and referred for explanation to the general inferences from the
preceding facts.      The result of a great number of experiments
proved that the order of the changes produced on the affinities
of bodies by the proximity of a third, exactly corresponds with
the order in which metals precipitate each other in the metallic,
state from their solutions.
    Jan. 11. The reading was continued.            Some considerations
were adduced to show that affinity        is a  force  existing between
 every species of matter ; and even between those that apparently
exert no action on each other.          The principle before stated,
namely, that the attraction of one body for another will be pecu
liarly modified by the contiguity of a third, was referred to ; and
it was shown that this change is reciprocal, the third body suf
fering a change of another nature by the contiguity of the first.
Considerations were then offered, from which it was deemed ne
cessary to admit a division of bodies into two grand classes ac
cording to their species of affinity.        The foregoing principles
with some others of less consequence were supposed capable of
explaining not only the internal action of the galvanic series, but
 also the effects produced by galvanism on other bodies.           It was
stated, that for reasons elsewhere assigned* the author conceived
galvanic phenomena to be unconnected with electricity any further
 than that the latter is a concomitant power ; and it was supposed
that every fact can be better explained without the agency of that
 power.
    The various phenomena of decomposition Were then referred for
 explanation to the new principles, and some were adduced which
 have never been hitherto satisfactorily accounted for, and which
 were considered reconcilable to these views.        Some new facts re
 lating  to the  internal  action of the galvanic   series were also no
 ticed, which militate    with modern  theories, but  do not  oppose that
 now proposed.       The power of the series in producing electricity,

effects on the organs of sensation     and motion, heat, light, Ike.
were then examined, and stated         to be explicable according to
the principles before referred to :      and it was conceived that all
these effects, as they occur, are      irreconcilable to the electrical
hypothesis.

    Mr. Forbes    (in his Oriental Memoirs, an interesting and

great attention to its changing colours.         Its general colour was
"a pleasaut green" spotted with pale blue. Its customary
changes w ere to a bright yellow, a dark olive, and a dull green ;
but when irritated, or when a dog approached, in which case fear
was perhaps the operating cause, the body became considerably
inflated, ari l the skin clouded like tortoiseshell, in shades of
yellow, orange, green and black : in these circumstances it ap

"XXtX. Short       Notices of Geological Observations made in the
     Summer of    1814, in the South of Yorkshire, and in North
     Wales, and of some Inferences therefrom, as to the Structure
.    of England and Wales. By John Farey, Sen.
                            To Mr.   Tilloch.
Sir, — I4 or    several months past it has been my intention to send
you during the present winter, an account, considerably in de
tail, of my Observations on the Strata during the last Summer,
and of certain new Geological inferences which they seem to
warrant,- as far at least as the structure of England and Wales
is concerned : but seeing reason now to fear, that Time will not
permit the sending all the details intended, I must beg your in
sertion of a shorter Notice on the subject.
     When J began, several years ago, to apply the Smithian prin
ciples of Stratification to practice, in the minute investigation of
the Strata of particular Estates and their vicinities, and, with
 less minuteness, to much larger Districts, I fell in some instances
into the error, to which observers of Nature have ever been
liable, of concluding too soon, that I had become acquainted
with all the leading characters of the Strata which I had investi
gated locally: — when for instance, I had traced my 1st, 2d, and
3rd Gritstone Rocks of Derbyshire, for more than 25 Miles, from
 Durneld northward, with but slight variations in their thicknesses
 or characters, as single Rocks, and had traced the Limestone-
 shale below and the 4th Grit, above these Rocks, still further
 northward, beyond Woodhead and Penistone, without material
 variations in their characters, I too hastily concluded (when about
 to finish my observations beyond Derbyshire on that side, in
  1809) from observations at a few points, as to some other points,
 in the ranges of these three intermediate Rocks and their Coal-
  shales in this part of Yorkshire.
     To some errors which were, in consequence hereof, printed in
 my Derbyshire Report, other more material ones having been
  added, by Persons who attempted to follow up the investigations
  1 had begun, and disappointment       following, in some trials that
  were made in search of Limestone, in Uden Vale, I was sent for
  last Summer, to complete my observations in this corner of
  Yorkshire, to the left of the old Road from Sheffield to Peni
  stone. . By this .means 1 discovered the source of my former
  mistakes, in the new and unexpected characters which the 1st,
  2d, and 3rd Rocks, and other intervening strata, exhibit, in these
  parts of their Ranges.    Instead of the same entire thickness of
  these Rocks continuing, as above mentioned, each one was here
  found much thicker, separated into two distinct Rocks, bv bind

   or soft and perishable stone, and making two distinct Basset
   Ridges, such, that had I happened in 1807, to have begun my'
   Survey here, instead of near Ashover, these divided Rocks, must
  each have had separate names or numerical designations.
      The positions which I at first adopted from Mr. Whitehurst
   (on reviewing nearly the same local facts as he had observed)
  as to the only very course gritstone of this series, occurring in
  the 1st Rock, and that "Coals are never found under coarse
  Gritstone," I in part corrected in 1S09, by the discovery (first
  made near this border of Yorkshire) of the coarseness of the
  3rd Rock, in numerous situations : but these now appeared,
  still further to be untenable positions, since in this corner of
  Yorkshire, the 2d Grit Rock was not only found very coarse
  in some places (and very fine and perfect, with concentric stains
  like shale-gritstone, in others), but the Car-house Rock* in the
  3rd Coal-shale, which in many places in Derbyshire appeared
  only as a very imperfect Stone or Bind, and even in a greater
  number of situations could not be distinguished (and therefore
  had not been numbered in my Series), here proved very coarse
 and thick, and formed the most conspicuous rocky Edges in the
 district 1 And, what will perhaps prove of greater interest to
 your Geological Readers, the 1st Coal-shale, not only produces
 here very coarse grit-stone beds, or large lenticular masses of such,
 and others that contain much calcareous matter, but it begins also
 to assume here, those metalliferous characters which have so long
 puzzled, in comparing the mining district of Yorkshire, Dur-
 harr), and Northumberland, with that of Derbvshire; the Broom-
 head and Wigtwizle Mines of Blende and Galena, proving to be
 in rake veins in the 1st Coal-shale!
     On examining the Coal-field of Anglesea Island 16 months
 ago, the appearances were so very dissimilar from the above, in
 the nearness of the workable seams of Coal to the Limestone, in
 the inconsiderable thickness of these calcareous Rocks, before
 coarse Slate commenced under them ; leaving scarcely any space
 for the loadstones, the Limestone-shale, or the 1st, 2d, or 3rd
 prit Rocks and their Coal-shales, so that sufficient similarity did
not remain, in these apparently extreme cases, to ground a con
jecture, as to the identity of this Coal-field with that on the
eastern side of Derbyshire. And the same appeared also to bev
nearly the case, with respect to the Denbighshire and Flintshire
Limestone and Coal Fields3 as far as my hasty journey across
    * The situation and characters of this Rock, were fully described in the
 Spring of 1813, in my Paper and Maps and Section of the Ashover Denur-
dati6n, which had been promised a place in the 2d volume of the Geological
Transactions ; but were subsequently denied that honour by a Geognostic
faction, see vol. slii. page 55, Note, aud p. a 17, Note.

             The Limestone Rocks         of North Wales,    described.        163
them, and a short stay, (in had weather) with an ingenious Friend
near St. Asaph, could enable me to judge: unfortunately, as it
now appears, I had descended Rhualt Hill into the vale of Clwyd
on its NE side in my way from Holywell, at a point where no
Limestone was visible (owing, as it since appears, to its edge
lieing low, covered by alluvial clay) and where nothing truly
indicated the direction of the dip of the strata*: ray Friends,
whom I very fully questioned, were only able to tell me of three
or four detached patches of Limestone, on all the north-eastern
border of the vale of Clwyd, and which they believed to be
perfectly unconnected, and to dip north-eastwardly , into the
Mountain : from this, and what I had myself seen of the northr
eastern dip of the two Limestone Rocks of Holywell (or Halkin)
and Abergeley (or Cefn) , I too hastily concluded, that there were
in this part of North Wales three Limestone Rocks far separate^
by Slate, &c. .agreeing nearly with those I had noticed near Lud
low, under-lieing the Clee-hills Coal-field.
    During the last Summer and Autumn, opportunities have how
ever been afforded me, by different Employers, of making a
pretty minute Survey of all the Coal-field to the NW of Holy
well, of examining other parts of it, and of satisfactorily tracing
the Limestone underlieing the Coals of North Wales.           Whereby
I  find, instead of there being three Limestone Rocks, widely se
parated by Slate, &c. that in general, four sueh Rocks occur,
 (as in Derbyshire, although not here separated by Toadstone) of
variable thickness, and not so far separated by intervening mat
ters, but the whole may be considered, in a very general view,
as one Rock, and as such I shall mention          in the following de

                       ;

the plane of the Limestone, when       covered the Slate here and that w here-

dip to what I had previously understood, and covering the slate'
instead of passing under it), then wheeling to the NNE and KE,
through Melidon, SE of Prestatyn to Gronatit, dipping WNWy
NW and at length N.
    Another grand wheel or change in the direction of these Rocks
takes place at Gronant, from whence they range nearly SE, in
an undulating line, with a NE dip, somewhat varied locally, in
the undulated parts, through Llanasa, SW of Whitford, Holy-t
well and Halkm, to Moel-y-gaer Hill, W of Northope ; where
a wheel is made to the SW for about a mile (with a SE dip) and
then another to the SSE, passing W of Mould, Nercwys and
 Llandegla to Tafarn-Dowyrch, with an eastern dip, and wheeling
then to the SE, it seems to cross the vale and turn N, with first
a NE and then a W dip.
-
    From a point SE of Llandegla, about half a mile, some obser
vations are yet wanting, to satisfactorily connect the range of
Limestone (or show the course of the Faults that prevent such
connection) to near Bwlch-y-Gwynt, and the SE side of Minera
Chapel, where the Limestone Rock appears again very majesti
cally, with an E dip, and proceeds across Ruabon Mountain and
 Eglwyseg Rocks, to a great Fault, ranging WNVV and ESE,
which I have traced on the N of Llangollen, passing just S of
the great Aqueduct at Pont-y-Cyssyllte and forwards into the
Coal-field.
  . By this Fault, the measures on the S are very greatly thrown
-
up, and the denudated edge of the Limestone, in consequence,
now appears a mile more eastwa'rdly : from hence it sets off
again SW, with a SE dip, but has not '-proceeded more than
three-quarters of a mile, before another Fault, ranging nearly
parallel to the last, again throws the basset to the eastward, into
lower ground, where it is nearly covered by alluvia, and this new
range continues, on the W of Chirk-Castle, to another great
Fault ranging nearly -parallel to the former, on the S of Chirk-
Castle and the Town ; by which the bassets are again thrown east
ward : anew range of the Limestone then commences and passes
W of Selattyn and near Oswestry Race-ground, to Pentrecefn,
where another large E and W Fault, throws up very greatly on its
S side, and moves the top of the Limestone E, to within half a
mile of Swinney Hall : from which point it again ranges SSW
to Llanymynech Quarries, on the south of which, a still larger
Fault than any of those above mentioned, ranges nearly NW and
SE, and probably passes forwards, on the S of the Wrekin Hill ?.
   As fa» as my late hasty view of this part of the Country would
enable me to judge, the Llanymynech Fault seems to throw up

 changed to the southward, in its thickness and qualities, so as to
 be with great difficulty recognised, when it appears again 4{ m.
 SE, in Balan Bank, south of the SeveYn, and whence, as I have
 been informed, this Limestone Rock, in a thin and very bad state,
ranges W of Woolaston and Westbury, N of Minsterley, NE of
 Haberley and Pulverbach, SW of Leebotwood*, &c. and that a
line of small Coal-works (whose names were mentioned to me)
accompanies, throughout, this last range of bad Limestone, on
ifs.NE side.
    The very irregular form and range of the Limestone which has
been mentioned above, seems to arise principally, from the nu
merous inequalities or ridges and troughs on the surface of the
coarse Slate, on which it was deposited, partly from the subse
quent dislocations occasioned by the Faults, and partly from the
still later and stupendous denudation, which the whole country
has suffered ; and by the combined operations of which three
causes, numerous detached lengthened Basins or Troughs, and
patches of the Limestone are left, as memorials of their opera
tions.
    One of         detached Limestone Troughs iiearly crosses
                 these
Anglesea, from  Malldraeth  Sands to Red-wharf, and has a small

Menai straight.   On the WSW of Caergwrle there are two de

Limestone in the slate ? I have                 not at present the means of

      I
      now, consider the identity of the Limestone and superincum
bent Coal-measures of Flint, Denbigh and Salop Counties, and
those of Derbyshire and Yorkshire, as sufficiently made out, by
my recent Survey, striking as the dissimilarities of them appeared
at first sight, viz. in the substitution of such very different strata
in places of the loadstones;          the extraneous fossils proving
much rarer here than in Derbyshire.       But the species of those that
are found, will however agree in those distant places, I believe,
both of shells in the Limestone and 9th Coal-shale ; and the
 Crowstone Reeds (W of Oswestry in particular) and other coaly
vegetable Impressions.      The Limestone-Shale also proves very
thin in most parts of North Wales, and either in or under
it, an unusual quantity of Chert occurs, locally, in thin strata
(sometimes striped as in Ashover and other places in Derbyshire),
which siliceous beds and the Limestone near them, seem to be
the most productive of Lead Ore, Calamine * and Blende, and
perhaps none of the Mineral Veins bear Ore in the lower part of
the series, near to the Slate: blue pozolanic Limestone           locally     is
found, imbedded in the lower part of this Limestone Shale.           The,
Coal-shales most of them seem thinner than in Derbyshire             and           ;
to the NW of Holywell, useful seams of Coal do not appear be-
Jow the 5th Grit Rock: but near Oswestry, on the contrary, the
seams in the 3rd Coal-shale appear more valuable than perhaps
any in this part of the series in or near Derbyshire. In the 10th
and 11th Coal- shales          mistake not the numbers in the local
                                 (if

 Grit Rock in Mostyn Park and other places, proves more su
 perior to the stone of any of the adjacent Rocks, than we find
 to be the case in Derbyshire: it is here called the Black Cannel
Rock.
  The Coal-fiefd of Flint (with Wirral in Cheshire), Denbigh and
Salop Counties, of which I have been speaking, seems terminated
on all its north-east and east sides, by ouerlietng, and sometimes
unconformable strata, of Real Marl, or their imbedded red, soft
Gritstones ! ; this appears a very striking feature of the British
stratification, which I could not see sufficient reason for admit
ting, in any case, until the last Spring, as I have mentioned in
a Note to page 330, of your xliiid volume*.
    While in Yorkshire, in July last, I was fortunate enough to
obtain from my Friend Mr. Andrew Faulds, of Worsborough, an
intelligent and able Coal-agent, the sketch plan, section and
particulars of Garforth Colliery near Abberford, in which, four
seams of Coal occur,' in 150 yards of sinking, on the west side
of the edge of the yellow Limestone, and in lower ground, dip
ping S, 1 in 20 ; and the basset edges of which seams were
known for considerable lengths, ranging VV and E, directly for
 the Limestone edge, under which they pass, and under the Sand
 stratum also beneath the Limestone ! ; which sand I have partis
 cularly mentioned in Derby. Report ii. 410 Note.       Several pits
have been sunk in the eastern part of this Colliery, which pene
trated the horizontal yellotv Limestone (with blue beds therein.
 I believe) 17 to 20 yards thick, and the Sand beneath          it,
                                                              before
 the dipping Coal-measures and seams of Coals above mentioned
-were reached   !
                !
    This new fact, of which no parallel presented itself, while          I
 was employed on my Derbyshire Survey or since, and of which
 no author that I  have read has mentioned an instance, viz. of the
 yellow Limestone and its incumbent Sand (or sandstone) being
 sometimes found unconformable to the Coal-measures beneath
   * Candour
               requires me also to mention here, that before examining Pis-
tern Hill, in  Smithsby, in the south of Derbyshire, my able friend Edward
Mammatt, Esq. of Measham, mentioned to me a report of old Colliers,
that level Red Marl and Gritstone, there covered dipping Coal-measures;
but on minutely examining the surface, and inquiring on the spot (for the
works were long discontinued)  I   could hear of or see no such things and
 therefore did not meutionit   in my Report, but which now

 still however be permitted to say, that proofs have yet in no inr
 stances been offered, that Faults do not range in the manner re
 presented in my Maps, or very nearly so, however much I may
 have miscalculated the magnitudes of their derangements, and
 consequent effects on the visible parts of the Strata : and that
 even in the present instance, that stretch or line of the zig-zag
 Fault, which I had observed passing (from Thorner) in a N\V
 and SE direction, at the foot of the Limestone edge near Kid7
 hall, on the Road from Tadcaster to Leeds, is recognized and
 named as such, in the Garforth Colliery map, received from
 Mr. Faulds ; although a far less derangement seems there asF
 signed to     it,

pp. 132, 159, 174 and 179 of my Derby, Report,) to be above

    The Geological, Inferences then, which appear to me deducti

 ducible into two very distinct parts, the product perhaps of very
 distant periods of time; the lowest or first, in which coarse Slalef
 and numerous other substances imbedded in the same, were de
 posited, and left with    very uneven surface

standing the British Strata which are accessible, but on the contrary, have
most materially impeded, the knowledge to be obtained, on Smit/iiun prin
ciples, of the actual structure of our Country, as deep as       concerns us
                                                                      it

  pendent," by numerous modern writers, because the evidences
  eeem very conclusive, that this formation was uniformly spread
  over the Limestone, as that also was over the Slate, before the
  first stupendous denudations took place, by which large patches
  of these strata were entirely removed, and their fractured                edges
  exposed on all sides.
        Some of my Friends are lately inclined to think, that this stale
  of external violence on the older strata, terminated by the de
  position, locally, of vast masses of highly mechanically rounded
  Quartz and other pebbles ; but I must see clear evidence, of such
   Gravel being now found wider any strata, those of Red Marl at
  the least, before I can assent to this position, or cease to assign a
  much later period, to all the Gravel and alluvial matters that
  we are acquainted with.
         The second grand division or period of the British stratifica
   tion, seems to have commenced with the deposition of the Red
  Marl, and its various locally imbedded Substances*, in an un
   conformable manner on all the denudated edges of the older
  strata, but conformably on all their naked planes ; and as these
  jast greatly preponderated in extent or surface, it has happened,
   that this general unconformableness, has not yet been universally
   known and assented to by British observers.
         Conformably with the top of this vast series of Red Marlf,
   and its imbedded soft red Gritstones, &c. are found deposited, the
  vast series of strata of the east and south-east of England and the
   adjacent parts of the Continent \ as I first, I believe, enumerated
   them, in print, in my Derby. Report, page 1 11 to page 116, but
  in the reverse order to that in which we are now considering
   them: and on which enumeration of the upper British Series, it                   >
   seems now proper to remark, that the " natural division" of the
   vyhole of those mentioned, will seem made with more propriety,
   at the bottom, rather than the top of the Red Marl Series. I
   would also here recall to mind, the correction which I made at
        * The     Basaltic hummocks, so often found locally covering the Coal-
   measures, seem referable to the bottom of this stratum, and are perhaps
,   unconformable in some instances?.
        f   The irregular and wedge-like stratification, so common in the Qrit-
   stones of this stratum, sufficiently explains how the stratification, begun on
   an uneven floor, was reduced above, to the very regular and horizontal beds,
   which I have mentioned in my Report, vol. i. pp. 117 and 174, and which
   1 have since almost everywhere observed in this Marl.
        J   We have been made acquainted with the identity of the upper part of
   the series of Strata, in these different Countries, by investigations com-
   menced abroad, since Mr. Smith's investigation and Maps had been ma
    tured, nearly to their present state (as     I have explained in your xxxvth
   volume, page 113), and had been made known to scores of intelligent pcr-
    Sftjfts, although to the present time, he has published nothing on the subject,
   't'                                                                        page

page 100 of your xxxixth volume, of my previous statements, as
to real Coal-seams not being found in England, higher in the
series than the Red Marl, as Mr. Smith originally taught.
    Since the deposition of the upper series of British strata was
completed, the same seems to have been subjected to dislocating,
 and since to denudating external causes, more extensive in their
 operation than those before mentioned ; and wherein the effect
 of wise design is throughout clearly manifested, in so directing
 the stupendous excavating cause (or causes) as to produce the
 perfect system of valleys, covering every part of the surface, for
 its drainage, as completely as the veins are distributed for re
 turning all the blood to the heart of an animal.           Towards the
 conclusion of which eventful period, depositions of alluvial mat
 ters were generally scattered, and in some places accumulated in
 vast heaps, filling up slight inequalities, and finishing the beauti
 ful contour of the terrestrial surface, as the same had previously
 been designed, by its Creator. The still operating causes, of de
 composition or mouldering of the surface of the strata, the tides,
 torrents, depositions from turbid waters, the growth of peat,
 &c. &c. have in so very trifling a degree altered the true geolo
 gical features of the country, as they were left at the period
 above mentioned (although the same appears to have been long
 prior to the existence of all the present races of living animals
 and vegetables) that the mention of them here, might perhaps
 have been spared.
    It remains only, to hint at the very important consequences,
 to the present and to future generations of the Inhabitants of
 this Island, which may follow from the views here taken, as to
 the probable extent of Coals, under the greater part of the Red
 Marl ! ; and that a minute examination of the extended surface
 of this stratum, with a view to discover such parts as are deepest
 excavated, or wherein the under-measures are brought nearest
 to the surface, by irregularities in their planes, or by Faults, wherein
 trials for Coals may be instituted, with prospects of the greatest
 advantage to districts, that are now far removed from pits of this
 essential article, are among our greatest desiderata.            -

 I hope now afford me, of adding some further observations, by
  way of Postscript to my Letter, which I will now proceed tq
  make.
      I have never visited the neighbourhood of Whitehaven ; but
  jn several conversations which I had in the spring of 1 806, with
  Mr. Edward Martin, who furnished materials for the account
 published that year in the Philosophical Transactions, of the
  Coal-Basin of Sputh Wales, wherein he has long resided and
 practised as a Coal-Engineer, I remember his telling me, that
 he was brought up and taught his art, in the Coal district near
  Whitehaven, and that the several Coalrseams there, could be
 .clearly identified with those in South Wales, where he was then
 more immediately employed.                In his account to me of the latter
 Coal-Field, in the published account thereof, or in any of my sub
 sequent inquiries while on the edge of this district or otherwise, J
 have not been able to learn, that Limestone occurs in the South
Wales Coal Basin, except at the lower edges of the Coal-measures?
 basseting from under them : I wish now therefore to supply an
 omission in my Letter, where I should, when enumerating the
 probable instances of unconformable yellow Limestone on Coal-
 ineasrtrei, (p. 168) have mentioned that at Preston- Hows, l|m,
 SW of Whitehaven, twelve yards of yellowish Limestone, and then
 43 yards of red Chit Rock, are sunk through at the top of a CoaU
 Pit, that is 216 yards dee)) ! ; the minute particulars of which were
 Jong ago published by Mr. Dixon, and have been copied into
the 2d Editicm of Williams's
                                      " Mineral Kingdom," vol. ii. p.246 ;

 this important fact, to Mi'. Bakewejl's Section* at top of' your                 '

the remarkable Limestone Rock, ranging NW with an eastern dip, through Snap,

and western sides of which slates I believe this Limestone to lap, but which we searcH
for in vain in Mr. It's Section ! ; and wherein it would I believe be found, that
between C and the Slate, considerably too little space is allowed, and that a trough
of Limestone is there omitted, containing Coal-measures within it. (having sma.U.

     did not see, or hear from Mr. Arrowsmith and other practical Colliers with whom
1 t   conversed, of any Coal-seams which regularly basset towards the East, instead of
  continuing on and passing under the yellow Limestone:            T   hope therefore that
  Mr. B. will favour me and your Readers by little more precision, as to the actual
                                                 a
  line of his Section in this part, and the truth of its representation, to the left or
  westward of his letter B.   I   heard of the Coal being in some places cut off, and
  cropping out before     came to the Limestone (p. 84). But on inquiry, the former
                         it
  of these seemed only ordinary cases of fault-i, and the latter, as far as they were
  not altogether supposititious,   seemed only local risirfgs of the strata against bumps
  in those beneath: but no final bassets down kill were mentioned, such as the Section
  represents.
      At the bottom of page 90, Mr. B. appears to apologize to your Readers, for
 making a quotation,, " in the language of hypothesis," from Mr. Forstcr's work,
 Xp. 126);    it had however  1 think been better fur Mr. B's reputation and the cause
 of truth,- that the whole should have been omitted since in searching through
                                                          ;

 of Mountains being " thrust through the superficial covering of the Globe," by
 imaginary subterranean Fires!.       The following  i< an essential part of the sentence
 which Mr. B. has partially qiiu'ed, following the words " Scotland and north
 ward ;" viz. "The mines at Leadhill and Wanlock-head are              in this rock, as are
 also the Black-lead) Wad-Mines in Korrowdale, and several other mines of I«ad.

 out of this rock in several places of Cumberland."         If we turn to page 2-, Note,
 we shall find Mr. F's own definition of ihe word dyke, used at the beginning of
 the passage quoted, (not " dyke or vein" as Mr. B. previously intimates,) to be,
 " a natural crack, fissure, or chasm in the strata, which chasm       is  commonly rilled
 up with heterogeneous matter." All which think fully exclude the interpretation
                                               I
 that Mr. B. has attempted, of this passage in Mr. Forster's Book the obscurity
                                                                            ;
 at the beginning of which passage,   I   have b«en used to attribute, to an error of the
 press, in wrongly joining an unacknowledged quotation             from some Author (of
 wh:ch unfortunately Mr. F's Book furnishes numerous instances) in the middle
 of hus own account of dykes of stone.
     The unfortunate figure which Mr. B. must have cut, from indulging the-ehit   in
favourite Plutonic whims, as to the thrusling up of the mass of the Cleveland or
eastern Moorland Hills, and his consequent inference of inclining strata from their
centre, contrary to the facts, (see Phil. Mag. vol. xliii. pp. 257 and 258,) would,
I   should have thought, operated, to prevent similar indulgences again, so near to
the same district.       Jhad entertained the hope, that the forthcoming Edition           of
Mr. B's Geology, would be freed from these Plutomc blemishes, and wish may             1
                                                                        •

 places at least, &c. &c.
        I wish next to mention, that having returned to Mr. Faulds
  the rough Sketches of the Garforth Colliery, Map and Section,
  which he had lent me (p. 167), with reduced copies thereof for his
  careful revision on the spot, and requesting answers to 17 queries
  on the subject ; that a few days ago I was favoured by his answer,
  mentioning, that his valuable Friend Mr. James Porter, of Gar
  forth, had first pointed out to him the very interesting, although
  not unique circumstances of this Colliery, because he says, that
  nearly similar observations have been made in Kippax and in
   Glass-Houghton Collieries, a few miles southward: — that he
  had transmitted my Map and Queries to Mr. Porter, from whom
   I might expect shortly to receive more satisfactory answers, than
  it was at present in his power to give, respecting a district near
  20 miles from his own residence.           I may therefore hope to have '
  the means shortly, of bringing these important Facts more fully
  before the public.
        I have never visited either Kippax or Glass- Houghton Col
  lieries, although I have made some observations on the gypseous
" Red Marl between the Limestone Rocks at Fairburn,                which is
  between these places, as mentioned in your xxxixth volume,
  p. 104 ; and I cannot avoid on this occasion expressing my sur
  prise and regret, that neither during this excursion, nor in the
  large mass of written information which my kind Friend Mr.
  Smithson collected for me, in answer to queries which he printed
  and circulated to most of the Yorkshire Coal-Owners, &c. fand
  which command and have my most grateful acknowledgements
  to those Gentlemen) that these interesting facts were not sooner
  made known.          I can now pretty clearly see the reason, and it
  may     be  of  use to  other observers to mention     it,   of my never
  having     noticed  or suspected the unconformableness of the yellow
  Limestone to the Coal-measures, viz. the loose nature of the
  intervening Sand or soft Rock, which will in general be found
  mouldered down over the upper Coal-measures            :     otherwise,  in
  the numerous times that    1     have ascended and descended the edge
  of this Limestone Rock, in various parts of its range,            I   must
  have noticed this fact   (if   as prevalent asI    now suspectit   to be),
        the Limestone had lain immediately on the Coal-measures.
I if
     hope however, now, that the attention of those best able to elu
  cidate the subject,I      mean the practical Men of the district, and
  of every other, where this Rock can be identified, will not relax,
  until the truth, wherever   it    may lie,
                                           is   fully established.
   It     will be seenby    your Readers, that Mr.Bakewell and myself
  now concur pretty fully, as to the little or rather the negative aid
  .   -;                                                                that

ihat  we may expect, either from the initiated        or the dupes of a
foreign Geognostic faction sprung up amongst us ; and your
work, Mr. Editor, is the more valuable, as a channel of com
 munication for useful facts, whether new or in confirmation of
correction of others already printed, expressed in the terms and
 language which may be familiar to the writers or their infor
 mants, accompanied or not by Inferences, of any kind, which they
may think deducible from their own communicated information,
 or that of others.
    I could not help thinking this morning that I perceived some
 thing of the influence above alluded to, while perusing an account
just published in the " Annals of Philosophy," of four species
 (or varieties rather perhaps, some of them) of the remains or
alveoli of Belemnites, found in argillaceous Coal-measures, and
of six others found in the Limestone near adjacent to them*, — in
 Blackburn Colliery in Livingstone, in Linlithgowshire : — how else
could it be doubted (p, 204) that " the concamerated alveolis"
belonged to a Belemnite 1, or the mistakes have now been printed,
that Belemnites are very rare in Scotland ?, and much more
so, that in England we find them in few situations ? : when Mr.
James Sowerby in his " Mineral Concliology,'' p. 128, has men
tioned the proofs that exist, in Woodward's and Bevan's Speci
mens and others, and alluded to his own and others' specimens,
which show this incoutestably.        While I was in Scotland, I saw
at Brora, very numerous Belemnites, in what I believe to be the
very same Coal-shale, as that from whence Mr. Fleming took
his specimens : they were well known there, by the name of " pe
trified Tangles" (a tubular sea-weed) as mentioned by another
Scotch observer in the same number of the Annals, p. 235, and
were considered as far from uncommon in Scotland.                In Eng
land we have at least 20 strata (far separated from each other,
by intervening strata without Belemnites) which produce them,
probably of a distinct species in eachBelemnitic stratum, and even
that more than one species are found, in some of these places in
the British series; so that excepting anomia Shells, we have per
haps no extraneous Fossil near so common in England as the
Belemnite, and in nearly all of which, when in situ, vestiges at
least of their alveoli may be seen.
    The Gentleman alluded to, furnished Mr. Sowerby with five
species of shells of the genus Productus, f«om either the same or
a iiear adjoining Limestone Rock as his six Belemnites (or " Or-
thocera," as it seems now agreed to call them) were takeny and
which are published in No. 13, of Min. Conch. I presume to
hope therefore, that cither he, or some kind friends to Geological
              . * See Kirwan's "Geological Essays," p. 314.

'of all these Orthocera, from as many and as distant places as
.may be, mentioning      their exact localities and strata, by their
 ordinary   and  local names,   in order that the same may in due
course appear,    in his very useful work, unmixed with Geognostic
speculations and distinctions, which may greatly impair, but
fcannot add to the value of coloured figures and a descriptive enu
meration of British Fossil Shells, with their habitats.
    But to return to the first article in your last Number, I beg to
•congratulate Mr. Bakewell on the very superior account of the
•Northumberland and Durham strata, which he has presented to
your Readers ; and to thank him for the very liberal manner in
which he has brought Mr. Forster's work hefore the public *,
 and which I hope that we shall see reiterated in the forth-coming
 Edition of his Geology.      And consistently with the opinion that
 I have long ago expressed to your Readers, of the usefulness of
Mr. B's Geological writings (and which, from being less Geogno-
stical and Plutonical, will I trust further improve hereafter), I
beg to make a few further remarks on his late paper, with a view
only of adding to its truth and usefulness.
    It will be recollected, that I objected to Mr. Bakewell's Geo
logical Map of England, in his Geology, 1st Edition, as at
tempting a greater simplification than nature admitted; at that
time Mr. B. did not extend his " Low district" far enough north
in Yorkshire (as I observed, P. M. xlii. p. 57), but now on the
contrary, he seems to have extended this uppermost of his three
divisions, too far in that direction, when he intimates, at p. 82,
that the yellow Limestone (extending far into Northumberland)
is to be classed with the strata that prevail " on the eastern
                                f
side of England ;" notwithstanding that this Rock so evidently
belongs to the Red Marl, which is nowhere admitted into Mr. B's
 low district, N of Leicester ; but even the Bath Odlite, far above
it, is excluded a place therein, in Mr. B's Map, in the vicinity
of Bath, and thence southward.
    The grand Fault which I have supposed to range SW and NE
from near Aiuderby-Steeple to near Redcar in Yorkshire, (P. M.
    *       I have
              very often quoted, and recommended the sale of Mr. Forster s
Book; hut unfortunately,      it is not sold hut at Newcastle, whence have   I
procured       for three or four of my friends.
                     it,                            beg also to mention, with
                                                     I

            in       would soon be more sought after; and from a similar
                           it
jiiotive will mention also, that the Binder employed to do up his Work in
            I
Boards, most reprehensibly omits sewing therein, so that all the copies          I
have seen, were no sooner cut, but the middle of each sheet became loose
and ready to fall out.
 t     In page 93, Mr. B. expressly says, that the Sunderland Lime&tone ex
 tends " through the south-easier n Counties," but which surely  uufounded.
                                                                   is

ing for the Rath Oalite, the Lias Clay and Limestone, and numerous
other thick strata, nowhere appearing on our east coast!: and
since that Mr. B. ha? at length admitted (p. 93) ic the frequent
disappearance of a whole series of strata on one side of a Fault," I
hope that in his new Edition, he will not be found supporting the
veryimprobable position he has mentioned p. 84, viz. that the alum
Shale (or clunch Clay) of the Cleveland Hills, is identical with
 the Coal shale, intervening between the yellow Limestone and
 the Coals at Pallion, 2m. W of Sunderland Iron Bridge: the
thickness of which Coal shale, I cannot think but Mr. B. has
over-rated, by trusting to his memory; and on which account I
beg to express a wish, that Mr. Goodchild would favour you with
 an accurate and particular account of his boring for Coals under
 the yellow Limestone, to be recorded in your work.           Consi

           snowy  IVeather. By  Mrs.  Agnes Ibbetson.
                                  To    Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, — Having        seen    letter in one of your Magazines, en
                                 a
deavouring  to account   for the phenomenon        attending the roots
of plants in snowy weather, and being humbly of opinion that
the fact   ismis-stated, having last winter particularly attended
to the appearance in question,         shall venture to suggest
                                           I                       few             a
observations on the subject.
   Whenever the snow lies for any time, generally             observed
                                                                    it   is
to melt and pass off round where             tree or shrub shades the
                                                  a
ground. Now in reality this effect has nothing to do with the
tree, as   Ishall show.     At first, indeed,     occurred to me that
                                                         it
the motion of the root might occasion a degree of heat which
might melt the snow, as        know

                                               by
there is much more action in them than             generally supposed,

 $nd motion will prevent congelation even in water, if not already
  too near the freezing point.   But observing that the snow passed
  off in breadth in proportion to the spreading and shading of the
 branches ; I fixed a long stick in the ground, and tied an um
 brella to   it,
               which should, when spreading, be about six or seven
 feet from the earth.       was then going to snow
                                 It                     and when  ;             it
 was already pretty deep round the stick, expanded the umbrella,

 and before the next morning, the whole extent of the circle of
 the parasole was totally melted before nine o'clock.          could   It
 not therefore be any effect of the roots of plants that caused the
 snow to dissolve   ; but was     not rather the dews and vapours
                                       it
falling and sinking among the dead leaves, putrid vegetable
 matter, or calcareous earth, which became nitrate of potash or
 saltpetre, and of course increased the cold, and preserved the
congelation of the rest of the snow           Many other trials and

propriety though not of consequence enough to be submitted

how many juices, and various liquids and compounds, are be
stowed on us       by
                   the atmosphere.     The hairs of the plants make
that subject most visible, though they may, like the salts afore
mentioned, not descend to us in         perfect state

Sir, — The     circumstance of two clocks keeping the same time
so closely together,and that for periods of considerable lengthv
of time, appearing extraordinary and unexpected to me,       the          is
reason why   Ihave transmitted the case to you and should you;
deem     worthy an insertion in your valuable Journal,
        it                                                     at     it   is
your service.
   Both the clocks were going in an imperfect state, and were
intended for further improvement:      but their assuming the
appearance of keeping so near together, made me delay the
taking them down to make any alterations, till     saw how long
                                                              I
they would  continue to do soj which they did  for such   length      a

of time, and might     have done so for how long I shall not pre
 tend to say ; had it not at last became necessary for me to put
 an end to it.   One of the clocks was a month one, with a re
 coiling scapement, and a compensation pendulum made after
 Ward's construction.     The other was an eight-day one, having
a detached scapement, and a zinc tube compensation pendulum,
both made some years ago, and of my own contrivance.
    During a period of four months previous to the middle of No
vember 1813, they kept so constantly and close together, that
at no time could I perceive the tenth part of a second of difference
between them; indeed no sensible difference could be perceived,
either by myself or by another person who had occasion fre
 quently to see them expressly for this purpose.      A pretty sharp
cold taking place   on  one    of the nights  in this November, the
month clock made a little deviation from the      other; this was im
puted to the influence of the cdd upon the oil, as the arc of the
vibration of the pendulum was followed by being shortened a
little at this same time.     However, very soon after, they again
went together, allowance being made for the difference or devia
tion made by the one from the other, and this difference was
kept up to for more than a period of 164 days afterwards. The
mean daily rate of these clocks, during the four months previous
to the middle of November 1813, was -f-0-2 per diem.             The
mean daily rate of them during a period of 1(M days, viz.
from the 2d of February 1814 to the 16th of July, was also
-j- 0-2 per diem, the same as before.          shall give an abstract
                                                  I
more in detail, of their going during these 164 days, not with
the view of showing any great perfection either in their rates or
in the compensation      yet at the same time
                            ;                         may be allowed
                                                         it
that in these respects, considering the incorrect state in which
they were, few clocks, even in their best and most correct
condition, have,     any thing, much exceeded this.
                       if                                  On the 2d
of February, the clock- having the detached scapement was fast
by mean time lm 35*.       The month clock was about 53 seconds
faster than      it,
                and this,difference     maintained during 164 days,
                                        it
when the month clock was taken down to be corrected and to
get another pendulum.

    These two clocks coming to keep time so close and near to
gether, and for such a length of time, was a matter merely acci
dental : I should consider it a very vain pursuit, to attempt to
make any two clocks do so, nor do I think that there is any pro
bability of my seeing the like to take place again.       It is not im
possible to make     two clocks to go very nearly together, and for
a considerable length of time too, but in this very nearly, and
in that quite close, there is a very wide difference.
     It has been said in some of the numbers of your Phil. Journal,
where I think that I have seen            it,
                                           that a clock with       dead
                                                                    a
beat scapement was made        by  the late Mr. Grignion, and given
by him to the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manu
factures, &c. " that any addition or diminution of the motive
force would produce no alteration in the time-keeping             of the
 clock."     Now, sir, being well acquainted with the principle of
 the dead beat scapement,     I   cannot easily admit this.       When
 this circumstance was mentioned,            should surely have been
                                             it
 stated in what manner this was obtained by Mr. Grignion, in
 the dead beat scapement.       Where this takes place in any scape
 ment, I     humbly presume   it   can then no longer have the pro
 perties of that of the dead beat scapement.           However,     if
                                                                     you
 or any of your correspondents will have the goodness to take
 trie trouble to explain this,      itwill be esteemed     considerable
                                                                a
 favour.
     From the same respectable authority of Mr. Grignion, we are
 informed that in the year 1641          clock was made and put up
                                         a

 who had applied   a   pendulum to it.    This    rather singular, con
                                                  is
 sidering the cavilling which took place many years afterwards, as
  to the priority or right of having first applied the pendulum to
a   clock.    Father Alexander tells us, that there were no clocks
 made with pendulums to them in Paris, till after the year 1660;
  and yet there was a duodecimo pamphlet of Galilei's, On the
  nature and properties of pendulous bodies, translated from the
  Italian into French, published at Paris in 1639. May we not
 hazard a    conjecture for Richard Harris in this case       Our coun

  about the time that Galilei was there.              It

               a   clock, and afterwards may have communicated
  these ideas to Richard Harris on his returning to London.              It

XXXII.        On Steam-Boats.        By Robertson Buchanan, Esq.
                                 of Glasgow.
                             To Mr. Tilloch.
Dear Sir, — Agreeably              to your request. I now send you some
account of the steam-boats on the Clyde.
                         I am, dear sir,
                                     Your most obedient servant,
    Glasgow, January 9, 1815.                 ROBERTSON BUCHANAN.
     So early as the year 1801, a vessel propelled by steam was
tried on the Forth and Clyde inland navigation, but was laid
aside, among other reasons, on account of the injury it threatened
the banks of the canal by the agitation of the water: and as far
as I can learn, the same objection still subsists to the use of steam
boats on artificial canals so narrow as those usual in Great Bri
tain. That objection, however, I should think, does not apply to
 some of those of Holland and other countries on the continent.
     The first attempt on any scale worthy of notice, to navigate
 by steam on the river Clyde, was in the year 1812*.            A passage
'boat of about 40 feet keel and 10 \ feet beam, having a steam-
 engine of only three horses' power, began to ply on the river.
 Since that period the number of boats has gradually increased.
      Besides three vessels which have left the Clyde, there are six
 at present plying on the river, two of which carry goods as well
 as passengers.       They have on the whole been gradue.'ly increased
 in tonnage as well as in the power of their engines ; and still
 larger boats and more powerful engines are now constructing :
 among others, one of about 100 feet keel and 17 feet beam with
 an engine of 24 horses' power; and one of equal burthen, having
 an engine of 30 horses' power f.            These boats are all neatly
  fitted up, and some of them even elegantly decorated.
      On board all the passage steam-boats are newspapers, pam-
     * The first steam-boat in America was launched at New-York on the
  3d  of October 1807, and began to ply on the river between that city and
  Albany, a distance of about 120 miles.

 phlets, books, &c. for the amusement of the passengers, and such
 refreshments as are desirable on so short a voyage, a distance of
 about 26 miles by water, and 24 by land.
     The voyage betwixt Glasgow and Greenock, including stop
 pages at intermediate places, is commonly accomplished in from
 three to four hours, the vessels taking advantage of the tide as
 far as circumstances will permit : but as they start at different
 hours from the same place, they are sometimes obliged to go
 part or nearly the whole of their voyage against the tide.
   Ih   i voyage has been accomplished in 2| hours ; the tide being
 favourable, but against a moderate breeze of contrary wind*.
    At first, owing to the novelty and apparent danger of the con
 veyance, the number of passengers was so very small that the
 only steam-boat then on the river could hardly clear her ex
 penses : but the degree of success which attended that attempt
 soon commanded public confidence.        The number of passengers
 which now go in those boats may seem incredible to those who
have not witnessed it. Travelling by land has not only been
 nearly superseded, but the communication very greatly increased,
 owing to the cheapness and facility of the conveyance.       Many
 days, in  fine weather, from 500  to 600  have gone from  Glasgow
to Port- Glasgow and Greenock, and returned in the same day.
One of the boats alone has been known to carry 247 at one
time. The increase of travelling in consequence of navigation
by steam, may be estimated by the number that went in the com
mon passage boats before the introduction of this agent : at that
time, the highest estimate even for summer did not much exceed
50 up and 50 down, and those generally of the lower class of
the people.      The number that then went by coaches may be
thus estimated : four coaches up and four down, which might
average six passengers each.
    In the summer, the pleasure of the voyage and the beauty of
the scenery attract multitudes ; and the bathing-places below
Greenock have, in consequence of the easy passage, been crowded
beyond former example.
    The scenery near Glasgow is sylvan and beautiful, but be
comes bolder and more picturesque as the river descends, until it
terminate in the rugged mountains of the west Highlands.

                           To    Mr. Tilloch.

Sir,— JL hat     time is now arrived, of which I last year promised
to give notice, when the seeds are to be discovered mounting
in the alburnum vessels from the root.      It is a phenomenon so
easily seen, that I cannot help calling on botanists in general
to convince themselves of a fact of such consequence to science,
and establishing the foundation        admitted) of
                                         (if             more perfect

knowledge in the formation of plants than we yet possess.            re It
quires no other preparation (to view      well)itthan  merely   cutting
off
  a   small piece df the outward rind of any tree, then cutting an
extremely thin slice adjoining the several cuticles, which             if it   is
the proper piece
                   (that   the alburnum vessels)
                          is                           will be so soft

184        A  Paper proving that   the  Embryos of  the Seeds
complete account of their proceedings from their first formation
in the side roots to their settling in the" buds : I shall then an
swer every objection that has occurred to myself, or been sug
gested by others in contradiction to the fact here reported, with
the same exactness and impartiality as if I were unconnected with
 the discovery.
      When first I viewed these balls just entering the bud> I could
 not conceive what they were ; but pursuing them in tiie right
 season for several years together, I found that they commenced
 their course in the radicle, at the termination of the side roots,
 about the end of January ; there they appeared to be first formed
 in a soijt of gross powder, which separated as it advanced further
 into the root, and soon became very small balls, which after
 wards entered the narrow passage of the middle root : here they
 generally stopped for a time, and then, proceeding across the cen
  tre, entered the alburnum vessels in the stem, and mounted to the
  buds.     Suppose the larch or oak tree, — but the first is the most
  distinguished and clear for viewing the completion of this curious
  phenomenon, as the shooting of its beautiful red flowers marks
  best the time of observation.        The seeds having mounted the
  stem arrive at a collection of gemma", and form a large heap at the
  middle points of the pith leading up to the buds ; here they re
  main many days, perln.ps a week or more, till the vessel of di
  spersion has formed, and run from the heap opening at each bud ;
   the seed-vessel of which remains distended for the reception of
   the seeds. When this is complete, the balls enter this new- f ormed
   vessel one by one, and slide up the cylinder to each pericarp,
   and such a number of balls are deposited in each seed-vessel as
   suits the urder to which the tree belongs.      Thus the seeds dis
   appear   from   the heap by degrees,  and  the  pericarps when they
   have attained their proper number close at the bottom, and the
   vessel of dispersion is soon lost in the increasing part of the
   plant ; but the seeds never enlarge from the time they quit the
    middle rcot till they enter the bud.
       1 must observe that I have every reason to believe that it is
    the heart of the seed only that is formed in the root, that part
    which afterwards becomes the embryo of the plant.            In the
    wheat and grasses it is so exactly marked, as the heart is before
    impregnation, that it is impossible not to be struck with the si
    militude of the figure.     1 conclude, therefore, that this part is
    formed by the immediate assemblage of the fresh blood of the
    plant mixing with and imbibing the new sap just proceeding from
    the earth, and pouring into the side roots.     We know that the
    liquid of those roots is drawn from the richest part of the vege
     table earth ; may not therefore the concoction thus formed, when
    both juices are in their purest state, and perfectly unmixed with
                                                                   other

                            are formed in the Root alone.                    185
ether ingredients, complete that production of animated nature,
which no other assemblage of matter could produce, and which
is concluded and finished by a thin thread of the line of life,
passing through each ball at its first formation ? When aggre
gated into a larger mass, their circle was completed ; and the
thread which ties them all together is fixed never%i be severed,
but, passing with them through all their different habitations, in
the side root, centre root, and alburnum vessel in the stem, fixes
 them at last in the seed-vessel, either incorporating the string
 with it. as in the lily, or hanging by               it,
                                                     as in the seed of the rose
 or violet, which seed              afterwards impregnated through this
                                       is
 identical stiing.        In the cactus tribe the balls being thoroughly
 divided, the string            admirably seen, being very thick in pro
                                  is
 portion, and so much more' woody and solid than the matter of
 the seed, that        it  easily distinguished.
                            is                          The seeds are found in
 every   plant   about     six  weeks   or  two  months     preceding flowering
 time, according to the season at which each plant performs that
 function.      In fir trees they rarely begin to show their seeds till the.
 seventh or eighth year of their age, and in other trees rather
  earlier.

 sir j for,  if placed in the air-pump, and a vacuum formed round
 them, it    has not the smallest effect on them ; whereas, place a
  real air-vessel, or rather a water plant with bubles of air in                            it,
  and the moment the vacuum              produced, all the bubbles swell

  in water or some water plants, though many air-bubbles ac
  company the sap.          If they were not seeds, would they not ap
  pear   at all  times,   and   not be confined to the season preceding
  the flowering     of   plants?    whereas they are rarely seen but at
  this time, except in those vegetables that flower twice, or for                           a
  long space of time.        A    few strayed on seed may, however, be
  found, but not in any quantity.           Neither can they be air sur
  rounded with the bark juices (as they sometimes appear in the
  firs), because they are really solid, and because in many trees
  they are so far removed from the inner bark vessels as to have
  no communication whatever with them.                    In the sempervivum
  tribe, the seeds are all in the alburnum vessels betweea two
  rinds, while the inner bark vessels, containing the bark juices,
  sse flxed in the interior between the second rind and the wood,
  and cannot therefore approach the seeds.               How admirably        this    is
  shown in     a specimen    of  the plant     how plain and decisive
                                                 !                              its    is

 present  it  to  the   public   as  an absolute    fact. Malpighi gave a
 specimen of the alburnum vessel            but, not viewing
                                             ;                       in the pro

 tain the seeds (see fig.      1,  Plate IV.) he called absorbent vessels,
 but designated them no further.                  But why should they not
 be the embryo       of the  seeds  ?   We     are    now well assured that
the bulbous roots form the flower in the root, and take in their
 seeds in the same place.           Ifone set of plants can receive their
seeds there, why should not all               It requires but cutting hy

in most^W the bark juices are of a deep yellow brown, and the
seeds of a most beautiful yellow white.         All this evidence, strong-
as it    is,  nothing to the perfect conviction the mind receives
               is
when in the arum the seeds are seen running up the middle
flower-stem, and thus passing into each separate seed-vessel, or
still plainer    possible in the larch, where a vessel
                     if                                         formed on      is
purpose    for transporting   them   to  their  proper    situations.   As
these reasons are,      think,I all sufficient,     will not   trouble
                                                                  I    the

                      I                                  almost as plain, is

specimen they cannot be seen to enter the pollen cases, but in
the arum, they are seen to proceed up the plant and enter the
stamen in the same manner as the seeds hail done just before in
their appropriate places.            have many reasons to suppose that

w      e haveseen that eight tetrahedrons may he united in a re
presentative form, whieh'has been designated under the name of
cubo-hexa-tetrahedron.      In this arrangement, the position of
two tetrahedrons differs from that of the six others but        easy
                                                                ;   it   is
to unite the same number of tetrahedrons,           giving to all of
                                                           by
them the same respective position.      For this purpose we shall
conceive that one of the summits of each tetrahedron         placed is
at one of the eight solid angles of a cube, and that this tetrahe
dron     situated in such
        is                   way that its three other summits are
                                a

 in' the plans which pass by the centre of the cube, and by the
three sides of this cube which form the solid angle.       The thirty-
 two summits of the eight tetrahedrons arranged in this way will
 be those of a polyhedron, which, in the case where the tetrahe
 drons are regular and have their centre of gravity at the same
 point, will have eighteen faces; viz. six square and twelve hexa
  gonal.
      It is easy to see that this polyhedron is nothing but a dode
  cahedron, of which the six summits with four faces shall have
  been curtailed by one-third of the adjoining ridges ; as the po
  sition of the eight tetrahedrons of which it is composed is the
  same for all, I have given it the hame of octo-tetrahedron.      The
  eight   tetrahedrons    which form this polyhedron by their junction,
  are placed two and two like the two tetrahedrons which form a
  cube, and four and four like the four tetrahedrons of which the
  tetra-tetrahedron      is composed ; we may therefore consider it
  also as produced by the union of four cubes, or of two tetra-
- tetrahedrons.
       The octo-tetrahedron having six faces, the middle parts of
  which are situated respectively like the six summits of an octo-
   hedron, we shall be able to unite these two polyhedrons into one
   only, in a manner analogous to that in which the combinations
   hitherto described are formed : but as this polyhedron is less
   simple than the amphihedron, which contains precisely as many
   tetrahedrons and octohedrons, and which consequently neces •
   sarily leads to the same results, relative to the combinations of
   bodies in determinate proportions ; I shall not reckon it among
   the representative forms.
       It is evident that the octo-tetrahedron, which has eight sum
    mits situated with respect to each other like the eight summits
   of a cube, cannot be combined with this form ; but it may, like
    the hexa-tetrahedron,      be combined with a hexahedral prism,
    because it partakes with the hexa-tetrahedron of the propertv
    of having hexagonal faces. In order to form a clear idea of
    this combination, we may conceive a line which joins the mid
    dles of the two opposite hexagonal faces of an octo-tetrahedron,
    and place it in a vertical situation ; we then find that those two
    faces are each surrounded by six other faces, viz. two square
    and four hexagon ; and that we may place a hexagonal prism in
 . such a way as that, the six summits of each of its bases answer-
 .
    ing to those six faces, its axis will be confounded with the line
    situated vertically.
       The two polyhedrons thus joined give a representative form,
    which differs only from the octo-tetrahedron inasmuch as the
    twelve faces of the latter, which surround the two bases, are
     covered by as many pyramids, four quadrangular and eight hexa
                                                                  gonal.

  ] 90                On Numerical Proportions
 agonal.     As we cannot establish between the respective dimen
 sions of the two polyhedrons, with the view of diminishing the
 number of faces, any relation which is symmetrical with respect
 to all the similar ridges, I shall suppose that they are such that
 the same sphere can be circumscribed for them ; and the poly
 hedron with forty-four summits which results from this supposi
 tion, having seventy faces, viz. four hexagon, two square, and
 sixty-four triangles, 1 shall give it the name of eptaconta-hedron.
     Finally, in order to combine the octo-tetrahedron with the
 tri-octohedron, it is sufficient to observe that each of these poly
 hedrons has as many summits as the other has faces, and reci
 procally ; we shall soon find that the positions of these summits
 and of these faces are precisely such, that by placing the six
 summits with four faces of the tri-octohedron on the perpendi
 culars raised in the midst of the six square faces of the octo-
 tetrahedron, all the summits of each polyhedron answer to the
 faces of the other.
     If we determine the respective dimensions of the polyhedrons,
 so as that the ridges of the tri-octohedron which join at the six
 summits just mentioned may pass by the middles of the ridges
of the square faces of the octo-tetrahedron, there will result from
the junction of those two representative forms a new polyhedron
which will have fifty summits and seventy-two faces; viz. twenty-
four quadrilateral and forty-eight isosceles triangles.     This poly
hedron may be considered as a tri-octohedron, of which the thirty-
 two faces shall have been covered by as many triangular pyra
mids : this is the reason why I designate it by the name of py-
ramidated tri-octohedron.
     I shall only point out three other representative forms, corny
posed of four, five, and seven octohedrons, and to which I have
given the names of tetra-octohedron,penta-octohedron,and         epta-
octohedron ; and for the sake of brevity, I shall not speak of the
combinations which may be made of those three representative
forms with the preceding polyhedrons.
     If we take notice that, one octohedron being given, there are
four different positions in which another octohedron of the same
size forms with the first a hexahedral prism, we shall easily
conceive that four octohedrons situated in those four positions
will have their centre of gravity at the same point, and will form
a combination into which they will all enter in the same way.
This combination is the tetra-octohedron, which has twenty-
four summits and fourteen faces, of which six are octagoa and
the eight others are equilateral triangles : by adding thereto the
same octohedron which has served to determine the respective
positions of the four octohedrons which we have combined, we
shall have the penta-octohedron, the summits of which are thirty

                              in Chemical Combinations.
     in number, and which has fifty-six triangular faces, of which
    eight are equilateral and the other forty-eight are isosceles.
        If, instead of uniting the tetra-octohedron with a single octo-
     hedron, we combine it with a tri-octohedron, by placing the six
    summits with four faces of the latter at the same point where
     we have placed the six summits of the fifth cctohedron in the
    formation of the penta-octohedron, we shall have the polyhedron
    composed of seven equal octohedrons, to which I have given the
    name of epta-octohedron, and which has forty-two summits and
    eighty triangular faces, of which eight are equilateral, twenty-
    four isosceles, and forty-eight scalene.

    tative forms.

 192     On Numerical Proportions in Chemical Comhinations.
     It is by these polyhedrons that I have represented the various
 arrangements of the molecules of all bodies.    When these bodies
'contain such substances only of which we may measure the vo
 lume in the state of gas, we have immediately the number of the
 molecules of each species which enter into their composition.
 When a simple body cannot be obtained in the state of gas, we
 must try in succession various suppositions relative to the num
 ber of molecules of this simple body, which are contained" in one
 of the compounds which it forms with a gaseous substance, oxy
 gen for instance.      The relations in w-eight make known the
 number of the molecules of the same body which enter into its
 other compounds ; and the condition which it must satisfy, that
 all the numbers of molecules which are obtained correspond to
 polyhedrons comprehended in the foregoing table, soon makes
 known that one of these different suppositions which can agree
 with the entire whole of the phenomena: it then becomes easy
  to calculate the respective weights of the molecules of all the
 simple bodies ; and these weights once determined, it is suffi
  cient to have a pretty close analysis of a compound body, and
  to know how much its particles contain of molecules of each of
 its elements, and thus correct the inevitable errors of analysis.
      Several chemists have endeavoured to attain the same result
 by determining the respective weights of certain proportions of
 the different simple bodies which always enter an entire number
  of times into the bodies which are composed of them.         These
  proportions do not lead to results conformable to the experiments,
  but when they are always multiples or submultiples of the re
 spective weights of the molecules : but when we make use of
  them, nothing can indicate how many of the proportions of a
 simple body ought to enter into one of those compounds ; whereas
  the consideration of the representative forms shows, in many
  cases, how much in a compound body there ought to enter of
  molecules of each of its elements, and even leads us to establish
  between the combinations of two simple bodies with all the
  others, such a dependence, that, the combination of one of those
  bodies being known, we may foresee those of the other.       I have
  found for instance, by comparing the combination which oxygen
  and hydrogen forth with different bodies, that, with the exception
  of chlore and sulphur, the combinations of which with hydrogen
  present the properties of the acids, one same quantity of a body
  susceptible of being united to hydrogen is combined in such a
  manner, that there are in general, in each of the particles of the
  compound, four molecules of hydrogen more than there are mo
  lecules of oxygen in the corresponding combination of the same
  body with this last gas. We may even remark, that when this body
  forms with oxvgen several combinations, some of which are more
                                                              difficult

difficult and the others more easy to decompose, the compounds
 of hydrogen corresponding with the first in the manner which I
have explained, are the only ones which can be obtained", at least
in the isolated state; and that those which correspond in the same
manner with the less stable combinations of oxygen are either
impossible, or cannot exist but when united to a third body.
According to this addition of four molecules or of an entire par
ticle of hydrogen to the number of the molecules of oxygen as
sumed by the different bodies in their most stable combinations
with this last gas, we find six molecules of hydrogen when there
are two of oxygen in these combinations,      and eight when there
 are four.
    The same considerations also lead us to foresee, according to the
representative forms of their particles, what are the gases which
water cannot absorb, but in very small quantity,       by the simple'
interposition of some of their particles between those of water,
 and those which the same liquid is susceptible of absorbing in
large quantities, and forming with them true combinations.

                           To    Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, Tn a paper On external Perception, recently published in the
Pamphleteer, by Mr. Fearne, he has maintained an opinion that
our perception   of external objects is not by means of the five
senses  alone, but that it is an act of the mind.   As this doctrine,
at least as expressed in the manner he has delivered     it,   some
                                                               is
what novel ;   and as it coincides with an opinion which has re
sulted from the last discoveries into the physiology and structure
of the organs of the brain,  I   am induced to point out to the me
taphysical speculator the great similarity of opinions drawn from
different sources, on a subject which has so frequently engaged
the attention of philosophers.        I  do not proceed with Mr.
Fearne in all his reasonings throughout the course of his various
metaphysical inquiries, but allude specially to the opinion that
the sensation of objects   by  means of the five external senses     is
not sufficient to produce the belief of the external existence
of bodies.      But I   believe the perception     of the external
bodies to be the consequence of an organic           apparatus quite
as material as the nerves of the five senses.     In short, the organ
of individuality, or that part of the front lobes of the brain
above the nose, in the middle and inferior part of the forehead,     is

the cause of our belief of external bodies. This organ also excites
 the activity of the five senses, and thereby is active, by means of
them, in producing the sensation of bodies, which it furthermore
causes us to regard as external, individual, and existent, inde
pendent of our sensations of them.       I have long conceived, as I
formerly mentioned, that there must exist some special faculty in
the mind for this perception of individuality; but it was Dr.
 Spurzheim who pointed out the seat of its organ.           I recom
mend the study, therefore, of the structure and organic arrange
ment of the brain published by him and Gall, to all those who
wish to see the material engines of the various functions of the
mind.      They will be really surprised, if they follow up this
course of anatomical and physiological studies attentively, at the
great progress which has in so short a time been made in a
science which has for ages been regarded as the most difficult
 and at the same time the most interesting in the world.           The
phrenology of Gall and Spurzheim has verified what Richerand
hinted at as the ne plus ultra of physiology, when he anticipated
a mode to solve the problem of the principles of the actions of
animated beings ; and, given the physical structure of any per
son, to find his moral and intellectual qualities.
    The proofs that the aforesaid. faculty of individuality resides in
the particular organ ascribed to          it,
                                         are founded on a series of
facts too numerous to be detailed here.        have fortunately had
                                                     I
many cases both of the great as well as of the defective develop
ment of that organ, to confirm and put beyond all doubt in my
mind the truth of the physiology he has imputed to it.          And     I
mention this apparent coincidence of opinion, to excite others to
examine; as these very abstruse considerations, such as are con
tained in Mr. Fearne's work, are very liable to be misunder
stood, and  it becomes desirable to call forth and collect the dif
ferent views of the philosophy of mind which they excite in peo
ple of different organizations.
                                 Yours, &c.

 XXXVI.      On the Pyramids       of   Egypt.       Extracted from Dr.
        Edward Daniel Clarke's Travels, Vol. IIL*
                         PYRAMIDS     OF   DJIZA.
As    we drew near the base of the principal pyramid, the effect
of its prodigious magnitude, and the amusement caused in view-
   * Dr. Clarke's account of the pyramids    by far the most philosophical
                                                is

highly gratified to find

                                                                       ing

ing   the enormous masses used  in its construction, affected every
 one of us ; but it was an impression of awe and fear rather than
 of pleasure. We had heard the pyramids described as huge ob
jects which gave no satisfaction to the spectator, on account of
their barbarous shape, and formal appearance ; yet to us it ap
peared hardly possible, that persons susceptible of any feeling of
sublimity could behold them unmoved.        With what amazement
 did we survey the vast surface that was presented to us when we
arrived at this stupendous monument, which seemed to reach
the clouds !    Here and there appeared some Arab guides upon
the immense masses about us, like so many pygmies, waiting to
show the way up to the summit
  The mode of ascent has been     frequently described ; and yet,
from the questions that are often proposed to travellers, it does
not appear to be generally understood-.  The reader may imagine
himself to be upon a staircase, every step of which, to a man of
middle stature, is nearly breast high ; and the breadth of each
step is equal to its height : consequently the footing is secure.
Where the stones are decayed, caution may be required ; but
upon the whole the means of ascent are such that almost every
one may accomplish   it
   At length we reached the topmost tier, to the great delight and
 satisfaction of all the party.     Here we found a platform thirty-
two feet square; consisting of nine large stones, — though much in
ferior in size to some used in the construction of this pyramid.   ....
     The view from this eminence amply fulfilled our expectations ;
 nor do the accounts which have been given of        it,as it appears at
this season of the year [August 23d] exaggerate the novelty and
                                         ,
grandeur of the sight.        All the region towards Cairo and the
 Delta resembled  a   sea, covered with innumerable islands.         Fo
rests of palm-trees were seen standing        in the water ;   the inun
 dation spreading over the land where they stood, so as to give
 them an appearance of growing in the flood.         To the north, no
thing could be discerned, but a watery surface thus diversified      by
plantations and    by  villages.    To the south we saw the pyramid?
of Saccara and, upon the
           ;                     east of these, smaller monuments of
the same kind,- nearer to the Nile.            An appearance of ruins
might indeed be traced the whole way from the pyramids of
Djiza to those qf Saccara    ;    as
                                  if    they had been once connected,
so as to constitute one vast cemetery.         Beyond the pyramids of
Saccara, we could perceive the distant mountains of the Said          ;
and upon an eminence near the Libyan side of the Nile appeared
a monasterv of considerable size.         Towards the west and SW
the eye ranged over the great Libyan Desert, extending to the
utmost verge of the horizon, without         asingle object to interrupt

the dreary horror of the landscape, except dark floating spots,
 caused by the shadows of passing clouds upon the sand.
    Upon the SE side is the gigantic statue of the Sphjnx, the
most colossal piece of sculpture which remains of all the work*
executed by the ancients.          The French have uncovered all the
pedestal   of this statue           it proves to be a wretched substruc
ture of brick-work and small pieces of stone, put together like
 the most insignificant piece of modern masonry* . . . .Beyond
the sphynx we distinctly discerned, amidst the sandy waste, the
remains and vestiges of a magnificent building (unnoticed by
former authors who have written upon the pyramids) — perhaps
the Skrapkum
    Immediately beneath our view, upon the eastern and western
side, we saw so many tombs that we were unable to count them,
 some half buried in the sand, others rising considerably above
it. All these are of an oblong form, with tides sloping like the
 roofs of European houses. A plan of their situation and ap
pearance is given in Pococke's Travels.             The second pyramid,
standing to the SVV, has the remains of a covering near its ver
tex, as of a plating of stone which had once invested all its four
sides.    Some persons, deceived by the external hue of this
covering, have believed it to be of marble ; but its white ap
pearance is owing to a partial decomposition, affecting the sur
face only.      Not a single fragment of marble can be found near
this pyramid.      It is surrounded by a paved court, having walls
on the outside, and places as for doors or portals in the walls ;
also an advanced work or portico.            A third pyramid, of much
smaller dimensions than the second, appears beyond the sphynx
to the SW ; and there are three others, one of which is nearly
buried in saud, between the large pyramid and this statue, to
the SE.
    Having thus surveyed the principal objects, as thev appeared
from the summit of the great pyramid, we proceed to the ex
amination of the substances which compose its exterior surface.
   * The author afterwards notices, that as they drew " near to view this
prodigious colossus, a reddish hue was discernible over the whole mass,
quite inconsistent with the common colour of the limestone used in build
ing the pyramids, and uf which the sphynx is formed."         This induced
further examination; and " having succeeded in climbing beneath the right
ear, where the surface had never been broken, nor in any degree decom
posed by the action of the atmosphere," Dr. Clarke found that the whole
had once been painted of a dingy red or blood colour; and on this painted
surface he found an inscription, but so concealed, under the enormous ear
of the sphynx that no notice has been taken of it by any preceding tra
veller.  Hie two first, lines are Coptic; the rest is Arabic; and the cha
racters, which are of considerable size, are black panned on the red sur
face.
                                                                      The

     The stones of the platform upon the top, as well as most of
  the others used in constructing the decreasing ranges from the
  base upwards, are of soft limestone ; a little harder, and more
•compact, than what some of the English masons vulgarly call
 clunck ; whereof King's College Chapel at Cambridge, and great
 part of Ely Cathedral, are built. It is of a grayish-white colour,
 and has this remarkable property, that, when broken by a smart
 blow with a hammer, it exhales the fetid odour common to the
 dark limestone of the Dead sea, and of many other places.
     .... l. .It is now very generally admitted, that the stones are of
 the same nature as the calcareous rock whereon they stand, and
 that this was cut away in order to form them                As we de
 scended from the summit, we found mortar in all the seams of the
 different layers upon the outside of the pyramid ; but no such
 appearance could be discerned in the more perfect masonrv of
 the interior. The mortar is of a coarse kind, and contains mi
 nute fragments of terra cotta
    The French had been very assiduous in their, researches among
these buildings.      They even attempted to open the smallest of
 the three pyramids ; and, having effected a very considerable
chasm in one of its sides, have left this mark behind them, as an
everlasting testimony of their curiosity and zeal.         The landing
of our army put a stop to their labour ; but for this, the interior
of that mysterious monument would probably be now submitted
to the inquiry which has long been an object among literary
 men.
     w       Having collected our party upon a sort of platform be
fore the entrance of the passage leading to the interior, and
lighted a number of tapers, we all descended into its dark mouth.
The impression made upon every one of us, in viewing the en
 trance, was this ; that no set of men whatever could have thus
opened a passage, by uncovering precisely the part of the py
ramid where the entrance was concealed, unless they had been
previously-acquainted      with its situation ; and for these reasons:
first, because its position is almost in the centre of one of its
planes, instead of being at the have.        Secondly, that not a trace
appears of those dilapidations which must have been the result
of any random search for a passage to the interior ; such as now
distinguish the labours of the French upon the smaller pyramid,
which they attempted to open. The persons who undertook the
work, actually opened the pyramid in the only point, over all its
vast surface, where, from the appearance of the stones inclined
to each other above the mouth of the passage, any admission to
the interior seems to have been originally intended             Strabo
describes not only the exact position of the mouth of the pyra
mid, but even the nature of the passage leading to the Wijw), or

  Soros, in such a manner, that it is impossible to obtain, in fewer
  words, a more accurate description*.               It seems also true, that
  this opening had been made before the time of Herodotus, al
  though his testimony be less decisive.             He speaks only of sub
  terraneous chambers         f ; but it were impossible        to know any
  thing of their existence, unless the pyramid had first been en
  tered.
      Hence it is evident that a passage to the interior had been
  open from the earliest times in which any account was given of
  this pyramid ; and perhaps it never was so completely closed,
  but that with a little difficulty an access might be effected.           Pnv
  ceeding down this passage [minutely described by Greaves] . and
  ascending a second sloping channel to the distance of 110 feet,
  we came to a horizontal passage, leading to a chamber with an
  angular roof.      In this passage we found on our right hand the
  mysterious well, which has been so often, mentioned. [Pliny makes
  the depth 129 feet— Greaves and others 20 feet ; but the latter
  were deceived by the plummet resting on some projection.]                  On,
  getting   a large  stone,   almost   as  wide   as  the mouth   of  the well,
  we were agreeably surprised by hearing, after some seconds, a
  loud and distinct report, seeming to come from a spacious sub
  terraneous apartment, accompanied by a splashing noise, as if
  the stone had been broken into a number of pieces, and had fallen
  into a reservoir of water at an amazing depth
      We examined the chamber at the end of this passage, men
  tioned by all who have described the interior of this building.             Its
  roof is angular ; that is to say, it is formed by the inclination
  of large masses of stone leaning towards each other.                 Quitting
  the passage altogether, we climbed the slippery and difficult ascent
  which leads to the principal chamber.              The workmanship, from
  its perfection,   and  its  immense     proportions, is truly astonishing.
  All about the spectator, as he proceeds, is full of majesty, and
  mystery, and wonder               Presently we entered that        " glorious
  room," as it is justly called by Greaves, where, " as within some
  consecrated oratory, Art may seem to have contended with Nar
  ture." - It stands " in the very heart and centre of the pyramid,
  equidistant from all its sides, and almost in the midst between
  the basis and the top."          The floor, the sides and roof are com
  posed of that most beautiful variety of granite which Linnaus
   distinguished by the epithet of durus rubescens, called by the
   Italians granito rosso, composed essentially of feldspar, quartz,
  and mica. . . . .It differs in no respect from European granite,
   except that the red feldspar enters more largely as a constituent
   into the mass than is usual in the granite of Europe. So ex-

quisitely are the masses of this granite fitted to each other upon
the sides of this chamber, that, having no cement between them,
it is impossible to force the blade of a knife between the joints.
We tried the experiment.          There are only six ranges of stone
from the floor to the roof, which is twenty feet high ; and the
length of the chamber is about twelve yards.             It is about six
yards wide.     The roof or ceiling consists only of nine pieces, of
stupendous size and length, traversing the room from side to
side, and lying like enormous beams across the top.           .
    Near the western side stands the Soros, of the same kind of
granite as that which is used for the walls of the chamber, and
as exquisitely polished.      It is distinguished by no difference of
form or dimensions from the common appearance of the Soros,
as it is often seen in Turkish towns when employed by the inha
bitants to supply the place of a cistern.       It resembles, as Greaves
has remarked, " two cubes finely set together, and hollowed
within ; being cut smooth and plain," without sculpture or en
graving of any kind.        Its length on the outside is seven feet
                                       J
3{ inches ; its depth three feet 3 inches ; and it is the same in
breadth.     Its position is north and south.
    This beautiful relique was entire when our troops were landed
in Egypt . . . .but our soldiers, and sailors, with the view of car
rying pieces as curiosities to England, began, alas ! the havoc
of its demolition ; and but for the classical taste and laudable
interference of Colonel now General Stewart, not a particle of
the Soros would have remained.           The persons who thus left be
hind them a sad memorial of the British name, had only suc
ceeded in accomplishing a fracture near one of the angles. Every
traveller of taste will join in reprobating any future attempt to
increase the injury it has so lamentably sustained.
                        PYRAMIDS OF SACCARA.
    Just beyond Menshee Dashoo we were much struck by the
appearance of a tumulus (standing to the south of a large gra
duated pyramid), which, instead of being pyramidal, exhibits a
less artificial and therefore a more ancient form of sepulchre
than any of the pyramids.         It is a simple hemispherical mound.
We saw afterwards others of the same kind
    These pyramids appear to be a continuation of the great ce
metery to which those of Djiza also belonged.              They extend
four or five miles, both to the north and to the south of the vil
lage of Saccara.      Some of them are rounded at the top, and, as
it was observed by Pococke, " do not look like pyramids, but
more like hillocks cased with stone."         One of these is graduated
 like the principal pyramid at Pjiza ; but with this difference,
that the gradations here are much larger, although the pyramid
                                     N4                               be

 be smaller.       It consists only of six tiers or ranges of stone ; the
  pyramid itself being 150 feet in height.          The ranges of steps are
 twenty-five     feet  high  and   eleven   feet wide.   The rest of these
 structures are so fully and accurately described by Pococke, that
 little will be added here to his description of them.              There is
 one built also with steps, which he believed to be as large as the
 principal pyramid at Djiza.             The works at Saecara, indepen
 dently of the different forms which characterize them, do all ap
 pear to be older than those of Djiza ; the buildings being mora
 decayed, and the stones crumbling, as if decomposed by longer
 exposure to the action of the atmosphere.                Four miles to the
 south of Saccara stands a -pyramid built of unhurried bricks.
 This is in a very mouldering state. The bricks contain shells,
 gravel, and chopped straw : they are of the same nature as the
 unhurried bricks in modern use in Egvpt.               Pococke concluded,
 from its present appearance, that it was built with five grada
 tions only.      It is of the same height as the other graduated py
 ramid of six degrees*.

explain    the  Phenomena       of Electricity," by Mr. De Luc. Any
thing from the pen of that venerable and distinguished philoso
pher is deserving of the highest consideration: you will therefore
allow a putee to a few observations in reply.
    it may in the first place be necessary to apprise Mr. De Luc
of a misconception into which he has been led, no doubt, by
some defect in the statement of my objections to the Frankiinian
hypothesis.
    The hypothesis of electric excitation, in which it is supposed
that, during the attrition of glass, the pores by opening receive
electricity, and expel it when they close, is attributed by Mr.
De Luc to me. To this, however, I have no title ; it is a state-

 to open the pores for receiving more electric matter, which is
 discharged when the friction ceases, as Mr. Donovan conceives
it," therefore, does not prove against me, but against Franklin.
     Mr. De Luc declares that " an error of Franklin has created
all the just objections of Mr. Donovan."                They are then ad
 mitted to be well founded, and my object is accomplished.                 It
 was Franklin, and not Volta, whose opinions I combated ; and
 therefore Mr. De Luc's observations all relate to the possibility
of applying to Volta what was intended for Franklin ; so that, be
 tween the opinions of Mr. De Luc and those which I have ven
 tured to being forward, there is as yet no disagreement.
     That I had no opportunity of an acquaintance with the Ideas
sur la Meteor ologie and the Trait e elementaire of Mr. De Lue
is true ; and I regret that works such as I suppose them to be
never came within my reach.               Living in a city where literary
advantages     of this kind  are far  less  numerous than in other places,
I have had often to feel and lament the consequent limitation of
my knowledge on subjects with which I was most anxious to be
acquainted.
     Of the hypothesis of Volta concerning the standard of electri
cal comparison I was not altogether ignorant; indeed the only
knowledge I possessed on the subject was derived from some
papers of Mr. De Luc's in Nicholson's Journal.                 I formerly
searched into various books with the design of gaining a better
acquaintance with Volta's view of this standard, but I was un
able to obtain it.       I found, it is true, a paper by Volta in some
of the old Philosophical Transactions, written in Italian : it re-,
lated to the action of electric atmospheres upon his condenser,
hut they did not afford what I desired.
    To enter into a discussion with so experienced a philosopher
as Mr. De Luc, were to presume myself what I am conscious of
not being.       I therefore decline that task, and content myself
with barely submitting to him a few suggestions concerning his
defence of Volta, and his observations on my objections.
    Mr- De Luc by a striking experiment has illustrated the Voltaic
hypothesis.       By the continued dispersion of electricity in a room,
the air was rendered positive.           A pair of insulated pith balls in
the natural state were brought in from an adjoining room : they
now diverged negatively ; but when returned to the room from
whence they came, the natural state was resumed.              Mr. De Luc
explains this by supposing that, although the balls           were  at first
in the natural state when compared with the electric state of that
                                                                     room,

                          Reply   to   Mr. De Luc.
room, yet, when brought into an air containing a greater absolute
quantity of electricity, they became relatively negative.           Now,
if this admit of a different explanation, the necessity of the above
inference is destroyed : it is therefore of importance to try if this
can be effected.
    With regard to my experiment in which bodies possessed of
similar states attract each other ; Mr. De Luc considers that
the excited electric repelled the similar electricity of the pith
ball through the thread into some other part : the effect is owing
to what Volta calls electric influence, and it appears to consti
tute an essential part of his system.          But with this I have been
long familiar ; not as belonging to Volta, but to Franklin. Now
it appears to me, that this principle of electric influences may be
applied in explanation of Mr. De Luc's experiment on electrified
air. The balls in the natural state are brought into a positive
atmosphere ; the electricity of the latter repels the natural quan
tity of the balls into their internal substance : the external parts
 are therefore left minus.       With, this view, the sequel exactly cor
responds ;    for,  when   the  balls were brought back into the un-
electrified room, they collapsed into their natural state.           But,
 on the opposite view, the balls by immersion into a positive at
mosphere should assume that state, and retain it when removed,
 and therefore still continue to diverge.         Hence it would appear
to me that the experiment is an anomaly on the hypothesis of
Volta, and perfectly reconcileable to the principles of Franklin.
    But my experiment above referred to, in which bodies of a
 similar state attracted each other, does not in my mind appear
to be explained by the principle of electric influences.          Mr. De
 Luc supposes that the excited tube repels the electricity of the
ball through its thread, leaving it ultimately negative, and there
 fore attracting it.      But at the moment when this attraction is
 about to take place, if the tube be dexterously removed, it will
be found that the ball is still positive.
    Furthermore, it is for Mr. De Luc's consideration, whether the
principle of electric influences be even applicable to this experi
 ment.     Volta's principle, if I understand    it,relates to two bodies,
 one of which   is   in the natural state, and the other in a super
 natural state.      In my experiment they are both in a supernatural
 state.
    With regard to the explanation of the motion of electrified
 bodies given   by   Volta, and cited       byMr. De Luc, p. 99, need
                                                                 I
 only  observe    that
                     it    virtually destroys the principle of repulsion,
 and   refers  all  to  attraction.    How then can    it be at the same
 time supposed that electricity         an elastic fluid
                                       is               ?
    The experiment which consider subversive of Franklin's sup
                             I
posed impermeability      of glass, appears to Mr. De Luc explicable
                                                                       by

by the hypothesis of Volta.       This philosopher analyses the elec
tric fluid into two elements : the one, called electric matter, can
not pass through the glass ; the other, called deferent fluid, passes
with ease.     Mr. De Luc subjoins : " so far this system might
appear only an hypothesis to Mr. Donovan, as he does not know
                                                                        •
the work to which I refer."        I must confess that to me the whole
has a very hypothetical appearance, but I am willing to admit
my ignorance of the above-mentioned work as the cause.           There
is not, however, any hypothesis in the simple experiment which
was detailed in my former paper.        A,thin flask with a neck many
inches long was half filled with mercury, and coated on the
outside to the same height with foil.        By means of a moveable
wire, an electric charge was thrown in ; the wire was drawn out,
and the neck was hermetically sealed.           After a length of time
the sealing of the neck was cut off; the wire was plunged into
the mercury; but not the slightest commotion was perceived by
the hand, although the original charge was capable of giving a
violent shock.      Thus I had encompassed a quantity of electricity
on all sides by glass ; aftsr a certain time I found that the glass
contained none : —What should I conclude, but that it escaped ?
Were Mr, De Luc to repeat this experiment, he would certainly
consider my inference natural.
    Many more observations might be made, but these are all that
 I consider necessary to offer for Mr. De Luc's consideration.
The object of my former paper was not to defend any hypothesis,
but, on the contrary, to show that we are deceived when we sup
 pose ourselves possessed of any knowledge of the electric fluid
 beyond the perception of its sensible effects.       The only mode of
 inviting truth is to remove the barriers which oppose its progress.
 I am persuaded that there would be no one more willing than
 Mr. De Luc to lend his assistance to the acquirement of so de
 sirable an object.

    to the Ordnance, and Lecturer on Chemistry at the Royal
    Military Academy at Woolwich*.
 It is well known that when wood and other vegetable substances
 are submitted to destructive distillation, there is produced, among
 other matters, a black dense fluid resembling molasses or com-
               * From the
                           Geological Transactions, vol. ii.'
                                                                   mon

 204                      On certain     Products obtained
 mon        tar.     My connection        with the Ordnance        powder-mills
 hav ing compelled me to examine some of the properties of this
 substance, which is obtained in large quantities in the proces of
 making charcoal, I was induced to extend jny inquiries, in con
 sequence        of finding that the nature of the compound has not
 hitherto been understood.
    As it is commonly called tar by the workmen, I shall use this
 term for want of a better.
    This tar is very inflammable, and so liquid that it may be burnt
 in  a lamp.
    Although it appears to be an uniform fluid, it contains a great
 quantity of acetic acid, in a state of loose combination or mix-
 ture.       For, by washing with water, a great part of this is se
 parated ; the water at the same time acquiring a colour from a
 portion of the tar which is retained in solution by the acid.
 Boiling water takes up a larger portion, and the tar acquires
 from this operation a thicker and more pitchy consistence.
    Lime and -the carbonated alkalies separate the acid with ease,
 carrying away also, a portion of the tar which continues united
 to the solution.         With subcarbonate of potash it thus forms in
 the first instance       an  uniform solution of a brown colour ; but a
 continuance of trituration or boiling renders it pitchy .and tena
 cious, after which it forms no further union with the mild al
kalies.
    It  is perfectly and readily soluble           in alcohol, in ether, in the
pure alkaline lixivia, in acetic acid, and in            the mineral acids. The
fat oils and the new essential oils dissolve only a small portion
of it ; but the drying oils and the latter when thickened by age
act more readily.           Coloured oil of turpentine dissolves a good
deal of it. Naphtha hardly exerts any action, acquiring a scarcely
sensible brown colour.              If heat be applied ^o assist the solution,
the portion         taken  up  is  again deposited on cooling.
    When it is subjected, to distillation in a heat sufficient to keep
it in a gentle ebullition, an oily-looking matter passes over in
considerable proportion, which sinks to the bottom of the water
into which the tube is inserted.               It is first of a pale colour, re
sembling        oil  of peppermint,     but  becomes     gradually darker as tb>e
operation advances,           till it  acquires  a  deep brown hue.
    If the operation be pushed by increasing the heat of the re
tort to redness, there remains at length only a mass of spungy
charcoal, and the substance is totally converted into the follow
ing new compounds, namely, the residuary charcoal, the oily
matter, and the matter held in solution in the water of the appa
ratus         This latter proves to consist of a large portion of acetic
acid, with which is combined a very little ammonia.
    There is no inflammable gas given out in this, process unless
                        "
 - ~;     .                                                                  the

                    in the Distillation   of Wood, &c.               205
the heat he carelessly managed.         If the vapour of the oilv matter
as it arises be exposed to the sides of the retort elevated to a
high temperature, it is decomposed ; and instead of oil there are
thus obtained by a violent distillation in a naked fire, scarcelv any
products but acetic acid and an inflammable gas.            This fact is
analogous     to  those occurring in  the   ordinary process for decom
posing such inflammable bodies as can be made to put on the
gaseous state — and we ought, in fact, to consider every process
of this kind, where a rapid distillation with a hot fire is used, as
a succession of decompositions ; the matter first produced being
afterwards exposed to another process of destruction.           It is not
therefore perhaps very correct language, to say that vegetables
yield a great quantity of inflammable gas on distillation with a
naked fire : this is the produce of a second distillation, which by
the common mode of operating is confounded with the first. As
this reasoning applies equally to all other similar processes, it
would be desirable to use a more accurate mode of describing
this common operation, by which we might in some important
instances be led to a more correct practice.         Thus, for example,
in the common mode of distilling coal to produce the inflam
mable gases, this double operation is carried on at once by the
 application of the petroleum and naphtha at first produced to
 the heated iron of the retort.       It is in consequence of this im
perfect mode of exposing the fluids thus generated to a second
heat, that so large a portion of the petroleum is distilled un
 changed,      liy causing it to pass a second time in contact with
 heated iron, while in the state of vapour, it may be resolved
 completely into inflammable gas and charcoal, and the produce
 of gas be thus considerably increased.          This circumstance ex
 plains also the contradictory accounts given by different persons
 of the relative products of distillation, as applied to the various
 compound inflammables.          To instance the case of camphor,
 which, according to the mode of managing the process, may be
 caused to yield essential oil, or inflammable gas, or a mixture pf
 both 'in various proportions : I need scarcely point out the ad
 vantages so obviously to be derived from this consideration in
 the ^economical process of procuring light from pit-coal, an
 operation at present conducted with less skill than it demands. •
    I distilled a portion of this tar in such a way as to obtain in
 flammable air only, and took the gas in five portions. The first
 burnt very faintly, the second rather better, the third and fourth
 portions with a good white flame, and the fifth burnt feeble and
 blue.    No portion of it was equal in brilliancy of inflammation
 to the gas from pit-coal.       On examination, it was found to con
 tain much carbonic oxide, by which its nature, as fr.r as it differs
 from the gas of coal, is readily understood.          The cause of this
                                                               difference

  206                   On certain Products obtained
  difference will be apparent when the other circumstances in the
  constitution of this substance have been detailed.                  I thought it
  superfluous     to examine      accurately   the nature    of these    gases ; but
  they probably       consist    of  different   mixtures    of  carbonic     oxide,
 with light      and   heavy hydrocarbonate         and    defiant   gases, if in
  deed (as I much doubt) there be any real boundary by which
  the composition of these three last gases can be defined.
      If the process of distillation which I have now described be
 stopped when the oily matter begins to acquire a brown co
 lour, and when the production of acetic acid is less perceptible,
 the matter in the retort will be found, when cold, to have assumed
 a solid consistence.           In this state it resembles either pitch or
  asphaltum, according to the degree of heat it has undergone after
      I will describe this substance as it appears when it first be
  comes solid, the reason of which will soon be apparent.
     Previously to its arriving at this state, it bears a considerable
 resemblance to maltha, being of a consistence intermediate be
 tween that of petroleum and asphaltum: but I did not completely
 examine its chemical properties in this condition, because they
 appeared not to differ from what might be expected, and its
 history will be sufficiently full without it. In the solid state it
 is brilliant and shining, and breaks with a conchoidal fracture
 and some external resemblance to obsidian.                   It has a pungent
 burning taste, and the well known smell of wood smoke. . It is
 heavier than the specimen of asphaltum with which I compared
 it, having a specific gravity of 1*254, while that of the asphaltum
 was 1-202.        It is fusible and readily inflammable, burning with
 a white flame.        It is electric, and exhibits the same electricity as
the resinous bodies.          When heated in an open vessel, it smokes;
and if kept in fusion till it ceases to smoke, it at length ceases to
be fusible, and is ultimately converted into a coal.                  During this
progress     it becomes     more     brilliant  and   less  fusible,   its fracture
also    from   conchoidal    becomes      more  splintery, and it puts on the
appearance of asphaltum so accurately that the eye cannot de
tect the difference.         Its specific gravity also diminishes, and its
chemical properties vary in the way I am now about to detail.
     1 have described the perfect solubility of the tar in alcohol.
The softest specimens of the pitch are nearly as soluble, leaving
only a small residuum, which is infusible and powdery.                          The
harder specimens become in proportion less soluble, and leave a
larger residuum ; and those which have been the longest ex
posed to heat scarcely give a stain to the alcohol, resembling in
this respect the driest specimens of asphaltum.                  The analogy is
here very apparent ; for asphaltum may approach more or less to
petroleum, and the various specimens of it are found to exhibit
                                                                            various

various degrees of solubility in alcohol.                That which is least
fusible in the fire,        in both cases, the least soluble in alcohol.
                                 is,
And     by this consideration, the jarring accounts which have been
given of the solubility of asphaltum in alcohol may be reconciled                          ;
and  it  will be seen in the sequel, that the history of this substance
illustrates, in every respect, the true nature of the several varieties
of the bitumens, substances whose mutual relations, and the
causes of whose chemical diversity, have hitherto not been under
stood.
   If   a perfectly soluble specimen be dissolved in alcohol,                         it   is
obtained unchanged                     by
                                evaporating the spirit.             In any other
case, the matter which the alcohol has             taken     up      precisely
                                                                            is         si
milar to the pitch in its first state, and the residuum resembles
that which        the result of fusion when
                  is                                  refuses longer to melt.

Alcohol therefore separates the pure pitch from that which                          a  by
process     of decomposition      has   been    nearly     carbonized.       Ether
acts upon this substance as readily and                   the same manner as
                                                                  in

siderably    more  soluble   in drying   oil.    In   all   these   cases  its  so
lubility varies,    from   the   same   causes     as  those     which   affect   its
solubility in alcohol.       Naphtha, whether pale            or  brown, has no

 208                 On certain Products obtained
mint was produced, as happens in a similar case with camphor,
and the pitch was thrown down.          The action of the red nitrous
acid on it is violent ; the acid is decomposed with great ebullition,
and a portion of the pitch is converted into coal.         In diluted
Eitric acid it dissolves, and produces an uniform brown fluid. On
continuing to apply nitrous acid according to the process of Mr.
Hatchett, solutions similar to those which he has described as
 having been obtained from the resins and bitumens, are pro
 duced.
     I exposed a quantity of the' pitch to a careful distillation
 through water. As might be expected from what I described
 before in the distillation of the tar, this process gave results
 nearly similar to the former.       The oily matter differed in being
 of a brown colour and in having a greater specific gravity, and
 much less acid was produced ; the residuum was charcoal.           The
 whole process of distillation appears, therefore, to be a decom
 position by which the pitchy substance is converted into oil,
 acetic acid, ammonia, and charcoal.
     I proceeded next to examine the oil. It has a violently pungent
 taste and smell.     It is scarcely heavier than water; so that it
 sinks in that fluid with difficulty, leaving generally some drops
 on the surface.     It is perfectly soluble in alcohol, in ether, in
caustic alkali, in olive oil, and in linseed oil.     It will unite nei
 ther to naphtha, nor to the recent essential oils, but is soluble
in the old ones. From these properties, it belongs to the class
of the essential oils, but exhibits at the same time other qualities
by which it is distinguished from the whole of them.
    Having thus examined the most remarkable chemical proper
ties of this substance, it will not be irrelevant to point out its
diiferences from and its analogies with those substances which it
most resembles, namely resin and the bitumens.              Resin, as is
well known, is eminently soluble in all the substances in which
this is dissolved, and also in those with which this refuses to
unite, even naphtha.        But the general analogy between essential
oil, turpentine, and resin, is so close to that of the three sub
stances which I have described, that it will not perhaps be su
perfluous here to make some remarks on the nature of common
resin and the substances connected with       it, pitch, tar, turpen
tine, and essential oil, as their history will also illustrate that of
the substance I     am describing, and as  it   appears, like that of
the bitumens,    to have   been somewhat mistaken.
    If turpentine, as flows from the fir in liquid state, be ex
                     it                         a
posed for a    considerable time to the action of the atmosphere, it
becomes brittle, and   is   converted into resin, in consequence, as
it   issupposed, of the absorption of oxygen.     If the same turpen
tine be exposed to the action of the fire,          colourless volatile

     oil is separated, and resin remains in the retort. This however
»    is not a mere case of the separation of a more volatile from a
    fixed substance ; for a decomposition takes place, and acetic acid
    is generated.       Nor can turpentine be again reproduced by mix
     ing together the essential oil and the resin — it then forms a var
    nish. The essential oil is in fact a new compound, produced from
    the vegetable elements by the action of fire ; and, although pro
    perly enough classed with those essential oils which are vegetable
    secretions, differs from them in some of its chemical properties.
     Itis,  for example, difficultly soluble in alcohol        but on exposure
                                                                         ;

     in the same substance.
      If   the resin, which      isthe residuum of this distillation, be still
    further heated,   it    gives over     thick and high-coloured oil, gra

     the specific gravity of water.         The residuum becomes ultimately
    black, and very brittle, remaining soluble in ether and in lixi
    vium of potash, but refusing to dissolve in alcohol.
        Common tar differs from turpentine in containing portion of          a
    the vegetable tar now under review, mixed with common turpen
    tine and with the acetic acid which             formed in the distillation

        The analogy between this wood pitch and the bitumens                           is
    equally striking, and the preceding history of these compounds
    will throw light on the several varieties of the bituminous sub

    From the same chemical cause which produces this effect arises
    also the difference in the nature of the inflammable gases which
    are produced from these different substances.                        ,

       The sensible qualities of the bitumens (their taste and smeff)i
    are  in all states utterly and entirely different from those of the
    vegetable tar.    Petroleum is also much less soluhle in alcohol,
    and further  differs  from the vegetable far in being perfectly solu
    ble in naphtha.      In their solubilities in oil of turpentine they
    fesemble each other, as well as in their habitudes with acetic
    acid aud the alkaline lixivia, although the vegetable tar will be
    found the more readily soluble of the two.        I need not repeat
    the circumstances in which the essential oil of wood differs from
    naphtha.    It is a sufficiently characteristic one, that it forms no*
    union with this latter.
       It has been already shown that the difference between the
    pitch andasphaltum is considerable, when the former is in its first
    state, particularly with regard to its solubility in alcohol.
       But if we compare the most brittle specimens of the pitch
'
    with common specimens of asphal turn, the differences, except as
    far as smell and taste are concerned, are not so apparent, and<
    the reason of this will be obvious on considering their funda
    mental similarity of composition.      The chief ingredients of both
    are carbon and hydrogen. By the application of heat, the propor
    tions of these substances are altered in both cases, the hydrogen
    being abstracted in the greastest ratio, to form the new com
    pound (the oil) in which hydrogen predominates.         The ultimate
    result of both is charcoal.     Asphaltum will be found to combine
    pretty nearly in the same way, with all the substanees I have
    above enumerated as combining with the pitch.             Its essential
    difference however consists in its solubility in naphtha, and by
    this test they are readily distinguished.
       The chemical difference to which these different properties of
    substances so similar are owing, will be evident on considering
    tome of the circumstances before related.        The disproportion of
    acetic acid and carbonic oxide produced from the wood pitch, when
    compared with the produce of the bitumen, proves that it con
    tains oxygen and azote in proportions different from those in
    which the same substances exist in the bitumens ; and that in
    particular it contains a considerable quantity of the former. The
    result would not repay the toil required to investigate these pro
    portions, which are probably also subject to considerable varia<-
-   tion.
          It
         is obvious that this substance is a new compound, formed
    by the action of fire on vegetable elementary matter ; but all that
    we can determine of its nature       is,
                                        that, in conformity to modern
    chemical nomenclature,     it  formed of carbon, hydrogen, oxy
                                    is
    gen, and azote.     The carbon and hydrogen constitute its basis,
    as they do that of the bitumens, and the large proportion of
    oxygen appears to give   it the peculiar properties by which      itws

 very great change   is wanting to convert the one of these into the
 Other;
    The question so much agitated, of the conversion of vegetables
 into coal, would appear to receive some illustration from the his
 tory of the compound which I have been describing; and since
 (as I shall by and by show) it has actually been confounded with
 bitumen, and has been adduced as an instance of the artificial
 production of coal by the action of fire, I shall make no apology
 for pursuing this subject.     Indeed the general chemical resem
blance between the mineral bitumens and this vegetable bitu-
 metii if it may be so called, is so striking, that we may at first
sight be easily led to suppose that the same agent has produced
both i and excuse the mistakes which seem to have occurred on
this subject.    But a cursory view of the several substances which
 have been classed under the head of bitumens, may enable-us to
 form a clearer notion of the limited extent of this analogy, at the
same time that it will perhaps assist us in correcting some errors
which have crept into our arrangements of them.                     ,
    It is necessary to separate from the bitumens three or four
mineral substances, which differ completely both in chemical and
ordinary characters, but which are approximated to each otlker
by some general resemblance*        These are, amber, mellilite, and
the subterraneous resins of Cologne, Bovey, and Highgate. The
two first are more nearly associated by the property they have of
yielding a peculiar acid ; and of the three last, it may perhaps
be fairly doubted, whether they are more entitled to be ranked
among the mineral substances strictly so called, than the other
vegetable matters which are found in alluvial soils.
    The nature and relations of naphtha, petroleum, maltha, and
asphaltum, will, I trust, appear sufficiently clear from what 1 bas e
above related; but I cannot forbear remarking on some false hy
potheses which have been held respecting these substances, and
their relation to other bodies. It is evident, from considering
the products of their decomposition, that the basis of naphtha
and of all the intermediate stages of bitumen, down to asphaltum,
are carbon and hydrogen, modified by certain small proportion'-,
of oxygen and azote. It is in the relative proportions chiefly of
these two ingredients     that naphtha differs from petroleum, pe
troleum    from maltha,  and  maltha from asphaltum.      If we distil
either of these more solid substances    with a  very gentle heat, we
obtain naphtha, in which the proportion of the hydrogen to the
carbon is increased to a maximum ratio.        If the heat is greater,
we obtain a substance of a darker colour, in which that ratio h
less ; and, for this reason, the distillation of asphaltum affords
                                 O 2                          a darker

212      *           On certain Products obtained
 a darker    oil than that of petroleum, because its composition
 cannot be dissolved but in a higher temperature.
    For the same reason also petroleum is easily rectified into
 naphtha.     Asphaltum, in its ordinary state, contains the two in
gredients in a ratio in which the carbon bears a large proportion
to the hydrogen, and that ratio is reduced to the minimum, or
becomes evanescent, when by the continuance of distillation
charcpal alone remains behind. A large portion of the oxygen,
and also of the azote, is disengaged during this process, but not
the whole, since the darker compounds still give it over on re
peating the process.      The naphtha is probably entirely exempt
from oxygen.       With this view, we cannot accede to the notion
that the absorption of oxygen is capable of converting naphtha
or petroleum into asphaltum; or that the harder bitumens ori
 ginate from the oxygenation of the more liquid.      It is more con
sonant to the nature of these substances to suppose that the
change consists in the alteration of the relative proportions of
the hydrogen and carbon ; but whether this is performed by the
action of heat, or of other causes volatilizing the hydrogen, or
by the contact of oxygen converting it into water, cannot now
be determined by any facts that we are acquainted with.           Ex
periments on the induration of the essential oils may throw some
light on this question.     It will here perhaps be remarked, that
there is a difference in the substances as they are produced artifi
cially by the distillation of coal, and as they are found in nature.
Tims, for example, the artificial petroleum of coal differs from
that of nature, in being much more soluble in alcohol.        Yet this
circumstance may arise from the insensible gradation of dif
ference which I have above remarked in the similar compounds;
and thus, in the series of gradation, specimens absolutely corre
sponding, whether artificial or natural, may exhibit the same
chemical characters.
   Thus, as I have shown that there is a sort of gradation from
naphtha to asphaltum, through a series of undefinable petrolea,
so this analogy may be extended to the next general variety of
the bitumens, coal.
    The several varieties of coal are supposed to consist of char
coal and asphaltum, or of charcoal and bitumen, combined in as
many different proportions.        Charcoal is undoubtedly found
mixed with coal, but it does not appear correct to consider pit
coal as either a mixture or combination of any bitumen with
charcoal.     The action of naphtha on its varieties, often none and
always sparing, shows that bitumen does not exist in it in a mixed
state.    It will be more consonant to the analogies of the other
bituminous substances^ to consider coal in its several varieties as
                                                           a bitumen,

a bitumen, varying in its composition, from the fattest specimens
of Newcastle to the driest of Kilkenny, and owing its compact
ness, as well as the other modifications which it exhibits, to the
peculiar circumstances under which it has been formed, the
changes it may subsequently have undergone, or the substauces
with which it has accidentally been mixed. The power of yield
ing naphtha on distillation is rather to be resorted to as the di
stinction between the one end and the other of the series ; and it
would be surely equally correct to call coal a compound of char
coal and naphtha, as a compound of charcoal and asphaltum.
    Its several varieties will moreover be found to vary from each
other by containing greater or less proportions of carbon, com
pared with their other ingredients; just as in asphaltum the re
lative proportions of the hydrogen, azote, and oxygen, to the
carbon, are found to differ from those which constitute petro
leum or naphtha.
    The last link of the chain of coal (chemically considered) is
anthracite, which contains only carbon, if we reckon the earths
mixed with it as adventitious matter.        So the last result of the
distillation of asphaltum is charcoal, and the intermediate steps
through which asphaltum passes in its progress to charcoal, re
semble precisely the corresponding changes which occur in the
distillation of coal till coak is formed, and confirm by their che
mical analogy the view here held forth of the chemical compo
sition of coal, and the gradation to be traced in nature from fat
coal to anthracite.      If asphaltum be subjected to distillation it
gives petroleum.      By degrees its solubility in naphtha diminishes,
in consequence of its carbonaceous ingredient becoming more
disproportioned to its hydrogen.        At a particular period of this
distillation it will be found to resemble fat coal ; by and by, it      >
resembles blind coal, and gives no stain to naphtha ; ultimately,
pure charcoal remains.         All these bituminous compounds may
therefore properly be said to belong to one genus or family, of
which the principal chemical ingredients are carbon and hydro
gen ; and it is chiefly to the difference in the /elative proportions
of those two substances that we are to look for the differences
which characterize the several bitumens, from naphtha placed at
one extreme, to anthracite placed at the other.          The chasm in
this series, from asphaltum to fat coal, is in fact rather apparent
than real, being more properly a mechanical or accidental than
a chemical or essential one.        I cannot here avoid taking notice
of the very loose experiments of Mr. Kirwan on the analysis of
coal, (which consisted in projecting portions of coal on melted
 nitre,) as his deductions are at war with this view of the subject,
 although not more so than with all chemical reasoning.           They
 were founded on an assumption, that coal was carbon impreg-
                                    03                           rscted

                     On cerlain Products obtained
nated sometimes with maltha and sometimes with asphaltum— *
a distinction quite unnecessary if the supposition wre true.                If
we conceive coal to he compounded in this way, it would be more
obvious to consider it as formed of carbon and petroleum, since
by a regulated heat it can be separated into those two substances.
 The theory of the experiment is equally assumed, and the con

 pound (coal) the carbon alone possesses the power of decom
posing the nitre, and tha-. the proportions of these supposed in
gredients may thus be determined.             The varying temperature
 of the nitre would necessarily produce considerable variations
 and uncertainty in its action, and in the consequent accuracy of
 the results ; but it is plain, that the effect of this contrivance
 was to separate by a sort of distillation the petroleum which fire
 elicits from coal, and that the method could neither be so accu
 rate as that of ordinary distillation, from the greater irregularities
 to which it was subject and the difficulty of conducting                and      it,
 that it  proves nothing    with  regard  to  the composition     or  nature
 of coal. In the examination of maltha, and asphaltum, the de

                                                                        is
  division of inflammable and subterraneous substances connected
  with these, of which the claims may appear doubtful.            Retaining

   The experiments   I  have already related prove that the substance
                                                                             resembling

                     in the Distillation   of Wood, &c.
  resembling bitumen, which is produced by the action of fire in
  the ordinary way on vegetables, differs from jt essentially, and it
  has. been seen that solubility in naphtha is the readiest criterion
  by which these substances can be distinguished.         To assure my
  self of the accuracy of this test, I mixed the petroleum of -coaj
  with the black oil of wood in several proportions, and by the ap
  plication of naphtha separated the one from the other.         By this
  simple method, therefore,     I expected   to detect not only the pro
  gress of hituniinization from simple turf to jet, but to assure
  myself whether, in the examinations hitherto made by others of
  these different substances, any mistake had arisen from con
  founding the vegetable bitumen with true bitumen when distil*
  lation was used to investigate their nature.
      Vegetable turf in all its varieties, as well as brown coal, gave
  .a considerable colour to lixivium of potash,      but the same mcnr
  etruum produced no effect on jet, or surturbrand.             Nor had
  naphtha or alcohol any action except on the resinous lignite of
  Bovey, from which they extracted the resinous matter which that
  variety contains.
      I therefore subjected these different substances to. distillation,i
  trusting that by the prqduee I should ascertain not only the
  fact but the progress of bituminization.
     Submerged wood, from peat mosses in Cumberland, gave a
  brown oil, smelling of the wood tar, and refusing to dissolve in
  naphtha.      In this case, therefore, no appearance of a change
  towards bitumen was exhibited.        A compact pitchy-looking peat
  gave an oil which had a fetid smell, neither resembling that of
  wood tar, nor bitumen, and which was very slightly soluble in
   naphtha.
      The Bovey brown (board) coal produced an oil of a peculiar
  smell, but most resembling that of wood tar, and much more
  soluble in naphtha than the preceding.         Having a larger quan
  tity of this, I separated the soluble part by naphtha, and in the
  remainder, or insoluble oil, the smell of wood tar was powerful,
  notwithstanding      the strong odour of the naphtha.       Here then
  the progress of bituminization had advanced another step.         The
  resin of this wood, an which a particular name has lately been
  bestowed, 1 consider as an adventitious and accidental sub-
- stance, and the natural produce of the tree, now' probably un
  known, which occupies these alluvial strata, as other lost pro
  ductions of Nature are detected in other alluvial soils.
     A specimen of black lignite from Sussex gave an oil which re-r
  eembled the former in smell, and perhaps did not differ much
  from it in its solubility in naphtha; but I had not enough of the
  instance to institute an accurate comparison, neither in fact
                                    04                             could

 216                 Oh certain Products ollaiiied
 could it serve any purpose.           A similar substance from Bovey
 gave similar results.
    The oil which was distilled from jet was of a greater specific
 gravity than any of the preceding, and smelled strongly of petro
 leum.     It seemed to be soluble in naphtha as readily as the speci*
 men of petroleum with which I compared it.           Indeed, had it not
 been that a greater quantity of acid was given over in this process
 than from any of the varieties of coal, I know not that any che
 mical distinction between the two would have existed.               The
 mineralogical   one   is  still  considerable.  The   several specimens
 above enumerated, yielded each a large portion of acetic acid,
 marking as clearly as the peculiar sort of oil did, the remains of
 unchanged vegetable matter.
    Examining therefore the alteration produced by water on com
 mon turf, or submerged wood, we have all the evidence of de
 monstration that its action is sufficient to convert them into
 substances capable of yielding bitumen on distillation.
    That the same action having operated through a longer period
 has produced the change in the brown coal of Bovey, is rendered
 extremely probable by the geognostic relations of that coal.
 From this to the harder lignites, surturbrand and jet, the transi
 tion is so gradual, that there seems no reason to limit the power of
water to produce the effect of bituminization in all these varieties ;
 nor is there aught in this change so dissonant from other che
mical actions, as to make us hesitate in adopting this cause. In
 the ordinary process of vegetable putrefaction and destruction, a
variety of compound gases are formed by the reaction of their
elements, and carbon alone, or rather carbon united to a portion
of hydrogen, remains behind.             Here the oxygen is completely
dissipated, together      with   the  azote, and the greater portion of
the hydrogen.      Analogous circumstances determine the putre
faction of animal matter; but in this case the play of affinities is
so intricate, that a large portion of the carbon is volatilized in
the gaseous form.        By the constant affusion of water, however,
this process may be so modified, that the greater part of the hy
drogen and carbon will be retained, and enter, together with
minute portions of other gases, into a new compound resembling
fat, which has obtained the name of adipocire.           The analogy is
strong, and the gradual deoxydation of the wood in this process
is visible in the different stages of bituminization.
    Such, as far as observations have yet gone, is our knowledge
hf this process, and of the power of water in producing it . To re
peat such an experiment in the laboratory seems impossible, since
the necessary element of time must be wanting to complete it.
But the action of fire being of shorter duration, and affording us
                                     -
                                              .                      also

also readier means of imitating Nature in those operations in
which she has wrought with the same ageut, it is worth our while
to consider, if by it we can produce from vegetables the bitu
minous   matters    under    review.    It is not necessary to   say how
intimately this question is connected with our speculations on
the origin of coal, since Sir James Hall's experiments were ex
pressly intended to illustrate this view of the subject.   In this,
it is related that " coal" was produced from "fir saw dust" by
the usual method employed in these experiments, and that pieces
 of wood were changed " to a jet-black and inflammable sub
 stance, generally very porous," in some specimens of which " the
 vegetable fibres were still visible." There is no reason to doubt
that the substance produced in these experiments was that black
matter which I have described in the first part of this paper,
which. however resembling bitumen in colour and inflammability,
1 have proved to be a different substance,      and that the igneous
theory  of the  origin  of coal will receive no  support frolm thera,
as far at least as relates to the conversion of vegetable matter
into bitumen.     I need take no notice of the modifications de
rived from a mixture of animal matter in these experiments, as
it is not my desire to enter into a discussion of the general ques
tion, but to state such chemical facts as arose in the experiments
I undertook.     And since it is certain that vegetables alone are
competent    to the  production of bitumen, and that the geological
history of coal does not justify a supposition that animals have
been concerned in its production, it is perhaps unnecessary to
investigate that question further.
    To satisfy myself whether any essential chemical difference
would result from the experiments performed by simple heat, and
those performed by heat under pressure, I repeated these trials,
by heating wood in close gun barrels, introducing occasionally
lime, clay, or other matters, to absorb the acid generated, and
give the greater chance for the disoxygenation and bituminiza-
tion of the wood. -But the produce only differed from that of the
experiments in open vessels, by the circumstance which is men
 tioned in Sir James Hall's paper, namely, the mixture of a porous
 charcoal, or a half destroyed vegetable structure.        In all cases
 the bituminous-looking matter was vegetable tar, not bitumen. "
    Thus far tben perhaps we are justified in concluding that the
 action of water, and not that of fire, has converted the vegetable
 matters into bitumen.       It is another question to determine how
 that bituminous     matter in its several forms of peat or lignite
 has been converted mto coal, into a substance differing mechani
                                        it,
 cally rather than chemically from      if,   without misleading,   I   may
use the contrast   of these terms.

 "Sir, — Tn Read's       " Summary View of the spontaneous Electri*
   city of the Earth and Atmosphere" (1793) is the following
                "
  passage : — Some years since, I saw Mr. Volta obtain a very small
  quantity of electricity from the fumes of a mixture of water, oil
  of vitriol, and filings of iron."    It appears to me that this mode
  of exciting the electric fluid bears great resemblance to a gal
  vanic process. In this experiment there were two fluids and one
  metal used. The writer does not mention whether the ingredients
  were put into a metallic vessel. If they were, (which is not very pro
  bable,) there is a greater similarity to the usual galvanic processes^
  supposing the,vessel madeof adifferent metal from the filings used.
      It is well known that electrical effects are produced by drop-?
  ping a burning coal into a metallic vessel containing water. Docs
  not this also resemble what is called Galvanism?              I wish to
  induce persons to make both the above experiments, and accu
  rately note down the particulars observable, and I think it probable
  that some interesting facts might result from the experiment.
      If a number of vessels for the experiments were arranged like
  Volta's couronne de tasies, perhaps (for it is only conjecture) a
  considerable accumulation        of the electric fluid might, as in
  Volta's experiment, be obtained
      I believe it has been wished by some electricians, tha't a single
  word should be adopted for the electric fluid. 1 know of no better
  than Fulgoric, the matter occasioning lightning ; and although
  I am not very fond of new words, I shall venture to propose this.
 We might use fulgoric alone, or call it the fulgoric or electric
fluid occasionally.
      It appears to me   that of late the two states of electricity, the
 plus    and  minus,  have  been considered as a state of condensation
 and rarefaction ; which seems to be very proper; for do not many
 of the electrical pluenomena bear a great resemblance to the
 phenomena observed in pneumatic experiments ?                 By this I
 would be understood to mean, Do they not seem to be caused by
 a condensed elastic fluid rushing violently to mix with another
 portion of the fluid in a comparatively         more rare state, and
 thence producing an equilibrium of density ?         If this opinion be
just, may not (as has been before suggested in your Magazine)
 the conductor annexed to the cushion of a common electrical ma
 chine be compared to the receiver of a rarefying air-pump, and
 the conductor before the glass cylinder, to the receiver of a con
 densing machine, or, as it might be called, a condensing air-pump ?
 The above is submitted to the consideration of your readers,
hoping for their remarks.

per On the Chemical Composition of the Paints and Colours used
by the ancient Greeks and Romans, was read.          It appears that
ceruse was never used for white in any of the places examined
by Sir Humphry, in the ruins of Pompeii, the baths of Titus*
and other vestiges of ancient art, although the ancients were ac
quainted with the acetats.      Their azure was prepared with nitre,
flint, and copper filings.     Sir Humphry states that 15 parts of
soda, and 20 of flint, added to copper, produced their blues ; coy
bait was also Used ; minium, oxides of iron, and ochres, consti
tuted their reds and browns ; their whites were carbonates of
lime; their glass sometimes contained manganese; and their
blacks were all carbonaceous matter.       The colour of the cuttle
fish was likewise occasionally used.
    March 16. A long letter from Dr. Brewster to the President
was read, detailing the particulars of Malus's discovery of the
polarization of light reflected from the first and second surfaces
of bodies, relating some of the author's first essays in this
branch of physical science, and concluding with an eloge of the
late M. Malus, and the merit or importance of his discoveries
and researches.     The Society then adjourned over two Thursdays
till April 6.

    Mr. Lysons exhibited to the Society of Antiquaries, in the
evening of the 16th of March, very accurate and finely coloured
drawings of the mosaic pavement lately found in the remains
of a Roman villa near Bignor in Sussex. The site of the build
ing extended about 230 by 1 50 feet, and contained all the va
riety of apartments usual in Roman villas.         In one apartment
the mosaic consisted of squares laid over each other at right an
gles, and the intervening spaces filled with florets ; in another,
a pentagonal fountain in the centre, with a passage for carrying
 off the water ; around the fountain were nymphs also in penta
 gonal compartments, many of them very well executed.            The
whole were inclosed in a circle more correct than usual with
 Roman artists.     Others consisted of mosaics with tolerably fine
 heads of Venus in the centre, represented no doubt as beautiful
 as the artists of the age of Agricola (the period at which Mr. L.
 supposes that 'this villa had been erected) could execute.

  March 11.    A paper by Mr. Scoresby, of Wliitbv, was read,
on the subject of polar ice, and the difficulties encountered by
the whalers in their annual visits to those northern regions. —
Mr. Scoresby's frequent visits to that part of the globe have in
duced him to turn his attention to the possibility of reaching the
pole by means of an excursion over the ice ; and a considerable
portion of his paper was devoted to this very interesting subject.
It appears, from his accounts, that the whalers have sometimes
penetrated so high as 81-J- degrees, or within about b'OQ miles of
the pole, which space he considers might be travelled in sledges,
by means of rein-deer or dogs, in about a fortnight ; and that
for the return, allowing for casualties, and time for observations,
the whole might be accomplished in six weeks.        From his know
ledge of the climate, he thinks the temperature of the weather
Will present no very great oljstacle, having observed that after a
long continuance of north wind the thermometer never was very
considerably depressed.       The difficulties he contemplates are,
open water, rough or mountainous ice or similar land, soft snow,
and dense mists.
   As it is supposed that the first will not be very extensive, he
proposes to have his trainaux formed in the shape of canoes, so
that they might pass over any thing of the kind, while the dogs
might be 'made to swim ; and for other obstacles, he must in a
great measure trust to chance, supplying himself with whatever
may be necessary to overcome them, should they occur.
    In shaping his course to the pole, he must soon lose the assist
ance of the magnetic needle, and must trust to solar observa
tions, which, together with a good chronometer, would answer
every purpose, could he be sure of not meeting with mists.        He
likewise proposes to assist himself in misty weather by making
his cavalcade move at some distance apart in a straight line,
which once properly directed may, with attention, be got to pro
ceed with tolerable accuracy.       From his experience of the at
 mosphere of high northern latitudes, however, he does not anti
cipate such weather, except with southerly winds, which are not
of frequent occurrence or long continuance.
    It is very satisfactory to observe a subject of this kind treated
with so much ardour, and at the same time with so much science,
 as Mr. Scoresby has done.      It is an object which has long- been
very much desired by men of science, to ascertain the nature and
form of the globe at the pole, and the manner in which the
needle is acted upon in proceeding towards it.        This, however,
is not an object that can be taken up by an individual ;; and      if,
after explaining his views to men of science, his plan may be

    Feb. 22, 1815.       The reading of an Essay was Commenced,
 " On the    Origin, Progress, and present State of Galvanism, with
Observations on the Inadequacy of the Hypotheses proposed to
explain its Phenomena, and Reflections on the Influence of Gal
vanic Discoveries on the Doctrines of Chemistry;" by M. Dono
van, Esq. Secretary*.
    The sketch of the history of Galvanism, with which the Essay
commenced, was divided into three periods : 1st, containing the
discovery of muscular contraction effected by simple Galvanic
 contact, and of combined Galvanic arrangements ; 2d, contain
ing the gradual development of the physical and chemical powers
of combined Galvanic arrangements; and, 3d, containing gene
ralizations of the chemical effects of Galvanism, and the dis
coveries that have resulted from the application of these gene
ralizations to research.
    Period 1 . The first distinct Galvanic phenomenon was the taste
excited on the tongue by two metals in contact, neither of
which could separately produce any effect; a fact noticed by
Sultzer in 1767, and little attended to until in 1791 it was
found by Galvani       that metallic contact excited a surprising     ar
tificial motion in the muscles of dead animals. Shortly after, the
experiments of Sultzer and Galvani were attributed by Fabroni
to the operation of the same agent. Galvani considered the
agent to be a kind of electricity inherent in animals : Fabroni
maintained the electricity to be concomitant, and the taste and
contractions to be produced by chemical action of the metals.
The discoveries and opinions of those who embraced the doctrine
of either of the above philosophers, with or without modifications,
were then stated.         Humboldt denied that the agent was elec
tricity, as it was not conducted by various good conductors of
that fluid, Pfaff considered the agent to be sui generis, and
associated or identical with the principle of life. Fontana denied
that muscular motion is in any degree connected with electricity.
Valli adopted the opinion of Galvani, with a peculiar modifica
tion : he allowed that electricity was the agent, but believed that
                                                                          '
it was identical with the nervous fluid.       From this Monro dis-
sented : he thought that the unknown agent merely acted as an,
artificial stimulus to the natural nervous Jluid.        Volta differed
   * Tliis.Essay in a somewhat different form was honoured with the prize
by the Royal Irish Academy.
                                                                    with

                    fcirwaman Society     of Dublm.
with all the preceding: he admitted that the agent in contrac
tions is electricity, not inherent in the animal, but generated by
the contact of two metals, which he found it necessary in most
cases to employ.     Vassali-Eandi preferred the opinion of Galvani,
but added this modification,       that the metal employed is not a
generator but    a  conductor of the electricity, which is evolved
during chemical action continually taking place in animals, and
 not inherent in them as a principle.      Fowler denied that the cir
 cumstances for producing electricity are present, and the pheno
 mena are even reconcileable to the laws of fluid : he supposes
 that the influence, whatever may be its nature, is not derived
 from the metals alone, but partly from the animal.           Experi
 ments- of Soiuch, Mareigli, Grapengiesser,        Giulio, Rossi, and
 Aldini, were then noticed.        Wells allowed that electricity was
 the agent, but denied that it was produced by the contact of the
 metals, or by any inherent quality of the muscles and nerves. At
 length Volta proved to a demonstration, that by the contact and
 separation of different metals electricity is really evolved ; a fact
 which in some time after led him to the grand discovery of the
 pile, — a column erected to the memory of its inventor, and in
 scribed with an epoch in the annals of knowledge.
     March 8. — Period II. The second period was commenced
  with the discoverv of the Galvanic decomposition of water by-
  Nicholson and Carlisle.        Mr. Cruickshank effected many de
  compositions,  as  of metallic  and earthy salts : he drew up some
  general conclusions 5   and    gave a new form to the pile, which
  combined convenience with increase of power.          Mr. Henry de
  composed sulphuric and nitric acids, and submitted other sub
  stances to examination.       Colonel Haldane made many experi
  ments upon the metals most proper to form Galvanic arrange
  ments, but could not believe that the agent is electricity.      Mr.
  Davy repeated the experiments       on the decomposition   of  water,
  and ascertained     some very singular circumstances of it : he
  found that a fluid interposed in the pile, which can act che
  mically on the plates, greatly increases its power. Hitter, struck
  with the separate evolution of the gases in the decomposition of
  water, was led to deny the constitution of that fluid, and to sub
stitute some singular opinions for the received theory.        Robert
  son considered the Galvanic influence peculiar, and of an acid
  nature.    Brugnatelli also supposed that it is an acid, but iden
  tical with electricity. Fourcroy, Vauquelin, Thenard, and Lehot
  denied the identity of the Galvanic and electric fluid : they heated
   wires red hot by means of large plates.      Tromsdorf and Simon
  effected the cqmbustion of metals.        Helwige, Twast, Bourguet,
  Frhman, and Grapcngiesser accomplished the combustion of
  inflammables.

224                 Kinvanian Society of Dublin.
     Attempts were made by Dr. Wollaston to reconcile the con
tending hypotheses of Fabroni and Volta : with the latter, he
supposes electricity to be the agent ; but, with the former, he
considers chemical action to be the exciter, and extends oxida
tion to the explanation of every case of electrical excitement.
Davy showed that oxidation was not the sole exciter, foy sul-
phuration produced Galvanic appearances : this had been before
shown by Volta.        The identity of Galvanism and electricity was
attempted     to  be proved by Van Marum and Pfaff, by comparing
the effects    of  the pile with the common electric machine : they
 concluded that oxidation was unnecessary.         Biot, Cuvier, and
 Desormes proved that oxygen is absorbed by the pile in action.
 Bostock admitted that oxygen is necessary to the evolution of
 electricity in the pile, and conceived that hydrogen is essential
 to its conveyance, a combination taking place between both.
 Cuthbertson considered the production of electricity as depend
 ing on the metals in contact, and on the chemical action. Al-
 ilini and Lagrave showed that neither metallic contact nor che
 mical action on metals was necessary, by producing Galvanic
 effects with different kinds of animal matter only ; and Jordan
 and Ritter conceived that Galvanic arrangements             could be
 effected with magnets.        This period of the history concluded
 with the labours of Dr. Wilkinson.
     March 22. — Period III. The third period' of the history of
 Galvanism commenced with the well known generalizations of
 Hisinger and Berzelius ; their experiments on the invisible trans
 fer of elements to a distance ; and the explanation given by
 Grotthus of the invisible transfer of the elements of water. The
 announced decomposition of muriatic acid by Peele, Pacchioni
 and others, was then detailed, and the discovery of the source
 of mistake by the Galvanic Society, Pfaff, Biot, Thenard, and
 Davy. Mr. Sylvester's well supported opinion, that the preci
 pitation of one metal by another is a Galvanic phenomenon, and
 his explanation of it,    which was afterwards enlarged on  by  Grot
 thus, was then stated.       Mr. Wilson's experiments with metallic
 filings were conceived very much to weaken the grounds of the
 Voltaic hypothesis, which supposed the electricity to be evolved
 by   contact
           :     Mr. Wilson showed that separation alone produces
 electricity: on the other hand, the Voltaic hypothesis acquired
 new probability from the experiments of Mr. Erhman, in which
it   was proved that Galvanism and electricity are conducted bv
 the same bodies, and that the supposed anomaly arose from not
-being acquainted with a new class of conductors, Vvhich are such
 to one pole only of the pile.     The grand discoveries of Davy re
 lating to the alkaline metals, and of Berzelius, Pontin, and Davy
 with regard to the earthy metals, were detailed   j    also the pro-
K     -.

effect's ; and also Mr. De Luc's and' Mr. Singer's column, which
possessed high electrical intensity with no other power.              Lastly,
the objections offered to Mr. Davy's hypotheses concerning oxy-

                         Mr. Brande's Lectures*.
    Mr. Brande, in his fifth lecture on the history of chemical phi
losophy, entered upon that period of his subject in which the
nature of the atmosphere began to attract the notice of chemists.
As in other branches of experimental science, so here the ad
vances of the human mind had been very gradual.                   Mayow in
 1674, said the professor, was upon the very brink of that tor
rent- of discovery, which in 1774 carried Dr. Priestley into the
fastnesses    of pneumatic chemistry.           Hales, by showing the
mode of disengaging and collecting gaseous fluids, had removed
all serious obstacles from this path of research ; he was followed
by Boerhaave and afterwards by Black, who, having dispovered
fixed air, turned into another road of investigation.              Although
these philosophers, therefore, had opened the mine, they neg
 lected to explore it — its treasures were reserved for more diligent
 and dexterous experimentalists.            Mr. Brande then cited the
 opinions of Libavius, Rev, Mayow, and Hooke, respecting the
 nature of the atmosphere, and added a brief account of what had
 been done in this insulated branch of inquiry, previous to the
 year 1772, when Dr. Rutherford, of Edinburgh, demonstrated,
 that after the separation of fixed air from that contaminated by
 respiration and combustion, the remainder was still noxious : to
 this new variety of air the term azote had been applied ; it was
 also called nitrogen, it having been afterwards recognised as a
 component part of the nitric acid.
     The discovery of azote was doubtless an? important step in
 pneumatic chemistry ; Mr. Brande passed on to that marked
 epoch of chemical history, which was adorned by the names of
  Priestley, Scheele, Cavendish, and Lavoisier.
     " These discoveries," 6aid the professor, " led to new views
    * We regret that our limits do not admit of our
                                                       giving the whole of this
  ingenious and popular gentleman's lectures seriatim.     We have therefore
  confined ourselves to such of them as appeared of the most general interest.

of the physiology of vegetables, and strikingly displayed some
of those masterly and beneficent adjustments of nature by which
the different members of the creation are made to minister to
each other's wants, and thus preserve that eternal harmony
which marks the natural world."
    Mr. Brande said it was a curious fact that some plants effected
the same changes upon the atmosphere as animals, only in a
much less degree : he alluded to some experiments of his own,
in which similar portions of contaminated air were exposed to
the operation of the vine, mint, the pea, and water cresses, all
in a healthy state of vegetation : by the vine and mint it was
purified, unaltered by the pea, and rendered less pure by the
 cresses.    Mr. Brande hoped upon these grounds to be able to
 explain some discordant results of later experimentalists.
     The remainder of the lecture was occupied with the details of
 Dr. Priestley's greatest discovery, that of dephlogisticated air,
 or, as it has since been styled, oxygen gas, on the first of Au
gust, 1774.
     In his sixth lecture Mr. Brande resumed the history of Dr.
 Priestley's researches.     Foiled in his attempts to collect and
 preserve certain gases over water, Dr. Priestley devised the ex
 pedient of confining them over quicksilver.       It was thus that he
 obtained   muriatic  acid, sulphurous acid,   and  the volatile alkali,
 in their pure elastic form : he then imagined, that by'mixing the
 acid and alkaline air he should obtain a neutral aeriform fluid ;
 but to his surprise a solid salt resulted, and the gases Were
 wholly condensed.       Having illustrated these and some other in
 quiries   of minor  importance, by simple but satisfactory experi
 ments,    the  professor took a general view of Dr. Priestley's
 scientific character and discoveries.
     Mr. Brande next proceeded to illustrate the discoveries of
 Scheele ; he dwelt principally upon that of dephlogisticated mu
 riatic acid, a subject that has given rise to a very singular con
 troversy in the chemical world.       Scheele regarded it as an ele
 mentary substance,     as  the base of muriatic acid : it was next
 examined by Berthollet, who imagined that it contained oxygen,
 and was composed of that principle united to muriatic acid.
 Sir H. Davy had found reason to doubt the accuracy of these
 conclusions, which for twenty years had prevailed in the chemi
 cal world, and by a series of satisfactory inquiries had re-esta
 blished the correctness of Scheele's original views.      Mr. Brande
 said, that any extended discussion upon this subject would be
misplaced in his present lecture ; but it had been alluded to in a
 manner neither complaisant nor philosophical, in a recent French
 publication — and whenever the claims of his eminent predecessor
 were unwarrantably attacked and infringed, it became his impe
 rious duty to step forward in their defence.
                                                                 Some

    Some     beautiful   experiments    illustrating the properties of
dephlogisticated       muriatic  acid, or chlorine, (as it had been
called by Sir H. Davy, in consequence of its peculiar colour, and
to avoid all hypothetical reference to its composition), were ex
hibited, and its application to the purposes of bleaching con
cisely   illustrated.    Mr. Brande feared that its application to
whitening .rags     for paper-making, had been productive of some
mischief;      and that  the spots and blemishes of the paper common
in many of the magnificent productions of our press, might be
referred to the effects of this substance.
 •
   On the other discoveries of Scheele, noticed by Mr. Brande,
our limits prevent us from dwelling : he particularly alluded to
that of the fluoric acid j and relieved the narrative and illustra
tion of Scheele's discoveries with some admirable remarks upon
his character and genius as a philosopher.
                            FRENCH INSTITUTE.
    Monday, January 9, 1815, the anniversary meeting of the Class
of Mathematical and Physical Sciences or the French Institute
took place.       The principal object of the meeting was the dis
tribution of prizes.       M. Lalande's annual astronomical prize for
the most interesting observation or the most useful memoir on
the science of astronomy, was adjudged to M. Piazzi, astronomer
royal, of Palermo, for his ample catalogue of nearly 7500 stars
 published in 1814.
 .  The two prize subjects for 1817 are: first, To determine the
 action of the thermometer filled with quicksilver, at least from
zero to 200° centigrade ; the law of refrigeration in vacuo, the
laws of refrigeration in the air, hydrogen, and carbonic acid gas,
 at different temperatures and in different states of rarefaction :
 secondly, To determine the chemical changes which take place
 in fruits during and after fructification.
    The Class will also adjudge in the public sitting for 1816,
                                                                          .
a prize for the best work or memoir, in print or manuscript, on
the application of mathematical analysis to a question in physics,
or to the best experiments in general physics, with which it shall
be made acquainted previous to October 1, 1815.
:   M. Delambre then read a biographical notice of Abbe" Bossut
and ML Cuvier of Count Kumford.; when the Class adjourned.
    At the meeting of the Class of Physical and Mathematical
Sciences on the 23d of January 1815, a report was read on a
memoir by M. Le Perej inspector of roads and bridges and
member of the Institute of Egypt, respecting the ancient com
munications between the Indian ocean and the Mediterranean
by the Red sea and the isthmus of Suez.            Speaking of the result

of the great operation of levelling the two seas by the isthmus of
Suez, M. Le Pere, or rather the reporter of his memoir, ob
        :
          " This levelling resolves the celebrated question agitated
serves
smce the days of the ancients respecting the elevation of the
Red sea above the Mediterranean sea and the soil of Lower
Egyflt : we thereby discover that the low-water mark of the
Mediterranean is lower by eight metres and 121 millimetres than
the low-water mark ; and nine metres and 907 millimetres lower
than the high -water mark of the Red sea.          We also find that
the total slope of the hill from Cairo to Rosetta, in a distance
of 252,000 metres, varies by about eight metres from the lowest
to' the highest level of the waters : the mean deelrvity when the
river is at its lowest ebb is -jf^ i    0,0002, and atits fullest state
in September 1 798 this declivity became             = 0,01)05 1 .
    " The difference between the high and the low-water mark
 at Suez i3 one metre 7S6 millimetres : the Nile in its most
suoln state at Cairo is superior at first by eight metres 960
millimetres, and in the second stage by four metres 740 milli
metres: at its lowest state at the same place it is inferior to the
low-water mark at Suez by two metres 836 millimetres.
    " The point in the vast basin of the bitter lakes is remarkable
for its being nearly eight metres below the low-water mark of
the Red sea : other points of land, and even places which are in
habited, are below the level of both seas; and an immense extent
of ground, very little elevated above the Mediterranean, is far
below the Red sea ; so that the waters of the latter might cover
the surface of the Delta, and the well founded fears of this sub
mersion may have caused great alarm at distant epochs, when

Abstract of the Labours of the CIasi of Mathematical and Phy
   sical Sciences during the Year 1814.        By M. Cuvier. per-
   ptlual Secretary.
   " The   memorable events of which the French capital has been
the theatre, far from interrupting our scientific researches, have
furnished new proofs of the respect which the sciences inspire,
and of the great influence which they have acquired over men of
all ranks and professions.        Innumerable armies from the ex
tremities of Europe have visited our monuments, have examined
our collections, without their sustaining the slightest damage.
Friends of science, enrolled in this grand crftsade, undertaken

  In a great measure for the restoration of the liberty of writing
  and thinking, had scarcely laid clown their arms, when they
  flocked to make themselves acquainted with our labours, to take
  a share in them, and to instruct us as to what was done among
   themselves."
      The reporter commences with chemistry, and notices the dis
  covery of iode, recapitulating its properties.
     "  When Lavoisier and Berthollet formed the new system of
  chemistrv on their beautiful experiments, which demonstrated
  their luminous theories of combustion, the formation and de
  composition of water, and of the formation of the acids by the
 combination of oxygen with different bases ; when this truth was
 completely established by evidence, so far as the principal acids
  were concerned, it was inferred from analogy that it might be
 extended to all.     Nevertheless, some scruples arose on this sub
ject, as soon as it was proved by M. Berthollet that sulphuretted
 hydrogen had the properties of the acids, although oxygen was
 no part of its composition.        It was acknowledged that oxygen
 was not the only principle capable of operating acidification.
      " The muriatic acid, that acid which combined with soda
 forms common salt, had not been decomposed : and the oxy
 genated muriatic acid, a substance so precious from the property
 which it possesses of disinfecting the air by neutralizing putrid
 miasmata, and from its use in bleaching,— this substance, which
 had been long regarded as a combination of the muriatic acid
 with a superabundance of oxygen, may be regarded as a simple
 substance, from a variety of concurrent circumstances, as a burn
 ing (comburan) or acidifying principle as well as oxygen : and
 most chemists who have adopted this opinion, those who are
 considered as the best authorities, have called it t/ilore, from the
 yellowish colour which they found it to possess.        The muriatic
 acid, according   to them, is a combination    of chlorg with hydro*
 gen, and they call it hydrochloric acid.
     " Iode also forms acids by being combined with hydrogen
 and other substances : we must therefore place it with chlore and
 sulphur among the number of acidifying principles.
     "A  fourth principle is sought to be discovered in the fluorio
 acid, arid hitherto not decomposed.        This acid is remarkable
 for its property of corroding glass, so that it can only be kept in
 flasks internally coated with wax.     This property has been taken
advantage of for making drawings upon glass by means of the
fluoric acid reduced into vapour.         We presume that it results
 from the composition of hydrogen, with a simple body of a pe
 culiar nature, and which we shall call Jiuor. It was M. Ampere,
a most eminent geometrician, who first conceived this idea, and
\% is for professional chemists to demonstrate it.

    " Will all  these discoveries revolutionize  chemistry once more ?
The new chemistry, wholly founded on experience, cannot change.
The old chemistry, completely systematic, had various founda
tions upon which it could not stand.           The new chemistry ad
vances   and   enriches  us  as it proceeds ; but it changes nothing
notwithstanding."                     •
    M. Theodore de Saussure has demonstrated, by the decom
position of alcohol or spirit of wine and ether, that these two
substances are composed in the same way as carbon and hydro
gen, but combined with different portions of water reduced to
its elements, so that in alcohol these elements form one- third;
whereas in ether they form only one-fifth !         Thus, when by di
stillation of alcohol with sulphuric acid we obtain ether, it is
because the acid has taken from the alcohol a portion of its water.
 This same acid, if we employ it in a greater quantity, will take
up the whole of the water, arid will reduce the alcohol to the
 state of olefiant gas, a kind of carbonated hydrogen gas highly
 charged with carbon, and to which this name has been given,
 because in burning it deposits oil.
    M. Mongez, in a memoir on the bronze of the ancients, has
 proved from the experiments of M. Darcet, that it was not by
 immersion in cold water that the bronze hardens, as is the case
 with steel, but that it acquired its hardness when after being
 made red hot it was allowed to cool slowly in the air.       M. Dar
 cet has made cymbals in this way of an excellent tone, and which
 it was pretended could only be made in Turkey, and by one
 workman of Constantinople.
    The falls of atmospheric stones, now that their reality has been
 ascertained, have been so often observed, that the long incredulity
 which people entertained on the subject, will speedily be the only
 topic for surprise connected with them.         There was a very re
 markable phenomenon of this description in the department of
 the Lot and Garonne, on the 5th of September, attended as
 usual by a serene sky, a great explosion, and a whitish cloud.
 The number of stones was considerable, and they were dispersed
 over a radius of a league.
    M. Cuvier has examined at Haerlem a petrified skeleton, ex
 tracted more than a hundred years ago from the quarries of
 (Eningen, near the lake of Constance, which Scheuchzer, a na
 turalist of Zurich, had taken for that of a man, and which he
 had engraved as " the man who was a witness for the Deluge."
 M. Cuvier has ascertained that this skeleton belonged to an un
known and gigantic species of Salamander, as he had already
 announced, on a simple view of the engraving, in his great work
 on fossil animals.     From not meeting with the fossil remains of
 human beings, M.' Cuvier thinks that man is the newest inhabi
 tant of the globe.                 •

    M. de Humboldt has given the truly wonderful history of the
volcano of Jorullo, which opened in 1759, at Mexico, on a well
cultivated plain/through which two rivers ran, and where no sub
terraneous noise had been heard within the memory of man.
The catastrophe was announced some months before by rever
berations which lasted fifteen or twenty days.          Flames and
showers of ashes determined the inhabitants to fly: the surface
of the ground rose and fell like waves, and a multitude of small
cones issued, from six to nine feet high, and which still exist.
At length there arose a series- of six hillocks, the principal of
which has still an inflamed crater, and is not less than 1600
feet high.    Every morning the smoke rises from small cones
and crevices ; and the water of both rivers is hot, and impreg
nated with sulphuretted hydrogen.       This volcano, like several
others of the new world, is upwards of 40 leagues from the sea ;
whereas    on the old continent     we know of none further re
moved than twelve leagues.
    Botanists are not yet agreed as to the fructification of the
mosses.    Linneus, who established his system according to the
several organs, unable to discover them in the mosses, mush
rooms, lichens, &c. ranged all these plants in a single class, which
he called cryatogami'i, or secret marriages.    The mosses flourish
in winter ; on a very delicate pedicle rises a small urn, at first
covered with a conical cap closed by an operculum ; the cap
falls, the operculum is detached, and the urn is found full of
a green powder which Hedwig considers as the seed.             M. de
Beauvoir has made some new observations, which induce him to
believe that the powder or dust in the urns is a true pollen or
fecundating powder, like that of the stamina of the greater part
of plants, and according to him, the seed is contained in a small
column which forms the axis of the urn.        Hence the mosses,
like the greater number of other vegetables, are hermaphrodites.
    M. Lamouroux, of Caen, has published several memoirs on
marine plants,     considered with respect to their use for the
nourishment     of men and animals, in political and domestic
oeconomy, in the arts and comforts of life.     It is surprising how
many useful or agreeable articles different nations have derived
from vegetables so little distinguished ; some are directly eaten,
or converted into a savoury and nourishing jelly ; others furnish
an essential support to animals in the frozen regions of the
North, and all of them yield soda or manure.      A few yield sugar,
and others colouring matter for the dye-house ; several of them
are made into mats, vessels for drinking, and even musical in
struments : that called moss of Corsica is a valuable remedy.

                 he last volume of the Memoirs pf the Philosophical
 Society   of Manchester      contains a valuable Essay on the Migra
tion of Birds, by Mr. Gough, of Kendal. Since the appearance
of this paper I have made some inquiries respecting migrating
birds, and find it very difficult to meet with any thing satisfac
tory on the subject, from any other part of Europe. It seems
that few British travellers, or even foreign naturalists, have paid
that attention to these transitory visitors which the subject de
serves ; for I am at a loss to know where a series of accurate ob
 servations respecting them can be met with, besides those stated
 by Mr. Gough.         It is very desirable that their regular appear
 ance and disappearance in the different latitudes of Europe
 bhould be ascertained, as it would considerably illustrate the hisr
 torv of this class of the feathered tribe.          It would, I believe, be
 interesting to many of your readers, if you could procure, through
 the medium of foreign publications, or from your extensive cor
 respondence abroad, an account of these birds from any other
 part of the globe- If such account was somewhat similar to
 Mr. Gough's, it would either throw further light on his theory,
 or else produce facts that might be combined with such cir
 cumstances as may tend to render this dark and controverted
 subject more clear. By inserting the above in your valuable Jour

 respondents to this amusing subject ; and will oblige,

    Sir,-— In   5'our last number        I  have noticed two questions put
 to me, respecting facts stated in a paper I transmitted last year

                            Mathematical Question.                            233
  to the Geological Society, to which I shall answer as briefly as
  possible.   The muscle shells found in the shale of this part of
  the kingdom are mineralized by clay iron- stone,. and exactly re
  semble the common fresh water muscle in shape, but are less in
.
  size.   1 beg leave further to add, that no organic remains which
I could suspect to have once belonged to marine animals, were
ever observed by me in the Newcastle coal formation, though
the magnesian limestone by which ic is covered, and the lead;
mine sills, lying below          it,
                              abound with them.       With regard to
the grindstone sill on Alston Moor,      consists of a sandstone not
                                                  it
unlike the stratum from which grindstones are quarried in this
vicinity, but the former must be situated far below the latter.
As Mr. W. Forster's section      referred to in the letter of my ano
                                       is
nymous correspondent,      permit me to say, that in the year 1800
a similar engraving was published at Carlisle (and signed William
Millot, mmer), of all the lead mine measures; and previous to
that period the late Mr. Q. Johnson had an engraving made of
the strata sunk through at the coal mine situated at Byker St.
Anthony. These two, together with the section of Sheriff-hill
Colliery, printed in Hutchinson's History of Durham, furnish
out the section given to the public by Mr. Forster in 1812.
MSS. of all these documents have been in the library of the Li
terary and Philosophical Society of this place for twenty years
past.   For the directions and description of the lead veins, which
are certainly highly valuable in     geological point of view, the
                                             a

    Sir, — The following       question has been proposed to many
philosophical persons, without obtaining any satisfactory answer,
notwithstanding the importance of the inquiry in regard to the
construction of astronomical instruments ; I therefore beg leave
to ask your readers, "What is the smallest angular space that is
perceptible to a sound unassisted eye, or to an eye assisted by
a telescope of a given power, aperture, &c. ?" — In Dr. Gre
gory's (Economy of Nature, vol. i. 238, I read,
                                                          " Opticians say
that the eye is not capable of perceiving any object which sub
tends an angle of less than half a minute of a degree : the image
on the retina is in this case less than •7-5Vfff'th part of an inch, and
the object itself, at six inches distance, less than the A 4'00dth part
of an inch broad.        All smaller objects are invisible."      Lalande
in his Astronomy says, Eight minutes, 8', are imperceptible on
a figure of a foot radius :

inches 3' 1154     lines  French.     This  is all that I have found in
answer to the above question, and this is not sufficient.            I de
sire to know also on what experiments or observations such as
sertions are founded.

to so many thousands, during the retreat from Moscow. The
effects alluded to were perfectly new to M. Desgenettes, and will
doubtless be equally so to our medical readers : " I have heard

                                      " who  were marching with every
 appearance of muscular energy and with the most decided and
 soldier-like pace, suddenly complain that a thick veil was co
 vering their eyes : those organs, at first, for an instant haggard,
 soon became immoveable : all the muscular apparatus of the
 neck, and more particularly the sterno-cleido-masto-idean          mus
 cles, became      rigid,   and   gradually   riveted  the head   on  the
 right   or left shoulder:   this rigidity next  extended  to the trunk;
  the lower extremities tottered, and the unhappy victim fell upon

                                    LIGHT.
      The Moniteur, of January 15, contained the following short
  article, by   M. Biot, "On the nature of the forces which produce
   double refraction."                                                  j
      " When a ray of light penetrates a crystal, the primitive form
  of which is neither the regular octohedron nor the cube, we ob
  serve in general that it is divided into two fasciculi unequally re
  fracted.     The one which we call the ordinary fasciculus follows
  the law of refraction discovered by- Des Cartes, and which is
  common to all crystallized and non-crystallized bodies : the other
  follows a different and more complex law: it is called the extra
  ordinary fasciculus.
/     " Huyghens has determined this last law by observation in
   the rhomboidal carbonate of lime, vulgarly called Iceland spar,
   and he has described it by a construction equally ingenious and
  precise.    By combining this fact with the general principles of
  mechanics, as Newton has combined the laws of Kepler with the
  theory of central forces ; M. Laplace deduced from it the general
  expression of the velocity of the luminous particles which com
  pose the extraordinary ray.        This expression indicates that they
  are separated from the others by a force which has emanated
  from the axis of the crystal, and which in the Iceland spar is
  found to be repulsive.
      " It was generally supposed that this was the case in all the
   other crystals endowed with double refraction. . But new experi
  ments have proved to me that in a great number the extraor
  dinary ray is attracted towards the axis instead of being repelled.
   So that with respect to this property the crystals onght to be
   divided into two classes ; the one I call double attractive refrac
  tion, and the other double repulsive refraction.          Iceland spar
   forms part of the latter : rock crystal is comprehended in the
   former.     Finally, it appeared to me, that the force, whether at
   tractive or repidsive, always emanates from the axis of the cry

236        Choak and     Fire Damp in Mines. — Electricity,
st.il, and always follows the same laws       : the formule of M.
nlace therefore apply to them always.
   " Some previous inquiries had already led me to recognise a
singular opposition in the nature of the impression which various
crystals give to light in polarizing it.           I had expressed this
opposition by the terms qxiartzous polarization and lerillated
polarization, from the substances which had first exhibited this
opposition. I have now ascertained that all the crystals en
dowed with the quartzous polarization are attractive, and all
those which exercise the bcrillated polarization are repulsive,
Iceland spar belongs to the latter class.
   " These results show that there exists in the action of crystals
upon light, the same opposition of forces which has been already
recognised in several other natural actions, such as the two kinds
of magnetism, and the two kinds of electricity.          To this also thct
other   observations   lead,  which    I have  already  published   on the
pscillations and rotations    of luminous    particles."

   Dr. Watt, of Glasgow, informs us that a Mr. Davidson, who
has been blind from childhood, is now delivering lectures in Scotr
Jand, on natural philosophy and chemistry.            The circumstances
in which he is placed have led him to adopt,in many cases, far
 more sensible modes of experimenting, and easier plans of efr
fecting his purposes, than are comnwnly employed by lecturers.
But we chiefly mention the circumstance, in the hope that it may
be the means of bringing Mr. Davidson acquainted with the So
ciety in Sunderland for preventing Accidents in Coal Mines ;
as Dr. Watt informs us, that among other contrivances he has
invented a mode of clearing mines from deleterious gases, which
for efficacy, facility, and cheapness, is preferable to any of the
methods hitherto employed.
                              ELECTRICITY.
   Monsieur    de  Nelis, an indefatigable inquirer into the pheno
mena of electricity on the continent, having favoured the Edi
tor of the Philosophical. Magazine with several valuable comT
munications,     accompanied by various specimens of electrical
results; Mr. Singer, the eminent lecturer in electricity and
Galvanism, has kindly undertaken to repeat the experiments of
M. Nelis, and to lay an account of them before the readers of
the Philosophical Magazine.         In the mean time it may not be1
amiss to state generally, that M. de Nelis has directed his atten
tion to the subject of electricity for upwards of fifteen years ;
%nd he conceives that all his experiments               demonstrate the
leading principle    of  Franklin's  theory,, namely, the existence of
                                                                  a single,

ft   single electric fluid condensed in positive bodies, and rarefied
in those which are negative.
 '
      Mr. Singer, in a communication alluding to the above experi
ments, thus expresses himself: " A great number of your readers
 are certainly not yet acquainted with these experiments, which
 have excited considerable attention on the continent.          I must
 confess I had regarded them hitherto as of inconsiderable mo
 ment ; but on examining the results now transmitted to you by
 M. de Nelis, they appear to me to merit the repetition which
 he has requested, and I propose to undertake it as soon as the
 incessant occupation which my lectures, and some researches in
 Voltaic electricity, at present supply, shall have subsided.
      "  I will then, sir, with much pleasure submit to your readers
 an account of these experiments, accompanied by such observa
 tions as their repetition may suggest."
       Mr. Thomas Forster is about to publish A Sketch of the new
  Anatomy and Physiology of the Brain and nervous System of Drs.
   Gall and Spurzheim, considered as comprehending a complete
  System of Zoonomy.          With Observations on its Tendency to the
   Improvement of Education, the Punishment of Crimes, and the
  Treatment of Insanity.       Reprinted from The Pamphleteer, with
   Additions.
      Another Edition of the London Pharmacopoeia, it is said, is
  now in great forwardness, and will probably be soon before the
  public.     Among the most important of its improvements will be
  the emetic tartar, which, we have been informed, is prepared
   according to a very elegant and simple process, contrived by
   Mr. Hume, of Long Acre ; in which the common' black su!-
  phuret of antimony is in one simple operation decomposed, yield
   ing an oxide suitable for the purpose, which requires merely to be
  washed before     it be submitted to the super tartrate of potash.
      A correspondent, H. G., desires us to state, that every vulgar
   fraction is in its lowest terms that is not divisible by the differ
   ence between its numerator and denominator, or by some sub-
   multiple of that difference.

XLIII.      On the late Plague at Malta.             By Joseph Skinner,
         lisq. late Surgeon to Prisoners of          War at Malta.
In    what way this terrible scourge was introduced into the island
of Malta,     is not to the present purpose ; but it      to be trusted
                                                                  is"
that for the future, whenever infection shall be known to prevail
on shipboard, and to hover about the vicinity of any of the Bri
tish settlements, there will be but one sentiment relative to the
precautionary measures to be adopted.          At the time of this vi
sitation Malta was substantially        British colony, although not
                                           a
declared so the Maltese, however, were not brought into that
             :                                                                          .
state which could prevent the spreading of the contagion at the
onset.     They are   a people who, being strongly attached to their
native soil, seldom migrate to make observations elsewhere.
 The history of the plague, as referring to their own island, was.
too remote to serve them as         guide
                                      a      and;   was not until many
                                                     it
of them had been swept away, that they could be made to be
lieve in the real existence of the calamity, which they mistook for
an ordinary disease.      In the interim, bigotry in all the ranks was
combined with the cupidity natural to the lower class of the
 Maltese.      The churches were as diligently attended as no mis       if
 chief could result from the contact of many individuals; the
 host was paraded with numerous followers             and visits paid to
                                                          ;
 the infected, without scruple and without hesitation,             their     by
 relatives and friends.     In this way, and       the concealment of
                                                     by
 pestilential effects, the disease not only spread through the city
 of Valletta, but was introduced into several of the casals or vil
 lages, before the strong hand of power could stay its progress.
    When these facts are considered,         will not appear surprising
                                                it
 that this dreadful scourge, which for several months devastated
 the island of Malta, and was, subsequently introduced into Gozo,
 was principally confined to the indigenous inhabitants of those
 islands.    Few of the Turks or Greeks resident at Valletta, the
 capital, were attacked,    if  we except those of the lower class of
 Greeks, who, -in common with the felons, were engaged in the
 hazardous employments which the exigencies of the occasion re
 quired.    Other foreigners were equally exempt        and the British
                                                              ;
 peculiarly so.   It  was indeed       matter of fearful wonder to the
                                          a
 Maltese, who regard all protestants as heretics*, and therefore
   * At Valletta, some years ago, during the funeral
                                                       procession of the lato
Admiral Sir A.   J.Ball, the civil commissioner, whose excellent qualities
had endeared him to every class of the inhabitants; a Maltese was heard
ro say to another, " What   a  pity that so good     man should go to hell!"

During his fatal illness the Bishop of Malta paid Sir Alexander several
visits, the drift of which may be easily conceived.     To have gained Over

the fittest Mibjects for Almighty vengeance, that of all others
they should have been most favoured under this visitation. With
the exception of two females, who had been abandoned by the
military, and were sent, with the charge of children, to the spot
destined to receive the population of the infected quarters of
Valletta; — of the wife of a serjeant of artillery who resided at
Floriana, when the disease raged with violence in that suburb ; —
and of the last fatal case at Gozo, which will be touched on
hereafter, the writer does not recollect any British who were
victims to the disease, the soldiery of one of the military corps
excepted.      At the breaking out of the plague at Valletta, many
of the British families resident there sought refuge in the coun
try.    It is highly to the honour of those who remained to face
the danger, and who were not riveted to the spot by public
employments, that they were most instrumental in checking the
propagation of the contagion, displaying, on every occasion in
which they volunteered their services to the Government, an
heroic courage and a zeal beyond all praise !
    Fort Manoel, situated opposite to Valletta, on the other side
of the Quarantaine creek, was at the beginning the receptacle of
the sick, who were, together with the remaining tenants of infected
houses, poured in from the capital in proportion as the disease
gained ground, and before pest-hospitals could be prepared for
their reception.      Huts were constructed in the sequel, to the
end that the entire population of the parts of the capital most
infected might be cleared.        These were, the Mandragio, a low,
obscure, and     crowded   quarter chiefly inhabited by market peo
ple, and another low spot in the vicinity of Fort St. Elmo.       Ee-
fore these measures could be adopted, the population of the
buildings of Fort Manoel became overcharged ; and here a par
 ticular symptom of plague, which does not appear to have been
 noticed by any writer on the subject, presented itself.       Owing
 to the stimulating quality of the pestilential virus, a furor, or
 what may be better termed a satyriasis, was induced in both the
 sexes, which required all the vigilance of the attendants to se
 parate them, and that under the most loathsome circumstances of
 the disease.    It is possible that this fact may lead hereafter to, a
 better knowledge of the specific quality of the contagious matter.
 Subtle and permeating in its nature, in attacking the vital ener
 gies, it produces that peculiar excitement in the system, which
 has been hitherto almost exclusively confined to the pathology of
 maniacal cases, and of uterine affections in females.
    Several of the Maltese medical practitioners, or as they style
 themselves professors, were selected by the Government, arid
 allowed handsome salaries, to administer to the sick who had
 been removed to Fort Manoel, '
                                     and to watch over the safety of

     Valletta, by visiting the houses where a suspicion of infection was
     entertained ; at the same time that the most prudent measures
     were adopted to prevent the concealment of disease.            For this
     purpose constant visits were paid in the respective districts into
     which the city was divided.        These districts were separated by
     barriers, to the end that each of them might be the more closely
     watched, and     aty
                        unnecessary intercourse between the inhabitant*
     prevented.     The  latter were, indeed, with the exception of such
f.   as could render themselves useful abroad, confined to their homes,
     the supplies of provisions being carried round             by
                                                                 persons ap
     pointed for that purpose.        Proclamations were issued, pointing
     out the precautions they had to observe in receiving these supplies,
     &c.     In short, every salutary and restraining measure which the
     public safety required was promptly taken            by
                                                         the Government.
        Having adverted to the Maltese practitioners, whose exertions
     for the relief of their fellow citizens were thus called forth, and
     liberally recompensed, some account of their practice — of the cu
     rative means they employed — may be expected            To come, how
     ever, at any precise knowledge of the treatment they pursued,
     baffled all the ingenuity of inquiry.      It   not but that they were

     undertook.     .Several  of  them   may, on   the other hand, be cited
     as highly accomplished in their profession *         but

     easy task for them to subdue the constitutional          timidity under
     which they laboured, on the sudden appearance of             contagious
                                                                  c\

     To follow up any thing like regular method of cure, required a
                                      a
     free and unrestrained communication           with the patients under
     their care, which they could not maintain unless exempted from
     the panic that was spread around them.            History records that
     on the breaking out of the great plague of London in 1665,
     among other instances of an heroic contempt of danger — of an
     ardent zeal in the cause of humanity, which could not be abated
      by any consideration of personal safety — Doctor Sayer declared
                                                     a
     that, braving every risk, he would attend indiscriminately the rich
     and the poor.      He persevered until the last, and escaped the
     contagion  f.    Nothing of this sort was to be heard of at Malta:
     it would  in truth appear, that every idea of systematic treatment
     yielded to the powerful impressions of fear, as well at the onset
      as when the disease raged with the greatest violence.             Even

   when, towards the close, the symptoms became milder, and the
   attacks less frequent, the same timid caution — the same dread
   of approaching the patient, so as to be enabled to direct a parti-
-
   cular attention to the symptoms of his cas^— was to be noticed *.
       In aid of the Maltese practitioners, several Turks and -Greeks
   were, at the instance of the Government, sent to Malta from
   Smyrna.     They are said to have been useful, not on account of
   any particular knowledge they possessed of the management of
   plague, but because they had been so accustomed to          and in                    it,         a
   manner seasoned, that they braved its attacks in their attend
   ance on the sick.           ,
      The attempts at plague inoculation were founded on the com
   monly received opinion, that those who have had the disease
   (and    it  presumable that this was the case with several,
                is                                                   not                       if
   with all the above individuals f,) are not again liable to infection.
   They may be less susceptible than others but        Frenchman who     :        a
   had been servant in an English family at Valletta, and who,
   having caught the plague, had been sent to Fort Manoel for cure,
  had, during his stay there, two subsequent attacks, from the latter
   of which, although     sharp one, he recovered perfectly.
                                   a
      A  Neapolitan physician, who had seen much of the plague in
   Turkey and Greece, was among the boldest of the practitioners.
   He did not hesitate to approach the sick, and to treat them
  with freedom.         was his practice to cauterize the pestilential
                           It
  tumors, and towards the close of the disease, when the inflam
  matory symptoms had subsided, to make a liberal use of cordials
  and alexipharmics.
      It remains now to pay      well merited compliment to the Bri
                                                    a
  tish medical staff, whose exertions were unfortunately required by
  the breaking out of the plague in the third garrison battalion, and
  likewise in DeRolle's regiment, consisting entirely of foreigners.
      The military pest-hospital was under the management and
  direction of Ralph Green, Esq. inspector-general        of hospitals.
      * At Valletta,    a part of the fortifications, huts were erected for such
                          in
 of the prisoners of war as had been released on the condition of their un
dertaking the tasks of swee ping the streets, white-washing infected house*,
&c. in the event of their being seized         plague.       by

The patients had every advantage which could be afforded them
by skill and science, aided by that courageous zeal which spurns
every idea of personal safety, when an imperious duty is to be
performed *.       Accordingly, the .proportion of recoveries was
much greater than that which the Maltese practice has to re
cord.     Nof any of the attendants took the infection.                 They
were made to bathe, and employed frictions of warm oil, as did
also the militarv on duty.        In addition to this latter preserva
tive, recourse was had to cold ablutions of vinegar and water.
    With the symptoms by which the plague is characterized, it
presents others, in its attack, similar to those of the endemial
causus, or bilious remitting fever, commonly styled in the Me
diterranean the fever of the country.          At the commencement it
therefore requires the same antiphlogistic treatment, by bleeding
and other evacuants, to diminish the powerful determination to the
brain, the oppression of which is among the earliest of the sym
ptoms, accompanied by stupor and delirium.              On the subsidence
of the inflammatory symptoms, the case having taken a favour
able turn, the method of cure is in either fever the same, inde
pendently of what belongs to the tumours and other characteristic
signs of plague.       The symptoms, as they have latterly presented
themselves,     and  the  treatment which appears to have been most
successful, are described by Ulstadius, who wrote on plague so
far back as the commencement of the sixteenth century                f ; and
by Sennertus, who collected all the authorities up to the middle
of the seventeenth.
    Several persons at Malta, and among others a British mer
chant, asserted that they could distinguish a glare, a peculiar
wildness of the eyes, before the individual himself in whom it
was perceived, was sensible of the attack of plague, and while
he was still following his usual occupations.           The writer had to
witness the effect of a sudden attack in a Maltese, who had pro
ceeded, apparently in good health, as far as the Conservatory
square at Valletta, when his progress was in a moment arrested.
He had just sufficient strength to maintain himself in an erect
posture ; but was obliged to be supported on either side when
    *The following melancholy fact is a proof, among others, that an ardent
 desire to procure information willi a view to benefit mankind, vviil some
 times carry ail individual beyond the prescribed limit of his duty.       Dr.
 MacAdam, physician to the forces, was sent by the governor of Malta to
Gozo, to direct the means to be employed in the ease of the plague break
ing out among the military stationed there. He was particularly enjoined
not to incur any personal risk, his being a task of mere superintendatice.
His anxiety, however, to acquire a precise knowledge of the nature of the
 disease, led him to pay frequent visits to the pest-hospital, where at length
 he caught the infection, and was the last victim of the scourge whipb. so
 long ravaged the islands of Malta and Gozo.

 His eyes were downcast, his countenance pallid, and there was
an expression of anxious terror which sufficiently explained the
 quality of the attack.
      Notwithstanding all that had been advanced in their favour by
various writers, and more especially by Messrs. Baldwin and
 Thornton ; and in spite of the example of the oil-carriers in
 Africa, who are represented as enjoying an immunity from plague;
 the frictions of warm oil had not, on the breaking out of that
 disease at Malta, all the credit which an after experience showed
 them to deserve.       This will not appear surprising, when it is con
 sidered that several late medical writers have spoken with con
 siderable hesitation on the subject.          After the numerous trials
 made at Valletta, and elsewhere in Malta, these frictions, if pro
 perly applied*, may be pronounced to be an almost certain pro
 phylactic. It is a justice due to a very intelligent young man,
 Mr. Thornton, assistant deputy paymaster to the forces, and
 nephew to our minister of that name, to state that, with his
 uncle's book in his hand, he was the first strenuously to recom
 mend their employment, at the breaking out of the contagion.
 Among those who wrought zealously in this cause, Mr. Matthew
  Fletcher, a British merchant, was foremost and indefatigable.
  Whenever a case of plague came to his knowledge, he hastened
  to the spot, beseeching the inmates of the dwelling, by whom a
  free communication with the infected individual had been kept
  up, to have instant recourse to the frictions, and supplying the
  means where these were deficient.           The happy result was, that,
  on the plague ceasing, he was possessed of a long list of the
  cases he had recorded, in not one of which a failure was to be
  found ; at the same time that, where this preservative was not
  employed, it was usual to see the disease spread from one indi
  vidual to another who herded together, until the whole were
  ?wept away.       A few instances of the beneficial effects of the oil
  frictions, as tried at Valletta, will suffice, so as to banish all scep
  ticism on the subject.       In a family consisting of seven individuals
  and a female servant, the father and eldest son, who had both
  been assiduous in attending the host, and had besides visited a
  relation labouring under plague, were attacked, and died pretty
  nearly at the same time.          On the first alarm the frictions were
  employed by the rest of the family, and all escaped, although
   they had communicated freely with the unfortunate victims of
   the disease.     A French cutler, who had the same number of
      *  Every part of the body having been well cleansed with water, or with
  vinegar and water, the frictions are applied witli a sponge, as warm as they
   can well be borne, the eyes being closed to protect them from irritation.
  This is repeated at least twice a week, wearing the same linen between the
   frictions.
                                                                    children,

children, had married his eldest daughter to a person who took"
the plague of the next door neighbour, as did likewise the second
daughter of the family.          The two sickened about the same time,
and these akso were fatal cases : but the remainder of the family,
who had had recourse to the oil frictions as soon as the nature
of the attacks was ascertained, escaped, without excepting the
wife of the young man, who was then in the middle of her preg
nancy, and who attended her husband during the few hours he
survived the attack.          A Maltese with a large family took a sick
brother into his house, not suspecting that he laboured under
the plague, and paid him unhesitatingly every affectionate at
tention.       The instant this came to the knowledge of Mr. Iliff,
apothecary to the forces, to whom the Maltese in question had
formerly been a servant, the oil frictions were sent in and em
ployed.       The infected individual died, but the whole of the fa
mily escaped.          It is needless to cite any other cases, although
many similar ones might be adduced.                  The confidence of the
Government of Malta, in the efficacy of these frictions, was at
length so great, that a shed was erected at each of the barriers
pf Valletta, for the purpose of administering them to the guards
stationed there, and to the market people and others whose avo
cations kept them abroad.
    Alexis, the Piedmontese, who travelled every where in search
of secrets, has published a .variety of receipts for plague, into
the composition of several of which storax enters.                   The writer
was solicitous to make a trial of this substance, which unluckily
was not to be found at Malta, either in the concrete state ia
which it is called storax calami ta, or in its liquid state*.                  It
was certainly, as the event proved, deserving such an essay, and
was susceptible of various modifications in its use.                  What has
been sanctioned by a long experience deserves credit, unless there
be incontrovertible evidence to prove that the notion originally
entertained of its effiacy was founded in error.               A Turk, whose
knowledge        of  the  subject   was  by  no  means    limited,   distributed
among      his  friends at Valletta lumps      of a  black   substance    resem
bling shoemaker's wax, which he had brought with him from
Constantinople, and in the composition of which storax was the
principal ingredient.          These were either to be carried on a stick
and smelt to from time to time, or kept in the hand and con
stantly moulded, to the end, no doubt, that a portion of the sub
stance might adhere to the fingers.                 They were sought after
with avidity.         Now, it is to be observed that both the Seraglio
eakes, and a particular description of beads of a great price m

     more in view than to supply an ornament in the case of the
    former, and in that of the latter, an object of pastime, in which
    light the generality of the Turks, who are in the constant habit
    of twirling them about with the fingers, regard beads.
        Common tar, a bituminous substance which may be considered
    as in some degree analogous to storax, although it does -not
    possess its peculiar fragrance, was employed by a Greek «vhose
    very hazardous task it was to bury the dead.         With this sub
    stance he kept his hands and arms anointed.         He was pointed
    out to the writer by Mr. Thomas, garrison surgeon, and acting
    superintendant of health, as having officiated with impunity in
    this way during the whole of the time that the plague raged ;
    while the greater part of those who were similarly employed had
    been swept off by the contagion.      In this instance it would ap
    pear, that the pores of the parts exposed to contact with the dead
    bodies. were sheathed by the tar, so as to prevent the absorption
    of the plague matter; but in an old work entitled " The Eng
    lish Housewife," described by Beloe in his Anecdotes of literature
    and scarce books, another application is made of that substance
    as a preservative against plague.    It is recommended " to smell
    to a nosegay made of the tasselled end of a ship-rope," that is,
    of a tarred rope.     Here something is implied of a specific quality
    of the tar, as a plague preventative ; and this application of
    it agrees with that of the storax as employed by the Turks.

    XLIV. Some Account of the Island of Teneriffe. By the Hon.
      Henry Grey Bennet, M.P. F.R.S. Pres. Gent. Society*.
    The     island of Teneriffe is the principal island t)f the seven in
    the Western ocean, that are called generally by the name of the
    Canaries.     It lies north-east by south-west, and is in length from
    the Punta del Hidalgo to the Montana Roxa, its northern and
    southern extremities, about 70 English miles ; its greatest breadth
    not exceeding 30.        The superficies may be considered as con
    taining 80 square leagues.
       The island narrows at its north-eastern and widens consider
    ably at its south-western extremity,        About the centre of the
    hitter, or, perhaps,   to describ'e more accurately, to the westward of
    the central point, is the mouutain called by the Spaniards El Pico

              Some Account   of the Island of Teneriffe.           249
di'Tiede, but better known by the name of the Peak ofTeneriffe,
and which is the highest land not only in the island, but in all
the Canaries; the mean of various observations making it 12,500
feet above the level of the sea.    It is visible at a great distance ;
we saw it perfectly distinct thirty-four leagues off by chronome-
trical observation, when it appeared rising like a cone from the
bed of the ocean ; and I have heard that it has been clearly di
stinguished at a distance of 45 leagues.
    The rocks arid strata of the island ofTeneriffe are wholly vol
canic ; a long chain of mountains, which may be termed the
central chain, traverses the island from the foot of the second-
region of the peak sloping down on the eastern, western, and
northern sides, to the sea.      Towards the south, or more pro
perly    the SSW.   the  mountains   are nearly perpendicular ; and,
though broken into ridges and occasionally separated by deep
ravines that are cut transversely as well as longitudinally, there
are none of those plains nor that gradual declination of strata
that the south-eastern and north-western          sides of the island
exhibit.
    From the Barranco Seco, in the neighbourhood of Santa Cruz,
to the northerly point called Punta del Hidalgo, a series of steep
and abrupt mountains form headlands to the sea, separated from
the central chain by the valley of Laguna; these mountains are
rugged and peaked, drawn up, if the term may be used, in a co
lumn, and are divided by* deep ravines.           The sides of these
mountains are steep, being in many places cut nearly perpendw
cular to the horizon, and are all composed of lava generally of the
basaltic formation, mixed with beds of tufa and pumice.           From
 Hidalgo point to that of Teno, the most westerly point of the
island, the strata vary from beds of pumice and decomposed lava
 and ash, which form the plains of Laguna Ticaronle and Songal,
to streams and currents and headlands of lava similar to those of
the Barranco Hundo, San Ursula, Las Horcas, and Las Guan-
 ckas.     The slope from the central chain is here gradual, inter
 sected by ravines and streams of lava.         The soil, famed for its
 fertility and which produces the Teneriffe wine, is composed of
 iava and ash in a state of decomposition.         Headlands, some of
 them from two to three hundred feet in height, project into the
 sea between San Ursula and Orotava, forming perpendicular
 cliffs.   At the western extremity of the island from Punta di
  Teno to Puerto de los Christianas, the strata rise in a broken
 ridge to the Peak, the land ascending gradually from Punta dc
  Teno by a chain of small peaked hills; the point itself being
 very low and projecting as a promontory into the sea.         The de
 clination of the strata is similar from the Peak to Puerto de los
  Christianas. This south-westerly • chain is broken into many
                                                                 abrupt

250           Some Account       of the Island of Teneriffe.
abrupt ridges, and is cut nearly perpendicular down to the sea.
I could not perceive any base or shelf as on the other sides of
the Peak, from which the cone arose, but the fall is regular
though steep.      From Puerto d$ /os Christia?ws to Santa Cruz,
comprising the southern and south-eastern sides of the island,
the form is similar to that in the vicinity of Orotava ; but it i?
barren and desolate, laid waste by streams of lava.             In the short
space of a few leagues I counted        no  less than  seven    cones of ex
tinct volcanoes, and the country is covered with scoria, exhibit
ing no appearance of culture, and hardly any of vegetation; it is
more broken into ravines and more intersected by lava torrents
than on any of the other sides of the island.           Numerous peaked
and conical mountains rise upon the slope of the chain, and the
whole country is covered by scoria, and is one continued stream
of lava. The Montana Roxa itself is a singular example of the
dislocation of strata so commonly found in countries of volcanic
formation ; it is evidently a slip or fall of semi-columnar lava,
and slopes into the sea at a highly inclined angle.
    The ordinary strata of the island are as follows, reckoning
from below upwards : 1st, the porphyritic lava covered by scoria
and sometimes by pumice.          This lava is composed of hornblende
and feldspar, and contains no other substance.              The next stra
tum graduates into what the Spaniards call roccaverde or green
stone, and is composed of feldspar and hornblende ; upon this is
generally a thick stratum of pumice, and last of all towards the
 surface is the basaltic lava covered also by tufa and ash.              This
 lava decomposes the soonest.            It also contains the greatest
variety of extraneous substances, and is sometimes divided by a
layer of large crystals of olivine some inches long, and towards
the north-east is often intersected by strata of porphyritic slate.
These lavas are more earthy and cellular than those which I have
had an opportunity of observing elsewhere, yet they contain fewer
extraneous substances than those of iEtna and Vesuvius ; they
are in some places exposed to view in the vallevs similar to those
of the Corral in the island of Madeira. The valley of Las
 Gwmchas on the north-west side of the Peak, contains according
to M. Escolar* above 100 strata of lava, the one reposing upon
the other, at times alternating with pumice and tufa.                    The
depth of these strata varies.       M. Escolar has seen one of basaltie
lava between 100 and 150 feet in depth in one solid mass, cel
lular at the surface, but gradually becoming more compact to-

political, commercial and mineialogical state of the Canaries : he has well
performed his task, and it is to be regretted that the situation of his native

 to communicate.
                                                                        wards

              Some Account    of the Island of Teneriffe.            251
wards the bottom. This basaltic lava contains olivine and horn
blende, and, in the caves on the coast, zeolite.        This substance
is also found in stalactites and in masses, sometimes in layers
spread between the strata and diffused over the rock.
    Nodules of chalcedony are sometimes also found ; but these
substances occur onlv in the chain of mountains towards the
north-east, from the northern extremity of Santa Cruz to the
point of Hidalgo.
    The lavas of the island are of an endless variety, and the num
ber of streams that have flowed are much beyond all enumera
tion. The whole surface is either ash, or solid or decomposed
lava, which seems again and again to have been perforated by
volcanic eruptions ; the number of small extinct volcanoes is
prodigious, they are to be found in all parts of the island, but
the stream that has flowed from even the largest of them, such
as the lava of the Peak called     El   Mai Pais, is trifling in com
parison with that immense mass of lava mountains which con
stitute the central chain of the island, and which stretch out as
headlands like those of Las Horcas and San Ursula.
    I never found in situ those masses of columnar basaltic rock
that are so common in the island of Madeira : but in the valley
 of Las E\peranzas, in the chain of hills to the north -eastward
of the town of Santa Cruz, they He scattered about in consider
 able numbers, and M. Escolar told me that he had seen strata
of them to a considerable extent, exhibiting with precision the
 columnar basaltic form : the modern lavas of .the peak are all
basaltic, that of 1704 is decidedly so, as well as that of 1798,
 though not exhibiting any prismatic form. Prisms of basaltic
 lava are yet found on the peak : I picked up one, though t here
 are no strata of them to be met with.       The metals are rare, and
 afford but little variety: specular and micaceous iron, black and
grey manganese are all that have hitherto been discovered.
 The salts that are so common on Vesuvius, are here seldom met
 with. Augite is also rare, and mica and leucite, though care
fully sought after, have hitherto not been found.
    In that part of the island between Lagana and Tacaronle,
where there are few streams of lava, the soil is evidently volcanic.
 I examined many of the clods that were turned up by the plough,
 and found them all alike : they contained much strong clav, with
 crystals of feldspar, olivine, and specular iron.     Dr. Gillan, who
 accompanied     Mr. Barrow   and  Sir G. Staunton,   has  advanced an
 opinion, that between Laguna and Malanzos there are no signs
 of volcanic formation.     That the currents of lava occur but sel
 dom is most true ; but the mountains in the vicinity of Laguna
 are all volcanic, and one has a visible crater : besides, the as sertion
 would prove too much ; for it would go to maintain that the

  2J2          Some Account      of the Island of Taieriffe.
 Campagna Felice, as well as the plains of Catania, were not
 created by the ash and pumice eruption of Vesuvius and iEtna.
  The bed of soil is here very deep. I examined some ravines that
 the rains had laid open to the depth of 30 or 40 feet : the strata
 were indurated at the bottom, and resembled the tufa in the vi
  cinity of Naples, and all contained the substances mentioned
 above.    This tufaceous character changes as you ascend the hill
  that separates Laguna from Santa Cruz ; the hill itself, and the
 whole neighbourhood of the latter city, is one continued stream
 of lava, hardly at all decomposed, with little or no vegetation';
 but here and there in the hollows some few stunted plants of
 the aloe algarvensis, and the cytisus.
     Having given a general account of the island, I shall now at
 tempt to describe the country of the peak, which mountain I
 ascended on the 16th of September 1 S 1 0. The road from Puerto
 Orotava to the city of Orotava is a gradual and easy slope for
 three or four miles, through a highly cultivated country.           The
 soil is composed    of  volcanic ash  and earth, and  to  the  eastward
 of the town of Puerto di Orotava are the remains of a recent vol
 cano, the crater and cone being distinctly visible.        Leaving the
 town of Orotava, after a steep ascent of about an hour through a
 deep ravine, we quitted the cultivated part of the slope or valley
 and entered into a forest of chesnuts ; the trees are here of a
 large size.   This forest of chesnuts is mixed with the erica ar-
 lorea, or tree heath, which shrub rises to the height of 1 8 or 20
 feet.   Some of the stems are as thick as the arm of a man, joined
 together in bunches or tufts like the common heath.           The form
 of this forest is oblong, it covers the flank of those hills which     I
 have already denominated the central chain, from their summit
 to half their elevation from the plain.     The soil here is deep, and
formed of decomposed lava, small ash, and pumice.            1 examined
several channels in the strata or ravines worn by the rains, and
there was no appearance of any other rock.         Leaving this forest,
the track passes over a series of green hills which we traversed
in about two hours, and at last halted to water our mules at a
spot called   El  barranco del pino de la meruenda, where there is
a small spring of bad and brackish water issuing from a lava
rock. The ravine is of considerable depth.         After the vegetable
earth, which is two or three feet deep, a layer of tufa succeeds,
which is followed by a lava of a greyish-blue colour, 30 or 40
feet in depth.     It is compact, contains olivine, and the strata
lap over   each  other, but show no appearance of columnar for
mation.      The range of green hills extends a mile or two further,
the soil shallowing by degrees, more lava and scoria showing
themselves on the surface, the ravines or channels, worn by the
rains, becoming more common, the trees and shrubs gradually
                                                              dwindling

             Some Account    of the Island ofTeneriffie.          253
 dwindling in size, and of them all the Spanish brodm alone at
 length covers the ground.      Leaving behind us this range of green
 hills, the track still ascending leads for several hours across a.
 steep and difficult mass of lava rock, broken here and there into
 strange and fantastic forms, worn into deep ravines, and scantily
 covered in places by a thin layer of yellow pumice.     The surface
 of the country, for miles and miles around, is one continuous
 stream of lava ; the rents or ravines of which seem to be formed
 partly by the torrents from the hills flowing for so. many ages,
 and partly from that tendency, characteristic of a lava current,
 to keep itself up in embankments, and in its cooling process to
open out into those hollows which I have uniformly found in
every eruption of lava that I have had an opportunity of exami
ning. This lava is cellular beyond any I have ever seen, is of a
 clayey earthy porphyritic composition, and contains few, if any,
pieces of olivine, though here and there felspar in a semicrystal-
lized form.      As we proceeded on our road, the hills on our left,
though broken at times in deep ravines, gradually rose in height
till the summits were lost in those of the central chain, while on
our right we were rapidly gaining an elevation above the lower
range of the peak.       This range forms one flank of the plain or
valley of Orotava, stretching from south-east to north-west, and
is broken into steep precipices, cut down in some places perpen
dicular to the horizon, and called Las Horcas ; it joins the cen
tral chain at the high elevation of the pumice plains, sweeps-
down the side of the valley, and forms a headland near 200 feet
high projecting into the sea, some miles from Orotava : we tra
versed this country an hour or two, till we reached the point of
intersection of las Horcas with the plains of pumice.        On the
road are several small conical hills or mouths of extinct vol
canoes, the decomposed lava on the edges of these craters having
a strong red ochreous tint ; by degrees the lava becomes more
and more covered by a small ash, and the masses or heaps of
pumice gradually increase, till the surface is completely con
cealed.     At length an immense undulated plain spreads itself
like a fan, on all sides, nearly as far as the eye can reach, and
this plain is bounded on the west south-west, and south south
west, by the regions of the- peak; and on the east and north
east by a range of steep perpendicular precipices and mountains,
many leagues in circumference, called by the Spaniards Las
Faldas.      M. Escolar informed me that the wall could be traced
for many leagues, the whole circumference of which evidently
formed the side of an immense crater.        This tract, called Las
 Canales, contains, according to   the same authority, twelve square
leagues.     As we entered this plain, from the south-west, there
                                                                  are

crater.    There is here no appearance of columnar formation,
the lava being earthy and porphyritic : this continuity of wall,
at present so easy to be traced, may be considered as forming
the sides of one immense crater, from which perhaps originally
the lavas of the island flowed, which might have thrown up the
cone of the peak, and covered these wide-spreading plains or
clanuras with the deep beds of ashes and pumice.         On this plain
or desert, for we had long left all show of vegetation, except a
few stunted plants of Spanish broom, a sensible change was felt
in the atmosphere ; the wind was keen and sharps and the cli
mate like that of England in the months of autumn.            All here
was sad, silent, and solitary.      We saw at a distance the fertile
plains on the coast, lying as it were under our feet, and affording
a cheerful contrast to the scenes of desolation with which we
were surrounded ; we were already 7 or 8000 feet above the level
of the sea, and had reached the bottom of the second region of
the peak.      Immense masses of lava, some of them many hun
dred tons in weight, lie scattered on these pumice plains.       Some
are broken by their fall, and all wear the appearance of having
been projected by volcanic force.          Their composition is uni
formly porphyritic,       with large  masses  of feldspar ; the whole
compact and heavy, and bearing no resemblance to the earthy
lava we had seen in such abundance prior to our entering these
pumice plains.        Many of these masses are completely vitrified,
while others only show marks of incipient vitrification ; but from
their site and fracture, from the insulated state in which they
lie, from there being no appearance of lava in a stream, from the
pumice bed being very deep, (and in one place I saw it exposed
to a depth of between 20 and 30 feet) from all these facts taken
together, there can be little doubt that these masses were thrown
out of the mountain when that lava flowed, which is of similar
substance, and which is called by the Spaniards El Mai Pais.
    Having reached the end of the plain we found ourselves at the
bottom of a steep hill, at the foot of which is a mass or current
of lava which has flowed from the higher regions of the peak,
and which constitutes the eastern branch of the lava of Mai Pais.
 We began to ascend this steep and rapid part of the mountain,
which is composed of a small white or yellowish ash mixed with
masses of pumice and fragments of lava similar to that found in
the plains, of which several small pieces that I picked up were
 in a state of vitrification. After a laborious not to say hazardous
ascent of about an hour, the pumice and ash giving way and the
                                                                  mule

               Some Account    of the Island ofTenerijfe.             255
mule sinking knee deep at each step, we arrived at about five
in the afternoon at the other extremity of the stream of lava,
which descending from the summit of the second region of the
peak divides at the foot of the cone into two branches, the one
running to the north-east and the other to the north north-west :
at the extremity of this latter are several immense blocks or
masses of lava which bear the name of La Estancia di los In-
gleses, and are rocks, not caves as has been stated by some
writers.     It was here we were to pass the night : so, lighting a
fire made of the dry branches of the Spanish broom, and stretch
ing part of a sail over a portion of the rock, we ate our dinner
and laid ourselves down to sleep.           I however passed the best
part of the night by the fire, the weather being piercing cold :
as I stood by the fire the view all around me was wild and terri
fic ; the moon rose about ten at night, and though in her third
quarter gave sufficient light to show the waste and wilderness by
 which we were surrounded : tin; peak and the upper regions
 which we had yet to ascend towered awfully above our heads,
while below, the mountains that had appeared of such a height
in the morning, and had cost us a day's labour to climb, lay
 stretehed as plains at our feet : from the uncommon rarity of the
 atmosphere the whole vault of heaven appeared studded with in
 numerable stars, while the valleys of Orotava were hidden from
 our view by a thin^veil of light fleecy clouds, that floated far be
 neath the elevated spot we had chosen for our resting-place : the
 solemn stillness of the night was only interrupted by the crack
 ling of the fire round which we stood, and by the whistling of
 the wind, which coming in hollow gusts from the mountain re
 sembled the roar of distant cannon.
     Between two and three in the morning we resumed on foot
 our ascent of the same pumice mountain, the lower part of which
 we had climbed on horse-back the preceding evening : the ascent
 became however much more rapid and difficult, our feet sinking
 deep in the ashes at every step.       From the uncommon sharpness
 of the acclivity we were obliged to stop often to take breath ;
  after several halts we at last reached the head of the pumice hill
  at its point of intersection with the two streams of lava, the di
  rection of which I have before described.        This is the commence
  ment   of that division of the mountain    called  El Mai Pais. After
  resting some short time here, we began to climb the stream of
  lava, stepping from mass to mass : the ascent is steep, painful and
  hazardous ; in some places the stream of lava is heaped up in
  dykes or embankments, and we were often obliged to clamber
  over them as one ascends a- steep wall.         This lava is of the same
  porphyritic appearance     as the  masses   we  found in the plains;.it
  is not covered with a thick scoria, and seems never to liave been

-256             Some Account     of the Island of Tenerijfe.
 in   a very fluid state, but to have rolled along     in large masses.
 The feldspar     is crystallized in the lava itself, which is slightly
.cellular at its surface ; yet though I searched carefully I was un
  able to discover any extraneous substance.         The whole compo
  sition 6f the stream seems to be felspar imbedded in a brown
  clayey paste, remarkably hard, of a close texture and heavy :
 judging from the sharp declivity of the mountain, it appears sur
 prising that the lava should have flowed so short a distance ; as
  it does not exceed two and a half or three miles from the base of
  the cone to the point of union with the pumice hill. The mass of
  lava as well as its depth is prodigious ; M. Escolar told me that
  its greatest breadth was above two miles, its depth it is not easy
  to determine : there are however several ravines or valleys in the
  course of the stream, some of which may be from 60 to 100 feet
  deep.     The fusion of the mass does not appear to have been
  perfect ; it is very earthy, and though vitrified pieces are found,
  there is no general appearance of vitrification : there are some
  pieces that exhibit an- union with the pumice and the gradation
  from the stony structure to the vitrified, and thence to pumice.
   Immense heaps of this latter lie scattered on the surface of the
  lava, some of them containing large crystals of felspar, which
  abounds in, or more properly forms the constituent part of, the
  lava of the Mai Pah.
      We halted several times during the ascent, and at last reached
  a spot called La Cueva, one of the numerous caves that are found
  on the sides of the mountain : this is the largest of them, and
  is filled with snow and the most delicious water, which was just
  at the point of congelation: the descent into it is difficult, it being
  thirty or forty feet deep. One of our party let himself down by
  a rope : he could not see the extent of the cave, but the guides
  declared it to be 300 feet in length and to contain thirty or forty
  feet of water in depth: the roof and sides are composed of a firm
  stalactitic lava similar to that found on Vesuvius, and it is of the
  same nature as that which flowed on the surface.       We rested here
  about half an hour, during which we had an opportunity of ob
  serving the rising of the sun, and that singular and rapid change
  of night into day, the consequence of almost an entire absence
  of twilight. As we ascended the north-east side of the moun
  tain this view was strikingly beautiful: at first there appeared a
. bright streak of red on the horizon,       which gradually spread i'.-
  self, lighting up the heavens by degrees, and growing brighter
  and brighter till at last the sun burst forth from the bed of the
  ocean, gilding as it rose the mountains of Teneriffe and those of
  the great Canary : in a short time the whole country to the
  eastward lay spread out as a map, the great Canary was easily to
  be distinguished ; and its rugged and mountainous character, si
                                                                    milar

                Some Account of the Island of Tenerijfe.        257
milar to that of the other islands, became visible to the naked
eye.     The cold at this time was intense, the wind keen and
strong, and the thermometer sunk to 32 degrees : after a short
though rapid ascent we reached the summit of the second stage
of the mountain, we passed over a small plain of white pumice
on which were spread masses of lava, and at length arrived at
the foot of the cone.     This division of the mountain forms what
is generally termed the Peak of Tenerijfe ; it resembles the pre
sent crater of Vesuvius, with this difference, however, that while
the surface of that mountain -is composed of a black cinder or
ash, the superficies of this appears to be a deposit of pumice of
a white colour, of scoria and of lava, with here and there consi
derable masses that were probably thrown out when the volcano
was in action.      Towards the north-west on the right hand of our
ascent, there is a small current of lava showing itself above the
pumice, the composition of which is similar to that at the bot
tom, though of a redder tinge ; it is broken on the surface, and
is in a rapid state of decomposition.      Numerous small cavities
on the side of the mountain emitted vapour with considerable
heat.      Here begins, in my opinion, the only fatiguing part of
the ascent ; the steepness of the cone is excessive,, at each step
our feet sunk into the ash, and large masses of pumice and lava
rolled down from above,; we were all bruised, and our feet and
legs were cut, but none materially hurt : at last we surmounted
 all difficulties, and seated ourselves on the highest ridge of the
mountain.        This uppermost region does not appear to contain
in superficies more than an acre and an half; it is composed of a
 lava similar to that on its sides, though decomposed and changed
white or grey by the action of the sulphurous acid : this acre and
 an half is itself a small crater, the walls of which are the dif
 ferent points on which we sat, and are plainly visible from below.
 Within, the lava is in the most rapid state of decomposition ;
 losing its brown colour and shade of red, and acquiring a whitish
 grey almost the colour of chalk ; large masses of sulphur are
 depositing, which are crystallized in minute though distinct
 forms ; there is also a coating of alum produced by the union of
 the sulphurous acid with the argil of the lava; the surface is hot
 to the feet, and the guides said it was dangerous to remain
 long in one spot : as it was, some of us sunk to our knees in the
 hot deposit of sulphur : upon striking the ground with the feet
the sound is hollow, similar to what is produced by the same im
 pulsion on the craters of Vesuvius and Solfalerra.       I estimate
 the depth of the crater to be, from the highest ridge to the bot
 tom about 200 feet, forming an easy and gradual descent, the
 whole being in a state of rapid decomposition, and charged with
 sulphur, large masses of which are every where depositing.         I

searched in vain for any of the arseniats so common on Vesuvius*
nor could I find those siliceous stalactites resembling strung pearls,
which are met with in the island of Ischia, in the crater of the
Solfaterra, and in the Maremma of Tuscany^               The sulphur is
pure and fine,   and is sold for a considerable   price at Orotava.   We
were hot able to go all round the walls or exterior summit of the
crater, and hence could      not distinguish   its southern or western
declivity; M. Escolar assured me they are similar to, though
more rapid than, the side by which we ascended : from this side
flowed the basaltic lavas of 1704, and of the last eruption in
 1797: this latter stream of lava flowed in a remarkably slow
current ; for notwithstanding the sharp descent of the mountain,
and the length of the lava not exceeding three miles, several
days elapsed before it reached the spot where it stopped.            How
little fluid this lava must have been is evident, when it is re
membered that the lava of Vesuvius, in 1794, which destroyed
Torre del Greco, reached the sea from the bottom of the cone,
a distance of eight miles, in little more than six hours.         M. Es
colar further told me that there is on this south-western side of
the peak an ancient lava, at present not at all decomposed, of
several miles in length, and in a perfect state of vitrification ; the
whole of this stream has the appearance of obsidian.            All these
lavas appear to have flowed from the bottom of the cone, and to
have run from its base in the same manner as that of Vesuvius
in 1/94, the crater of which vomited out ash and pumice, and
large pieces of rock, while the current of lava issuedTrom its
side.     It is not however improbable that the cone itself is of
anterior formation to this vitrified lava, as the summit of the
Peak is similar to the lava of the Mai Pais, and that being por-
phyri'tic is considered as of more ancient date than the one above
mentioned, which is basaltic.
    If one might hazard a conjecture upon a subject where the
data are so few, I should be inclined to suspect that the Peak it
self, as well as" the whole of the country around it which forms
its base, were produced by that immense crater Called Las Ca-
nales, the shape and magnitude of which I have before taken
notice of when traversing the pumice plains : it is also well
worthy of remark, that there is no volcano in action at all to be
compared in size of crater to those that are extinct.            The an
 cient crater of Vesuvius is considerably larger than the present,
and those in the vicinity of Naples, the eruptions of which pro
 bably created that district of Italy, are of enormous extent.
 The crater of the Camaldoli is somewhat more than two leagues
 in circumference, and the superficies of the Canales is estimated
 at twelve square leagues. These vast craters were probably ca
 pable of ejecting from their bosom tapse stupendous beds of

             Some Account    of the Island of Teneriffe.          259
lava, which being so much more extensive than any that have
flowed from more recent eruptions have led some persons to
deny the former to be the effects of a central fire-.   That all the
island of Teneriffe was volcanically produced, no man who ex
amines it can have any doubt: and though the smallness of the
existing crater of the Peak may lead one to imagine that it alone
could not be the effective cause of all the phenomena, yet the in
numerable volcanoes on all sides of the island, the appearance ef
Las Canales, and its elevation, are able to account for the ex
tent of the streams and beds of lava, and of the deposits of tufa
and pumice, of which the island is composed.        Having no data
to proceed upon but what is given by the measurement of the
eye, it is not easy to determine the magnitude of the cone at its
base; one may say at a venture, it is about three miles in cir
cumference, though towards the SSW the descent is much more
 abrupt, and the plain from which the cone springs not percepti
ble.    The view from the summit is stupendous; we could plainly
discover the whole form of the island, and we made out distinctly
three or four of the islands, which together are called the Ca
naries ; we could not however see Lancerotte or kuerteventura,
though we were told that other travellers had distinguished
them all.
    From this spot the central chain of mountains that runs from
south-west to north-east is easily to be distinguished.        These
with the succession of fertile and woody valleys, commencing
from San Urstda and ending at Las Horcas, with the long line
of precipitous lava rocks that lay on the right of our ascent, and
which traverse that part of the island, running from east to west
from their point of departure at the Canales to where they end
in an abrupt headland on the coast, with their forests and villages
and vineyards, the port with the shipping in the roads, the towns
of Orotava with their spires glittering as the morning sun burst
upon them, afforded a cheerful contrast to the streams of lava,
the mounds of ash and pumice, and the sulphurated rock on
 which we had taken our seat. The sensation of extreme height
was in fact one of the most extraordinary 1 ever felt; and though
 I did not find the pain in my chest arising from the rarity of
the atmosphere, near so acute as on the mountains of Switzer
 land, yet there was a keenness in the air independent of the cold
that created no small uneasiness in the lungs.        The respiration
 became short and quick, and repeated halts were    found  necessary.
 The idea also of extreme height was to me more determinate .and
 precise than on the mountains of Switzerland ; and though the
 immediate objects of vision were not so numerous, yet as the
 ascent is more rapid, the declivity sharper, and there is here no
 mountain like Mont Blanc towering above you, the 12000 feet

 above the level 'of the sea appeared considerably more than a
 similar elevation above the lake of Geneva.              We remained at
 the summit about three quarters of an hour, our ascent had cost
 us a labour of four hours, as we left the Estancia at ten minutes
 before three and reached the top of the Peak before seven ; many
 indeed of our halts were needless, and M. Escolar told me that he
 had twice ascended to the summit in somewhat less than three
 hours.    Our thermometer, which was graduated to the scale of
  Fahrenheit, was during our ascent as follows : at Orotava at eight
 in the morning, 74° ; at six in the evening at La Estancia, 50° ;
 at one in the following morning, 423 ; at La Cueva at half-past
 four, 32'; at the bottom of the cone, 36' ; at the top of the
  Peak one Hour and a half after sun-rise, 38'. The descent down
  the cone is difficult from its extreme rapidity, and from the fall
 of large stones which loosen themselves from the beds of pumice.
  Having at last scrambled to the bottom, we pursued our march
  down the other course of the lava, that is to say down its westerly
 side, having ascended its eastern.          The ravines and rents in this
  stream of lava are deeper and more formidable ; the descent into
 them was always painful and troublesome, often dangerous, In
 some places we let ourselves down from rock to rock.                  I can
 form no opinion why there          should  be  these strange irregularities
 in th« surface of this lava ; in places it resembles what sailors
 term the trough of the sea, and I can compare it to nothing but
 as if the sea in a s/torm had by some force become oh a sudden
 stationary, the waves retaining their swell.             As we again ap
 proached     La   Cueva   there  is a  singular steep valley, the depth of
 which   from     its  two  walls   cannot   be less than 100 to 150 feet,
 the lava lying in broken ridges one upon the other similar to the
 masses of granite rock that time and decay have tumbled down
 from the top of the Alps ; and, except from the scoria or what
 Milton calls " the Fiery Surge," they in no degree bear the
 marks of having rolled as a stream of liquid matter.             This cur
 rent like that    of the  eastward    branch   has  no resemblance to any
iavas I have seen elsewhere, it is hardly at all decomposed, full
 of lamine of feldspar, the fracture conchoidal, and the texture
 porphyritic, the colour brown like that of the other branch ; it
 is but slightly cellular, and contains no extraneous substances.
     We descended the pumice hill with great rapidity almost at a
 run, and arrived at La Estancia in little more than two hours.
 We then mounted our mules, and following the track by which
 we had ascended the preceding day, we reached about four
 o'clock the country house of our hospitable friend Mr. Barry.
     The difficulties of this enterprise have been much exaggerated :
 the ascent on foot is not a labour of more than four hours at
 most, and the whole undertaking not to be compared in point
                                                                           of

 That the ascent must be hazardous in a storm of hail and snow
 there can be no doubt, but to cross Salisbury plain may some
 times be dangerous.      Yet stripped of poetical terrors and di
vested of the eloquent description of some writers, there is per
haps no mountain in Europe, the ascent of which does not fur
nish more difficulties than the Peak of Teneriffe.

    Power; with a Description of a Galvanic Clock.                  By
    Francis Ronalds, Esq. of Hammersmith.
                            To  Mr.   Tilloch.
           I
 Sir, — send you a drawing and description of a contrivance
for applying the electricity of M. De Luc's column to the mo
tion of indexes, which arose out of my attempts to facilitate his
ingenious method of observing its extraordinary phenomena.
If any of the readers of your useful Magazine, by improving upon
the method I have stated of regulating the power of the column,
or by substituting a better, were to render it subservient to the
measurement of time, it would give me great pleasure.
    I believe M. De Luc first applied a column of 600 groups to
the motion of a small gold bead, suspended by a silken thread
between two balls, each of which was connected with the oppo
site extremity ; but not having succeeded by this means in ob
taining a vibration sufficiently regular and constant for his ob
servations on its variable action, he abandoned it for one much
better adapted to his purpose : he suspended the small gold bead
by the finest silver wire from a hook connected with the positive
extremity, which hung when unelectrified close to a ball also
connected with the same extremity ; but, when the column was
active, it receded from this ball, and discharged the electricity
of the positive end upon a ball connected with the negative ex
tremity, or with the ground, or with both ; after which it fell by
its gravitation into the first position.    He also placed a cross wire
above the bead to prevent it from striking, and afterwards sub
stituted a gilt pith ball of the size of a pea, for the bead, and ex
tended his number of groups to 1300 of 1| inch square: this
apparatus continued in motion more than two years, (and has
not that I know yet ceased,) varying in the number of vibrations
in a minute from forty-five down to scarcely one.
    But Mr. B. M. Forster had constructed a similar kind of
apparatus to that which M. De Luc first employed, which kept
a pair of bells ringing several months ; and Mr. William Allen
                                  R 3                        extended

                      On Galvanic Agency.
extended a column to 10,000 groups of small diameter,., and
placed them in glass tubes.
     Mr. G. S. Singer has subsequently improved it materially by
interposing two disks of paper instead of one, which increased its
power considerably, and thus lessens the labour of construction.
He extended his series to 20,000 groups, and has filled up ah
apparatus of two small columns in a very convenient form for
ringing a pair of bells. But I have constantly preferred the se
cond method employed by M. De Luc for observing the phe
nomena of this curious instrument, which I have endeavoured to
render more convenient by using a much larger ball on the pen
 dulum ; by making this pendulum of an inflexible wire instead
 of the fine silver thread ; by causing it to partake of the motion
 of the common pendulum with that of electric attraction, and
 by applying its vibrations to the motion of indexes.       It would
 not be just to omit here my acknowledgement of obligation to
 Mr. Gorham, a very ingenious watch-maker at Kensington,
 from whom I received great assistance, and who executed the
 mechanism of the wheels, levers, &c. in a very neat and accurate
 manner.
     AA, &c. (Plate V.) are six of Mr. Singer's columns in glass
 tubes, supported by two stems of glass covered with sealing-
 wax BB, and the flat pieces of brass CC, &c, which pieces
 serve also to render them continuous : the positive extremity P
 is connected by a brass wire with the dial plate D ; and the
 negative extremity N, with the screw 6.       The dial plate is sup
 ported by a stem of glass projecting from the piece of wood E
 behind it.     The pendulum, which is a wire of steel of about
  l-50th of an inch diameter and 14 inches long, carries a ball
 of gilt cork about one inch diameter : this when unelectrified
 hangs at about 4-10ths of an inch from the disk.       No. 1 and 2
 is a bow stretching a fine silver wire, and is attached to a spring
 so that it can be advanced towards or
                                          withdrawn from the pendu
 lum by turning the screw 3. 4 is a flat piece of brass carrying
 the support of the disk &c. 5, and has a groove which allows
  the lower part of the screw 6 to pass through, so that the disk
  and bow may be placed and firmly secured at the required di
 stance from the bob of the pendulum, which is ascertained by
  a great many trials.    The whole is covered with: a large glass
  shade. Fig. 2 is a front view of the mechanism attached to the
  dial plate, of the exact size of the original. No. 1 is the top of
  the pendulum, which is suspended from the peg 2 by a piece of
  fine watch pendulum wire. I have not drawn the lower part, be
  cause it would obstruct the view of the crutch 3. This crutch

head 7 from moving beyond a certain point to the left, whilst a
very delicate spring 8 causes it to regain that point after it has
been removed from it.         At the lower end of the crutch are
two pins 9, which receive between them the pendulum.           The
wheel 10 has sixty teeth, and is supported by the cock 11.
When the pendulum moves to the right, the upper end of the
crutch moving in the contrary direction, and the spring 8 yield
ing', allows the lever 5 to clear one tooth of the wheel; but when
it moves to the left, the screw-head 7 stopping the lever, the
wheel is caused to move through the space of that tooth, the
elbow 12 dropping between two teeth at the other part of                                 it,

 distance from the cork ball when the latter is in the most di
 stant part of its vibration from the disk 1 ; so that, in proportion
 as the   electricity    is   more abundant          and intense,        the disk 19
 causes it to make a longer vibration, and thus to bring it nearer
 to the point, which discharges a portion proportionate to its
 proximity. The columns represented in the plate have kept the
 pendulum thus circumstanced in activity about three weeks.
 When the temperature of the room is above 53 degrees, it gains
 about two seconds in five minutes for every advance of one de
 gree ; but when it is below this degree it diminishes its velocity
-gradually, until it no longer vibrates so fast as seconds.

       I    have found in Art. XVII. of your Number for last
                           "
January, under the title of Observations on the Geology of
Northumberland and Durham," some propositions on which                                    I
shall communicate        to you my remarks,              as they concern        a    most
 important point of geology, namely, metallic veins.
     The author, Mr. Robert Bakewell, thus attacks the celebrated
  M. Werner (p. 91 of the Journal) " The almost invariable change
                                              :

 through different rocks is,      conceive, a demonstrative proof of
                                    I

fissures, filled with metallic solutions from above, either            an            by

 veins filled in this manner, the quality          the rock would have

   system without being sufficiently acquainted with               but as this
                                                                          it   ;
is     an important point, not only in mineralogy but in geology,                           I
   shall enter into some particulars.
       In the first volume of my Geological Travels in some Parts of
   France, Switzerland and Germany,              relate a journey which
                                                  I                                         I
   made in the mountains of Freyberg with M. Werner himself.
   We had both happened to express in the same French journal,
   the opinion, that metallic veins were fissures in the strata, while
   still under the water of the sea which fissures had been filled
                                              ;
   by deposits on their sides from the same liquid a proof of which  ;
  .operation        is,
                     that the same deposits are found on both sides,
   forming what          called gangue, not necessarily metalliferous
                          is                                                                ;
   but that some of the gangnes, or part of               gangue, contained
                                                                a
   ingredients which,         smelting, produced metals of different sorts
                                   by
   according to the veins.
       The inaccuracy of the author in stating M. Werner's system,
   consists in ascribing to him the idea that veins are open fissures
 filled with metallic solutions from above while he expressly   ;
   considers the filling up of the veins as           progressive operation,
                                                            a
   by successive deposits from the liquid of the sea against the sides
   of the fissures        proof of which operation is, that the deposit*
                          ;   a
   are symmetrically formed on both sides of the fissure.
  I      had been in that respect, some years before, in           very good     a
   school and under        very able master.
                               a                 The scene was the mineral
'
   country of the Hartz, where, contrary to the opinion of the
   author, the mining operations had been carried on to                 muck         a
   greater extent than in England, not only for the extent of the
    veins, but for the breadth and the depth in which they have
    been followed throughout         their ramifications.      In short, th«
    Hartz  is one    of the  most  celebrated   mineral   countries  in whick
    veins have been worked for many centuries; and surely the
    author was not acquainted with             it,
                                              when he thought that in no
    part of  Germany the mining operations had been carried so far
 /as   in England.
       My guide in that great mineral scene was my late intimate
                                                                                         friend

 266                 Mr. De Luc on    Mr. Bakewell's
 friend Baron Von Reder, who was at that time captain general
 of the' mines, in which he accompanied me himself, making me
 observe     many particulars   which  I  could not have discovered
 without him, in those dark underground passages, down to above
 1400 feet.       He made me in particular observe the proofs that
 the veins were fissures in the strata, produced by unequal sub
 sidence of the sides after the fracture, which inequality was
 shown by the want of correspondence of the same strata on the
 opposite sides of the vein ; making me observe some places where
 there was above twenty feet difference in the Level of the same
 Strata on the opposite sides of the veins.       A clear proof that
 these openings or fissures ill the strata were produced by some
  catastrophe, in which, after the fissure, one side had subsided
  more than the other.
      With respect to the process of filling vp these cavities, he
  gave me a proof of a succession in that operation, by the dif
  ference of the metallic content of the same gangue: he showed
  me in particular some recesses, or cavities, on the side of the vein,
  incomparably richer than the other parts, which he had caused
  to be shut up by doors, in order to keep tkem for the time when
  the vein was hardly rich enough to pay the wages of the miners; at
  which times he permitted them to extract some of that rich ore,
  to make an average of the yearly product ; as these mines are the
  common property of companies, who are to maintain the miners
  at all times with the same wages, be the product of the • mines
  more or less.
      From these observations it was that I wrote a paper in the
  same French journal, which contained one of M. Werner's, in
  which he assigned the same origin to the metallic veins.       It was
  therefore very interesting for me to observe with him the mineral
  country of Freylerg, in which he was also director of the mines.
  I wrote to him from Dresden, my intended visit ; he was so good
  as to come himself to meet me at Dresden, and I spent some
  days very usefully and agreeably at Freyberg, making many -ex
  cursions in that very interesting mineral field, which observations
  I have related in my Travels : but I shall confine myself here t«
  my subject, that of the formation of the mineral veins, and the
 production of the gangue in those fissures of the strata. For
 which purpose I shall copy what I describe from p. 448 of the
  first volume of those Travels.
      " On the side of the valley in which flows the small river
  Mulda, M. Werner made me observe several little veins, which
  having been broken in the catastrophe whence is resulted the
  valley itself, most evidently have been formed in fissures an
  terior in date to the formation of the valley.        Many of these
fissures    unite  below in a single one.   In the part here exposed
                                                                     to

                     Geology   of Northumberland.                    267
to view, the gangue was chiefly of spar, and contains nothing
metallic; but when the veins thus collected in a single fissure
are followed to  a great depth, ore is found in some of them."
This is          proof of the system which we have maintained,
          a direct
M. Werner and myself, for the formation of veins; a system very
different from that which the author attributes to him, which
he certainly has not found in his works.
    Continuing the account of my travels, 1 say at p. 448, " It
was in the side of this valley that M. Werner pointed out to me
the principal phenomenon which had convinced him that veins
were fissures filled up with substances precipitated against both
the sides of the space thus opened, and that phenomenon was
 precisely the same which had led me also to the same opinion.
 In all veins, these new substances have on both sides been depo
sited in symmetrical layers ; and the intervals between the sides
 having been gradually narrowed by their accumulation, they
 have at last united towards the middle ; where, however, there
 remaiji some vacancies, lined with small crystals.           Now, in the
 little veins just described, M. Werner showed me a remarkable
 circumstance, which at once proved the symmetrical accumula
 tion of the substances on the opposite sides of the fissures, and
 the catastrophes undergone by the veins, after the formation of
 the first gangue.      These fissures have been evidently enlarged
 by a new subsidence of the strata, which having been more con
 siderable on one side than on the other, has divided the first
 gangue in many places along the line of the first junction. The
  same symmetrical layers uniting incompletely towards the mid
  dle, have again been formed in the same manner as hefoie.
  This is a case which I have frequently observed in large veins
  where new fissures have taken place ; sometimes tovyards the
  middle, sometimes on one of the sides : and where the unequal
  progress of the accumulation on the opposite sides is shown by
  effects on a greater scale, especially by large cavities, they are
, always lined with crystals, like that which I have described at
  St. Andreasberg in the Hartz, § 185."              If the author, who
  speaks of M. Werner's system without knowing               it, had only
  known my Travels to Freyberg, published in London in 1813, he
  would have found in     it all the particulars above mentioned.
      M. Werner led me     to  the highest point of the mineral ground
   of Freyberg, from which he pointed out to me the course of the
   principal veins, crossing each other, as       it   happens when the
   ground splits     by
                      dryness, or  by  unequal sinking.
      But the mineral region of Freyberg has a very different aspect

 to judge of the internal part of the ground.          For the external
 part presented   to the   sight only  hills with  gentle inflexions, at
 that  time covered  with   the finest harvest.   I was struck with th«
 idea that I walked over a land inhabited by a nation of gnomes,
 occupied down to a great depth in opening new paths in the
 bowels   of the earth.
    Lastly, I observed from another high ground, that this mineral
 country is confined by two valleys or great fractures in the strata,
 beyond which the veins no more appear externally.
    I come to the author's opinion, " that if the veins were fis
 sures, the quality of the rock could have little influence on the
 ore."    There is no reason given by the author for his assertion,
 nor is the case a general one. In the veins of Derbyshire, the
 same gangue continues without interruption, and without dif
 ference in the fundamental material, through different kinds of
 strata ; but it contains galena only when it pervades the lime
 stone strata.     This is a fact, but nobody that I know has un
 dertaken to explain it.      It would be incumbent on the author
 to prove that it is a constant effect, in order to give it as a
 general case, that the nature of the rock has an influence on that
 of the veins. But in this again he shows that he does not know
 the great mineral country of the Hartz.            The whole of that
 chain consists of schistus, and there is a great variety in the con
 tent of the veins.    Besides galena, furnishing by smelting lead
 containing silver, which is the greatest mineral product of the
 Hartz, there are veins of copper and of iron ores, very near one
 another, and in some places crossing each other.
    These are facts, but till now they give no clew that leads to
their explanation.      The author does not increase our knowledge
in that respect : on the contrary, in contradicting Werner's sy
stem concerning the veins, which I think I have now proved,
he throws obscurity on points assented to by the greatest num
ber of mineralogists, without substituting any thing to that
system.

 XLVIII.       On certain Products obtained in the Distillation of
      Wood, with some Account of bituminous Substances, and Re
     marks on Coal.        By J. MacCulloch, M.D. F.L.S. Chemist
    .to  the   Ordnance,     and Lecturer on Chemistry at the Royal
     Military Academy at Woolwich.
                            [Continued  from p. 217.]
 There       is a wide     interval between the external characters of
 the lignites and of coal, and though we cannot presume to state
 the period which Nature has used in her operations, nor during
 how long a space the causes have continued to act, before the
 vegetable matter has undergone its ultimate change into coal,
nor therefore whether the long continued agency of water and
 pressure may not have produced the required changes; yet, since
     • A new edition of this work, with considerable improvements,     is now
  in the press, and will be published about midsummer.
                                                                philosophers

 270                 On certain Ptoditcts obtained
 philosophers of high reputation have supposed that fire has been
a probable cause of this conversion, and that this theory is sup
ported by considerable evidence in some analogous cases, it is
our duty to examine by experiment, what effects conducing to
 this end may result from our limited trials.     The foregoing ex
 periments show that the fire of our furnaces does not convert
wood into bitumen, and the processes of Nature seem to prove
 that water can produce this effect, and that jet, the bituminous
 lignite which approaches nearest to coal in its chemical cha
 racters, is the result of this action.    Yet there is an interval
 between jet and coal, as I have already observed, requiring ex
 planation.     The chemical characters may be identical, but the
 mineralogical resemblance is still wanting.      It is possible that
 the agency of fire may account for this ultimate change^ and
 that its action on beds of lignite and peat has converted not
 wood but vegetable matter already bituminized by water into
 coal.    Pursuing this train of investigations I was induced to
 try if jet, the most perfectly bituminized lignite, could by the
 application of heat under pressure be converted into coal.       For
this purpose I introduced powdered jet into gun barrels, placing
 it between two portions ^of rammed Stourbridge clay, with the
vfew of absorbing a part of the distilled petroleum when it might
be formed in greater quantity than was requisite for the success
of the experiment, and where by its conversion into hydrogen it
might endanger the bursting of the apparatus.           The barrels,
which were Swedish, were held in a moderate red heat till they
burst, when they were instantly withdrawn and cooled in water
to prevent the further volatilization of the bituminous matter.
As the opening was generally no larger than a pin hole, there
was no difficulty in cooling the apparatus in time.      In this way,
among some failures, I procured a perfect fusion of the jet, which
exhibited the true characters of coal, and was taken out with
the impression of the irregularities, in the barrel.       I need not
add that in this case the produce had not merely the colour and
inflammability but the fracture of coal and its odour on burning.
It is not unlikely that by a sufficient repetition of these experi-r-
ments with better regulated heats and more leisure than I pos
sessed, several varieties of coal might have been in this way pro
duced.      Indeed some of the specimens exhibited a dry, and
others a fat appearance, but it was impossible in general to de
tach them from the barrels without reducing them to small frag
ments.      Two other circumstances occurred deserving of notice.
In one   or  two cases where the heat had been too great, a portion
of the jet was reduced to charcoal, which continued attached tm
the coaly matter, and the clay was in every instance blackened
to a considerable distance from the jet, and converted into a
                                                                 hard

hard compact substance resembling bituminous shale in its smell
and consistence.
   Reverting to the chemical nature of the other lignites, there
is very little reason to doubt that those among them which ap
proach the nearest to a state of perfect bituminizatipn, would
have given results nearly similar, but I could not pursue the in
vestigation for want of sufficient specimens. From peat we should
expect but a mixed matter, varying between the bitumen of
wood and true bitumen, according to the degree of change pre
viously undergone ; for that the process of bituminization is the
effect of water, and not .of fire, is rendered probable, as much
by these trials as by the geological observations above mentioned.
 The conversion of bituminized wood into true coal may possibly
be the effect of a consolidation produced by the agency of fire ;
but 1 shall leave this argument in the hands of those who have
undertaken the defence of this theory — having entered into this
train of reasoning, not by design, but from the unavoidable con
catenation of experiments *.                               ,
   A circumstance occurred in the coaly residuum of the wood
tar which it is worth while to notice, although of an accidental
nature, and not essentially affecting the history of the vegetable
bitumen or pitch which 1 have described.         It bore no resem
blance to common charcoal, but was more like black lead.           It
was as glossy, and although not so soft, marked paper with a
similar sPreak. It was inflated, and therefore minutely scaly,
and poro\ts, and was attracted by the magnet.         Muriatic acid
took up   a  portion of iron from     as   does from it,

of plumbago, and the remainder resembled plumbago after         had                                   it
been submitted to the action of acids.
  It  was also exceedingly difficult to burn, requiring   long con-                         a

         I                                     will add, in
                                                         I     note, a cursory ac a

272                 On certain Products attained
tinned red heat, after which it left an oxide or rather a carbonat
of iron, such as remains from the combustion of plumbago.             It
is in fact to be considered as an artificial plumbago, a substance
of whose nature all the charcoals of difficult combustibility par
take, deriving their resemblance apparently from the same cause.
     The formation of this plumbaginous substance serves to show'
a very powerful affinity between iron and carbon, even where the
proportions are very different from those which enter into the
composition of steel.       But to effect this combination, it is neces
sary    that the  carbon  be in a state of previous union with other
substances,    and   that it be applied to the iron in that state.    It
will be in vain that we attempt to combine iron with charcoal
for this end, unless the charcoal or carbon be in that state of very
minute division in which it exists when precipitated by a new
 affinity from some previous combination.
     It is necessary now to account for the iron in this compound.
     This distillation of wood for charcoal is carried on in iron ves->
 sels, and hence is derived the iron which enters into the com
position of the pitch. I will not say that it is solely derived thence,
 as it is probable that if there were iron contained in the vegeta
 ble matter, it would also be found in the same place.         When the
 acetic acid has been separated the iron remains united to the
 pitch. This fact may show us, that if in the destructive analysis
of vegetable (and probably animal) matter, we trust to find the
iron they may contain in the residual matter of the distillation,
 we may be disappointed, since it may be carried over, together
 with the substances I have now been describing, in the act of
ebullition, as happens in this very case, its tendency being to
 combine with them, in preference to the charcoal.
     As it was no part of rny design to examine the vegetable ele
 ments, I did not pursue any experiments with this substance di
 stilled in earthen vessels so to ascertain whether in this case also
 it would contain iron, but I did enough to satisfy myself that
 the pitch was essentially the same in whichever way produced.
     It is already known that a substance' resembling plumbago is
 formed in water, it having been discovered by Fabroni in the
 country round Naples.        It is equally known to be formed in the
 iron foundries; and the advocates for the igneous origin of coal
 have also contended for that of plumbago, and have supposed it
 to have been produced by the contact of melted greenstone with
 beds of coal.      But even if we admit this cause of its formation,
 something else seems necessary for the production of the sub
 stance, and some other mode of applying the heat required be
 fore it can be produced.        Nor indeed does the explanation suf
 ficiently correspond with     the  general geological position of plum
bago.

                   in the Distillation   of Wood, &c.                         273
   In numerous trials to combine iron with charcoal so as to
form this substance, I have uniformly failed of success, except
where, as in the case above related, the charcoal or carbon has
been in a state of previous combination, or was actually held in
solution.  In many trials on this principle, the results have been
tolerably successful.    If therefore we are to adopt an igneous
theory of the formation of plumbago, it will be as easy to sup
pose that the action of subterraneous fire on mixtures of bitu
men and iron has produced the compound of charcoal and iron,
on the'prineiples    I have described, and this supposition will be
more consonant to, the chemical facts.           But we are too little
 acquainted with the geological relations of plumbago to lay much
stress at present upon this or any other hypothesis.           It is evi
dent that plumbago may be a produce of art ; and could it be
produced in as solid and compact a state as Nature affords                         it,
the discovery would form a material addition to those useful ones
 for which the arts have been indebted to chemistry.
     As nothing tends more to confusion of ideas than confusion
 of terms, may be excused for proposing a name to the pitch of
           I

                           It

priated       chemists.           in fact that which

painters       the name  of  bistre, although  the nature of bistre has
I   believe never yet been examined      ; and the importance of       to     it
 the arts of design induces me to extend this article for            few      a
 lines.    According to Dr. Lewis, bistre      prodiiced from the soot
                                               is
 of all wood, other receipt books give us the same account, but
 limit the sort of wood to beech without seeming aware of its real
 nature;    but the colourmen use the soot of all wood indiscrimi
nately.
    Those artists who have made the tour of the highlands of
Scotland, are well acquainted with-that variety of           which var

274               The Knowledge     of Fossil Shells
equal in freedom and force to seppia. By distilling or evaporating'
the oil from the pitch, according to the process described above^
a colour may be produced varying in tone from the warmest
bistre brown down to black.        At the same time the substance
loses a great portion or the whole of its disagreeable tenacity,
according to the degree of boiling it has undergone.        By treat
ment in alcohol, results in some measure similar are produced,
and the residuum of this solution is equal in colour to seppia,
and totally void of tenacity.    In either or both of these ways may
the quality of this colour be improved. .
    It might perhaps be a matter worthy of trial, whether useful
varieties in colour and quality might not be produced by the di
stillation of different woods.    That which I used was procured
either from willow or alder    —  the two woods chiefly used in the
royal powder-mills, but I cannot ascertain from which of them.
The solution in lixivium of potash or of soda, a substance ana
logous to the resinous soaps, answers the purpose of ink, pos
sessing a colour sufficiently intense and flowing freely from the
pen without requiring gum.        As it is indestructible by time, by
the common acids or by the alkalies, perhaps it may be found a
valuable substitute for this useful but fugacious substance.      The
 compound of bistre and soda appears peculiarly well fitted for
drawing in monochrome, since, as it does not consistent' a powder
suspended in a vehicle, it is free from the peculiar defects, so well
 known to artists, which occur in colours thus compounded.
    I may also add that it forms a substitute for asphaltum in
drying oil, where such a coloured varnish is wanted, and that it
makes a very good japan varnish for metal if dissolved in spirit
of wine, and heated strongly after its application. It is for
practical men to see whether by combining it with asphaltum,
lac, or the gums, some more useful and cheap compounds of this
sort may not be produced.
 XLIX. An     earnest Recommendation to curious Ladies and Gen
    tlemen residing or visiting in the Country, to examine the
     Quarries, Cl'Jfs, steep Banks, &c. and collect and preserve
    Fossil Shells, as highly curious Objects in Conchology , and,
    as most important Aids in identifying Strata in distant Places;
    on which Knowledge the Progress of Geology in a principal
    degree, if not entirely, depends. By a Correspondent.

commending many       more Ladies  and  Gentlemen  in every part of
Britain to become Collectors of Fossil Shells, I have been at the
pains to collect out, alphabetically, from the sixteen numbers of
Mr. Sowerby's work already published, and send you herein, the
Names and number of presents or loans of Shells, which have
been respectively made by them, for enabling Mr. Sowerby, in
addition to his own extensive Collection, to proceed thus far in
his meritorious design, of publishing coloured Engravings and
Descriptions of all known Fossil Shells, and their habitats, those
of England more particularly.

    I indulge the hope, sir, that the above respectable List will
enable me, with some effect to plead the cause of Geological
Science, in inducing country Gentlemen of leisure, and ingenious
Ladies in particular, to imitate the praise-worthy conduct of those
mentioned, and turn their attention to the very interesting facts
around them ; viz. of there being imbedded in almost every thick
stratum or rock, those of Limestone in particular, an almost infi
nite number of individual Shells, belonging to a vast number of new
species, and even new genera, which have never yet been noticed
by writers, long and ardent as has been the research of Natura
lists, since the days of the illustrious Linnams, in describing every
recent species of Shells, throughout the known world.
    Besides this important object, of increasing our knowledge of'
the vast number and variety of the organized and once living
Beings, with which the all bountiful Creator has seen fit to peo
ple this terraqueous Globe j the entombment of an extensive series.
of species, most of them in vast numbers, each in distinct strata,
Heing upon each other in a determinate order, through consider-,
able tracts of country, and perhaps almost throughout the earth's
surface, irresistibly leads us to the fact, of the very slow and pro
gressive formation of the solid matter of the Earth, and enlarges our
comprehensions of its great Author, by making us in a consider
able degree acquainted with, events long prior to, and which yet
are in perfect unison with the sacred writings, which commence
not with details of the creation of the Earth itself, much less of-
its early and progressively entombed animal Inhabitants, but
with what more immediately concerned our early fore Fathers to-
know, viz. the origin of the existmg species of Plants, Animals.-
and Men, upon the surfa.ce of the earthy ball, and in the waters,
how covering only apart of this surface, instead of such being
                                                             previously^

             is Important to the Progress     of Geology.         277
previously,  the universal cover of the solid land, as the Mosaic
records attest, and as irmurrrerable facts still observabie w'rthhS
the earth's surface, concur in proving to have been the case.
    I was long myself, after [ had begun to take views of the subject,
not very different from the above, under the then too common mis
take of supposing, that, in order to be able to contribute in any
useful degree towards the stock of Geological knowledge, which
even yet is lamentably deficient, it was necessary to possess a
considerable and technical knowledge of Mineralogy, (including
its chemical and crystallographical departments,) of Botany and
comparative Anatomy, of Conchology in particular, with ample
leisure and opportunities for employing these,' in foreign countries,
more than in our own, which last we had been often told, was
barren to a proverb, of true Geological phenomena ! f
    A sight however with which I was favoured, of Mr. William
 Smith's Collection of Fossil Shells and other Organic Remains,
arranged in the order in which they are found in the several
 Strata described by colours on his Map of England, and each
Specimen distinctly marked with the name of the Place from
•whence it was taken, at once convinced me, that what had been
achieved, by the perseverance of a plain and moderately lettered
Man, in a great measure if not totally unacquainted with the tech
nical knowledge above mentioned, might be followed by others ;
and I became convinced, that the efforts of persons like myself,
and numbers of my acquaintance, residing always or frequently
in the Country, might contribute usefully to Geology: and since
Mr. Sowerhy has begun the Work, which it is now my object
to recommend, the same has been evident to most of the Indivi
duals in the above List, and to his Readers in general, and will I
trust prove so to daily increasing numbers, everywhere.
    Industry and attention only are wanted for Ladies or Gentle
men to be able, in most country situations, to collect many fossil
Shells, either from Quarries or Pits which are constantly in the
course of work, by small occasional gratuities to the Workmen
for preserving all they meet with, and pointing out the exact bed
of stone, clay, &?c. in which they each lie, entombed ; by the
like attention to occasional opportunities of seeing the strata
penetrated by new Wells, Shafts, Drains, Foundations, &c. or
after the slipping down of Cliffs or steep banks after heavy Rains
or Frosts, &c. in order to collect the shells newly exposed thereby,
 and record their exact matrix df place in the strata, (by their
local appellations as well as by their ordinary names, as Lime
stone, Chalk, S\nd-stone, Sand, Clay, Marl, &c.) which are even
still more important, because resident Observers can alone col
lect these occasional facts, while the regular Quarries and Pits
                                  S 3                             may

278                 The Knowledge of Fossil Shells
may be, and many of them already have been visited, by travellers
in search of Geological facts, like Messrs. Smith, Farey, Bakewell,
Greenough, and many others ; this latter circumstance ought not
however to occasion the neglect of such public and permanent
Works in the strata, because the deeper and further progress of
excavating, is continually exposing new or better specimens of
 Shells than have hitherto been collected, in almost any Quarry
or Pit.
     Each Specimen should have a number put on           it,
                                                          as soon as
possible after collecting, referring to the Notes taken, as to its
habitat or place in the strata, as above mentioned, and the Place
 on the surface of the country, described    by the Name      the par
                                                               of
 ticular quarry or work, and in what Farm, Township or Parish
 situated, and its bearing and distance, as near as these can be
 estimated or told        the workmen, from the nearest church or
                             by
 village which     shown in the ordinary Maps, not forgetting to
                   is
 add the County to all such descriptions, for fear of another place
 of the same name being confounded therewith,       byothers to whom
 these particulars may     be communicated.
  A     common mistake          many Collectors has been, imagining
                                  by
 that they were possessed of unique specimens of fossil shells, and
 which persuasion has had two bad effects, one of them occasion
                                                                         -
 ing the neglect of an accurate and persevering search in the iden-
 tical stratum from whence their rare specimen was taken,                by
 which other such specimens might almost with positive certainty
 be found;    and the other evil resulting, has been, that so high a
 value was set on the supposed unique specimen, that such Gen
 tlemen as Mr. Sowerby have rarely been able to obtain even the
 loan thereof  :  whereas, the profusion that exists of fossil speci
 mens,' in their proper beds, might enable all industrious Collectors
                                                                        '
 to have so many almost equally perfect duplicates of each species
 in their Collections, as freely to give or exchange with all their cu
 rious Friends who may visit them, and even to enable them, occa
 sionally, to carefully pack up a small Box of good Specimens, as
 to their being pretty entire, and showing the hinge of the Shell
 in particular, each numbered, and accompanied           by

true characters and nice distinctionn which are necessary in de
scribing Fossil Shells, so as to render the same useful in Geo
logical investigation.
    It remains tor   me to mention    one other very important cau
tion to Collectors of Fossil Shells and mineral matters, which is
rendered necessary, bv the almost universal scatter of alluvial
rubbish on the tops of the regular and uudisturbed Strata, such
alluvium being often accumulated to a vast thickness, of alluvial
Clay in particular, and in which, as well as in alluvial Sand, and
tlie more obviously worn Gravels, fossil shells are commonly
found, mostly in a worn state, but not invariably so.        The care-'
fill Observer need in no instance to be in doubt, as to distin
guishing alluvium from strata, if he will attend to the regularly
laminated and unmixed nature of the latter, except as to grains
they may be composed of (as Sand, Sandstone, &c.) or nodular
masses, (like those of Flint, Ironstone, &c.) and organized remains
they may contain, which are regularly disposed in strata, in most
instances; while on the contrary, the alluvial matters, always found
upon and never under any regular stratum, are disorderlv mixtures,
containing water-worn ana violently broken pebbles and stones,
most of them entirely foreign to the district in which they now
lie, and which may, some of them, have come from the antipodes,
for aught that has yet appeared to the contrary: there is like
wise an intermediate class of loosened substances found, either
under the gravels and other alluvia, or nearly naked on the surface,
which is called Rubble, Ramel, Stone-brach, &c. in different
districts, consisting for the most part of angular and unworn
fragments of the stoney stratum or Rock immediately beneath,
merely loosened up, sometimes without the intervention of any
extraneous matters between these small loosened stones, but more
commonly, some of the loosened matter of the next superior stra
tum of the series, and more rarely,gravel-stones, alluvial-shells, &c.
have fallen in among these Rubbles : — on all these accounts, the
caution I have mentioned is abundantly necessary, always to note
 it on the spot, where fossil shells were found in the alluvium, and
 to call these alluvial shells : — of which latter class, any particular
 specimen may appear to be unique in the district where it is
found, which in reality is no more so, than the finding of a single
 Oyster, Cockle or Muscle Shell, in ploughing a Field, carried
 thither in the manure, after having been brought from the Sea.
 by Man, would entitle this shell to such a character of rarity.

  L. Explanation      of certain Improvements in the Construction
     and Fastening of the Frame Timbers of Ships or Vessels, cither
     when Building, or when under Repair, for. the mot e effectually
    preventing the Disunion of the Parts caused by Hogging, arm
     the transverse Bendmg of the Hull.         By Air. John Wai>
 ,   TEns, Architect,   Fenchurch   Buildings, London.
  Before I      proceed to explain the proposed improvements, it is
  necessary  to give an idea of the common method of ship-building,
 and of the principal improvements which the art has hitherto
 received.
     The frame or skeleton of a ship, built according to the com
 mon mode of construction, is composed of a number of curved
 timbers (called ribs) placed at certain distances from each other,
 in planes, at right angles to the keel on which they all rest.   In
 the intermediate spaces between the said ribs, are placed filling
 timbers, answering to the curve of the ribs, so that the void be-
 tween timber and timber is from one to five inches.        Athwart
 this frame are laid beams, at right angles to the keel, serving to
 hold together the sides of the ship and to support the decks.
 And for the purpose of strengthening the parts, a second range
 of curved timbers or inside ribs (called riders) are placed over
 the interior planking, but at a greater distance from each other
than the ribs properly so called1.
    As in this construction all the timbers are disposed at right
 angles to the keel and keelson, and the planking both within and
without is longitudinal, there is evidently no mechanical sup
port to resist the action of gravity, from which radical defect all
ships have a tendency to arch longitudinally an'd bend trans
versely by the sinking of the sides.       The remedy of these evils
is a great desideratum in naval architecture,
    The constant strain which a ship experiences from an un
equal distribution of weight, and the upward pressure of the
water, is the cause of its becoming arched throughout its length,
or (as it is called) hogged, to which cause may be added the
partial pressure of the water in a longitudinal direction, which
tends to compress the keel, and thereby to increase the curvature.
The degree of curvature produced by these combined causes.

is of course different in different ships. Dr. Young has investi
gated this subject, the detail of which will be found in a very
interesting paper published in the Philosophical Transactions,
Part II. 1814. The result of his calculations applying to a 74
gun ship is as follows
                                                 J-JJ-J- I —

                                                                   <-

of a vessel which      A                                            •           B
has hogged — imagine the line   a i to be parallel to the horizon,
touching the curve in e, and let it be divided into eight equal
parts as in the figure.   Then if we suppose the ship to be con
structed of an uniformly flexible substance, the curvature will be
such, that the fall of the keel below the imaginary line at each
of the points a, b,c, &c. is proportional to the following num
bers, viz. at a, 17153; at b, 09421 ; at c, 03738; at d,
00809; at e, 00000; at                 /,
                                   00854; at g, 03721 ; at k,
08041; and at i, 13525."
    The two causes above mentioned, by which the arching of
the ship is produced, act permanently; but when a ship is riding
over the waves, she is occasionalry borne up by the fluid in her
central part only, while the head and stern are forsaken.       The
strain hence produced, together with the agitation by which it
is accompanied, far exceeds that arising from the mere inequa
lity of the distribution of weight and pressure. Dr. Young esti
mates   it,in certain cases, at nearly three times as much      and         ;
notwithstanding the temporary action of        this cause, he justly
considers    as the most destructive, because, when the fastenings
            it
have been strained and loosened        the action of the waves, the
                                            by
ship  will more   readily give way to the operation of the perma
nent causes.
  A   degree of curvature       also produced in
                                  is                  transverse di
                                                               a
rection, that      is,
                  at right angles to the foregoing,   by  the weight
sustained     the sides being heavier than that
              by                                    in  the  middle,
while the vertical pressure of the water              is
greatest in the neighbourhood of the keel.
Thence arises an alteration in the transverse
section of the ship, which assumes a form
approximating to that of the annexed                 fi
gure.
   And lastly, there      also a tendency to
                         is                        lateral curvature.

 2S2           Explanation    of certain  Improvements
with a view to counteract these evils inherent in every ship, and
by which the lives of so many brave men have been lost, con
sists in employing oWique timbers.          Mr. Seppings, who is the
author of this improvement, fills the spaces between the frame
timbers nearly to the height of the orlop or lower tier of beams,
so as to make this part of the fabric solid ; and omitting the in
side plank, he places immediately over the frame timbers oblique
riders, at an angle of about 45 degrees, (instead of placing them
at right angles with the keel, as in the common construction,)
and so disposed that the direction in the fore is contrary to
that in the after part of the ship, and their distance asunder from
sis to seven feet or more ; the upper ends abutting against the
shelf-pieces (answering to the clamps of the common construc
tion) which support the beams of the deck and the lower ends
against the limber strakes.      He next places two series of timbers
longitudinally upon the joints of the frame timbers at the floor
and first futtock heads, their ends dowelled to the sides of the
riders.   The framing thus formed by the oblique riders and lon
gitudinal pieces represents two tier of compartments from the
head of the floor timbers to the underside of the orlop deck,
each compartment being of the figure of a rhomboid, in which
is introduced a diagonal timber with an inclination opposite to
that of the riders, thereby dividing it into two parts.           Mr.
Seppings   also  substitutes for  the internal  planking  of the sides
oblique braces placed in ships of war between the ports, the
raking direction of these braces being lowest towards midships,
and in the space on each side the centre port are placed two
braces crossing each other.        These comprise the principal im
provements made by Mr. Seppings.             Some others have also
been introduced by him, but not necessary to be here noticed.
    Dr. Young has published in the Philosophical Transactions
his remarks upon this construction. He allows the use of oblique
timbers, to be good in principle.         His arguments sufficiently
prove their general utility, in tending to resist a change of figure
in the ship ; but he seems to doubt of the complete efficacy of the
oblique riders and framing in the hold, when employed for the
thick stuff of the ceiling.    The filling hi, however, appears to
him wholly unexceptionable,       and the braces between the ports
to be decidedly more beneficial than the planks for which they
are substituted.
    Excepting Mr. Seppings's improvements, I know of none of
any importance that have been introduced into naval architecture
for ages ; but valuable as they are, there was room left for further
improvement, and a remedy for hogging still remained a desi
deratum.     Having, as I conceive, contrived means for effectually
obviating this defect in all ships, and having obtained His Ma
                                                               jesty's

                           in Naval Architecture.
jesty's Letters Patent for my invention, I am induced to submit
 the following explanation of it to the consideration of the public,
 and of those who may be interested in such a subject.
    The mechanical principle upou which this improvement is
 founded is that of forming a complete and integral truss or sup
 port from the centre of gravity (whence the strength of the whole
 structure should as much as possible be derived), and so con
 necting the parts together, by embracing the entire fabric, that
any tendency to a change of figure may be powerfully counter
 acted, and as much strength be given as the nature of materials
 will permit.
    The frame or skeleton of a ship being constructed in the com
 mon way, a principal frame A (fig. 1 and 2, PI. VI) , constructed of
 metal, or of wood and metal, is introduced in the space between
 the ribs, intersecting the vessel athwart the centre of gravity,
 connected across the ship by a tie-bar or beam B (fig. 2), and
 having the internal diagonal braces C, C.     Also from the upper
 part of the said principal frame, the braces DD (fig. 1), con
 structed of metal, are let in flush upon the outside and bolted
 to the frame timbers, and carried down in an inclined direction
  (being that of the shortest distance over the curved surface*)
 to the lower part of each extremity of the vessel, and connected
 each with its opposite one, in the concave parts of the bottom,
 by bolting through from one to the other, or by any other con
 venient method.      Thus the whole frame of the ship is firmly
 connected together, and the weight of either end (supposing the
 ship supported under the centre of gravity) is counterbalanced                  '
 by the other end, while the vertical strain, proceeding from the
 weight of the whole fabric, is transferred by the tension upon
 the braces C, C, to the principal frame A. And also for the
 more perfect stiffening of the hull (when the spaces between the
 timbers are not filled in solid), and thereby obtaining a counter
 resistance to the weight of the middle (supposing the vessel sup
 ported at the ends) ; chocks or strutting pieces of timber scant
 ling are tailed in between frame and frame behind or within the
 braces, which acting as arches when confined by the braces, dis
 charge the weight of the vessel upon the butments at each ex
 tremity, which completes the truss.     And it will appear evident,
  that so long as the truss remains perfect, not any weight or
  pressure can alter the relative position of any of the parts,
  whether the vessel is horizontal or inclined, unless caused by
  * The
        utility of keeping the brnccs in the direction of the line of shortest
distance   is,
             thatit  presents the direct tension of the braces to every en
deavour of the ship to change her figure, and prevents the possibility of the
braces being moved    byany force into a new position.
                                                                        some

2&4              Improvements     in Naval Architecture.
some shock that would go near to effect the total destruction                  of
the whole fabric.
   The foregoing     description being confined to the method of
trussing  smaller ships or vessels, the manner of extending this
system (which    with   a little modification  is applicable to ships
of the greatest magnitude) is shown by figure 3, in which A i*
the principal frame; and B, B, the braces, as already described ;
CC are auxiliary braces ; D, D, minor principal frames, one in
the fore and the other in the after part of the body ; EE are
minor braces ; and F is an horizontal brace, connecting the
heads of the minor braces, and forming a kind of longitudinal
hoop to the tipper part of the structure*.        Chocks or Mrutting
pieces are also tailed in at the back of these braces, similar
to those before described, when the spaees are not filled in
solid.
    In ships of war the disposition of the principal braces ought
to be so regulated as to be but little exposed to be shot awav,
and auxiliaries should be employed below low-water line, for
additional security.
    The braces before described are made of flat bars of metal in
pieces of convenient length, so adjusted that the parts at which
they are joined together, fall in the spaces between the ribs of
the vessel, being connected by scarf joints wedged up for the pur
pose of equalizing the tension.       The outer surface of the braces
is kept flush with the frame timbers, and the bolt-holes in all of
 them are countersunk to receive the heads of the bolts, so that
no part may present any obstruction to the planking.
    In addition to the security afforded by this principle of truss
ing in constructing the ribs, I affix upon the sides over each
butting joint of the timbers of which the rib is composed, a plate
of iron or other metal extending above and below                   it,
                                                            and bolted
through the rib,        bywhich means the ribs acquire great addi
tional strength ;  an object of the first importance, even         only  if
partially employed    in  assisting the weaker  parts,  and  protecting
those most exposed to injury; as, in cases of        ship's grounding,
                                                         a

                                               is
of the parts situated near the head of the floor timbers.            In
many other respects the employment of these iron clamps will
be found of the most essential service.

tion to practice.     It is a system of framing, which resembles in
some of its qualities, and in its effects and operations, the trussing
employed in the construction of roofs, bridges, and other framed
carpentry of great span, so that a vessel to which it is applied,
may not improperly be called a trussed ship or vessel ; and this
powerful support, superadded to the usual fastenings, must, it is
presumed, infallibly produce the great objects proposed of pre
venting the depression of the two ends, and the butt ends and
seams of the plank from opening, and also give general strength
and security to the vessel.            -
   The advantages resulting from this improvement are t
First, — That the durability of vessels will be increased, thus pre
      cluding the early and frequent repairs rendered necessary
      by the radical weakness of the present mode of construc
      tion.
Secondly,— That by means of the powerful support effected by
      the truss the filling timbers between each rib may be
      omitted, thereby making a very considerable saving in the
      first cost, after allowing for the expense of the truss.
Thirdly,— The great benefits eventually to accrue to the mer
      cantile world are, first, a reduction in the charges of freight,
      proportioned to the diminution of the expense of building,
      the less frequency of repairs, and the comparative greater
      durability of the vessel ; secondly, a more perfect security
      of the cargo from damage ; and thirdly, a lower rate of
       insurance.
Fourthly, — The saving annually to their relatives, and to the
       community, a great number of valuable lives.

    Clarke, LL.D.
                          [Continued  from p. 200.]
After       the numerous accounts which, during so many ages,
have been written to illustrate      the origin of the Pyramids, it is
not probable that any new remarks will meet with much atten
tion. Yet how few, among all the authors who have undertaken
to investigate this subject, have ever ventured to express an
opinion of their own ! Struck by the magnitude of the objects-
 themselves; by their immense antiquity; and by a consciousness
of the obscurity in which their history has been veiled, every
 succeeding traveller contents himself with a detail of the obser
vations of his predecessors, only showing the extent of the la
 byrinth wherein he is bewildered.        Yet something perhaps might

be accomplished, were it allowable, upon good authority, to an
nihilate a most redundant source of error and imposture.          With
this view, it may be advisable to abandon all that Grecian histo
rians have written upon the subject.         The arrogance and vanity
with which they endeavoured to explain every thing consistently
with their own fables and prejudices, caused the well known ob
servation, made by an Egyptian priest, whq, according to Plato,
maintained that the Greeks were always children, and had no
knowledge of antiquity.      Hence originate those difficulties men
tioned by Pauw, as encountered by persons who study the monu
ments of a country concerning which the moderns have con
spired with the ancients to give us false ideas.

at the discretion of a set of men called interpreters, whose col
lege was established in the reign of Psammetichus, and who
might be compared to those people called Ciceroni at Rome.
Travellers who went and returned, like Herodotus, without
knowing a word of the language of the country, could learn no
thing but from tLese interpreters.         These men, perceiving the
inclination of the Greeks for the marvellous, amused them, like
 children, with stories inconsistent with common sense, and un
worthy of the majesty of history."        If we would obtain authentic
information concerning the earliest history of the Egyptians, we
 must be contented to glean from other sources ; and principally
from Jewish and Arabian writers.         The Jews, by long residence
 of their forefathers in Egypt, and also by the constant inter
 course offered in the contiguity of this country and India, were
of all people the most likely to have preserved some knowledge
of Egyptian antiquities : and the Arabs have preserved not
only the names bestowed upon the Pyramids from the earliest
times, but also some traditions as to the use for which they were
intended.     By the dim light thus afforded, and by comparing
the existing remains with similar works in other countries, and
with the knowledge we possess of the customs of all nations in
their infancy, we may possibly attain something beyond conjec
ture, as to the people by whom the Pyramids were erected, and
the purpose for which they were intended.         The epocha of their
origin  was  unknown   when   the- first Greek   philosophers travelled
into Egypt. They are even more ancient than the age of the
earliest writers whose works have been transmitted to us.         That
we may arrive, therefore, at any thing like satisfactory informa
tion concerning them, the following order of inquiry may be
deemed requisite :
    I. Who were the inhabitants of this part of Egypt in the re
mote period to which these monuments refer ?
                                                                 II.  Is

                On the Origin   of the Pyramids of Egypt.           287
      II. Is there any thing in the Pyramids, as they now appear,
  which corresponds with any of the known customs of this peo
  ple P
       III. Did any thing occur in the history of the some people
  which can possibly be adduced to explain the present violated
  state of the principal pyramid ?
       IV. Doth any record or tradition attribute the origin of the
  Pyramids to this people, or to a period equally remote with that
  of their residence in Egypt ?
       If the last three of these queries admit of an answer in the
   affirmative, and a satisfactory reply can be given to the first, the
   result will surely be, either that we do possess documents suffi
  cient to illustrate this very difficult subject, or, at least, that a
  very high degree of probability attaches to the opinion thereby
  suggested ; and that the obscurity in which this part of ancient
  history has. been involved, is principally owing to the cause as
   signed by Pauw, namely, to a train of theories founded upon the
  bewildering fables of the Greeks.
       To proceed, therefore, according to the proposed method of
   investigation—
                                      I.                        t
       Who ivere the inhabitants of this part  of Egypt in   the remote
  period to which these monuments refer ?
       The kingdom of Egypt, according to the best authorities ad
   mitted in chronology (see the calculation of Gonstantine Ma-
   nasses), had lasted about 1700 years at the conquest of Cam-
   byses (B. C. 525).      The first princes spoken of in sacred Scrip
   ture are those " of Pharaoh," mentioned in the books of Moses
    (Gen. xii. 15), near 2000 years before the Christian era. The
  first pyramid, according to Herodotus (Euterpe, c. 101) was
   built by Maeris, the last of a line of kings from Menes to Seso-
   stris; and therefore it must have been erected some ages before
.  the Trojan war.      Without, however, placing any reliance upon
   this record, or attempting to assign a particular epocha for any
   one of these monuments, we may venture to assume, as a fact,
   upon the authority of all writers by whom they are noticed, that
    they existed above 1600 years before the birth of Christ.        Al
   most a century before that time, the prosperity of Joseph, then
    a ruler in this country, and a dweller in the very city to which
    these monuments belonged, is described as having extended
    " unto the utmost bounds of the everlasting kills." These words
    (Gen. xlix. 26), as applied to the place of his residence, and the
    seat of his posterity, are very remarkable.    He " bought all the
    land of Egypt for Pharaoh," reducing all its independent pro
    vinces into one monarchy.        The entire administration of this
        . ..                                                      empire

empire was intrusted to him.; for Pharaoh said,
                                                            "
                                                        only in the
throne will I   be greater than thou." (Gen. xli. 40.)    In the re
                                                                     "
mote period, therefore, to which the Pyramids refer,          Joseph
dwelt in Egpt, he and his father's house."       It is said of them
(Exod. i. 7) that they "increased abundantly, and multiplied,
and waxed exceeding mighty, and the land was jilted with
them." The customs of embalming bodies, and of placing them
in sepulchral chambers, were then practised ; for Jacob was
embalmed (Gen. 1. 2), and "gathered unto his fathers in the
cave of the fx 'eld if Ephron." At the death of Joseph, he too
                                        "
was embalmed (Gen. 1. 26), hut not      gathered unto his fathers."
He was entombed, to use the literal expression of the LXX, EN
THI SOPfll, in Egypt. And this mode of his interment sug
gests a reply to the second question l>efore proposed.
                                II.
      Is
      there any thing in the Pyramids, as they now appear, which
corresponds until any of the known customs of this people ?
   The nature of a Soros has been repeatedly explained, upon
the indisputable authority of inscriptions where this name has
been assigned to a particular kind of a receptacle for the dead,
one of which now exists in the chamber of the principal pyramid.
This kind of coffin has sometimes one of its extremities rounded,
and sometimes both are squared ; but its dimensions are almost
always the same, and it is very generally monolithal, or of one
stone.     This is the kind of coffin which the Romans call sarco
phagus, and any doubt as to its use seems to be without rea
son ; because the Soros, in many instances, has borue not only
its name inscribed upon it in legible characters, but also the
purport for which it was intended.         The principal pyramid,
therefore, contains that which corresponds with the known cus
toms of a people who inhabited Egypt in the remote period to
which the Pyramids refer, because Joseph's body was put h
rjj Xoqca.   And on this fact alone,    no other could be adduced,
                                       if
the sepulchral origin    of those monuments    decidedly manifest.
                                                 is
                                III.
      Did
       any thing occur in the history     the same people, which
                                            of
can be adduced to explain t/ie present violated slate   the prinof
cipal pyramid   ?
   Previous to the consideration of this question,    may be pro
                                                           it
per to mention, that the custom of heaping an artificial mound:,
whether of stones or earth, above the Soros, after interment, was
a common practice of the ancients.     Examples of this kind have
been previously alluded to in the former volumes of these Travels.
The most ancient form of thib kind of mound was not pyramidal.
                                                                     However

               On the Origin    of the Pyramids of Egypt.                           289
 However ancient the Pyramids may be, a simpler hemispheroidal
or conical form seems to have preceded the more artificial an
gular structure.      Among the pyramids of Saccara, which appear
 to be more ancient than those of Djiza, there are instances, as
 we have shown, not only of this primeval pile, but of its various
modifications until it assumed the pyramidal shape.          One ex
 ample   has  been  noticed among    the pyramids of Saccara, of an
 immense mound, which corresponds in its form with the com
mon appearance presented by ancient tumuli almost all over the
 world, as they are found in countries where the pyramidal shape
 was never introduced.      But to proceed in the discussion of the
  third question.
     The body of Joseph being thus placed Iv              rij
                                                   26gu>, and buried
 according to the accustomed usage of the Egyptians (as mani
 fested  by  the existence of one of their ancient sepulchres con
 taining the receptacle in question), was not intended to remain
in Egypt. The Israelites had bound themselves                   by
                                                        an oath, that
 when they left the land they would " carry his bones" with them
 (Gen.   1.
            25). Accordingly, we find, that when       century and
                                                                a                        a
 half had elapsed from the time of his burial, the sepulchre, which
 during all this period had preserved his reliques in     Soros, was a
 opened       by
              the  children of  Israel.  Their number    amounted  to
 600,000 men when they went out of Egypt, besides the mixed
 multitude       whom they were accompanied (Exod. xii. 37, 38);
                   by
 a sufficient army, surely, even for the opening of     pyramid a                   if   it
were necessary, especially when the persons employed for the
undertaking were acquainted with the secret of its entrance                              ;
having from the very moment of the patriarch's interment, been
under    asolemn engagement to remove the body which they had
there placed.      However this may be determined,                certain
                                                                     it   is

tioned, than we read (Exod. xiii. 19),          Moses took the bones                     of
Joseph with him."         Here, then, we have         record in history,
                                                          a
which implies the violation of         a sepulchre,  and  the actual re
moval of an embalmed body from the Soros in which                    said it   is
to have been deposited.           The locality, too, of this sepulchre
seems to coincide with that of the particular coemetery where this
pyramid has for so many ages unaccountably borne the marks of
a  similar violation    its secret entrance being disclosed to view
                        ;                                                                ;
and its Soros always empty.           It   is   by
                                              no means here presumed
 that this circumstance will account for its violated state           but      ;
it furnishes    curious coincidence between the present appearance
                   a
of the pyramid, and         a  fact recorded in ancient history which
 may possibly   be  urged   to   that effect.   No other pyramid has
been thus opened       neither
                        ;        is   probable that any such violation
                                      it
 of  a  sepulchre would ever have been formerly tolerated               so          :

290          On the Origin    of the Pyramids of Egypt.
sacrilegious was the attempt held to be among all the nations of
antiquity, Egyptians, Jews, Greeks, and Romans.      At the same
time, there are many weighty arguments against the opinion that
such a stupendous pyramid would have been erected by Joseph's
posterity over his remains, even if they had worshipped him as a
God, when it was known that his body was not intended to re
main in the country; but the honouis paid to the dead in Egypt
were, in certain instances, as it is evident, almost beyond our
 conception ; and there is no saying what, in a century and a
 half, the piety of some hundred thousand individuals might not
have effected, especially when aided by the Egyptians themselves,
 who equally revered the memory of Joseph, although they be
 came, at last, inimical to his descendants.     This part of the
 subject is not altogether essential to the end proposed ; it has
been introduced rather as a curious inquiry suggested by the
 connection which appears to exist between the Pyramids and the
 history of the Hebrews ; it neither affects nor alters the main
argument.
                                    IV.
   Doth any record or tradition attribute the origin of the Py
ramids to the Israelites, or to a period equally remote with that
of their residence in Egypt ?
    This brings us to the last article of the inquiry. For the
 record we have only to refer to Josephus, who expressly states it
 as one of the grievous oppressions which befel the Hebrews, after
 the death of Joseph, that they were compelled to labour in build
 ing pyramids (Joseph. Antiq, Jud. lib. ii. c. 9) ; and the cu
 rious memorial, as given by the Jewish historian, is sustained by
 collateral evidence in the book of Moses.          The principal labour
 of the Israelites is described in Exodus           (v.16) to be     a daily
 task of making bricks, without being allowed a requisite portion
 of straw for their manufacture.           The mere circumstance of
 600,000 persons being employed at the same time in making
 bricks, affords of itself a proof that the building for which these
'materials -were required could be of no ordinary magnitude.           This
 happened, too, after the death of one of the kings of Egypt
 (Exod. ii. 23), at which time,      it   issaid, they began     "  to sigh
 by   reason of their bondage."           It    therefore very probable
                                               is
 that the pyramid at which they laboured was the sepulchre of
 this king: this   is   matter of conjecture; although
                        a                                      it   may be
 added, that one of the pyramids near Saccara             isbuilt of bricks
 containing chopped straw.        [It  is called Ktoube-el-Menshieh,
 the bricks  of Menskieh.]     The    fact  for present attention    is  the
 record preserved       by
                        Josephus,  Tfhich    attributes  to  the  Israelites
 the origin   of  certain pyramids         Egypt and for other evi
                                          in        :
                                                                     dence,

              Oa the Origin of the Pyramids of Egypt.                      291
dence, proving them to have existed in a period equally remote
with that in which this people inhabited the country, we may re
fer to the testimony of Manetho, whose authority is respected by
Josephus, and who, from his situation as an Egyptian priest*,
had access to every record preserved in the sacred archives of
the country.    Manetho affirms that these structures were begun
by the fourth king of Egypt during the first dynasty f; which
carries their antiquity back to a period earlier than the age of
Abraham. Of this nature are the records required by the last
question in the proposed inquiry, without having recourse to any
of the writers of Greece or Italy. As for the traditions which
refer the origin of these monuments to the age of the Israelites
ih Egypt, these exist, not only among the Arabians, but also
among the Jews and Egyptians.      The author of a book entitled
Moral A/zeman, cited by Greaves in his Pyramidographia (p. 6,
Lond. 1646), speaking of the founders of the Pyramids, says,
" some attribute them to Joseph, some to Nimrod." The Ara
bians distinguished the Pyramids by the appellation of Djehel
Pharooun, or P/iaraoh's mountains           J;
                                        and there is not one of
these   oriental   writers   who does not consider them as ancient
sepulchres   §.
   Upon   these premises,   thus derived from sources that are not
liable to the objections urged by Pauw, being wholly independent
of any notions with which he supposes the Greeks to have blended
their accounts of the Pyramids, the following conclusions may
 perhaps be warranted : .
    1 . That the Hebrews inhabited Egypt in the period to which
        the Pyramids may be referred.
    2. That the Pyramids contain an existing document corre
        sponding with the mode of interment practised by this peo
       ple, and were, therefore, intended as sepulchres.
   ? Josephus says, that the care and continuance of the public records
were the peculiar province of the priests (lib. i. cont. Apion.).     Manetho
 belonged to the college at Heliopolis, the veiy seat of Egyptian science.
His testimony was preferred by Marsham lo that of Josephus himself.
However, it should be acknowledged that Perizonius, who considered the
dynasties of Manetljo as fabulous, attacked Marsham upon this ground,
describini; him as " absurdissima quoque Manethonh recipiendi studiosior,
quam specinsa Josepfii." — Vid. Perizonii iEgypt. Orig. Invest, c. xxi. p. S84.

         sibly be owing to the circumstance related in their history,
         of the removal of Joseph's reliques from the Soros in which
         they had been preserved.
      4.  That from the records of Jewish and Egyptian historians,
         as well as from the traditions of the country, we may attri
         bute the origin of some of the pyramids to the Hebrews
         themselves; and may assign to others a period even more
         remote than the age in which this people inhabited Egypt.
      In the principal point to be determined, namely, the use for
 which these structures were erected by the ancients, there cannot
 remain even the shadow of a doubt.                That they were sepulchres
  has been demonstrated beyond the possibility of a contradiction ;
 and in proving this all the best authorities have long concurred*.
 In their whole extent from Djiza to Saccara, the Pyramids, and
 all their contiguous subterranean catacombs, constitute one vast
 ccemetery, belonging to the seat of the Memphian kings f, the
 various parts of which were constructed in different periods of
 time.      Some learned writers however, as Shaw, and the author
 of Philosophical Dissertations on the Egyptians and Chinese, have
 exercised their erudition in attempting to prove that the Pyra
 mids were mythological repositories of Egyptian superstitions ;
 and they have described the Soros, in direct opposition to Strabo,
 either as a tomb of Osiris          J, or as one of those xiVrai iega) in
 which the priests kept their sacred vestments §. Nor, perhaps,
 would these conjectures have appeared so visionary, if those
 distinguished       writers had carried the investigation somewhat
 further. If the connection between ancient Egyptian mythology
 and Jewish history had been duly traced, an evident analogy,
 founded upon events which have reference to the earliest annals
 of the Hebrews, might be made manifest.                   The subject, itself
sufficient to constitute a separate dissertation, would cause too
 much digression ; although an endeavour may be made to con
 centrate some of its leading features within the compass of a
 note || . The main object at present is to prove the intention

   II Perhaps, with due attention to facts collected from ancient and mo->
dern writeis, the whole connection might be traced between the history of
Joseph, and      the Egyptian Mythology founded thereon.       For this purpose
the reader may be referred to all that Vossius has written upon the subject
(vid. lib. i. cap. 20. torn. i. p. 213. de Thcologia Gentili; Amst. 1642), who
                                                                       considers

               On the Origm         of the Pyramids of Egypt.                        293
for which the Pyramids were erected   ; and in this it is hoped we
may succeed.     If these were the only monuments of the kind
belonging to the ancient world, and we had not the evidence
afforded by the Soros in the principal pyramid, a greater degree
of difficulty might oppose the undertaking.    But in addition to
the testimony offered bv this remarkable relique, we are enabled,
by collateral evidences derived from other countries, to establish
beyond all controversy the truth of their sepulchral origin.     It
                                                                has
considers the Egyptian Apis as a symbol of the Patriarch.    He supports his opi
nion by authority from Ruffinus (Historic Ecclesiastic*, lib. ii. cap. 33.) ; and
derives evidence from Augustin, (Script. Mirab.\. i.e. 15.)/ to prove that the
Egyptians placed an ox near the sepulchre of Joseph.  It appears also from Suidas
                                                                Joseph : " Quo ut
(voce ^x(xms), that Ans was by some considered a symbol of
 magis iiiclinem facit" observes Vossius, te quod Josephits Deut. cap. penult, com-
 mate 17, bos vocetur, secundum        codices Hebratos."     But if Api3 were the same as
 Joseph, so must also be Serapis (or Sarapis. as it is written by the Greek?) and
 Osiris; for these are but different names of the same mythological personage.
"   Factus est Joseph quasi rex totius Mgypli, et vocavervnt eum Apis," says Kircher
 (CEdip. Mgypt. torn. i. p. 196. Rom. 1652) ; awfhe gives u? from Varro tha rea
 son why he was called Serapis: " Quia Area (inquit Varr.') in qui. pnsitus erat,
 Grace seu ASgyptici dicitur 2oji,-, unde t'givnt, quasi Area Apis, deinde, un& literA
 mutata,T'ti*ris dictus est." Also according to Strabo, Apis was the same as Osiris.
"Of trrn ("Arts) 2 aureg         'oWgii (lib. xvii. p. 1 14. Ed. Oxon.)   Hence it may be
 inferred, that as Joseph, together with the names of Aris and Seratis, also bore
 that of Osiris, the annual mournings which took pi ice in Egypt for the loss of
 Osiris'! body, and the exhibition of an empty Soro': upon those occasions, were
 ceremonies derived from the loss of Josephs body, which had been caried away by
 the Hebrews when they left the country.            Julius Pirmicns, who 6ourished under
 the two sons of Constantine, endeavours to explain the reason (De Error. Profan,
  Relig.) why Joseph was called Sfrapis.           In opposition to the origin assigned by
 Varro, for the name Serapis, it may be observed, that Plutarch (De hid. el Osir.
 c. 29) derives a notion which prevailed maintaining that Serapis was no god, but
 a mere name for the sepulchral          chest where the body of Apis was deposited :
 Oi/x iTmh 9-iav coir TZoiQaLvrtY,£\?.a thv 'AIIJAOX XOl*ON ovrw iyofjLa^ieSai.         But
 things which were rejected by trie Greeks as inconsistent with their religious opi
 nions, may come much nearer, on this account, to truth and to our own.              A very
 popular opinion has long been entertained, concerning an extraneous idol brought
 to Alexandria, by one of the Ptolomies, from the coast of Pontus, which received
 the appellation of Serapis upon its arrival in Egypt; but the word Serapis is
 purely Egyptian. . . .and Jablonski has refuted the opinion, by proving that Serapis
 was worshipped in Memphis long before the time of the Ptolomies, (Panlh. Egypt.
 lib. ii. e. 5. p. 233. Frank. 1750.) and by showing from Eustathius that the
 whole story of this Sinopic deity was derived from Sinopium near Memphis. Thus
 Tacitus, " sedtm ex qui transierit (Serapis) Memphin pcrhibent, inclytam olim, et
 reteris Egypti columen."       Vet Gibbon seems to imply (Hill. c. 28. vol. v. p. 90.
 Load. 1807) that both the 7iame and the idol were alike strangers to the priests of
 Egypt ; and he sneers at the notion of Vossius, that the patriarch Joseph had been
  adored in the country as the bull Apis, and the god Serapis. (Ibid, see note 36.)
 The reader may eonsult the learned observations of Bochart upon this subject
 (Hierozoicon, tom. i. I.ii,  c. 34, pp. 345, 346, 347, 348), and alsoof Jablonski, upon
  which Gibbon may have grounded his scepticism, although he has not mentioned
 his authors.     The following passage of Apollodorus, as cited by Bochart, proves
 the name Serapis to be of ancient date in Egypt " Apis, relatus inter Deos, Serapis
                                                    :
 appellatus est."    Upon the identity of Serapis and Joseph many learned writers
  are agreed.    "Sunt qui Arm et Serapidem unum numen putarint, etper Serapidem
 Josephom intellexcrint;    nec veritati contraria videtuIJ h«c opinio." (Cunaus dp
Uepub. Hcb. Annot. Nicolai, c. 17. not. 14. Thes. Anlia. Sac. Ugolini, Venet. 1745).

 has been already shown, that of themselves they constitute but
 remaining traces of a custom common to all the nations of an
 tiquity. An ancient tumulus for men of princely rank seems
 very generally to have consisted of three parts ; the Soros, the
 Pile or Heap, and the Stele. Of these, Homer mention's two
 at once ; as being those parts of a tumulus which were exter
 nally visible. As the practice occasionally varied among different
 nations, only one of these was used to denote an ancient burying-
 place.        In Asia Minor, the Soros, of gigantic proportion, some
 times stood alone, without the Pile and the Sle/S.                             In Scythia
 and in many northern countries the Pile only appears. In Greece
 perhaps, although no instance is decidedly known, the simple
  Stele, without the Pile, might serve to denote the grave of a
  deceased        person*. The Pile or Heap was generally nothing
  more than a lofty mound of earth : more rarely it was a magni
  ficent pyramid.             A square platform was left, in some instances,
  upon the tops of those pyramids, as a pedestal for the Stele"                           ....
  Hence originated the appellation of Hermetic Stelcr (because
  Hermes had the care of the dead), and all the Grecian mytho
  logy connected with themf.                       In America pyramids were built
  in this manner by the ancient inhabitants of. that great continent.
  That those pyramids were also tempKs is true ; because all an
  cient sepulchres were objects of worship, and tombs were the
  origin of temples                  By the account which Gmelli gives of the
  Mexican pyramids at Teotiguatan (a place of Gods,' ox of Ado
  ration), they were erected, like the Egyptian Pyramids, for se
  pulchres.          The first he saw was the pyramid of the Moon, about
   150 feet in height.                "It    was made," he says,-" of earth, in
  steps, like the Pyramids of Egypt ;" and on the top of it was a
  great stone idol of the Moon ". The pyramid of the Sun was
  Indeed the number of authors and commentators by whom this opinion is main
  tained may be considered as more than a counterpoise to the objections of Boehart
  and of JablonsKi.       Tirinus (Annot. in Sutpit.Sever. p. 59. Ed. Horn. L. Bat. 1654)
  in addit-on to the authorities above cited mentions also Picrius and Raronius: and
  he further observes, *' ltlque patet, turn ex nomine Serapis quod Bovem notat;

surrounded by sepulchres of a more diminutive form, the Mexi

artificial mounts, supposed to be burying-places             of lords."
Another instance, and more remarkable for the similitude it
bears to the principal pyramid of Egypt, is the great pyramid of
Papantla mentioned by Humboidt, in which mortar may be
discerned in the interstices between the stones.      It is an edifice of
very high antiquity, and was always an object of veneration
among the Mexicans.

 Esq.   for his prompt   and  kind attention in p. 233, to a part of
 my Queries in p. 108 of your Magazine.         It seems now I think,
that the " bivalve shells" of Mr. W. are the Myae ovatce of
 William Martin, and that the " Grindstone sill" of W. Forster
 (fathom 244 to 247) is a far lower stratum than the Gateshead-
fell Grindstone sill : but I am still left in ignorance, of the par
ticular strata to which these Mye and Newcastle Grindstone
 Quarries, are to be respectively referred ? and I presume -there
fore to prefer these further requests to Mr. W. or any other kind
 friend of Geological investigation : requesting, in order to avoid
mistakes, that they will mention the Name of the stratum and
 Fathom on Mr. Forster's attached scale, in each instance.

of the requested information from the respectable keeper of the

wood, mutilated fish, pentacrinites, &c." are rarely found in
that neighbourhood, in the undisturbed substratum to the hard
or flintless chalk (whether named Chalk-marl or Gait, is very
immaterial), or whether some of these Reliquia have not been
taken from the superficial alluvial* Clay?.               I presume however
again, respectfully to prefer the above request to the Rev. Mr.

LIII. Mr.      Bakewejx in Reply to Mr. Frere; and on            sotae
                   peculiar Properties of Light.
                          To       Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, — A Correspondent            in your last Magazine, who signs
himself   J.   H. Frere, has been pleased to insinuate       that the
sketch representing the arrangement of the strata from the Ger
man ocean to the Irish channel, given in the preceding number,
was taken from a section he had previously made and sent copies
of to the Rev. W. Turner and Mr. Wynch, of Newcastle, and to             ,
Mr. Greenough, in London. I trust I shall be allowed sufficient
space to repel the accusation, though it is with regret that I oc
cupy a part of your pages with subjects of a personal nature. —
Until I saw the letter of Mr. Frere's, I had never before heard
either of that gentleman or his section ; but I immediately wrote
to Mr. Turner for an explanation, who informs me that some
months after I returned from Newcastle, Mr. Frere did send a
section there; but I can confidently appeal to Mr. Turner, Mr.
Wynch, or atiy person in that place, that I never received from
them the slightest notice of its existence.      I can make the like
appeal to Mr. Greenough ; and as I have not been at the rooms
of the Geological Society for more than two years, I have never
seen it there, nor have I heard of it from any of the members ;
(it  may be observed that the Society has not thought proper
to give   it   place in their recently published volume of Trans
               a
actions;) nor can Mr. Frere name any other person who has
either directly or indirectly acquainted me with his section.
I  believe Mr. Farey and many other gentlemen interested in such
subjects were equally ignorant of Mr. Frere's section. The sketch
sent you was laid down on Cary's large Map of England, which
your engraver reduced.     I   did not attempt more than    a  general
resemblance of the surface outline.         In one now engraving for
the second edition of my Introduction to Geology,       I    have en
deavoured to preserve the contour of the principal mountains.
What coincidence either of these may have with Mr. Frere's
section,  I  am to this hour unacquainted with    ;   butif   two de
lineations of the same object laid down on the same ground-plan,
and where the characters are so strongly marked, have not a near
resemblance, one or both must be manifestly erroneous.            The
part   between  Cross  Fell and   Burtreeford  Dyke  was  drawn  from
Mr. Forster's description  :   all the other parts were the result of
my own observations and inquiries.            In my Introduction to
Geology in 1813,    I   described several sections across England,
and in my Lectures at the Russell Institution in February 1812,
J  exhibited   asection of the rock formations between Hull and
                                                            Liverpool.

29S             Mr.    Bakewell in Reply   to Mr. Frere,
Liverpool.      Mr. Frere might with equal justice say that these _
were also copied from his labours.
    In the last nuniber of the Monthly Magazine, an anonymous
writer has repeated the same charge respecting Mr. Frere's
section, mixed up with some illiberal reflections on Dr. Thomson
and myself, for having published An Account of the Geology of
Northumberland and Durham. We have indeed been guilty of
regretting the too great apathy respecting the destruction of hu
man life by explosions in the mines ; and if this have given offence,
1 am willing to bear my share of the censure : but with respect
to the publication of information given by others in an impro
per manner, I utterly disclaim the charge as false.    The only one
who could have the slightest grounds for complaint, is the gen
tleman who I since understand has written a paper on the same
subject (Mr. Wynch); but I have his assurance communicated to
 a mutual friend, that he has not now, nor ever had, the least
 reason for complaint against me for what 1 have published.
     To return to Mr. Frere. From his letter it might be inferred,
 that after he had made his section, he put the mountains into
 his pocket to prevent any one from attempting the same thing.
 If he has done so, let me entreat him to place them in their old
 station again, and content himself with threats of pains and
 penalties against all future drawers of plans and sections.     The
 observations from which my section was framed, were, however,
 made previously to Mr. Frere's monopoly of the mountains ; 1
 ought not therefore to incur his displeasure.
     Mr. F. says, If my section were not copied from his, he must
 place himself in the degrading situation of having copied from
 me. This is a dilemma of his own choosing; but I may tell him
 without fear of contradiction, that, he has placed himself in the
 more unpleasant situation, of having brought forward an accusa
 tion without any evidence whatever to advance in its support.
 From this difficulty Mr. Frere can only extricate himself by can
 didly admitting that he has fallen into a mistake (perhaps not
 very uncommon in life), namely, that of supposing himself and
 his labours to be better known than was really the case.
     In what I have stated, I by no means wish to be understood
  as disparaging Mr. Frere's section, which I have not seen.    From
  his residence in the country, it is reasonable to presume that
  it may be a more correct representation thaft the one I have
  given ; and I hope Mr. Frere will favour the public with an
  engraving and description of it : I can assure him there .is no
  one to whom the publication will give greater pleasure than to
  myself.

             and on some peculiar Properties    of Light.           299
     P. S. — The very ingenious experiments of Captain Kater (in the
last volume of the Philosophical Transanctions) on the different
quantities of light' reflected by the Gregorian and Cassegrain
telescopes with specula of the same aperture, appear to prove
that when the rays of light converge to a focus, a considerable
part of them are (as far as affects the sight) extinguished before
they diverge again.       I do not know whether similar experiments
have been made with refracting telescopes, with a view to confirm
this fact ; but there is one case well known to the earliest optical
writers that has hitherto been unexplained, but which I conceive
 offers a Ml and decisive confirmation of the same phenomenon.
 In the original telescope of Galileo with a concave eye-glass,
 the rays are intercepted before they come to a focus ; and
though this construction was laid generally aside on account of
 the small field of view ; yet such is the superior brilliancy of the
 effect, that Jupiter's satellites may be seen with a common re-
 fracter of twenty inches in length, with a concave eye- piece, more
 distinctly than with one of four feet when a convex eye-glass is
 used.     Having when a school-boy amused myself with the con
 struction of telescopes of this kind, I was well acquainted with
 the effect : on referring to optical writers for the cause, I was
 informed that it arose from the concave glass being much thinner;
 and by later writers, that the effect was produced by the flint glass
 of the eye-piece correcting in some degree the aberration fror.-
 the different refrangibility of the rays, as in the achromatic ob
ject glass. Without denying that both the above causes may con
 tribute something to the superior brilliancy of the object, I am
 persuaded that the solution which is offered by Capt. Kater 's
 experiments is the only one that will fully account for the dif
 ferent affects of the convex and concave eye-glasses in refracting
  telescopes.    It is much to be desired that Capt. Kater, or others
 who have leisure for such experiments, would prosecute these
  inquiries, as they cannot fail to contribute much to the improve
  ment of optical instruments.       They will also elucidate one of
  the most interesting subjects of philosophical investigation, re
 specting the effects produced by the rays impinging on different

  still more extraordinary effect of their impact on each other as
  they converge to a focus.       Those who have attended to the
  experiments of M. Malus and Dr. Brewster will immediately
  perceive the importance of Capt. Kater's discovery in reference to
  the phenomena of the polarisation of light.        If the particles of
  light have each a positive and negative or attracting and repel
  ling pfje, as certain experiments appear to indicate, may not the
  opposing poles of some of the particles be brought so near to
                                                                    each

      L1V. On Coal Formations.           By W. H. Gilbt, Esq.
                              To Mr.  Tilloch.
Sir, —The       following remarks have originated from a paper of
Mr. Farey's in the last number of the Philosophical Magazine,
respecting the coal formations in North Wales, and the relation
of the red ground to the coal and its accompanying strata. From
the general tenor of this paper, Mr. Farey seems to claim the
credit of having first brought forward to the notice of the public,
the fact that the different beds of the red ground so widely distri
buted through many parts of England, lie in an unconformable
position over the inclined coal measures.        If that gentleman had-
consulted a description of the neighbourhood of Bristol, which
you did me the favour of inserting in one of your late numbers,
he would have found that this circumstance had been then most
explicitly detailed.        The arrangement which for the sake of
method and clearness I followed in that paper was entirely founded
Upon this very circumstance.        For as the formations in the neigh
bourhood of Bristol consist either of inclined strata or of such
as lie " unconformably in an horizontal position upon the tops of
the inclined strata;" I began by describing those of the first de
scription, comprehending the inclined coal measures, the moun
 tain limestone, and other rocks which dip under them. I then
proceeded to treat of the unconformable horizontal series, be
ginning from the beds of the red marl and passing upwards to
the Fyas, &c.     As this account was printed in a journal which
Mr. Farey is in the habit of making the repository of his prac
tical olieervations, I cannot suppose that he was unacquainted
with it ; and as he has alluded to no writer who had noticed the
fact before him, he plainly wishes to appear as the first an,-
nouncer of it.      It is ivery evident, therefore, that Mr. Farey lias
acted in an unfair and disingenuous manner in manoeuvring for
himself a gloriola, which he does not deserve ; and whatever con
sequence may be attached to the observation, — and I clearly see
that it is of considerable importance to coal proprietors, — I shall
at least be entitled to the priority of having ascertained it before
Mr. Farey, inasmuch as my paper was printed full half a year
before his. — I cannot suppose that Mr. Townsend is ignorant of
the relation which the red ground bears to the coal measures ;

                      New Process for Emetic Tartar.                        SOI
 \mt, I believe, it would not be very easy to collect the fact from
 his writings.   As far as I yet know, my description of the forma
 tions in the neighbourhood of Bristol contained the first and
 most distinct information as to the unconformable position of the
 beds of the red ground over the inclined coal measures j and at
 this moment it is peculiarly gratifying to me to state, that Pro
 fessor Jameson, while lecturing during the course of last week
 upon coal, did me the honour to allude to my paper, and at the
 same time mentioned me, as having first observed the real posi
 tion of the red ground, in regard to the coal and its accom
 panying strata.
    As Mr. Farey plumes himself so much upon his practical
 knowledge, and as he seems to have seen so much of the red
 ground, I cannot but be surprised that he has been so long in
 the dark as to the beds of the red ground overlying the tops of
 the. inclined strata.    This formatioii must have very different
characters in the country where that gentleman has seen               it,
                                                                    from
those which   it exhibits in the district which has been the sub
ject of my examination.         There the most incurious observer
 could not but remark, in very many places, the beds of the red
ground, that     isto say, the coarse breccia, the red calcareous
sand-stone, and sometimes          loose clay-stone abounding with
                                     a
gypsum, occurring in an unconformable situation, sometimes over
the coal measures, and at other times over the inclined rocks
that inclose the coal tract. These remarks,            believe, will be
                                                           I
sufficient to show   that Mr.  Farey  has  claimed  what   he has not         a
fraction of  a right to   ;  shall therefore
                              1               conclude          by

Bristol, as also some observations respecting the red ground, the

                              To    Mr.    Tilloch.
Sir, — About      two years ago,    was requested
                                         I            some mem by
bers of   the Royal College of Physicians, to turn my thoughts to

302                New Process        for   Emetic Tartar.
the preparation   of Emetic Tartar, and more especially to such
processes   as   would admit of the common black sulphuret of
antimony being employed.
  Having- succeeded" in my endeavours to attain this object,            and
received the most ample testimonials from my friends and many
other practical chemists, of the perfection, practicability, and,
saving in respect to expense, by following this process, I shall
on the present occasion, just mention in general terms the pre
scription itself, and then leave any observations I may have to
offer on the subject, or on the labours of others who have pre
ceded me, for another opportunity.     .
                 ANTIMOJflUM TaRTARISATUM.
   Two parts of black sulphuret of antimony in fine powder, aril?
one part of nitrate of potash are to be mixed and added to two
parts of sulphuric acid, previously mixed with eight parts of wa
ter and suffered to cool.   By a due application of heat a proper
oxide of antimony will be formed, which when thoroughly washed
is to be boiled, while yet moist, with two parts of supertartrale
of potash and a proper quantity of water. The solution is then
to be filtrated, evaporated, and treated after the usual manner
for crystallization.
   Although I succeeded by other methods, peculiarly my own,
to prepare this very important medicine, yet, upon the whole,
I am disposed to prefer the formula which I now lay before you,
more particularly as it is sanctioned with the decided approba
tion of those whom 1 wished to serve and consult.
   I have here adopted the nomenclature of the College, which,
after all, is as correct and convenient as any other that has been
proposed for this article.    I profess, indeed, to be an advocate
for many of the arbitrary names, especially for such bodies as are
beyond a binary composition ; and, where the ingredients enter,
as in emetic tartar, alum, Rochelle salt, &c. in definite propor
tions, the rule is perfectly admissible ; I should propose, there
fore, to retain both these preparations of tartar, at least under
their present titles, viz. antimonium tartarisatum and soda tar-
tarisata.

 Sir, —     I would heg leave to recommend to your agricultural
 readers the use of the liquor produced in the distillation of coal,
 at the Gas Light Establishments, as a valuable manure.          It con
 tains principally carbonate of ammonia; and this, according to
 Sir H. Davy in his Elements of Agricultural Chemistry, quarto,
 page 297, was found to produce more luxuriant effects upon
 some plants on which he tried                      it,
                                        than any other saline/ solution
 he made use of.        And he very justly observes, that this result-
 might be expected for carbonate of ammonia consists of carbon,
                             ;
 hydrogen, oxygen, and azote, the principles of which all vege
tables are composed. But from the circumstance of this liquor
 containing      little sulphur, there
                   a                        another valuable property
                                                          is                                 it
 possesses as     manure.

                                                                        it
  of destroying insects and grubs which frequently prove so de
  structive to growing crops.       In the proportion of one gallon to
  sixteen or eighteen of water,       may be applied to all green crops
                                               it
  with effect.
     The tar that       produced inthe same operation, when mixed
                         is
  very largely with    soil in the proportion of      gallon to about   a                     a
  wheelbarrow of mould or marl, and this mixture used as            com                  a
  post and ploughed in, or applied as          top dressing, will also be

 are seen: with the first lens the colours appear in a line 5 when
 the second lens is added to     it,  the fringes of colours then assume

 Coloured rings also appear in these experiments, the same as                in
 Dr. Herschel's researches. Mr. K. used black card, the same

 to prevent the appearance of coloured concentric rings, and the
better to observe the nature and modulations of the fringes, which
had not been observed,      by   preceding experimenters, and of which
 he endeavoured to make tolerably accurate drawings.                The au
thor very modestly avoids drawing any hasty general conclusions
 from his experiments, but seems to think that reflection and re
fraction are sufficient to explain all the phe'nomena of coloured
 concentric rings, by the solution or separation and combination
 of rays without any intervening plate of air, or fits of easy trans
 mission, as supposed by Newton.              He found that   in   vacuo, in
water,   or  in air, the  same    rings   were   produced;   but  nitric and
other heavy     acids  destroyed    both   the rings and  colours.

years ago (1793) on this subject.             He chiefly dwelt on   a    NVV
current proceeding from Cape Finisterre to Cape Clear and the
Scilly Isles; his facts were taken from old journals kept on dead
reckonings in 1737, and some books on navigation published in
 1755.     He also mentioned the experiment of a bottle being
carried by   a  NE current to Cape Ortegal, &c.
    April 20. Part of a very curious and important paper                bySir
H. Davy was read, detailing some of his new and curious ex
periment, and discoveries 011 the combinations of iodine with
oxvgen and the acids.       It    appears that when oxygen         is  com
bined with iodine,    it first  assumes     apastey or gelatinous appear
ance, and afterwards becomes solid          ;   with sulphuric and nitric
acids something similar occurs         : these solid combinations Sir H.
very properly calls oxyiodats, as they differ very materially from
all "the other salts the names of which terminate in ale. Gay
Lussac, however, having anticipated the existence of such bodies,
proposed*to call them iodates     ;     but this name, Sir H. justly ob
serves, conveys  a   very erroneous idea of their real character, which
is  singular and interesting.       The colour of these salts approaches
to violet, according to the quantity of uncombined iodine pre
sent in them.                                                         royal

      'Sir. Brande's seventh lecture related exclusively to the disco
  veries of Mr. Cavendish, and to the state of chemical philoso
  phy at the period at which he terminated his successful career.
     Although Van Helmont, Mayow, and others were acquainted
  with mflammable gaseous fluids, the nature of the principle upon
  which their inflammability depended had been but very imper
  fectly guessed at, till Mr. Cavendish turned his mind to the
  subject, and published upon it in the Philosophical Transactions
  for 1766.     The nature and properties of inflammable air are
  there dwelt upon with a masterly perspicuity, and its leading
  peculiarities particularly developed.
     That the combustion of a mixture of this air with common
  air produced moisture or dew, had been observed by Macquer,
  Priestley, and others ; but its source was hidden until exposed by
  the acute suggestion of Mr. Watt, and the decisive experiments
  of Mr. Cavendish, who burned by means of the electric spark a
  mixture of two measures of inflammable air, and one of dephlo-
  gisticated air, and obtained an equivalent weight of pure water :
  thus was the composition of this -universal fluid (till then deemed
  elementary) demonstrated with an exactness and precision of
  which chemists had hitherto had no example.-
      Mr. Brande said, that the subject upon which he was then
  engaged was of such consequence in the history of the French
  chemical revolution, of which he should consider the merits
  and demerits in his next lecture, that it would be proper to ex
  hibit a few analytic proofs of the correctness of Mr. Cavendish's
  general views.     The decomposition of steam by red hot iron, and
  of water by the galvanic batten-, were then shown.
      Several singular properties of hydrogen, or inflammable air,
  were illustrated ; especially the production of musical tones by
  the combustion of the gas in tubes of different diameters and
  materials.
      Having noticed Mr. Cavendish's second great discovery, that
  of the composition of nitric acid, the Professor entered at some
   length into the discussions which had arisen concerning the
  identity of hydrogen and phlogiston, and showed, by several ap
  posite experiments, the additional strength and probability which
   the phlogistic hypothesis had attained in consequence of the dis
   covery of inflammable air: he said that, in treating of the anti
  phlogistic doctrines, he should draw a comparison between the
. facts upon which they are founded, and those wllfch support
   Stahl's notions. Having put his audience in possession of Mr.
   Cavendish's principal discoveries, Mr. Brande digressed shortly
  t. Vol.45. No. 203. /ipril\815,-             U                    upon

Upon the peculiar genius and talents of the discoverer : he espe
cially praised the mathematical precision and statical accuracy
which glitter in his dissertations.     He should not endeavour to
draw a parallel between the philosophical character of Mr. Ca
vendish, and that of his fellow labourers in science, for he ad--
 mitted not of comparison ; *' he was himself alone."
    Towards the conclusion of his lecture the Professor summed
 up the additions which the labours of Black, Priestley, Scheele,
 and Cavendish, had made to the stock of chemical knowledge ;
 the elements of the ancients had vanished before them ; air and
 water had each been decompounded, and had yielded new ele
 ments ; their properties had been investigated, and tHe inquiry
 had thrown am entire new light upon the science : such were the
 favourable auspices under which Lavoisier and his associates
 entered the field of chemical philosophy.
     Mr. Brande in his eighth lecture resumed his History of
 Chemical Philosophy with the discoveries of Lavoisier and the
 views of the French School.      With Lavoisier, as with his prede
 cessors in the field of theoretical chemistry, the phenomena of
 combustion were a leading object of attention, and Black's
 theory of latent heat was assumed as the groundwork of his new
 views.   Oxygen was considered as the only supporter of com
 bustion ; in its gaseous state it was'regarded as a compound of
 a peculiar basis, combined with light and heat ; during the pro
 cess of combustion the ponderable basis united to the burning
 body, while the light and heat were developed in the form of
 flame.   Oxygen, as its name imports, was also looked upon as a
 necessary constituent of all acids — it was described as the uni
 versal acidifying principle.
    Having illustrated these views by experiment, and enlarged
 upon their applications by the French chemists, the Professor
 proceeded to notice the weak and faulty parts of the theory which
 had been raised upon them.       In regard to the evolution of heat
 and light depending upon the transition of oxygen from the
 gaseous to the solid form, Mr. Brande remarked, that it often
took place during the change of that principle from its solid or
liquid,- to its aeriform state ; as in the combustion of gun
powder, and of -oil of turpentine and nitric acid ; that the re
sult of combustion inoxygen gas was often itself gaseous, and
that numerous substances burned with great energy and splen
dour, independent of the presence of aeriform matter : this was
shown by several experiments ; the most striking was the vivid
combustion*bf phosphorus, on being brought into contact with
iodine in an exhausted receiver.       As to the necessary presence
of oxygen in acidsj the Professor remarked, that although many

                          Royal Instittttion.                              307
acids contain  it, there are many without       and that

                                                        ;    exists
                                                                  it
in the alkalies and in the earths    this was well illustrated by
                                       :
the combustion of sulphur in oxygen, which produced sulphurous
acid:  the acid thus formed was then transferred to          retort
                                                                  a
containing potassium, which was made to burn in             it,
                                                         and thus
generate an alkali oxygen was therefore exhibited alternately
                     :
as an element of an acid, and an alkali.
   Hence we are to conclude, in direct opposition to the tenets
of the French School, that acidity   not dependent upon oxygen,
                                       is
but upon the basis   it unites to  and that combustion may be
                                   ;
equally independent of oxygen, and must be considered as        re     a
sult of powerful chemical action, or other violent motion of the
atoms of bodies, not as ensuing from the mutual agencies of any
appropriate principles.
   The identity of charcoal and the diamond was one of the most
singular and important of Lavoisier's original discoveries: he had
shown that both produced fixed air or carbonic acid during com
bustion; and  it  was since supposed to have been proved that the
quantity  of fixed air generated   byburning the diamond in oxy
gen, was exactly equal to that obtained from the same weight
of charcoal.    The Professor said that the most eminent chemists
had been engaged in this inquiry; he exhibited their different
modes of experimenting, and noticed particularly the elegant re
searches of Mr. Tennant, whose loss society has lately had to de
plore.
   Mr. Brande concluded this part of his subject with the in
vestigations instituted by Lavoisier to ascertain the nature of the
atmosphere, and the proportions of its component parts, and
terminated his lecture with a short account of the character of
that philosopher, and of his melancholy death during the vio
lence of the revolution in 1794.

   " By some," said the Professor, he has been extolled as the
most towering genius of his age, by others stigmatized with the
dishonours of plagiarism; but these are the extremes of panegyric
and malevolence, each equidistant         from candour and truth.
His merits were distinct and peculiar but those who have cen

sured him with the uncandid appropriation of the thoughts and
discoveries of Rey and Mayow, of Black and of Priestley, have
unquestionably some grounds for the accusation.          Let us re
member, however, that Lavoisier was never fairly confronted
with his rivals and antagonists;    that unintentional inadvertency
often hangs upon scientific ardour     ;that in the eagerness of pur
suit he may have neglected that which in a calmer hour he would
have seen, regretted, and acknowledged         and that in the hurry
                                                   ;
Of discussion, and heat of controversy, he was summoned to
 eternity with all his imperfections on his head."

      The reading of the " Essay on the Origin, Progress, and pre
  sent State of Galvanism, with Observations on the Inadequacy
  of the Hypotheses, &c. &c." by M. Donovan, Esq. Secretary,
  was continued.
-     April 5. Examination of the hypothesis of Volta. — An arranged
  statement of this, philosopher's opinions was first given, with the
  fundamental experiments on which these opinions were grounded.
  The principle of the disturbance of the electric equilibrium was
  first discussed.    It was conceived that, for reasons assigned, this
  principle is repugnant to the known laws of electricity ; that it
  is not supported by any of Volta's experiments but one, and that
  this lies under a two-fold objection : first, it admits of a different
  explanation ; and next, it has not succeeded             in the hands of
  others.    The structure of the pile apparently affords a proof
  that contact produces electricity : but experiments were adduced,
  which appeared to prove" that during the contact of the plates
  there is no electrical appearance, that these are produced be
  fore the contact takes place, and after it is broken ; or, in other
  words, that the evolution of electricity happens when the plates
  are at a minute distance asunder.         The experiments of Wilson
  proved that during contact the electrometer is not affected :
  new experiments were detailed, showing that metallic electricity
  obeys the common law, and that contact of conductors instead
  of disturbing restores the equilibrium.          The effects of placing a
  metal between two others of a similar kind were next examined.
  Volta conceives that two electric currents are excited in oppo
  site directions, which therefore destroy each other : hence, in
  such a situation of the tl ree metals, the equilibrium is main
  tained, and accordingly the electrometer is not affected.             The
  author showed, that the three metallic pieces thus arranged
  display phenomena which do not belong to these metals under
  ordinary circumstances ; and, therefore, since the electricity is
  in a state of repose, what is the cause of the effects. A great
  variety of other considerations were adduced, from the whole of
  which the precise state of the question concerning the agency
  of contact was concluded to be as follows.          The principle is op
  posed   by  the laws  of electricity : it  is  founded    on experiments
  which admit of a different explanation, which were made with
  a doubtful apparatus, which did not afford similar results when,
  mstruments less liable to fallacy were employed, hut in some
  cases entirely opposite : it is proved that contact instead of dis
  turbing restores the equilibrium ; and that some phsenomena of
  contact are inexplicable by this principle, whether the electricity
  be in action or at rest.
                                                                   Waving

                   Kirwaman Society     of Dublin.              309
   Waving the objections to this part of the hypothesis, a trial
was made how far the phenomena of galvanism are explained
by the principle in question, supposing it true.    A series of ar
guments were adduced, tending to show that the increasing po
sitive and negative states of the pile towards the top and bot
tom are not made necessary, but rather counterindicated by the
hypothesis : and that contact with both ends of the pile ought -mjt
to be necessary in order to receive the shock.         Experiments
made with a pile of a thousand plates of highly polished, zinc
and copper plates were detailed, the results of which were con
sidered to prove that the electric states of the extremities a'fe'
very different from what has been supposed by Volta and others.
The effect of the saline solution interposed in the pile was
shown to have little relation to its conducting power, and the
efficacy of oxidation of the plates, as supposed by Volta, was
considered highly improbable : but this part of the subject was
deferred for a future discussion.
    II. Examination of the hypothesis of Fabroni. — This hypo
thesis is directly opposed to that of Volta: in the latter, electri
city is supposed to be the cause, and the chemical phenomena
no more than effects : in the former, the chemical action is con
ceived to be the cause, and the electrical appearances are con
sidered effects.   That the effects called galvanic are always pro
duced in consequence of chemical action, and never else, the
 author conceived to be a true proposition in its fullest extent ;
and experiments to prove that there is not one militating instance,
had been already laid before the Society in the statement of a
new theory of galvanism.       The other principles of Fabroni's
hypothesis it was considered unnecessary minutely to investigate,
as several facts and arguments adduced were plainly irreconcile-
able to them.     The consideration of the main proposition of
this hypothesis, it was observed, came under discussion in a more
advanced period of the essay.
    III. Examination of the medium hypothesis adopted by the
British philosophers. — Drs. Wollaston and Bosfbck were the first
who attempted to reconcile the two preceding hypotheses: with
Volta they considered electricity the agent, but with Fabroni
supposed that this electricity was evolved in consequence of che
mical action. Sir H. Davy proposed a further modification.
 He conceives with Volta, that the contact of the metals is the
primary exciting cause of the evolved electricity; that electricity
is the agent in galvanic phenomena ; but with Fabroni he al
lows that chemical changes are essential to the continued action
of the pile. The disturbance of the equilibrium by contact, it
was observed, lies in this hypothesis under the same objections
as in that of Volta.    The exaltation of the two states of electri-
                                  U 3                            city

      city in the galvanic series, attributed by Sir H. Davy to induclU/nt
      was conceived to be not founded upon any known law of electri
      city: in all cases of induction, the intensity induced is never
     greater than that of the inducing cause ; and this was illustrated
      by various experiments.          Numerous objections were made to
      this explanation ; amongst others it was stated that the princi
      ple of induction is unnecessary, that it cannot operate, that if it
      aid it would not explain the phenomena, that it excludes the
      state of electric neutrality known to exist in the middle of the
      pile.    It was also objected, that although the hypothesis con
      ceives the separation of the differently electric elements of the
      saline solution interposed in the series to depend on the difference
       of electric state in the metals, yet the same separat ion is effected
  '
      in cases where experiment proves that negative electricity is not
      present.     Considerations were also adduced, which seemed to
      show that neither positive nor negative electricity acts any part
       in the separation of the combined elements.
           In the hypothesis of Davy, water is assumed to be an insula
       tor: and upon this question rest the claims of the whole. Va
       rious experiments were stated, designed to prove that water is
       a very perfect conductor of low intensities, and whenever it is an
       imperfect conductor, that it is only to the highest intensities.
       But whether water be or be not an insulator, the result was sup
       posed to be equally unfavourable : if its insulating power be de
       nied, every principle of this doctrine is subverted ; if admitted,
       it opposes some of the facts which it was intended to explain.
       Various other imperfections of Sir H. Davy's views were noticed;
       and this part of the essay concluded with some general remarks
       on the contradictory nature of the fundamental principles of
       galvanic hypotheses.

            M. Augustus St. Hilaire, whose papers on Botany have           been
       frequently mentioned, has this year made some observations on
      .several families of plants, in which the placenta, i. e. the part of
/       the fruit to which the seeds adhere, is simple, and placed in the
        midst of the fruit like a column on an axis.
           When the summit of this column is free, the route by which
        the influences of the pollen are transmitted from the pistil to the
        seeds seems to be sufficiently complicated,         and is formed by
        vessels which creep along even the sides of the fruit, in order to
        penetrate into the placenta by its base, and proceed to the seeds
        side by side with the nutritive vessels.       Such is in fact the pro
                                                                          gress

   gress of these vessels in the Amarcmlaeece, according to M. St.
   Hilaire; but this observer     has remarked that in most of the
   plants of the class at present under his observation, and particu
  larly in the Primulacece, the Porlulacece, and the Caryophyllece,
  the fecundation is produced in a more direct way ; and for this
  purpose there exist originally very slender vessels proceeding
  from the basis of the style to the summit of the placenta.      These
  threads are destroyed after fecundation, and it is then only that
   the summit of the placenta becomes free.
      M. St. Hilaire also adopts, as constant, the existence of a
  point or of a pore different from the umbilicus, by which the
  fecundating vessels arrive at the grain, and to which M. Turpin,
  as mentioned in a preceding report, has given the name of mi-
  cropiiis.                                                    «
      The purely botanical part of M. St. Hilaire's memoir pre
  sents many observations in detail, unfortunately very little sus
  ceptible of analysis, on the particular characters of certain plants
  of the families which he has examined, some of which seemed
  to him to serve as the types for new genera, and others ought to
  pass into families different from that in which certain imperfect
  observations had hitherto placed them.
     The pisang, banana, or fig-tree of Adam is a herbaceous
 plant, of the height of a tree, very remarkable by the enormous
 extent of its leaves, and celebrated for the utility of its fruits,
 which furnish the inhabitants of the torrid zone with one of the
 principal articles of their food.      Cultivation has multiplied its
 varieties to such an extent, that there are as many kinds of it as
 of apple or pear trees.
     M. Desvaux, who has collected all that has been written on
 the banana, has reckoned forty-four varieties in the common
 species, or the musa paradisiaca of Linneus, and three species
 distinct from that : viz. the musa sapientutn Linn., the musa
 cocchiea now quite common in Europe, and the ensete de
 scribed by Bruce in his Travels.
     The fig-tree has undergone still more numerous modifications
in the hands of cultivators. Marquis Suffrein, who resides in Pro
vence, which is so famous for its figs, has taken the trouble to
enlighten cultivators as to the true method of bringing the fig-
 tree to perfection.     He has already made known 162 varieties,
 and his researches are not yet terminated.
     M. Thiebaut de Berneaux, who purposes to give a French
 translation of the works of Theophrastus, and who, in order to as
certain with more accuracy the vegetables mentioned by this
celebrated successor of Aristotle, has performed several journeys
in the countries where these vegetables grow, and has presented
to the Class some of the results already obtained, not only in the

species indicated by Theophrastus, but also in those mentioned
in the other Greek and Latin authors.
    Thus the chara, which Cesar's soldiers discovered so fortu
nately under the walls of Dyrrachium, and the roots of which,
prevented them from starving, deserves well to be sought after.
At present this name is given to a small aquatic plant, which cer
tainly can afford nourishment to no person ; and there are a mul
titude of contending opinions on the subject of the chara of
Cesar.
  M.   de Berneaux,  after having examined and rejected all these
opinions successively, shows that the chara was a cabbage, and
thinks it was the species now known by the name of crambe
 tatarica. In fact, this plant grows in great abundance in the en
virons of Dyrrachium, and in all Hungary and Turkey : it has
very long and thick roots, firm and well tasted, which are eaten
raw or boiled in all the countries just mentioned, and which are
of great service in times of scarcity.
    Several Latin authors describe various marsh plants by the
name of ulw ; but they mention one in particular as being
excellent food for sheep.    As among the aquatic plants the fes-
litca fiuitans only is eaten by sheep, and as this grass covers a
great part of the Italian marshes, M. de Berneaux thinks the
above is the particular species of ulva, and he also shows that
this is the grass denominated by Theophrastus and the Greeks
typha.
   The ancients boast much of the useful properties of the cy~
tisus ; but they describe it imperfectly, and the moderns differ
greatly as to the plant which ought to bear this name.    Some
have been of opinion that it is the tree lucern (medicago ar-
liorea). M. de Berneaux, who has made copious researches into
this subject, thinks that it is rather our false ebony, cytisus la
burnum.     But as Pliny speaks clearly of this last tree under the
name of laburnum, and regards it as different from the-cy tisus;
and as on the other hand some parts of the description given of
the cytisus by Dioscorides do not exactly suit       it,M. de Ber-
neaux's opinion does not seem quite well founded.          It  to be
                                                                is
observed, however, that Pliny and other ancient naturalists are
very vague in their descriptions of plants.
    In the buds of trees, there are some which are not developed
with the rest, and which are called dead eyes, but which ought
rather to be called sleeping eyes, for it   possible to revive them

It owing in general to the tendency of the sap to go to the up

which are destined to yield wood or to afford    ashade but in the .

fruit-trees, where it  is requisite to arrange all the branches for a
  specific purpose, cultivators are compelled to put grafts on the
  places occupied by the dead eyes ; a tedious and uncertain pro
  cess.   M. Marien de la Martiniere practises another method : he
  makes a small cut in the form of a V reversed above the dead eye
  and into the core\" The ascending sap is checked in its progress
 upwards, and is thus confined to the dead eyes.
     We are now called upon to say a few words on a work by
  M. Lasteyrie du Saillant on all the branches of the agriculture
  and the rural and domestic ceconomy of the Chinese.        It is col
  lected from all the authors who have written upon China, and
  embellished with a very great number of drawings made in China
  and by Chinese, in which are represented all the processes of
  their industry, and all the instruments which they employ.      This
 great empire, in which an immense population is entirely sup
 ported by agriculture, and where this art has been honoured and
 protected without interruption since the first establishment of the
 Chinese monarchy, cannot fail to have made great progress ;
 and in fact M. de Lasteyrie has made us acquainted with several
                                                                       '
 utensils more simple and more convenient than those used by
 the Europeans, and indicates some highly useful improvements
 respecting the culture of fruit-trees.
     M. Yvard has presented a large treatise on such plants as are
 injurious to grain, and on the means of preserving cultivated
 lands from them.        What are commonly called bad plants
are the production of nature; kinds of savage plants : the
 air, water, and animals bring their seeds, which the earth re
tains a long time in its bowels, and at the favourable moment 1
they are seen to spring up : frequently also the farmer himself
sows them mixed with badly compounded manure.              M. Yvard,'
who has described upwards of three hundred, gives ample details
of various methods for destroying these weeds.
     This experienced agriculturist has rendered a still more im
portant service to agriculture, by publishing last spring, through
the medium of the journals, the means which his experience
pointed out to him as the best adapted for repairing the losses
which the events of the war had occasioned by destroying the
corn in the ear.     He had the happiness to see his counsel fol
lowed, and the high price of corn at least did not indicate that
our provinces had been overrun by contending armies.            It has
been by similar applications of agriculture and of the arts, per
fected by the spirit of the sciences, that France has combated for
twenty years the disasters of a cruel war, and has been able to
support, without sinking under      it,

In the    county of Sutherland iu Scotland, a pit of coal was dis
 covered about two or three years ago, contrary to the opinion of
 many who supposed that no coal was to be found north of the
 Tay. This coal has been wrought to a considerable extent, but
 time has shown that it seems to possess one property peculiar
to itself.   The refuse coal, of which a large quantity had been
"left to accumulate near the mouth of the pit, after having been
 exposed to the air for a considerable time, took fire of its own
 accord, and continued in a state of combustion till the whole

 partly on account of this peculiar property of the Coal, but chiefly
 that they may have time to clear away the refuse on the surface.
 They do not despair of opening the pit again, and of discovering
 a mode of preventing the deflagration : and preparatory to the
 recommencement of working           it,

astronomer, Professor Bygge, of Copenhagen.
   Mr. Thomas Forster    has just published a Sketch of the New
Anatomy   and  Physiology of the Brain.    He has determined the
organ of mysterizingness to be a distinct faculty, but does not
enter into the proofs, as the large work of Dr. Spurzheim eou-
tains the substance of what     known on the subject.

    June. — The first fortnight was cold and cloudy for the season, particularly from
the 1st to the 9th, as the wind chiefly blew from the east quarter, which had the
effect of retarding vegetation, particularly as the fall of rain bad been trifling for
six weeks past. — It is remarkable, that during this and the preceding month the
greatest extremes took place in the course of twenty-four hours : in the pre
sent instance the difference of the extremes of the thermometer indicated 28*,
the maximum being at 67°, and the minimum 39": it was on the 9th, or upon the
day these changes took place, that the wind changed from E to S.— -Much honey-
dew appeared upon currant-trees during the continuance of the easterly winds.
The latter part of the month was warm, and attended with occasional showers of
rain, which much revived the drooping state of vegetation.
     July.— Rain fell at intervals, and in larger quantities; whioh greatly accele
rated the productions of 'the ground. — On the 20th, about four o'clock in the even
ing, there were very yivid lightning and loud thunder; after which an inch and a
toalf of rain fell in the course of half an hour; wind blew strong but sultry from the
SW. previous to the storm, but abuut the time of the thunder it became a complete
 calm.— The temperature in consequence was lowered, but it soon showed a quick
and great augmentation, for on the 25th it was as high as 80*, being the annual
maximum*
      August.— This month was decidedly very cloudy and showery, for there were
 22 days on which rain fell less or more, yet the monthly quantity only exceeds the
 preceding month by one inch ; the temperature in consequence received a sensible
 diminution— Prevailing winds, SW and NW ; on the 6th and two following days
 it'tilew strong and boisterous from the former quarter, attended with heavy rain.
      September.— From the 1st to the 12th, the curve of temperature was lowered
  16", the minimum being as low as 411", but at the end of a week from this depres
 sion jt was raised to 74", which constitutes the monthly extremes.— This month has
 been fine, brilliant, and dry; prevailing wind SW. — On the 11th, at nine o'clock
 in the evening, the sky being free from clouds, there was a luminous band, like an
 halo, but much narrower, which extended quite across the hemisphere in the di
  rection from NNE to WW by S; it continued near an hour, gradually disappear
 ing, by diffusing its light laterally.
      •October. — From the 1st to the 12th the weather became much colder, the
  thermometer indicated two degrees below freezing, but which was at the end of four
  days raised 26'; wind boisterous from S W ; rain now fell in large quantities, and
  continued so almost uninterruptedly       to the end.

 Tainy days. — Mean monthly temperature about 40°, the minimum was as low as.
  S3*; and which occurred on the 22d.
       December— Upon the whole was as mild as November, indeed the two monthly
  extremes were several degrees higher. — On the 16th the wind blew a violent hur
  ricane from the SSW nearly the whole of the day, its fury did much damage to
  houses and other buildings by unroofing and otherwise damaging them. — There

Meteorological      Observations    made    at Clapton, in Hackney.
                     from April I to 20, 1815.
   April  1  to 7*.  —  The weather during this period was fine,
warm, and dry ; the wind for the most part westerly, with clouds
of curious modifications.      Some slight showers now and then.
   April 8. — I perceived today that the wind was got to the
eastward.      There were cirri and a cirrocumulative tendency in
the clouds, with cumuli below.          The wind blew strong.
   April 9. — Easterly wind. Cloudy, with a shower in the mid
dle of the day.
   April 10. — Hard rain early; clouded and damp the rest of
the day.      Thermometer     at 11 P.M. 52°.        Barometer falling
30-00. Wind easterly.
   April 11. — Cloudy morning and misty; fair day, and very
warm.     Fine calm evening.          Cumuli and some cirrostrattis.
Thermometer at midnight 45°.            It had been 62° in the day.
   April 12. — Fine warm day, but with light showers.
   April ) 3 . — A very hard thunderstorm with hail and rain about
2 P.M. ; air warm ; night partially clouded.          Some of the gall
stones which fell during       the   hard storm this morning were
very large.     The evening became cool.
   April 14.— Cold north wind. The change from the warmth
of the several preceding days to the present cold was very sensi
bly felt.
   April   15. — Cold N. wind with much cloudiness.            Cumuh-
sratus forming      out  of the   flimsy   and  confused  modifications.
The Barometer rising to 30-20 at 11 P.M., and the Thermo
 meter down to the freezing point.
        il 16. — Confused masses of lofty cumulus early; after-
         common ephemeral well-defined cumuli.              Cold north
winds.
   April    17. — Fine clear morning ; cumuli formed afterwards.
   April   18. — Cold NE wind, and unpleasantly dusty.               Fine
clear moon-light evening.
 k  April 19. — The weather still cold; the sky was clear, except
cumuli increasing towards afternoon.           The moon at night was
hazy   with   a faint halo, and  the   air was somewhat warmer.
                —
   April 20. Clouded and         warmer     than yesterday, with change
of wind, veering round to the eastward. During the morning
some small rain. Barometer sinking.

 LIX.     On the Pheenomena    of  Vegetation.   By Mrs. Ibektson.
                            To   Mr. Tillocki
 Sir, — In    two previous   communications    I have shown that the
 quantity of nourishment distributed to plants was variously ar
 ranged between the two grand repositories, the earth and the
 atmosphere.      I have by the dissection of leaves, plainly I hope,
 evinced that some plants receive hardly any nutriment from the
 soil, while from the surface and sides of the leaves, and the im
 mense quantity of hairs with which the plants are loaded, they
 evidently prove how much support they draw from the atmo
 sphere.     But others on the contrary, having innumerable skins
 oil their leaves to shut out moisture, must therefore depend al
 most wholly on the root for that support which they cannot
 procure otherwise.      Now to complete the establishment of this
 fact, as one to be depended on, it was necessary that the forma
 tion and appearance of the root of each different plant should
 corroborate the evidence of the leaves, and answer to the idea
 their cuticles suggested.      I had hitherto neglected to examine
 this ; I had indeed dissected a great variety of roots, but it was
  the interior that then occupied my attention, not the exterior
  and accompaniments.        It was with some trepidation, there
  fore, I collected twenty roots of different soils to examine and
  inquire thoroughly into this fact.      With what delight then do
  I present to the public the complete confirmation of its truth !
  and as this requires no dissection, every person may prove the
 justice of my assertion.     But before I show the sort of root that
  belongs to the plant of each different soil, I shall point out the
  various ways in which the juices are received by the , root, and
  the use of each separate part.
      The middle root i3 merely a reservoir, within which is accumu
  lated all that provision which supports the plant.     Its office ap
  pears to be the receiving the collections brought to it by the
  side roots, to arrange, compound, and extract the juices collected
  for its appropriation    and selection.    Next to this are the side
  roots: — always keeping near the surface of the earth, they
   cull the richest of its liquids, and from the fat and!iv-egetable
   matter which usually covers the upper soil, they 'by means
, of their radicula, which are generally projected upwards, draw
   into these side roots that liquid matter which forms the sap, but
  which is certainly diluted in the middle root ; for, if caught in
   the preceding situation, it forms an almost Jelly ; yet when ar

forms   the new wood,       as  I   have before shown in Nicholson's
Journal, vol. xxxiii. p. 234.         The tap-root collects the juices
from a lower strata from the subsoil ; and there, \ doubt not,
much of that which completes the bark is taken, besides the
matter of the pollen, which is most evidently formed here, since
I have traced it from hence to the parts adjoining the bark, and
from that place to the bud at the time it is taking in its seeds and
pollen, when fixed in its cradle in the bark.           The juices thus
obtained from the substrata, and running in the tap-root, often
show by their strange colours the different kinds of liquids they
draw from the earth : from the side roots no juices come but
an inspissated colourless liquid, but in the tap-root it is often so
deeply tainted with colour as to dye the wood the whole way it
runs.    I have by me three specimens of this : — one a beautiful
lead tint, one a bright yellow, and one a light green : the latter
I take to be copper, especially as it killed the tree. The yellow
was probably sulphur ; but the first had the appearance of a
bright and shining paint, highly varnished.           After the tap-root
may   be  ranged   the radicnla   :  and this is  the principal part that
really draws   in  the nourishment the plant requires ; and by their
number we may fairly judge what quantity of matter the tree
takes in from the root : they are formed in a curious manner,
rounded at the end and without rind, and more intended ap
parently to suck up the moisture, than take it in as the hairs.
I may here observe, that when it is designed to take in juices
from the atmosphere, the instrument made use of by Nature re
sembles a blow-pipe, though with many valves.               But when the
nourishment is to be drawn from the earth, the instrument is a
round figure like a diminutive sponge about 2-10ths of an inch
in length, but which has also several valves to complete it ; see
Plate VII. fig. 1 . Besides the radicula there is another sort of small
root, which I call & fibre : it is blunt, with an interior vessel often
projecting beyond the bark: see fig. 2. Next to this are the hairs,
which are rarely discovered of more than two sorts ; see fig. 3.
But the hairs appear to me to be merely an occasional addition,
when a dry season requires more moisture. — I have now shown
                                                                           "
how the root receives the liquids from the earth ; it may there-
fore be easily conceived that the quantity of matter it takes in,
must be proportioned to thenumber of radicula, fibres and hairs,
it possesses, and not to the size of its middle root.
   This prefaced, I shall now show that ihe sand plants, which
take so much nutriment from the leaves, though often large in
the middle (as the turnip), have a totally denuded root, with_very
few radicles and no fibres ; they have long tapering roots lessen
ing by degrees to a point ; they have a few side roots rarely
graced with radicula.      See the turnip-radish, carrot, chamomile,
                                                                   itrtica

itrlica urens, alyssum, and many others it would be tedious to
mention, but which take almost all their nourishment from the
 atmosphere*; se'e Plate VII. fig. 4.
    Rock plants being of a perfectly different formj have no radi-
 cula ; they have instead a little sort of instrument which licks up
 the water from the stones, to keep the stem moist enough to al
 low the seeds formed in the root to rise through it to the buds.
 The trifling degree of earth found in most rocks appears to give
 sufficient liquid to form the seeds, and this is all that is required
 from the root of a rock vegetable ; for all the nutriment is given
 either by the leaves if they have any, or the stems and flowers of
 these plants : every part is indeed open to the atmosphere. But
  when we turn from the vegetable, which, like the rock plant,
  takes all its nourishment from above, and observe those which
 by degrees receive more and more of their support from the
  root, we are immediately struck with the difference not only irt
form but in appendages. The clayey plant receives a pretty
  equal quantity of nutriment from the leaves and root.                It has
  almost always a stunted prcemorse or bitten-off root ; see fig. 7«
  The side roots reach but a very little way, that they may not be
  cut off by the large lumps of clay that coagulate, and inclose
 the moisture surrounding each vegetable.             But their short side
  roots are loaded with radicula, which plainly show how much
  more nutriment they must take from the earth than either sand
  or rock plants: sometimes they have occasional hairs, but never
  any fibres.
     The chalk plant takes nearly two-thirds from the foot, the
 rest from the atmosphere.            They have no very' distinguished
  shaped root,   that  part being sometimes large and thick, as in
 Japonaria officinalis and Artemisia acanlha; sometimes running,
  as in the Antirrhinum repens: they have always pretty nearly
  the same quantity of radicles, many more than the clayey plants,
 but no fibres, and rarely any hairs. Most of the chalk plants
 have rather a thick cuticle to their root, but not so thick as that
 which always covers the clayey plant, for that is almost always
 double: both are intended, I suppose, to guard the root from the
 entrance of that putrid water but too apt to lodge within the
 interstices of the clayey lumps.          I conjecture this, because the
 defence    (though   still existing)   is not so great in the chalk as in
  the clay, neither is the first so troubled with the defect. See
 fig. 8, Ghalk root.
    *  I much regret space    is not allowed me to give many specimens in
 drawing of the roots, as they would strike the eye with the astonishing
 difference existing in that part as appertaining to each different soil. But
 should I ever be able to give this work to the public properly, it will be
 there exemplified,

 r   As to the tree and shrub, they      are certainly more indebted
    the reot than to the atmosphere, though a quantity of nutri
   ment is also received by the leaves.       It is known that in many
   trees the roots almost equal in extent the spreading branches ;
   and as each of the side limbs below has such a set of branches
   to support above, they must of course increase with their leafy
   honours.    It is the side roots which bring the greatest quantity
   of sap : they often reach an immense way ; and as the radicles
   placed in the whole extent are mostly turned upwards, it is in
   great part the produce of that vegetable matter lying near the
   surface which bestows on them its richest juices.         A large num
  ber of circular vessels in the middle of these roots convey these
  treasures to the centre root, while the rest (adjoining the bark)
  are filled with fresh-forming seeds.     Trees and shrubs as well as
  luscious plants (see fig. 9) have all the assistance the radicula, ai
  well as fibres and hairs, can bestow on them ; but many have
  also those balls of fat matter which adhere often to the sides of
  the fibres, and must add much to the nutriment of the plant.
  But when it is a fir or an ever-green tree, Nature has still another
 resource. Dissecting many roots of firs, I discovered in the balm
 of Gilead fir, at the termination of each side root, a large bun
 dle of radicula; it had a most strange appearance ; nor could I
 at first understand its use. till I examined it thoroughly, and
 found it was to increase the nourishment'within a given distance.
 To give an idea of the contrivance, I subjoin the specimen; it is

found closed and their       sides pressed together.     There is still,
 however, much to be discovered in the mechanism of the water
 plants, which I hope to understand and unravel this summer :
 the straight roots of the real water plants are never branched,
 nor have they any radicula, fibres, and rarely any hairs, and
those only on the middle root.         I before showed that the leaves
take in no nourishment from the atmosphere ; but these pipes
 hanging continually in water, and administering it to the plant
 ns long as the light continues', must give all the support they
                                                                        '
 can possibly require.
    Thus it may be easily seen that the roots as well as the cuti
 cles of the leaves and the hairs confirm the facts they promised
 to corroborate, and prove that the plants are either fed by tire
roots or the atmosphere, or both conjointly; that this entirely de
pends on the nature of the soil.          What then is to be deduced
 from this review of their habits ? That each plant being formed
to grow in one particular earth, it must consequently be more
adapted and grow better in its native soil than in any other.
That those plants which grow in sand, from taking so much
from the atmosphere, require a greater attention to be paid to the
aspect than any other circumstance.            That those which grow
in clayey ground demand its being drained, and reduced to as
fine a soil as is consistent with the nature of the earth ; that the
roots may be capable of running to a greater distance from their
centre root, without danger of having them cut off, and there-'
fore that they may, by spreading more, be better able to nourish
the plant.     In calcareous ground the form of the root teaches
us that the weight of the chalk should be lessened by mixture,
and the secreted water mingled with the upper surface : and in
a rich soil it should be well ascertained, whether it is luscious
enough to do without manure ; as all these luxuriant plants are
so loaded with the means of taking in nutriment from the root,
that if any addition is made they will easily overpower them
selves, and die of plethory.      It often happens that dung is laid
on land that would grow better for a few cart-loads of clay or
sand.     I have seen a soil so rich as to spoil the taste of the ve
getables raised in it, and to bring on disorders (hat afterwards
spread in the seed.      It is greatly the interest of the farmer who
is lucky enough to have such land, to ascertain this, as it is only
not to manure    it,  and now and then to throw on         itlittle lime

a  particular sort of wheat (Triticum monococciirn) in the Mysore
country, which was not suited to the soil, though it did admira
bly higher up towards the Carnatic— obliged to obey, all the
wheat that was produced was so tainted with blight, that it
yielded in a bushel not a quarter measure of flour.        When for
want of other ground they are obliged to put a plant into
clay instead of sand, they fill the holes where the seeds are to
be placed with sand, or strew the ground over with it to some
depth *, that the embryo of the plant, finding its own soil, may
draw from it its native juices, nor have to struggle with adverse
land, till, strong and vigorous, it is enabled to bear it. But they
say,
      " take what precautions they will, it is never equal to that
which grows in its proper soil."       1 think I may observe, that it
stands to reason that this must be the case ; and that, as every
plant   has its favourite earth, it must grow better and finer, if
manured in that soil, than in any other: and as Nature has been
so bountiful to us as to bestow a great variety of the necessary
plants, and adapted them to almost every soil ; should not our
industry supply what remains to be done, and seek and fix the
plants suiting each different sort of ground ? And would not the
person who did this be a benefactor to mankind?         The manner
in which our wheat is now tainted, calls aloud for some remedy;
and the introduction of the immense number of neu wheals
well accounts for the increase of this disorder; for they are placed
in any ground, nor the question thought of " From what soil
do they come?"        But I have strayed to farming again, when I
intended to pursue my present subject. — " The consequence that
must follow the proofs I have given of the leaves in part feeding
the plants.' .
    If the leaves contribute thus to the nutriment of the plant,
and that the water taken in by the hairs is decomposed, and con
verted into oxygen and hydrogen, the first given out to purify
the air, and the latter secreted for the use of the seeds ; how
can it be also retained to be given put in perspiration ? The plan
is perfectly contradictory ; and I wonder not that the inimitably
Alirbel expressed some doubts of its truth. The idea therefore
of plants perspiring is a mistake ; and those figures taken for
hubbies of wafer given out of the plant, are on the contrary in
struments beautifully adapted to the receiving and inhaling all
the various juices the atmosphere has to bestow, and convert
them into volatile oils, resms, and all the liquids the plant is
afterwards found to yield.      But another argument appears to
me still more to show the fallacy of the former opinions.          It
was believed that the water taken in from the dews and rains

                 On the Boots differing in each Soil.             327
 was decomposed, and the oxygen given out ; and the only re
 maining juices, the sap, (after mounting and attaining the highest
 part of the tree,) descended again through the bark into the root.
 Thus every sort of nutriment belonging to the plant is disposed
 of. And what then is left to nourish the plant ? what is to form
 all the new shoots of the tree, and new wood which requires the
 sap to stagnate on the parts while forming? But, instead of this
 false system, if we suppose that part only just which dissection
 authorizes and enforces, " the dispersion of oxygen arising from
 decomposed water," and the very pockets from which it flows, is
 discoverable in the leaves: that from other sorts of hairs are taken
 into the plant all that can form the scents and sweet-smelling oils,
 and are thus made to pass into the second cuticle, wher,e they
 are defended by a double skin from the too great evaporation;
 while the various bark juices after uniting compose the pabulum
 of the leaf; then pouring down through the leaf-stem, pass un-*
 der the rind, and fill the large vessels of the inner bark, the green
 part detaching itself and forming separate as in the leaves; while
 the upper cuticle of the leaf gives nutriment to many plants,
 and with the assistance of the hairs and instruments gives scents
 or juices to all: that through the root and from the earth is
 taken the sap, which is always analogous in quantity to the mea
sure of 'the new shoots it is to form, and the new wood it is to
 create : that the tap-root also supplies the centre shoot and the
 powder of the pollen. Thus every part is provided for; and the
 whole formation is justified, and indeed was at first suggested by
 the dissection of plants, and can in its whole process be followed
 up by the eye, with the help of little more than a single mi
 croscope, thbugh the discoveries of course were made with much
 more powerful means. It is also certain that the roots mark, by
 their shape and their accompaniments, the soil in which they
 are to grow ; it cannot therefore be wondered at, that the cuticle
 of the leaves of each plant should concur with them to display
 the same.
    It was my intention to leave the root of rock plants unde-
 scribed for the present, till I got some more vegetables of that
 kind ; but I am anxious to bring them all into one point of view,
 and show how entirely the soil governs the plant, and how truly
 the root differs in shape, forma/ion, and accompaniments, when
 it originally proceeds from another earth ; and in this case there
 are very strange alterations 1 cannot in any manner account for.
 The stem from the root upwards is exposed and open to the
 atmosphere, and generally covered with hairs or spines, which is
 only another means of taking in nourishment ; but the root be
 low is laid over with a double cuticle of a very strange kind.

It    is uncommonly       thick,   and the whole interior of the stem so
loose as not to be        half filled, and     the centre circle is a cylinder
of cotton curiously        formed   : this  I take (though so soft) to be the
wood part, as there is an interior line, small (but more solid in
matter), on which all the branches of the root are fixed, which
proves it to be the line of life, or canal mSdullaire. The alburnum
vessels, instead of being in their usual places (between the bark
and wood), are placed between the two rinds; and the inner bark
vessels follow.        We may call the second rind a bark, for there
is no other: but if we do, it is still differently placed, since it
completely separates the seeds and inner bark vessels: the pol
 len is as usual with the seeds, only the latter in vessels tied with
the string, and the farina in the spaces between them ; the two
 rinds are more like leather.           The wood (if it must be so called)
 consists    of  soft cotton cylinders filled with water, which I suppose
 is taken up by the little pumps which are on the roots instead of
 radicles : but there are two sorts ; perhaps one of them takes
 the juices for the seeds, and the other the water, as there are
 very few of the armer ; see fig. X, and fig. XI; the water ones,

 are divided.
      I shall now conclude this letter, and my next will be another
 explanatory letter on the growth of the seeds in the root, show
 ing that they must be seeds, or at least the emlryo or heart ;
 since they are to be seen passing into the seed-vessel and fixing
 themselves in the place of the seeds while the flowers are still in
 the bud.                                                                    j

of electrical Hypotheses ; by M. Donovan, Esq."
    If philosophical controversies were always carried on with such
a tranquillity and fairness as reigns in that between Mr. Dono
van and myself, such discussions would better forward true na
tural philosophy than they commonly do.                   I hope it will be the
case when I shall have explained myself respecting what appears
a disagreement between us.
    A first point relates to the object of excitation.                 I had not
present     to  my  memory      all the  parts of  Franklin's   theory    with re
gard   to  that  part   of electric  science,  when   finding  it  in  Mr. Dono
van's paper,      and   considering     it as his own    opinion,   I  made some
objections against it ; therefore he has reason to say that it does
not prove against him, but against Franklin ; in proof of which
he quotes the Doctor's work, " Experiments and Observations on
Electricity," published in London in 1749.
    The most important point in our controversy concerns Volta's
theory, of which I thought to give a proof by an experiment
against which Mr. Donovan objects.                 The theory of that justly
celebrated electrician           is,
                                   that the standard of plus and minus in
our observations           no fixed point, but changeable, being the ac
                          is
tual electric state          the ambient air.
                            of                      My experiments to prove
it, which' I      still consider as decisive, Mr. Donovan accurately
describes, and        1shall repeat them in his own words          ;    in which,
however, he      uses   an  expression     which  has  misled him, and which
   shall point out afterwards.

I
       By the continual dispersion of electricity in           a     room (where
an electric machine was worked, having                  a   point fixed to the
prime conductor), the. air of the room was rendered positive                 ;    a
pair    of   insulated   pith-balls    in  the natural    state   was  brought   in
from an adjoining room; they were diverged negatively; but when
 they returned to the room whence they came, the natural slate
                                                                               was

SSO            A    Reply   to   Mr.   Donovan's   Observations
was resumed.        Mr. De Luc explains this by supposing, that al-
 though    the balls  were at first in the natural slate when com
 pared   with  the  electric state of that room ; yet, when brought
 into an- air containing a greater absolute quantity of electricity,
 they became relatively negative.        Now if this admits a different
 explanation, the necessity of the above inference is destroyed j
 it is therefore of importance to try if this can be effected
 Now it appears to me, that the principle of electric influence
 may be applied in explanation of Mr. De Luc's experiments on
 electrified air.    The balls in the natural state are brought into
 a positive atmosphere ; the electricity of the latter repels the
 natural quantity of the balls into their internal substance; the
 external parts therefore are left minus.          With this view the
 sequel exactly corresponds; for, when the balls were brought back
•into the unelectrified room, they collapsed into their natural
 state.    But on the opposite view, the balls by immersion into a
 positive atmosphere would assume that state and retain it when
 removed, and therefore continue to diverge.          Hence it appears
 to me, that the experiment is an anomaly on the hypothesis of
 Volta, and perfectly reconcileable to the principle of Franklin."
     I think that some further explanations will remove Mr. Dor
 novan's difficulties ; and the most direct way will be by stating
 in what consists the difference between the two theories.— In
 Dr. Franklin's, the standard of plus and minus was a certain
 (supposed) natural quantity of electrify belonging to all the sub
 stances of our globe, which fixation as merely arbitrary, and
 opposed by facts, prevented that theory, though true in itself,
 from being admitted by a great number of natural philosophers
 hoth in England and on the continent ; it was even by such
 strong arguments explained in my works, that they were never
 answered by retaining that theory.
    But Volta's theory has produced two great and permanent
 changes in the science of electricity.      He first proved that there
 is no fixed nor permanent standard of plus and minus ; that the
 sta?idard was changeable, being the actual electric state of am
 bient air.     He next explained the cauAe of the electric motions
 of pairs of balls, by proving that air possesses the electric fluid as
 well as all the bodies which it embraces; but with this circum
 stance, that it abandons some to the bodies that have less, and
 takes some from those which have more than itself : lastly, that
 as the electric fluid has some adhesion to the bodies which
 possess it,   ifthese bodies oppose less resistance to move than to
 part with the excess, or to receive their defect, they are trans
 ported by the electric fluid where        has a tendency to move.
                                           it

                                                                    as

as a pair  of pith-lalls.     When these disks were laid together on
water they diverged, and the cause of that diver gem e was vi
sible: both disks gave soap to the water between them, but only
one to the external water on both sides ; and the disks moving
towards this, they separated from each other, or diverged.
   Returning to ilectric motions, Volta's theory was submitted
to direct verification by the experiment which Mr. Donovan ex
amines.     But I shall first remark, that by changing the expres
sion which I had used in explaining these phenomena, he has
not undertood me, nor could he understand Volta's theory.            He
uses the expression' natural stale, to define the electric state of
the air in the room next to that in which an electric machine
was set in motion ; whereas I had used the expression, the ac
tual electric state of the air in thai room, in which the pair of
halls which were in the same electric state did not, nor could
not diverge.     If therefore Mr. Donovan in-his reasoning changes
the expression natural state, into that of actual and local elec
tric state of the ambient air, he will find that his objection is
not applicable to the explanation of the phenomena which I
have observed.
    Mr. Donovan makes this objection, " that the pair of balk
brought from the next room, when coming in a posit ive atmo
sphere should be rendered positive, and continue lo'diverge so,
when brought back to the first room."           This was not the case,
however. Therefore Mr. Donovan's objection is against a fact.
But this would certainly have happened, had that pair of balls
remained long enough in the room of the electric machine ; for
the air communicating at least its own electric state, they would
then cease to diverge; but in that case, when brought back to
the first room, instead of collapsing, they would have diverged as
positive; having thus changed their electric .stale.        Now Volta's
theory explains all these cases : it is founded on this property
of air, that it is a non-conductor , and cannot communicate the
elect nc fluid to the bodies which it surrounds, or take some from
them but in absolute contact ; and from this circumstance pro
ceeds the insulation of electrified bodies in air.         However, by
 the continuance    of the contact of the particles of air, these bodies
are by degrees reduced gradually to its electric stale.
   With respect to electric influences, no true conclusion can he
derived from experiments on that object when the air is not
 dry.   For moisture is produced in the air by aqueous vapour,
 a conductmg fluid; wherefore, in all my electric, experiments, 1
had in the same room the hygrometer of my construction, and
 I made them at times when that hygrometer stood at about the
 same degree, as    I  have stated it in my paper in Nicholson's Phi
losophical Journal.        Mr. Donovan had not this test in Ins-experi
                                                                   ments

  ments with an excited glass tube, which he brought under a
  pith-ball, and when removing the tube, the ball remained posi
  tive.   This effect was probably owing to the aqueous vapour
  being then abundant in the room, and thiis producing a con
  ducting medium.
     Coming now to the great object of electricity, namely, the di
  vergence of the electrified ball, which is our electrometer ; Mr.D.
 declares with ingenuousness that he has not had opportunity to see
 Volta's system completely stated ; but he says, if I understand,
 it relates to two bodies, one of which is in a natural state, and
 the other in a super-natural state. But this is a misconception :
 Volta's theory relates to two bodies, both either positive or nega
  tive; and this divergence I have thus explained from Volta's
 theory, as in a pair of balls thus situated, both act to bring the
 air between them to their electric state; while one only acts on
 the external air on both sides, to which therefore they tend de
 cidedly.
     Mr. Donovan objects against that explanation,        " that  it vir
 tually destroys the principle of repulsion, and refers all to attrac
 tion." This is true in the common «cceptation of the words at
 traction and repulsion ; but in strict natural philosophy, they
 ought to be called tendencies, as a vi ible effect, not implying the
 idea of cause, of which we might remain ignorant.             But Mr.
 Donovan asks,     " How can it be supposed at the same time, that
 electricity is an elastic fluid?"      In Volta's theory electricity is
 only considered as an elastic fluid, in the upper region of the
 atmosphere; for, when it is produced in a manjier which I have
explained, it darts in a straight line and soon vanishes, as seen in
 lightning.     But within the atmosphere it is a parasite fluid, al
ways fixed    to the particles of air; and I have proved, by an ex
periment related in my work Idees sur la MetSorologie, that a
perfect vacuum free from aqueous vapour is not a conductor.
This experiment I made in presence of Dr. Franklin and some
other experimental philosophers, who, knowing my opinion, de-
Mred to submit it to a test which Dr. Franklin himself prescribed.
I performed the experiment, by which it was completely proved
that a perfect vacuum did not transmit the electric fluid. Thus,
after having doubted, they were fully convinced of this fact, that
the electric fluid is really a parasite fluid, always attached to the
particles of some atmospheric fluid and moving with them.
    There remains another object of disagreement between Mr;
Donovan and myself, concerning the impermeability of glass to
the electric matter, which in my works on Electricity I had
maintained as the real cause of the phenomena of the Leyden
vial. On this object Mr. Donovan refers me to an interesting
experiment which he has made, and thus describes:             "A     thin
                                                                    flask
                                      -

     flask of glass with a neck many inches long was half-filled with
     mercurv, and coated on the outside to the same height with foil.
     By means of a moveable wire, an electric charge was thrown in ;
     the wire was drawn out, and the neck was hermetically sealed.
     After a length of time the sealing of the neck was cut off; the
     wire was plunged into the mercury, but not the smallest com-
     motion was perceived by the hand ; although the original charge
    was capable of giving a violent shock.        Thus I had encompassed
     a quantity of electricity  on all sides by glass : after a certain time
     I found that the glass contained none. What should I conclude,
    but that it escaped ? Were Mr. De Luc to repeat this experi
    ment, he would certainly consider my inference as natural."
        I am too old and too infirm to undertake any new experi
    ments ; I shall therefore only suggest an idea which Mr. Do
    novan may easily try.      Glass becomes a conductor when heated;
    thus it may be that the flask was discharged, by the operation
    of sealing it; for the operation of hermetically sealing              re  it,
    quires a  great heat.  I   therefore suspect that the moment when
    the flask was sealed,      itwas discharged.       This appears to me
    more natural than to suppose, against all the known phenomena
    of the Leyden vial, that glass         permeable to the electric mat
                                           is
    ter.   But Mr. Donovan might easily put          to the test of experi
                                                       it

    IV. H. Gilby has been induced to address to you from Edin-
    burgh, pages 300 and 301 of your last Number, would not at this

334          The History   of Mr. Smith's Investigations
lish Geology, against the theoretical pretensions of an Anglo*
German Geognosy, which has too high and proudly raised its in
tolerant head amongst us.
    From the year 1791, or earlier, Mr. Smith possessed verv su
perior opportunities for, and began assiduously to apply himself
to the practical comparison of, the underground measures or
 Strata of extensive and deep Collieries, with the surfaces or bas
sets of these same Strata; and he succeeded, in tracing and
mapping these surfaces and those of other strata lieing below
and above them in the series, to a considerable extent, in con
nection, for considerable distances uround Bath and Bristol;
and in 1794, having had the opportunity of travelling with a
Committee of the Somersetshire Coal Canal Company, through
all the principal Coal districts of England, almost to the borders
of Scotland, his discovery was completed, as to the same order
of superposition, the same general features, and the same organic
remains, accompanying each stratum, with which he had made
himself acquainted near Rath, through the whole of their defina
ble coztrse across the Island.
    Immediately from this time Mr. S. resolved on the design, of
extending his Map around Bath and Bristol, to the whole of
England and Wales, and as much of Scotland as he might be
able ; to which Map, during its progress, as well as to his grow
ing Collection of marked Specimens of each stratum and its im
bedded extraneous Fossils, his friends had the most free access,
and whereby several scores of Persons in the West of England,
and other parts, had every facility given them, of becoming
thoroughly acquainted with the subject, before I had the good
fortune to hear of Mr. S. or his pursuits, in the year 1800;
 and yet it has since appeared, that few if any one, of my pre
sent scientific acquaintances, had heard of Mr. Smith, before
myself.     Such is the difficulty opposed to merit alone, bringing
a man into notice.
    Mr. Smith's- liberality in communicating his discoveries even
went so far, as to draw up, at a Friend's house, in the year 1799,
a List of all the principal Strata of England*, with the names
he had adopted for each, in their ascertained order, with the
most characteristic Reliquia of each, their several effects in pro-           .
ducing springs of water, and a pretty copious list of the quarries
and places, best adapted for examining each of these strata:
of this List he gave some copies at the time to his Friends pre
sent, and they from time to time multiplied and distributed
   * Last Sunday Evening (April
                                 30) Mr. S. exhibited at Sir Joseph Banks's
Converzalione, an exact copy of this his original List of Strata, and intends
to publish the same,                                                 ,    .
                                                                       them,

                       of   the Strata  of England.                       335
them, so that before the commencement of the present century,
many copies of a list got into private circulation, which ex
plained the chief results of Mr. S's arduous labours.
     Soon after this period, Mr. S. printed and widely circulated
a Prospectus, which further and pretty fully explained his dis
coveries and results, and the modes of their beneficial application
to the concerns and interests of the Land and Mineral owners:
but these appeals to the Public, failing to produce an adequate
list of Subscribers to Mr. S's proposed Map and Work, and
having received no Money on account thereof, but from two In
dividuals, he found himself compelled to lay the same aside, and
apply very assiduously to his Engineery and other Business, for
retrieving his pecuniary affairs, from the embarrassments that a
too ardent zeal in the prosecution of this great and truly national
undertaking, had brought on him !
     In this dilemma of my Friend, and instructor in his new art of
Mineral Surveying, and after I had fully ascertained the ori
ginality, as well as verified the truth and importance, of his dis
coveries relating to the mineral structure of Britain, of the south
east and east of England in particular, I saw with the utmost
regret, persons starting up on every side, who had evidently either
directly, or more indirectly, although not less certainly, acquainted
themselves with Mr. Smith's ideas and leading facts, who were
preparing to profit by them, and who yet appeared little dis
posed to acknowledge their obligations.
      These circumstances, occasioned me almost incessantly to
wrge Mr. S. as others did whose advice ought to have had more
weight, to bring out a publication on the subject, however short
and in outline : but failing in accomplishing this,            J  determined
to let no opportunity slip, of bringing Mr. S's discoveries and
new professional practice sufficiently before the Public, to secure
him the credit of them at least ; and I began, in 1 805, by show
ing at "Some length, their application to the important concerns
of the Civil Engineer, in the article Canal, which I undertook,
to prepare for Dr. Rees's Cyclopedia*, and followed the same
                                                                           up,
    * By  a sort of fatality which attended my connection with this Work,
 it happened, that the Editor rejected nearly all this part of the manuscript,
in his hasty and indiscreet mode of shortening my communication :       I  con
 tinued, however, to embrace the numerous opportunities that offered as a-
contributor to that work, for introducing the mention of Mr. Smith and
his discoveries, and of making reference to futur« articles on other points,
 from the article Clay Strata, to that on Joints or fissures in the strata, in

up, in occasional communications* to your and other periodical
 Publications, until 1811; when Mr. Smith, having yet published
 nothing on the subject, seemed in danger of lessening, if not
 perhaps being judged to have forfeited, his well merited claims,
 I gave such an abstract of the history of his proceedings and his.
 results, in my Derbyshire Report, as seemed to me best calcu-
 of, and     I received sometime after the delivery of this MS., assurances,
 lliat   the same should appear, along with the accounts'of the principal sy
 stems of Geology and Theories of the Earth, that had been previously
 published: — what, however, was my surprise and that of many others, on
 the appearance in 1810 of this article Geology, promised to be a very com
 prehensive and full one, to find a mere statement of the Wernerian Theory,
 with suitable flattery to its author; and consistently enough, this was pre
 faced, by such remarks as the following; viz. — This interesting part of mi
 neralogy (the new Geognosy) principally owes the distinguished rank it now
.holds among the Sciences, to thccelebrated Professor of Freyberg, who hasse-
 paratedCfeoifnoi^fromGeo/ogy,"considering the latter as a merely speculative
 branch of knowledge, and as having nearly the same relation to the former,
 which astrology has to astronomy J "— The framers of most of these tissues
 of extravagant notions, known by the appellations of theories of the earth,
 have been satisfied with a very moderate share of materials for their struc
 tures — nothing is better calculated to flatter self-love than to be mentioned
 as the creator of a theory of the Earth — in short — " who would be de
 sirous to waste his time in refuting, or even remembering all {or any of) the
                                       "
 theories of the Earth now extant? — (and doubtless the iiberaiybreigner in
  British pay, who wrote this, meant to insinuate) — or what Geognost would
 wish, to continue to be told, of anything that Englishmen have, or can do in
  Geology? — And accordingly it has occurred, throughout the articles since
  furnished, from this anti-British source, that Mr. Smith or any of his co
 adjutors 4r their discoveries, are not mentioned , or have scarcely any of
  the rapidly accumulating facts of the British stratification been brought
  forward, in this extensive English Dictionary, even where they had been pro
  mised and referred to, in some instances; but the Dogmas of the idol of
  Geognosts, Werner ! and the observations and opinions of his followers
  abroad, with those of a few of the lately initiated amongst ourselves, have
  been held to he all-sufficient, for the information of English Readers ! !
       It gives me pleasure however to add, that the serious evil above com
  plained of, seems at length to have worked its own cure, since on reading
  part of the particle Rock, in the last published leaf of this Work, the same
 plainly appears to be from another pen ; — begins by restoring the Geological
  meaning of one of the most common and useful English terms, which in
  considerate Anglo-German Geognosts had endeavoured to alter, so essen
  tially, as to make rock mean, very c.ommoidy, a soft and earthy stratum,like
  clay, marl, sand, and the like ! — the infallibility of the Geognosy, as detailed
. in the aitideGeo/ogy, is plainly called in question ;
                                                         — and the writer, liberally
  assigns to Mr. S. the discovery, to which your pages, Mr. -Editor, have so
  often stated him to be well entitled, with regard to the distribution of fossil
  shells and other organic remains in the Strata, and their uses in identifying
 the same,      &c.

tractable friend.
    After some time, the Rev. Joseph Townsend published a 4to•
work, which, although under the very ill-chosen title of " The
Character of Moses," &c. is almost entirely occupied with local
details, respecting the stratification of the West of England, and
therein he very handsomely, in the preface and other parts, ac
knowledges the having first learnt to trace the Strata, and very
many of his particulars concerning them, from Mr. Smith, in
the year 1801, and subsequently.
    On the proposal for founding the Geological Society of Lon
don, in 1808, Mr. Smith and myself were often complimented,
in the Letters and remarks of our Friends, on the great Sclat
which this new Institution would give to Mineral Surveying, as
 a chief basis on which British Geology should be built ; our
 replies at the time were, that this result would altogether de
pend, on the Persons to whom the management of the Society's
 concerns might fall, and be retained ; and the result has unfor
tunately corresponded, — instead of the least patronage or counte
nance being given to Mr. Smith, every means, direct and indi
rect, were 'soon resorted to, 'by a leading Individual therein, in
 particular, to obtain his materials and delineate them on a new
 Map, pretended, at first, to be for the private use of the So
 ciety; but after it had twice or thrice been copied, to cor
 rect its first egregious errors, as new materials were quickly col
 lected, with inconceivably less pains or cost than Mr. Smith's
 materials were originally obtained, and I was repeatedly applied
 to for contributions to this new Map, I began to suspect, that
 all was not right, and determined on putting the question
 plainly, whether the design was not really entertained, of pub
lishing this rival Map?, and this not being longer denied, — then,
 whether it was intended in such publication, to make the acknow
 ledgements so justly due to Mr. Smith, for his long priority in
 the research, and his materials, obtained as above mentioned?,
 when I was unblushingly told, that theirs being a Map begun
 and altogether made on Wernerian principles !, no such acknow
 ledgements as I asked, would be made ! !
     Much as I may have heard from various quarters, since Mr.
 John Cary seriously undertook the publication, of Mr. Smith's
 Map, (and became a useful sort of security to the Public, that he
 should not very long delay completing it,) on the progress then
  actually making in Engraving this pretended Geognostic Map
  (concerning which some curious history will remain yet to be
  disclosed) first in London and then in Paris, I had so much con-

fidence that the fear of the exposure I couldwtnake, and the cofS-
sequent shame and disgrace that must attach to the actors here
in, would restrain them, that I had determined to delay sub
mitting the present statements to the public, and should have con
tinued to do so, but for a publication that has lately issued from
the University press at Oxford, on Geology, dedicated to the
worthy Geognost, to whom I have been principally alluding
above; and wherein the author Dr. Kidd*, has at pages 21 to 27,
given a brief account of the strata of England, essentially the
same as Mr. Smith has been in the habit of explaining and
showing them for twenty years past, and as I published them
four years ago in the Derby Report, yet not a mention or hint
of Mr. Smith or his labours, escapes this impartial Doctor !,
 (although he n>akes many references to the Derby Report), but
he on the contrary, concludes his account thus; viz.         In the        "
 foregoing account of the strata of the SE part of this Island, I
 have been purposely very brief : not only because they have al
 ready been described by other authors; but because I have rea
 son to believe, that a still more detailed and accurate account of
 them is liktly to bt given by a Gentleman (to whom he dedi
 cates), who, from his extensive travels both on the Continent and
 in this Island, is most competent to the task, and to whose pri
 vate-^ but persevering exertions, Geology has long been deeply
indebted."
   Now is it not surprising, that Dr. K., who makes express re
ferences, by volumes and pages, to 44 different works, for his
 Geological materials! (and refers to special few of his own ma
                                                          terials)

   t The fact here alluded to, of the Geognost here so extolled, having yet
published nothing on Geological subjects, as far as      I  know, is worthy o"f
observation by the impartial Reader, as well as the prevailing practice, of
ascribing all Geognostic merit to M. Werner, who has alike withheld his
speculationsfrom the Public, on most of the theoretic points, that are known
to'be his, by the English Public, only through the Writings     of'Mr. Jameson,
and others of his" admiring pupils:" and yet, the plea almost daily brought
                                                         is

Wernerians, that    it    perfectly fair, to anyhow obtain, atid to publish, all
                         is

these worthy Gents, that all which Mr.     S.  has done in teaching persons,aitd
they in publishing abstracts of his/acts and discoveries, should go for nothing
in his favour, but the knowledge of these publications may, and ought as

he meant to allude to the publishers of Mr. Smith's results; but
that neither Mr. Smith or any of those who have had the libera
lity, publicly to bring forward or admit his claims on this head,
were intended in all the paragraphs here quoted from Dr. K. will
be apparent, from the well known fact of Mr. Smith never having
quitted this kingdom ; and also from the two very next paragraphs
in Dr. K's Book, which, says he, contain " the earliest and most
interesting hints     I
                      have met with respecting a regularity in the
succession of the strata of the Earth :" — the first of these early
and notable instances,         is,
                            a mere suggestion, on an unfounded
opinion    by   Dr. Lister, in 1684, for others
                                           to set about making            a
coloured Map of the       "
                        upper soils" (whether alluvial or other
wise) of England, but which no one attempted to carry into effect,
until the County Reports to the Board of Agriculture were under
taken, long since Mr. Smith's Map of the Strata (lieing beneath.
these superficial and alluvial Soils) was begun and well nigh
finished.
    The second of these interesting cases-, quoted by Dr. K. is,
that of Mr. B. Holloway (not Mitchell%, as the very reprehen
sible laxity of the Doctor's quotations, had said) who in 1722
mentioned, in Letter to Dr. Woodward, that the Fuller's-Earth
                  a
Sand ridge of Woburn, ranged through Shotover near Oxford,
and Newmarket-heath near Cambridge, and accompanied "every-

Townsend, the respectable author of Travels in Spain: and for which no
sufficient reasou appears to me in the reading of Dr. K's Book, but the im
proper desire, more effectually to conceal Mr. Smith's claims, and appro
priate his discoveries to his Geognostic Friend!

     Professor Jameson, in issuing to the world, his first version of
 .The Geognosy, of Werner, declared himself unable to determine
 the " formation" to which the Gypsum of Derbyshire (with its im
  bedding Red Marl) should be referred, because forsooth, " no
  well educated Geognost has ever communicated any observations
  regarding it;" and        we may credit Mr. G. H. Gilby in your
                             if
  301st page, this great Geognost, remained in his perplexing di
lemma, as to " the real position of the red ground," or Red
  Marl, until he fortunately read Mr. G's paper in your xlivth

 volume, page 241. — That after so many persons had laboured
  at investigating and describing the Gypseous or Red ground of
  England, so many hundreds of pages of Werneriau Memoirs,
  Geognostic Transactions, Geognostic Annals, &c. had been pub
  lished, he, Mr. G. should hear himself publicly announced, as
  the first, the well-educated,   and the. happy Geognost, who had
  at last succeeded in solving this very knotty problem         (and in

   But to be serious, and to show that no wrong has been done
by me to Mr. G., but the contrary. I beg to point out to hina
and your Readers, that so far from he having, " full half a year"
previous to me, pointed out the unconfbrmableness of the Red
Marl, the reference that was      so distinctly before him in p. 167
(viz.  to p. 330  of your xliiid volume)   will show, that five months
         any  communication           him, appeared, I had not only
before                         from
pointed out, a new and perfect case of this unconformableness
(unknown to him) at Bedworth in Warwickshire, but had di
stinctly and correctly referred to the Papers of Mr. John Strachey,
published in 1719 and 1725, which described his (Mr. G!s) whole
case of the same nature in the vicinity of Bath and Bristol ! ; and
also, that   I had expressly invited your Correspondents, to make
and communicate observations on this point.            I might there
fore, with far more justice than Mr. G., complain of his want
of candour, in silently passing by my previous notice and invi
tation.
    I have, however, higher charges to prefer against Mr. G. for
endeavouring, by the authority of Mr. Jameson's name (I hope
without his sanction?) to <£ manoeuvre for himself a gloria," and
" plume himself" with merit, that so very justly belongs to Mr.
Strachey, long since dead, whose accounts and two sections,
most distinctly mention and show the overlieing and unconfor
mable position of the Red Marie, &c. on the inclined Coal-
measures of that district: — and that Mr. G. made this arrogant
claim, not entirely without a knowledge of what Mr. Strachey
had done, must I think be inferred, from page 245 of his first
paper, wherein he mentions the description of Stowey and Far-
rington Collieries (by Mr. Strachey) in vol. xxx. of Phil. Trans,
for 1719, but ascribes the same to " a Mr. Williams" contrary
to all the facts contained in the volume quoted ! ! .
    In like manner, I cannot altogether acquit Mr. G. of want of
candour at least, if not of injustice, towards my friend Mr. Smith,
whose prior labours in the same field he could not be in the least
 ignorant of, from Mr. Townsend's work, which he so often re
fers to in his first paper ; and if Mr. G. really went over the
ground which he describes, it is next to impossible, I think, but
that numbers of persons there, must have told him, that the same
observations had been made, and a Map of the strata drawn,
 and which had been exhibited among them for many years by
 Mr. Smith ; who did not secretly do this, in a corner, but made
a point of attending the Bath Society's Meetings and other si
milar occasions of public resort, to freely exhibit and explain his
 Map and Sections of the district, now so long after claimed, to
le first truly described by Mr. G. H
                                    r*.                            Mr.

842             The overlieing of Red   Marl or Red     Rock
   Mr. Smith was from the first aware of, and always taught, the
correctness of Mr. Strachey's representations (with which he first
made me acquainted) in the places described by that Gentleman,
but Mr. Smith knew a great deal more than was known to Mr.
Strachey, viz. that the coal-seams which near their bassets were
highly inclined to the Red Marl, which lay upon their edges, by
degrees became more flat and parallel to the Marl, as Steam-
engines enabled them to follow these seams into the deep, and
the inference seemed a natural one, that still further eastward,
they would be found parallel to the Red Marl and Lias upon it.
   In addition to these new facts, adverse to _ the generalization
of Mr. Strachey's local observations on unconformable Marl, &c.
the pudding-stones* which were generally mentioned, as con
tained in these overlieing strata, not as continuous and regular
strata, but varying considerably in thickness and being often
wanting altogether, appeared to me so very like to alluvial
matters, that, never having had the opportunity of minutely ex
amining any place in the district myself,        I
                                              always doubted, and
so have uniformly expressed myself, that Mr. Strachey's really
did form a case of unconformable regular or undisturbed strata f,
until the same was rendered more probable, by an able pupil
of Mr. Smith's, Mr. Bevan, having brought to light a case (see
vol. xliii. p^330) admitting of no doubt, as I happen sufficiently
to know, from having myself' been upon and examined the sur
face with him, several years before, when on Canal business near
Bedworth, but at which time, the slight inquiries we made, as
to the coal strata and works below, did not bring out the least
hint of any unconformabbeness, or other deviation there from
what is common in Coal Pits, everywhere! — in p. 174, I have
alluded to similar, although apparently accidental difficulties, in
gaining correct, or rather, perhaps, sufficiently full information,
  *   Some of these are by Mr. Gilby called " livnestone breccia," and seem
to me now referable, to the unconformable conglomerate Yellow Limestone,-
which I   have since mentioned at Alberbury, Barnby,&c. page 108 of your
March number: and had I when writing that page, happened to have
turned to and reconsidered Mr. Gilby's description of these Limestone beds,
          I
in p. 246, certainly should have referred thereto.
  t   These difficulties may very well be supposed to have prevented Mr.
 Towmend from so decidedly mentioning the unconformubleness of the Rtd

had him done, and has himself done, in contradiction to the ascertained
facts above mentioned, and in defiance of the reasoning which   I   have ad
duced, in the middle of page 170, to show that the unconformubleness of the
Marl or any other stratum, can only show itself 'in the very few spots, com
paratively, where edges of strata are covered by it, and not inhere the over
lieing stratum covers the plane of previously deposited stratum, (see Note

known.
    It  may be proper to add in this place, that not only the ma
jority, but nearly all of the local and operative Colliers in Eng
land (and too many of their superiors) except some near Bath
and Bristol and near Bedworth, still doubt, and even deny the
overlieing of the Red Marl or its Red Rock on Coal-measures,
either conformably or otherwise, and that they generally assert,
either, as 1 have mentioned of the Ashby-de-la-Zouch Coal-field,
 Derby Rep. i. 174*, that a fault is always met with, before
 reaching the edge of the Red Marl or Red Rock; or, that the
 seam they have been working, rises suddenly up and bassets or
"  is thrown out," before reaching such edge, or more commonly,
 they say, that it is " cut off," without being able to explain how;
 and they mostly aver, that in no case do the Coals pass under
 the Red Marl or Red Rock ! These representations seem to have
 been often made to Mr. Bakewell, and have been and will, for a
 time at least, continue to be so repeated, to every inquirer.    In
 Durham, it should seem, that a similar notion yet prevails, and
 was lately mentioned to Dr. Thomson and Mr. Bakewell (see
 p. 177 of this volume), that the Coals never pass under the yel
 low Limestone !
    In- saying thus much, I hope no one will consider me as cast
 ing reflections, as to the veracity or the designs of this body of
 highly useful and respectable Men, far from it ; I have often had
 the satisfaction of saying, that on matters of fact, I rarely if

wrong, when they refer the locally rapid dips they meet with, to or from a
fault, to a tilt of one or both of the piles of strata contiguous to such fault,
and consider such tilts to be occasioned by the Fault ; and that being for
merly misinformed on these points,      I   have involved my generalization or

        Determination of the Proportions in which Bodies are corn-

   We may also deduce from          this manner of conceiving the com-,
   position of bodies, the relations of the quantities of acid, basis,
   and even of water of crystallization, which ought to be found in
   the acid salts, the neutral, or those that are hvpersaturated with
   one am! the same species, according to the representative forms
   of the particles of the acid and the base. It is thus, for instance,
  that we find, according to that of the particles of the sulphuric
  acid, that most of the supersaturated sulphates ought, conform
  ably to experience, to contain three times more bases than the
  neutral sulphates, and that the quantity of sulphuric acid is
  double in the acid sulphates to what it is in the neutral sulphate;
  whereas the sulphurous acid may, according to the representative
  form oi i ts particles, make with ammonia an acid salt, into which
  it enters in greater quantity than into the neutral sulphite, in
  the ratio of three to two only.       Such, in short, is the acid sul
 phite which we obtain by distilling the neutral sulphate of am
 monia.
       I shall not enter here into the details contained in my full
 memoir on the different combinations of ammoniacal gas with
 the other acid gases : the accordance of the results to which we
                                                                     are

    »re led, with those of the experiment, seems to me one of the
    most remarkable proofs of the theory therein detailed : but in
    prder to give an example of the manner in which we may draw
    from this theory the determination of the quantity of water which
   is combined with bodies, either in the state of crystallization or,
   even after they have undergone the action of a strong heat, I
   shall cite the determination according to the representative form
   of the particles of potash from the quantity of water which is
   united with it in these two states.        After having established,
   setting out from the phtenomena which potassium exhibits when
   we place it in contact with water and ammoniacal gas, that the
   particles of potash have as their representative form an octohe-
   dron composed of two molecules of oxygen and four of metal,
   I find that, in the crystallized hydrate, the quantity of the oxy
   gen of the water ought to be double that which is united to
   the potassium ; but after the hydrate has been fused, those two
   quantities of oxygen ought to be as 4 : 3, because a particle of
   hydrate in this state has for its representative form a heptaocto-
   hedron formed by the meeting of a trioctohedron composed of
   three octohedral particles of potash and of a tetraoctohedron of
   four octohedral particles of water.      Now, according to the com
   position of potash as determined by Messrs. Thenard and Gay
   Lussae, 100 parts of potassium unite with 19'945 parts of oxy
   gen to make 11 9*945 of potash.         It follows from what I hava
  said, therefore, that this quantity of potash ought to retain, at
  every temperature,- a quantity of water in which there is 26'593
. of oxygen, and which consequently weighs 30" 139; that is to
   say, nearly -j-ihyth of the weight of the potash, as has been found
   by the most accurate analyses.
       The combinations of oxygen, hydrogen, and chlore, either with
  themselves or with other bodies, have been successively the sub
  jects of researches analogous to those just mentioned.        As it is
  impossible to indicate all the results here, I shall confine myself
  to those of the combinations in which all the elements may be
  obtained in the state of gas, and in which the numbers of the
  molecules of each of their elements are consequently given im
  mediately.
      We have already ascertained the representative forms of the
  particles of two combinations of azote and of oxygen, the oxide
  of azote and the nitrous gas ; that of the nitrous acid ought to
  be determined according to the ratio of the volumes of nitrous
  gas and oxygen of which it is composed.             Experiments have
  been made upon       this subject, but their  results are at variance.
  According to the analyses of Sir Humphry Davy, this acid is
  composed of two volumes of nitrous gas, and of a volume of
  oxygen : each of its particles will then contain two molecules
                                                                      of «

                     On Numerical Propartivns
of   oxygen more than the particles of nitrous gas, and will con
sequently have, as the representative form, an octohedron com
posed of two molecules of azote and four of oxygen ; but then,
as in all the other combinations where the volume of one of the
Components is double that of the other, the volume of nitrous
gas will not change by the addition of oxygen : the greatest con
densation which takes place appears to me to be ascribable to
this, namely, that in proportion as these octohedrons are formed,
they are combined in hexa-decahedrons,           with tetrahedrons of
nitrous gas. As two molecules of oxygen are then sufficient for
the formation of one of these hexa-decahedrons into which two
entire particles of nitrous gas enter, the volume of oxygen is
only the fourth part of that of the nitrous gas, and the volumes
of azote and oxygen are, in the nitrous acid, as 4 : 6. These
results agree with the experiments of M. Berzelius.        On this hy
pothesis, the condensation ought to be 3-fifths of the total vo
lume ; but it will not take place completely except when, the
oxygen being introduced by small portions into the nitrous gas,
the octohedrons just mentioned, in proportion as they shall be
formed, will meet an excess of tetrahedron of nitrous gas with
which they may be combined. If we introduced, on the contrary,
the nitrous gas into oxygen, a part of these octohedrons might
remain isolated, and there might result combinations and con
densations in variable proportions.
    It follows from the composition of the nitric acid, as deter
mined by Sir H. Davy, and which is confirmed by the decompo
sition of the nitrate of ammonia, that a particle of this acid, if
we can obtain it without water, will be composed of one particle
of azote and of two particles and a half of oxygen. \t will then
contain four molecules of azote and ten of oxygen ; and we may
conceive it as formed by the meeting of two tetrahedrons of ni
trous gas joined to an octohedron of six molecules of oxygen *,
and forming with it a dodecahedron.            But in the combination
which this acid always forms with water, we must suppose that
the octohedron of oxygen and two octohedrons of water form a
trioctohedron which is united irt a trapezoidal form with the two
tetrahedrons of nitrous gas : we may hence conclude what is the
quantity of water in the most highly concentrated nitric acid,
and we find by calculation that it is nearly what Dr. Wollaston
has determined by his experiments.
    In the nitrate of ammonia, a particle of dry nitric acid is
united to two particles of ammoniacal gas ; so that one particle
   *  We may also suppose that, in the formation of the nitric acid, the
hexa-decahedron of nitrous acid is joined to a tetrahedron of oxygen,
which always forms a combination of an octohedron with two tetrahedrons,
»nd changes nothing in the following explanations,
                                                                      of

                    in Chemical Combinations.                     347
of salt is formed by the junction of one octohedron of oxygen,
two tetrahedrons of nitrous gas, and four tetrahedrons similar
to those which enter, to the number of two, into each particle
of ammoniacal  gas : the representative form of this particle is
  therefore a pyramidated hexa-tetrahedron,      containing ten mole-
  cules of oxygen, eight of azote, and twelve of hydrogen , When
  we decompose the salt by heat, the eight molecules of azote
  form two particles of oxide of azote with four molecules of oxy
  gen, and the twelve molecules of hydrogen form three parti
  cles of water with the six other molecules of oxygen,
      When the salt contains besides water of crystallization, we
  ought to obtain more than three particles of water ; but in all
  cases, we can only extract from its decomposition water and
  oxide of azote, as we find by experience.
      If the quantity of water of crystallization was equal in the
  salt to that which is contained in the most highly concentrated
  nitric acid, it would be necessary to join to the octohedron and
  to the six tetrahedrons of which one of the particles js composed,
  two other octohedrons of water ; which will give for the repre
  sentative form of the crystallized nitrate of ammonia, an octo-
  centahedron formed by the meeting of six tetrahedrons aitd
  one trioctohedron.     Chlore is combined with hydrogen in equal
  volume, and the muriatic acid gas which results occupies a vo
  lume equal to the sum of the volumes of those two component
  parts.     We might account for this mode of combination, by
  supposing that the representative forms of the particles of chlore
  are isolated tetrahedrons like those of oxygen, azote, and hy
  drogen ; that of the particles of the muriatic acid will then be
  a tetrahedron : but we may also explain it by considering each
  particle of chlore as formed by the meeting of two tetrahedrons
   in aparallelopipedon,   and as consequently containing eight mo
   lecules.   This last hypothesis is the only one which can agree
   with the proportions of the other combinations of chlore, the
   phenomena which they exhibit, and the properties which cha
   racterize them.
      By admitting it,   we find that each particle of muriatic acid,
'
   containing the half of  a   particle of hydrogen and the half of
a    particle of chlore, has for its representative form an octohe
   dron composed of two molecules of hydrogen and four molecules
   of chlore.    When the muriatic gas  is    combined with the am
   moniacal gas, each of its octohedrons     is combined with a   cubic
   particle  of this gas
                     :     hence
                               it    follows, thatit ought    to absorb
   of
    it   a  volume equal to its own, as experience shows, and that
•
   the particles of the salt thus formed ought to have as their re
   presentative form a rhomboidal dodecahedron    :    this form is, in
   fact, one of those which belong to the system of crystallization

of sal ammoniac, and all the others might consequently be re*
 ferred to it by different decrements.    The acid gases, the parti-
 ties of which have a cube for their representative form, tend, oh
•the contrary,   to combine with the ammoniacal gas in such a
.way that   the volume   of one of the gases is double that of the
 other,  because  the most simple polyhedron which we can form
with cubes is the hexa-tetrahedron which contains three of them.
    The composition of the gas formed by the meeting of oxygen
 and chlore, which Sir Humphry Davy has discovered and called
 euchlorine, is pne of the most remarkable, from the proport
 ions in volumes of its two component parts. According to his
 analysis, five volumes of the gas which he submitted to the ex
 periment, gave, on being decomposed by heat, two volumes of
 oxygen and four of chlore.      These relations seem contrary to
 all analogy, and they seem to be inadequate to the explanation
 of the composition of the particles of euchlorine, without ad
 mitting that the gas analysed by this celebrated chemist was mixed
 with a little chlore ; a supposition which naturally occurs when
 we recollect that the process by which this gas was obtained gave
 a mixture of euchlorine and chlore, from which this last gas was
 separated by shaking it over mercury ; a process which probably
 did not take up all the chlore, and which, besides, did not leave
 any method of ascertaining, even if successful, that the residue
 of this operation was pure euchlorine.
    I think therefore that we must account for this analysis, by
 .supposing that the gas employed contained one-fifth of chlore ;
 and that, of the five vqlumes submitted to the experiment, there
 were four only of a gas really composed of oxygen and chlore.
 By supposing that the representative form of its particles is a
 cube composed of. two molecules of oxygen and five of chlore,
 we find that four particles of this gas ought to contain eight
 molecules, i. e. two particles of oxygen and twenty-four mole
 cules, i. e. three particles of chlore : So that the decomposition
 of four volumes of pure euchlorine would produce, upon this
 hypothesis, two volumes of oxygen and three volumes of chlore.
 These three volumes of chlore united to a volume of the same
 gas, which formed by its mixture with the four volumes of eu
 chlorine the five volumes which were operated upon, ought to
 have given in the residue the four volumes of chlore found by
 Sir Humphry Davy.
    The relation of three volumes of chlore and two volumes of
 oxygen in the euchlorine, seems at first to* present no analogy
 with the relations which we observe in the combinations of the
 other gases ; but this anomaly is only apparent, and merely
 arises from the tetrahedrons of the chlore, instead of being se
 parated like the tetrahedrons from the oxygen, the hydrpgeu,

 Arid the azote, remaining combined by pairs in each particle of
  chlore ; so that a volume of this gas is equivalent to two volumes
  of another gas relative to combinations ; and that if the tetra
  hedrons of the chlore shall all be separated from each other, we
  shall obtain, by the decomposition of the euchlorine, six volumes
  of chlore and two volumes of oxygen, precisely as we find in
  the residue from the decomposition of ammoniacal gas, the par
  ticles of which have the same representative form with that of
  the euchlorine, six volumes of oxygen and two of azote.
      The results which I have just indicated form but a very small
 part of those which we may deduce from the consideration of
  the representative forms of the particles of bodies applied to the
  determination of the proportions of inorganic compounds.              The
  chemistry     of organized   bodies  also presents    numerous    applica
  tion of this theory ; but it is in this respect particularly that
  .there are many analyses and calulations to make for completing
  it. I have nevertheless drawn several determinations relative to
  the composition of different circumstances drawn from the ve
  getable kingdom, which agree too strongly with the results of
  experience to leave any doubts as to the utility of which it may
   be in this part of chemistry.

   for their most celebrated productions, and the emulation existing
   between different states with regard to the possession of them,
   prove that painting was one of the arts most cultivated in an

   withstanding the efforts of modern artists during three centuries
   of civilization, are still contemplated as the models of perfection
   in sculpture ; and we have no reason for supposing an inferior

        The works of the great masters of Greece are unfortunately
    entirely lost.   They disappeared from their native country du
    ring the wars waged by the Romans with the successors of

        The subjects of many of these pictures are described in
   ancient authors, and some idea of the manner and style of the
   Greek artists may be gained from the designs on the vases, im-*
   properly called Etruscan, which were executed by artists of
   Magna Grajcia, and many of which are probably copies from
   celebrated works: and some faint notion of their execution and
   colouring may be gained from the paintings in fresco found at
   Eome, Herculaneum, and Pompeii.
       These paintings, it is true, are not properly Greek ; yet, what
  ever may be said of the early existence of painting in Italy as a
   native art, we are certain that, at the period when Rome was
   the metropolis of the world, the fine arts were cultivated in
   that city exclusively by Greek artists, or by artists of the Greek
   schools.      By comparing the descriptions of Vitruvius* and
   Pliny with those of Theophrastus f, we learn that the same
   materials for colouring were employed at Rome and at Athens ;
'
   and of thirty great painters that Pliny mentions whose works
   were known to the Romans, two only are expressly mentioned
   as born in Italy, and the rest were Greeks.         Ornamental fresco
   painting was indeed generally exercised by inferior artists ; and
   the designs on the walls of the houses of Herculaneum and Pom
   peii, towns of the third or fourth order, can hardly be supposed to
   offer fair specimens of excellence, even in this department of the
   art : but in Rome, in the time of her full glory, and in the orna
   ments of the imperial palace of the first Cesars, all the resources
   of the distinguished artists of that age were probably employed.
   Pliny names Cornelius Pinus and Accius Priscus as the two artists
   pf the greatest merit in his own time, and states that they painted
   the Temple of Honour and Virtue J, u Imperatori Vespasiano
   Augusto restjtuenti         and it is not improbable that these artists
   liad a share in executing, or directing the execution of, the
   paintings and ornaments in the baths of Titus ; and at this pe
   riod the works of Zeuxis, Parrhasius, Timanthes, Apelles, and
   Prptagoras were exhibited in Rome, and must have guided the
   tyste of the artists.       The decorations of the baths were intended
  Jtp  be  seen  by torch-light, and many of them at a considerable
   elevation,   so  that the colours were brilliant and the contrast
   strong ; yet still these works are regarded by connoisseurs as
   performances of considerable excellence : the minor ornaments
Jvf them have led to the foundation of a style in painting which
   might with much more propriety be called Romanesque than
   Arabesque : and no greater eulogy can be bestowed upon them

than the use to which they have been applied by the greatest
painter of modern times, in his exquisite performances in the
Vatican. In these and in other works of the same age, the ef*
feet of the ancient models is obvious ; and the various copies
and imitations that have been made of these remains of antiquity
have transferred their spirit into modern art, and left little to be
desired as to those results which the skill of the painter can
command.       There remains, however, another use to which they
may be applied, that of making us acquainted with the nature
 and chemical composition of the colours used by the Greek and
 Roman artists.    The works of Theophrastus, Dioscorides, Vi-
truvius, and Pliny, contain descriptions of the substances used
 by the ancients as pigments ; but hitherto, I believe, no experi
 mental attempt has been made to identify them, or to imitate
 such of them as are peculiar*.       In the following pages I shall
 have the honour of offering to the Society an investigation of
 this subject.   My experiments have been made upon colours
 found in the baths of Titus, and the ruins called the baths of
 Livia, and in the remains of other palaces and baths of ancient
 Rome, and in the ruins of Pompeii. By the kindness of my
 friend, the celebrated Canova, who is charged with the care of
 the works connected with ancient art in Rome, I have been en
 abled to select, with my own hands, specimens of the different
 pigments that have been found in vases discovered in the exca
 vations lately made beneath the ruins of the palace of Titus,
 and to compare them with the colours fixed on the walls or de
 tached in fragments of stucco : and Signor Nelli, the proprietor
 of the Nozze Aldobrandine, with great liberality permitted me to
 make such experiments upon the colours of this celebrated pic
 ture, as were necessary to determine their nature.       When the
 preservation of a work of art was concerned, I made my re
 searches upon mere atoms of the colour, taken from a place
 where the loss was imperceptible:     and without having injured                 .
 any of the precious remains of antiquity, I flatter myself, I shall
 be able to give some information not without interest to scien
 tific men as well as to artists, and not wholly devoid of practical
applications.
  * In the 70th -volume of theAnnates de Chimie, page 22, M. Chaptal has
published   a paper on seven colours found in a colour-shop at Pompeii.
Four of these he found to be natural colours, ochres, a specimen of Verona-
green, and one of pumice stone. Two of them were blues, which he con
siders as compounds of nlumine and lime with oxide of copper, and the lasC
a pale rose colour, which he regards as analogous to the lake formed        (5y
fixing the colouring matter of madder upon alumine.    I   shall again refer

                  II. Of the   Red Colours     of the Ancients.
     Amongst  the substances found in a large earthen vase filled
with mixtures     of different colours with clay and chalk, found
about two years ago in a chamber at that time opened in the
baths of Titus, are three different kinds of red; one bright and
 approaching to orange, another dull red, a third a purplish red*.
On exposing the bright red to the flame of alcohol, it became
darker red ; and on increasing the heat by a blow-pipe, it fused
                                                                                          1
into a mass having the appearance of litharge, and which was
proved to be this substance by the action of sulphuric and mu
riatic acids. This colour is consequently minium, or the red
oxide of lead.
   On exposing the dull red to heat, it became black, but on
 cooling recovered its former tint. When heated in a glass tube
it afforded no volatile matter condensible by cold but water.
Acted on by muriatic acid, it rendered it yellow ; and the acid,
after being heated upon         it,
                              yielded an orange- coloured precipitate
to ammonia.      When fused with hydrate of potassa, the colour
rendered    it
             yellow    and the mixture acted on
                         ;                               nitric acid af

    The purplish red submitted to experiments, exhibited similar
 phenomena, and proved to be an ochre of a different tint.
    In examining the fresco paintings in the baths of Titus,                         I
found that these colours had been all of them used, the ochres
particularly, in the shades of the figures, and the minium in the
ornaments on the borders.
 I    found another red on the walls, of tint different from those
                                                 a
in the vase and much brighter, and which had been employed
in various apartments, and formed the basis of the colouring of
the niche and other parts of the chamber in whi«h the Laocoon
is said to have been found.       On scraping     little of this colour
                                                      a

running quicksilver was procured from it.
 I    found the same colour on some fragments of ancient stucco
in a vineyard near the pyramidal monument of Caius Cestius.
   In the Nozze Aldob»andine, the reds are all ochres.             tried   I              -
on these reds the action of acids, of alkalies, and of chlorine,
but could discover no traces either of minium or vermilion Hi

            have been discovered accidentally by means of a fire
that took p'ace at the Pireus at Athens.     Some ceruse which
had been exposed to this fire was found converted into minium,
and the process was artificially imitated: and he states that it
was first used as a pigment by Niciasf.
   Several red earths used in painting are described by Theo-
phrastus, VitruviusJ, and Pliny. The Sinopian earth, the Ar
menian earth, and the African ochre, which had its red colour
produced by calcination.
   Cinnabar or vermilion was called by the Greeks xwa&atgi §,
and by the Romans minium.        It is said by Theophrastus || to
have been discovered by Callias, an Athenian, ninety years be
fore Praxibulus, and in the 349th year of Rome, and was pre
pared by washing the ores of quicksilver.    According to PliuyH,
who quotes Verrius, it was a colour held in great esteem in
Rome at the time of the Republic; on great festivals it was used
for painting the face of Jupiter Capitolinus, and likewise for
colouring the body of the victor in the triumphal processions,
" sic Camillum triumphasse**."       Pliny mentions that even in his
time vermilion was always placed at triumphal feasts amongst
the precious ointments; and that the first occupation of new
censors of the Capitol was to fill the place of vermilion-painter
tB Jupiter.                                                        ,
   Vermilion was always a very dear colour amongst the Romans ;
and we are informed by Pliny, that to prevent the price from be
ing excessive it was fixed by the government.         The circum
stance of the chambers in the baths of Titus being covered with                it,
affords proof in favour of their being intended for imperial use               ;
and we are expressly informed by the author      have just quoted,

the taste of the ancients in selecting a colour to give full effect
to their master-pieces of sculpture was similar to that of      late     a
celebrated English connoisseur.
   Pliny describes a second or inferior sort of vermilion formed
by  calcining stone found in veins of lead.            evident that

                       III. Of the   Yellows of the Ancients.
     A large earthen pot found in one of the chambers of the baths
of Titus contains a quantity of a yellow paint, which, submitted
to chemical examination, proved to be a mixture of yellow ochre
with chalk or carbonate of lime.
     This colour is used in considerable quantities in different parts
of the baths ; but principally in the least ornamented chambers,
and in those which were probably intended for the use of the
domestics.           In the vase to which I alluded in the last section,
J found three different yellows ; two of them proved to be yellow
ochres mixed with different quantities of chalk, and the third a
yellow ochre mixed with red oxide of lead, or minium.
     The ancients procured their yellow ochre * from different parts
of the world ; but the most esteemed, as we are informed by
Pliny, was the Athenian ochre; and it is stated by Vitruvius, that
in his time the mine which produced this substance was no
 longer worked.
     The ancients had two other colours, which were orange or
 yellow; the auripigmenttim^ or dgcrsvixov, said to approach to
 gold in its colour, and which is described by Vitruvius f as found
 native in Pontus, and which is evidently sulphuret of arsenic ;
 and a pale sandarach, said by Pliny to have been found in gold
 and silver mines, and which was imitated at Rome by a partial
 calcination of ceruse, and, which must have been massicot, or
 the yellow oxide of lead mixed with minium.                That there was a
 colour called by the Romans sandarach, different from pure
 minium, is evident from what Pliny says ; namely, that the palest
 kind of orpiment resembles sandarach, and from the line of
  Kevius, one of the most ancient Latin poets, " Merula sanda-
 racino ore :'v so that this colour must have been a bright yellow
 similar to that of the beak of the blackbird J. Dioscoridcs de
 scribes the best <ra.vtiuqa.yy as approaching in colour to ver
 milion §, and the Greeks probably always applied this term to
 minium ; but the Romans seem to have used it in a different
 sense ; and some confusion was natural when different colours
 were prepared from the same substance by different degrees of
  calcination.
      I have not detected the use of orpiment in any of the ancient
 fresco paintings ; but a deep yellow approaching to orange, which
  covered a piece of stucco in the ruins near the monument of
  Caius Cestius, proved to be oxide of lead, and consisted of mas
  sicot mixed with minium.             It is probable that the ancients used
  many      colours     from   lead of   different tints between the usta of

Or pale massicot.
   The yellows in the Aldobrantlini picture are all ochres. I ex
amined the colours in a very spirited picture, on the wall of one
of the houses at Pompeii, of a lion and a man ; they all proved
to be red and yellow ochres.
            IV. Of the Blue Colours of the Ancients.
   Different shades of blue are used in the different apartments
of the baths of Titus, and several very fine blues exist in the mix
tures of colours to which I have referred in the last two sections.
   These blues are pale or darker, according as they containi
larger or smaller quantities of carbonate of lime ; but when this
carbonate of lime is dissolved by acids, they present the same
body colour, a very fine blue powder similar to the best smalt
or to ultramarine, rough to the touch, and which does not lose
its colour by being heated to redness ; but which becomes ag
glutinated and semifused at a white heat.
    This blue I found was very little acted on by acids.       Nitre-
muriatic acid by being long boiled upon it gained, however, a
slight tint of yellow, and afforded proofs of the presence of oxide
of copper.
    A quantity of the colour was fused for half an hour with twice
its weight of hydrate of potassa; the mass, which was blueish
green, was treated by muriatic acid in the manner usually em
ployed for the analysis of siliceous stones, when it afforded a
 quantity of silica equal to more than 3-5ths of its weight.     The
 colouring master- readily dissolved in solution of ammonia, to
which it gave a bright blue tint, and it proved to be oxide of
 copper.    The residuum afforded a considerable quantity of alu-
 mine, and a small quantity of lime.
    Amongst some rubbish that had been collected in one of the
 chambers of the baths of Titus, I found several large lumps cf a
 deep, blue frit, which when powdered and mixed with chalk pro
 duced colours exactly the same as those used in the baths, and
 which when submitted to chemical tests were found to be the
same   in composition.
   The minute quantity of lime found in this substance was not
sufficient to account for its fusibility: it was therefore reasonable
to expect, the presence of a fixed alkali in it ; and on fusing some
of it with three times its weight of boracic acid, and treating
the mass with nitric acid and carbonate of ammonia, and after
wards distilling sulphuric acid from       it,
                                             I procured from  it  sul
phate   of soda; which  proves  that  it was   frit
                                                 a  made by  means  of
soda, and coloured with oxide of copper.
   The undiluted colour in its form of frit     used for ornamenting
                                                 is

some of the mouldings detached from the ceilings of the charn*
bers in the baths of Titus : and the walls of one chamber between
the compartments of red marble, bear proofs of having been co
vered with this frit, and retain a considerable quantity of it.
    There is every reason to believe that this is the colour de
scribed by Theophrastus as discovered by an Egyptian king * ;
and of which the manufactory is said to have been anciently
established at Alexandria.
    Vitruvius speaks of     under the name of cceruleum\, as the
                                  it,
colour used commonly in painting chambers, and states, that                 it
was made in his time at Puzzuoli, where the method of fabrica
ting     was brought from Egypt by Vestorius

         %,
    Pliny mentions other blues, which he calls species of sand
{arena!) from the mines of Egypt, Scythia, and Cyprus.         These
natural blues, there      reason to believe, were different prepara
                             is
tions of lapis lazuli, and of the blue carbonates and arseniates of
copper.
    Both Pliny and Vitruvius speak of the Indian blue, which the
first author states to be combustible, and which was evidently               a
species of idigo.
.   Ihave examined several blues in the fragments of fresco paint
ing from the ruins near the monument of Caius Cestius.        In             a
deep   blue approaching  in tint to indigo, found little

of copper, but the basis of this colour was the frit before de
scribed.
   The blues in the Nozze Aldobrandine, from their resisting the
action of acids, and from the effects of fire,   am inclined to
                                                         I
consider as composed of the Alexandrian or Puzzuoli blue.
   In an excavation made at Pompeii, in May 1814, at which                  I
was present, a small pot containing a pale blue colour was dug
up, which the exalted personage,              by
                                     whose command the exca
vation was made, was so good as to put into my hands.                       It
proved to be a mixture of carbonate of lime with the Alexandrian
frit§.
   Vitruvius states, that the ancients had mode of imitating the
                                                   a
Indian blue or indigo,             by
                            mixing the powder of the glass called
by   the   Greeks  uahos,  with   selinusian t"creta" or annularian
"  creta,"   which  was white clay or chalk mixed with stained
glass    the same practice
         ;                     likewise referred to

    * De Lapidibus,      sect, xcviii.       f  Lib. vii. cap. 11.
I     This identifies   the nitrum of the ancients with carbonate of soda.
      This probably     is the same colour as that examined  bj  M. Chaptal. He
    not search in     it for alkali, or thereisevery reason to suppose he would
have found soda.
                                                                        There

were similar to our smalt.     I have not found any powdered co?
lour of this kind in the baths of Titus, or in any other Roman
ruins ; but a blue glass tinged with cobalt is very common in
those ruins, which when powdered forms a pale smalt.1
    I have examined many pastes and glasses that contain oxide
of copper j they are all blueish green, green, or of an opaque
watery blue.    The transparent blue glass vessels which are found
with the vases in the tombs in Magna Greeia are tinged with
cobalt; and on analysing different ancient transparent blue glasses
•which Mr. Millingen was so good as to give me, 1 found cobalt
 in all of them*.
    Theophrastus, in speaking of the manufacture of glass, states
as a report that "
                    %a\xbs" was used to give it a fine colour, and
it is extremely probable that the Greeks took cobalt for a
 species   of ^aXxb;.  I have examined some Egyptian pastes
which are all tinged blue and green with copper ; but though I
 have made experiments on nine different specimens of ancient
 Greek and Roman transparent blue glass, I have not found cop
 per in any, but cobalt in all of themf.

was pale grass green, had the character of carbonate of copper
 mixed with chalk ; and a third, which was sea green, was 'a
 green combination of copper mixed with the blue copper frit.
      All the greens that I examined on the walls of the baths of
 Titus were combinations of copper.                 From the extreme bril
 liancy of a green which I found in the vineyard to winch 1 have
 60 often referred, I suspected that it might contain arsenious
 acid, and be analogous to Scheele's green ; but on submitting it
\o experiments, it afforded no indications of this substance, and
 proved to be a pure carbonate of copper.
      The greens of copper were well known to the Greeks ; the
 most esteemed is described by Theophrastus and Dioscorides
 under the name of xgucroxoKka, and is stated by both to be found
 in metallic veins.
      Vitruvius mentions chrysocolla as a native substance found in
 copper mines, and Plinv speaks of an artificial chrysocolla made
 from the clay found in the neighbourhood of metallic veins, which
 clay was most probably impregnated with copper.                 He describes
 it as rendered green by the herb luteum. There is every reason
 to believe, that the native chrysocolla was carbonate of copper,
 and that the artificial was clay impregnated with sulphate of
 copper rendered green by a yellow dye.
     Some commentators have supposed that chrysocolla is the
'same substance as borax, because Pliny has mentioned that a
 preparation called by this name was used by goldsmiths for sol-
tiering gold* ; but nothing can be more gross than this mistake,
 which, however, has been copied into many elementary books of
 chemistry.         The material used for soldering gold consisted of
 carbonate or oxide of copper mixed with alkaline phosphates.
 This is evident from the description of Dioscorides " Ilegi io5
 trxcuA.))-/coj," lib. v. c. 92, who says it was prepared from urine
 treated in brass mortars.             Plinv says likewise, that it was pre
 pared from
                  " Cypria »rugine et pueri impubis urina, addito rii-
 trof." The name of chrysocolla was probably derived from the
 green powder used by the goldsmiths, and which contained car
 bonate of copper as one of its ingredients J.
      Amongst the substances found in the baths of Titus were some
 masses of a grass green colour.              I at first thbught these might

 this is merely an inaccurate account of the decomposition of a vein con
 taining copper. We have no reason for supposing that the Greeks and
 Tipruans were acquainted with borax. Pliny, probably misled by the ap
 plication of the same name to different substances, considered chrysocolla
 as the cement of gold in mineral veins.

of red oxide of copper, so that probably these substances had
been copper nails or small pieces of copper used in the building,
converted by the action of the air, during so many centuries, into
oxide and carbonate.
    The ancients, as it appears from Theophrastus, were well
acquainted     with verdigrise.     Vitruvius mentions it amongst
pigments; and probably many of the ancient greens, whieh are
now carbonate of copper, were originally laid or^ in the state of
acetite.
    The ancients had beautiful deep green glasses, which I find
are tinged with oxide of copper ; but it does not. appear that
they used these glasses in a state of powder as pigments.
    The greens of the Aldobrandini picture are all of copper, as
was evident from the action of the muriatic acid upon them.

 LXIV.     The Electric Column considered as a maintaining
    Power, or First Mover for mechanical Purposes. By Georgk
    John Singer, Esq.
 The     power of the electric column as a source of mechanical
 action, was first discovered and applied by that excellent philo
 sopher M. De Luc, the admirable inventor of that important
 instrument; and it is to his active discrimination and unceasing
exertions we are indebted for the principal mechanical arrange
 ments which have been employed to render the -variable action
 of the column equal to the production of a constant though un
 equal motion.
    The principal object of such an attempt is to enable an ob
 server to measure the actual variation in the power of the column
 at different times, and under dissimilar circumstances ; and, by
 a comparison of these changes with the usual meteorological
 phenomena, to ascertain if any connexion can be traced between
 the spontaneous electricity of the column, and the natural elec
 tricity of the earth and the atmosphere.
    For this purpose anv arrangement may be employed which is
 capable either of producing or maintaining the motion of light
 substances by the immediate action of the column; and that will
 be most eligible which produces this effect most certainly, and
 by the least complex means.

 leaves of Bennet's electrometer are made to open, and strike the

the comparative power of the instrument at different times : but
its distinct expression is prevented by the tendency of the gold-
leaves to stick to the sides of the glass ; and this arrangement                             is.
therefore        by

are not strictly attended to, the motion will soon cease           and the       ;
want of complete success in the original experiments of M. De
Luc and of Mr. B. M. Forsjter most probably arose from this
cause   ; for, in the construction of a number of instruments on
this plan,      have had but one failure, and in that instance the

apparatus was finished in such haste as to preclude a proper
attention to the circumstances above stated.

pendulum, being in conducting communication with the positive
extremity of the column, will necessarily recede from it and ap
proach the opposite ball ; but it is prevented from actual con
tact with that ball by a brass fork F, across which a very fine
silver wire is stretched.       This wire discharges the electricity of
the pendulum, and at the same time produces a kind of jerk
which prevents the pith-ball from sticking : the pendulum now
falls again into contact with the positive ball, but becoming
again electrical recedes from it and again strikes the cross wire;
and in this Way, if properly constructed, may continue its vibra
tions for an unliniited period.
    I have sometimes made a variation in this apparatus, by re
moving the cross wire and the conducting support of the pendu
lum, and by substituting for it a pith-ball suspended by a silk
 thread, and accurately proportioned in weight and size to the
medium power of the column. By this means the motion occur?
pver more space than in either of the preceding arrangements,,
and is therefore more obvious, and well calculated for observa
 tion, as the irregularity is considerable, and may be noticed when
the temperature of the surrounding medium varies but slightly.
    During my employment of the very extensive series of co
lumns I have constructed, I have frequently attempted to produce
a rotatory motion by the direct action of their electrical power,
but hitherto the attempt has continued unsuccessful; by indirect
 means, however, the same object has of late been very ingeniously
 obtained.     In October last, my friend Mr. Lightfoot, a very ac
 tive philosopher,    who has made many interesting observations
 on this subject, first suggested the employment of an inflexible
 pendulum as a means of converting the reciprocating motion,
 usually produced py the column into a source of rotatory move
 ment ; and, the correctness of this idea was soon afterwards
 practically verified by my pupil Mr. F. Ronalds, who with the
 assistance of, a watchmaker has made a very successful and truly
 ingenious arrangement, by which a simple and curious electrical
 clock is produced.
     The rotatory motion obtained by this indirect means, is how
 ever rather curious than useful ; for it is scarcely so correct an
 indication of the power of the column as the simple pendulum,
 and requires a much more extensive series to keep it in motion;
 it cannot therefore be preferred for the usual purposes of obser
 vation, and has I fear very little chance of becoming at all use
 ful as a time-keeper ; for the variable action of the column must
 render it a most irregular maintaining power, which it will be
 very difficult, if not impossible, to correct effectually.
     The most elegant and at the same time the most simple move->
  ment yet produced by the action of the electric column appeal?

   to be that employed by Signior Zamboni, who has made soma
   interesting discoveries on the general structure of the instrument.
   He employs a vertical needle supported by a delicate pivot or
   knife-edge a little above its centre of gravity, the position of
   which may be readily altered by means of a sliding weight at
   tached to the lower extremity of the needle, which may by that
   means be so adjusted as to possess the properties of an accurate
   scale-beam, and will maintain its oscillations over a considerable
   space by a very slight impulse.
      The upper end of the needle, for at least an inch, is formed
   of varnished glass; and on this a ring of gold, or a gilded ball of
   pith or cork, is fixed ; the axis of the needle is supported midway
   between two vertical columns insulated, but connected together
   at bottom, so that the upper ends of the columns become the
   positive and negative extremities of Ihe series ; the. upper and
   insulated extremity of the needle comes in contact alternately
   with each of these ends, receives its electrical state, and recedes
   towards the other, where the same process ensues ; and thus the
  vibrations of the needle are maintained with great constancy over
   a considerable space.
       Fig. 3 represents the form I have employed for this con
   struction : the needle js supported by a brass arm which slides
   on one of the columns; it is suspended by a delicate pivot, and
   has at its summit a fine varnished glass tube to .which a gilded
  ball is affixed ; the lower extremity of the needle is provided with
   a sliding weight, by which the relation of the centre of gravity to
   the point of suspension is accurately adjusted : to render the
   contacts perfect, and least liable ,to change, the gilded ball does
  norstrike the brass caps of the columns, but touches alternately
  two gold wires connected with them.
      In this construction the needle is not moved by the direct at
  traction of the column ; but bemg once put into a state of vibra
  tion, its motion, which would naturally decline, and finally ter
  minate by the operation of friction and by the resistance of the
  air, is renewed at each contact by the impulse of electrical at
  traction, which is alternately exerted on the needle in opposite
  directions by each extremity of the column ; and as this attrac
  tion does not sensibly act on the pendulum until it is very near
  the attracting surface, its operation commences when it is most
  wanted, and, without materially affecting the action of the pen-
  dnhim in any other way, occasions it to describe constantly
  equal arcs at every vibration.
      It is obvious, that by connecting a proper lever and ratchet-
  wheel with the axis of the needle, motion may be readily com-
> municated to indexes, or to other wheels ; and this I am in
  formed has been done during the past year, by some experimen
                                                                 talists

              On the Coal and Stone Strata      of Durham.          363
talists on the continent.    I have since tried the experiment, and
find it succeeds perfectly, but requires a more extensive series to
overcome the increased friction.
     An effect very nearly resembling the action of the beam of a
steam-engine may be produced by placing the needle in a hori
zontal instead of a vertical position.      For this purpose it should
be constructed in the same manner as an ordinary scale-beam ;
having equal arms terminated by gilt balls, and its point of sus
pension above its centre of gravity.       If a needle of this kind be
insulated, and placed with one of its balls a few inches above
the positive extremity of a powerful column, whilst the opposite
ball is similarly situated with respect to the negative extremity,
it will, when once put into a state of oscillation, continue to move
with considerable regularity, and with a momentum which ren
ders it probable that, by the application of a proper mechanical
arrangement, a tolerably regular source of rotatory motion would
be obtained.
     I have now completed a series of columns comprising up
wards of 50,000 groups of a peculiar and powerful arrangement,
but have not as yet combined them so as to institute any accurate
experiments on their effects ; but I trust it will not be long ere
I have leisure to accomplish this object.

but are sometimes replaced by beds of different descriptions at
places by no means distant from each other ; and of course that
a single section, such as that adopted by Mr. Forster, can convey-
but a very inadequate idea of the stratification of this part of the
kingdom. But should his residence be out of town, the fol
lowing information relative to the Newcastle grindstone bed
may prove acceptable to him.          On Gateshead Fell and Wick-
ham Banks (see the Map of Durham) this stratum is 1 1 fathoms
thick, and lies 33 fathoms above the High Main Coalj it is also

 accounts     of the dreadful accident which happened at Heaton
 Colliery, on Wednesday the 3d of this month; yet as these
 paragraphs appear to be only short. extracts from our provincial
 newspapers, the editors of which have omitted a description of
 the local situation of the mine and other circumstances well
 known, and of course uninteresting to their readers in this part
 of the kingdom ; — I trust the particulars now transmitted vou
 will be deemed worthy a place in the Philosophical Magazine ;
 and under the impression that your Journal is perused by many
 gentlemen connected with mining pursuits, I shall offer no
 apology for detailing some minute occurrences, or occasionally
 making use of technical terms when applicable. — Heaton Col
 liery lies a mile and a half east of this townj and was won
 about twenty-five years ago ; the workings are carried on in the
 High Main Coal, from the dip where the engine-pits are sunk
 to the depth of about eighty fathoms, towards the rise, where there
                                                                             -
 may be twenty-five fathoms covering on the seam : but here the
                                                                   present

                      '
                   .      at Heaton Collieryt                       365
present 6wners have put down no shafts ; the inclination of the
strata is nearly east and by south.    To the west and north-west of
Heaton     Hall are  the wastes of ancient collieries long since aban
doned.      The conductors of the mine, well aware of the great
body of water they would have to contend with when they ap
proached these boundaries, had increased the number of their
steam-engines to three {one of which is of the power of 1.30
horses), the whole being capable of drawing 1200 gallons each
minute ; and by this prudent precaution had already freed them
selves from the water pressing upon them from the west ; but
that accumulated towards the north-west was still to be let off.
For this purpose a drift was driven in a direction to perforate the
old workings near Heaton Burn, a little to the north and by
east of the Hall, where the remains of numerous pit heaps are
to be seen. An upcast dike of eight fathoms had just been
passed through ; this should have served to point out the spot
where the miners of former times were from necessity likely to
suspend their labours ; and now all due precaution should have
been used to guard against impending danger.           This drift in the
stone had been driven in a sloping direction upwards to regain
the seam, and two feet of coal already formed its roof. — At four
o'clock on the fatal morning, Mr. Miller, the resident or under
viewer, visited the men engaged in this operation, and a dripping
of water from the roof being pointed out to him, he gave direc
tions that the work should be squared up ; and said " he would
send in the borers at nine o'clock with the next shift, to ascer
tain whether the water proceeded from the waste or no.           In less
than a quarter of an hour after this conversation took place,
the water began to run more freely through the chink ; and the
two drifters becoming rather alarmed, sent their boy to apprize
two other men who were working near them, with the state of
the mine ; also directed him to go to the crain where the caves
of coals are delivered from the board-ways into the waggon or
rollywa^, and acquaint the whole of the men in the pit of their
danger. The youth asserts that no one was at the crain when
he reached it; but this is altogether improbable, and no doubt is
entertained that, impelled by fear, he made the best of his way
to the shaft and escaped. The two workmen first mentioned
had now quitted the face of the drift, and one of them recollect
ing that he had left his jacket behind, proposed to the other to
return and see how the water was coining off; but at this in
stant a frightful crash, accompanied by a violent gust of wind,
which extinguished the candles, warned them that an immense
tor rent of water was rushing into the mine ; they fled precipi
tately towards the working shaft, distant about a mile ; and, as
the water of course flowed first down the lowest level, reached
          '                      -                                     it

  it just in     time to save their lives.      The two men who were
  working     near  them,  the boy  before  mentioned,  and fifteen other
  men    and   boys  who  were on   the rollyway, were so fortunate as
  to make their escape, but not till the last of them was up to his
  waist in water.       Every possibility of retreat to those left behind
  was now cut off; and, shocking to relate, seventy-five human
  beings, including Mr. Miller, were shut up in the workings to
  wards the rise of the colliery, either to perish by hunger, or die
  for want of respirable air ; and twenty-four hours elapsed before
  the water rose to twenty-five fathoms in the engine pit ; if it
  could even then displace the air confined in the higher part of
  the mine.        Some faint expectations were entertained during the
  course of the first day, that a communication might be opened
  to these unhappy people, by uncovering and descending through
  one of the old shafts at Hcaton Banks; but before the scaf
  folding was reached, the surrounding earth fell in, and every
  glimpse of hope vanished. — Workmen are now busied in clearing
   out a shaft in front of Heaton Hall; but owing to rubbish which
  has accumulated at the bottom, and the carburetted hydrogen
  which is ascending in great profusion, much time must be spent
   before that part of the workings can be inspected, where most
   of the pitmen were known to be employed when the accident
   took place.
      The sufferers who thus found       a living grave have left twenty-
-
   four widows and seventy-seven           orphans, besides Mrs. Miller
   and her eight children, to deplore their untimely fate. — I am
   happy to add, that a subscription is now on foot to relieve the
   pecuniary distress of their families.                             N.

    Olservations, chiefly practical, on some of the more common
       Diseases of the Horse; together with Remarks upon the ge
       neral Articles of Diet, and the ordmary Stable Management
       of' that Animal.      By Thomas Peall, Veterinary Professor
       and Lecturer to the Right Hon. the Dublin Society, and Ve
       terinary Surgeon in the Royal Artillery. 4to, 360 pages.
   M r. Peall speaks with much            modesty of his pretensions as an
    author.     His work, howeyer, is replete with so much useful
    practical information, that it cannot fail to prove acceptable, not
    only to professional people, but to every gentleman who would
    rescue his cattle from the destructive empiricism of grooms and

                      Notices respecting New Books.                        367
common farriers.           The author's views of some of the diseases
to which this noble animal is liable, appear to us to be new, and
the treatment recommended, highly judicious.                   He ridicules the
idea of a vitiated, foul state of the blood and humours being the
cause of the grease, the great winter disease of horses that are
kept in large crowded towns.             It . is seen but rarely (in com
parison) in the country, especially among such as are employed
in agriculture ; and least of all among those of the latter kind
that perform work of a regular kind.                 No disease to which the
horse is liable, appears to the author to arise more decidedly from
the ordinary management of stables, or to be less a necessary
consequence of domesticating this animal.                  In opposition to the
opinion of the late professor St. Bel, that this disease is contagious,
he urges, that where numbers of horses are all treated in the
same way, and exposed to the same exciting cause of disease,
nothing can be more natural tkan that 'numbers should be at
 tacked with similar morbid symptoms — " Stripped of all mystery
 and all the technical language of the schools j the grease may
be considered, simply, as an inflammation of the skin of the fet
 lock joint.        The disease is,  in truth, the chilblain of the horse.''
            " We shall cease to wonder that the skin of the fetlock
is   liable to be attacked with inflammation, especially in the win
 ter season,     if we consider the peculiar circumstances to which           it
is   exposed.             The seat of the disease   is   remote from the great
 fountain of life, the        heart          .The fetlocks are exposed to
 greater vicissitudes of heat and cold than any other part of the
 animal — at one moment enveloped in             a      bed of hot litter and
 feces at   a   temperature of 50° to 60c; the next, exposed to a cur
 rent of cold air several degrees below the freezing point;" — and
 sometimes standing for hours in snow, or bruised ice.                    " The
 skin  is    frequently not merely imbued with moisture, but with
  such as   is  of a most deleterious kind, to a part susceptible of in
  flammation, namelv, the urine of the animal             ;     which contains
  a great deal of volatile alkali, even before that salt can be ea-
  gendered       bythe putrefactive fermentation of the litter."         We re
  gret that our limits do not permit us to lay before our readers
  the whole of the author's reasoning and proofs in support of his
  opinion.      Though the author considers the grease not as a con
  stitutional but as a local disease, brought on          by    external causes
  alone, yet    he    does  not  maintain     that   internal   remedies   oughs
jiever to be used — for    "   it    happens, every now and then, that
  the inflammation of the diseased limb        is   so prodigiously high,thsjt
  the constitution    is   found to sympathize with the diseased parts-,
  and generally fever and derangement of .the system are the con»
  sequences.         But the chief reason why this complaint     is   frequently
  fouud    so  difficult  of cure,
                                 is   owing    to  the  circumstance    of consi

 dering it a primary disease of the constitution ; whlch^ it is sup
 posed, must he amended before the complaint can be cured.
  Hence the farrago of alteratives," &c. &c. which are frequently
 exhibited for weeks, sometimes months, where a judicious appli
 cation of simple external remedies would be found capable of
 effecting a cure in as many days.      But we must refer our readers

  'Travels in South  Africa, undertaken at the Request of the Mis
      sionary Society.    By John Campbell. 8vo. 596 pages.
     We notice this publication (in which there are some^curious
 details, which cannot but prove interesting to those particularly
  who recommended the voyage) chiefly for the purpose of giving
  a few extracts of detached facts which may be acceptable to such
 of our readers as are fond of natural history. The author's route,
 marked on a map which is given in the volume, was from Cape
  Town, about 1 8° 20' S. long, and 34° S. lat. in a direction nearly
 east to 27° 1C ; then northerly (with some westerly deviations)
 to lat. 27° 40' S. whence he proceeded easterly, then SW. till
 he reached the banks of Yellow River, at about 26° 30" E. long,
 and 20° 30' S. lat. This river runs westerly, and towards its
 mouth takes the name of Great or Orange River.           It runs into
 the South Atlantic Ocean at .about 16° 50' E. long, and 28° 30'
 S. lat. Mr. Campbell's general route was then in the direction
 of this river, from the point at which he approached it to about
 1 S3 E. long., when he travelled     southerly, the most direct way
he could find to Cape Town.          In this route, a great part of
which had never been visited by any European, the author en
countered the usual inconveniences which accompany travellers
among uncivilised tribes, and met with some facts so curious as to
procure them a slight notice in his pages, though his journey had
other and more important objects in view — the future civilisa
tion and moral improvement of the sons of Africa. Mr. Camp
bell left England in July 1812, and reached Cape Town on the
24th of October. After a few weeks residence there, and visiting
different missionary settlements, the author and his small party
set off on his projected journey on the 13th of Feb. 1813, with
three waggons (afterwards augmented to five) each drawn by
                                                               twelve

October.
    Feb. 16. — Killed a grav serpent, which shone in the dark, and
emitted a rattling sound, evidently intended by Providence to
give warning of its approach.
    March 15. — Counted 29 aloes in flower.          Some of the stalks
measured 38 feet in height, and 2£ feet in circumfeience at the
bottom ; — a wonderful growth in one year!             What a curiosity
would these be esteemed in the vicinity of London, where it is
believed they come into flower only once in 100 years !               If an
aloe produces seed when it sends on a flower, it dies that year;
if not, it lives and sends forth a flower again.
    March 1 9. — Saw numerous ants' nests. In shape they resem
ble a baker's oven, and are from two to four feet high.              These
industrious animals have their enemies, especially a creature
 about the size of a fox, who, after piercing a hole in the side of
 the nest, pushes in his tongue, when the unwary ants rush to-
 wardsjt in order to investigate what has happened.          The tongue
 being covered with these insects, he draws it in, and swallows
 the whole, repeating the process till he has devoured millions.
 The bees sometimes covet and take possession of the house.
 The boors also, when travelling, frequently clear out these nests,
 and use them as ovens for baking their bread.
     April 13. — Came in sight of some springbucks, which af
 forded great amusement, from their springing at least six feet
 every leap in height, and several yards in length.        However near
 a person may be to them, no motion of their legs can be per
 ceived.    The instant they touch the ground they rise again into
 the air, which makes their motion resemble flying.           When they
 leap,  the  ground   on which   they light seems   as if elastic.
     April 25. — A honey-bird, which leads travellers to hives of
 bees, invited us, by chirping, to a place where honey might be
 found.     One or two of our escort went towards         it,

 from tree to tree chirping but as the hive appeared too distant
                              ;
  they returned.
     May 18. — Commenced keeping watch at night. The Hot

  attack from the windward, because then the dogs smell them
  and give an alarm.

  The ground being      now  softened   byrain, they pull up    roots,    not
  only for present consumption, but for future use.            In   summer
  they are supplied with locusts, which they dry and pound into
  powder, which serves as    a  substitute for flour.

while.   Its thorns exactly resemble fishing-hooks ; so that,            if
they catch hold of your clothes as you pass, you must stop, some
times along while, before you get clear of them.       In clearing
one arm the other is caught; and without the cautious assistance
of a second person there is no escaping, but by main force and
losing part of your clothes.
     June 17- — Halted at Blink (or Shining) Hill, so called on ac
 count of a shining stone, resembling the lead of which pencils
 are made in England.        This the Bushmans and others grind
 to dust, which they use as we do hair-powder.          A red stone with
 which the surrounding nations paint their bodies, comes also
 from this hill, and forms an article of barter.        This mountain is
 a kind of Mecca to the surrounding nations. . They are con
 stantly making pilgrimages hither, not indeed to pay religious
 homage, but to obtain supplies of blue powder for their hair.
 This custom has existed time immemorial.               Accompanied by
 Mr. Reid and our Hottentots with candles, the mine was entered.
 After descending with sonie difficulty, we soon lost sight of the
 world, sometimes wading half-leg deep in black-lead dust. The
 roof was full of projecting pieces of the shining rock, and large
 caverns appeared on each side as we advanced.            The roof at one
  place appeared curiously    carved.    Touching part of it which we
                                                     a
 could reach, we perceived it had life. It proved to be composed of
  a multitude of bats hanging asleep from the roof.         Moving them
  backwards and forwards neither awoke nor made any of them
 lose their hold of the rock, to which they clung by the claws of
  their binder legs ; but holding the candle at a little distance un
  der one of them awoke       it,  when    itflew to another part of the
  cave.     Having  advanced   about   100  feet, the cavern became so
  low and narrow, that we could proceed no further in that direc
  tion. We returned, and went,        by   apassage leading to the right,
  deeper into the mountain, and entered a large cavern the bottom
  of which was strewed with the bones of animnls, and some parts
  indicated fires having been made in it.           After collecting some
  specimens    of  the  rock  and   powder,    we  returned   to day-light
  nearly   as black  as chimney-sweepers.
      Killed
           a   buffalo and wounded two.         The buffalo   is  often ex

  enemy climb a tree, he    is  far from being out of danger       ; for the
  animal will run with violence and strike the tree with his massy
  horns, which cover as with a helmet the crown of his head
  the stroke of which will so shake the largest trees as to require      a ;
'firm hold indeed to prevent the person falling to the ground,

city. By the map it appears to be situated in long. 25° 55' E.
lat". 26i 20' S. where they remained till the 7th of July.       They
were treated with hospitality: not a single article was stolen
from them during their stay, except two buttons, for which the
culprit was driven out of the public square. The king agreed
to receive missionaries for the instruction of his people.       They
had heard, they said, that there was a Great Being, but they
knew him not, having never seen him.           On one occasion, about
a dozen people sitting a few yards from Mr. Campbell's tent were
singing one word with a little variation, viz. Hailylallay — Hie-
 laylaliay.     After repeating it six or eight times in chorus, they
paused, and began all at once again.           [May not this be a cor
rupted pronunciation       of  Hallelujah?     which,  with some va
 rieties in pronunciation, is still in use among all the northern
 inhabitants of Africa.]
     Aug. 11. — Hardcastle is surrounded by mountains of asbestos.
 It is disposed between rock strata. That which becomes, by
 a little beating, soft as cotton, is of a prussian blue colour.      I
 found some of the colour of gold, but not soft or of a cotton
 texture like the blue ; some I found white, brown, green, &c.
  Cloth of this substance stands the fire. The ancients burnt
 their dead in such cloth, to obtain their ashes ; and it is remark
 able that in the language of the Griquaas it is called handker-

      Aug. 14. — Observed a camel-thorn tree stripped of its leaves
 by the winter, which was just over; but there were three branches
 of a different kind of tree, or bush, which had been engrafted into
  it by a bird; which is a common occurrence in this country: these
  branches were full of leaves.
      Sept. 10. — A tree was observed having two remarkable nests
  on it ; one about four yards in circumference ; the other three,
 and about a yard in depth.        They are built of coarse grass, by a
  small  bird  resembling  our  goldfinch.    One of the nests had se
  venteen holes in the bottom, the other seveH, by which the birds
  enter.    At one time I saw about a hundred come out of them.
  Instead of being the nest of a single pair, they seem to be kraals
  or towns of birds.
      I was for some time surprised how such multitudes of lizards
  and mice as inhabit the Desert could live without water; but I
  observed many succulent plants of various kinds loaded with
  small berries containing water.       I poured out of one large berry
  about three teaspoonfuls of water ; and I witnessed the mice
  dragging them to their holes, just as seamen take casks of water
   into their ships. This is a wonderful provision God has made
   to supply the wants of these little animals.

 well as myself stood wondering at this exhibition.           The Hotten

     Sept. 28. — Four scorpions were put into a hole dug in the
 earth.    They soon began to fight.             The mode yvas curious.
 Having two claws like a crab's, with these they attempted to
 seize each other by the head.            When one happened to be thus
 caught,   he   seemed    sensible  of. his danger and cried out ; but the
 other, regardless     of  his cries, turned  round his tail and gave him
 one sting. The one that was stung, as if aware of its mortality,
 resisted no more, but lay down till he died.               The other, as
 if aware of the same thing, gave himself no further troublet
 They all had the same method of fighting, and all the vanquished
 acted in the same manner.            The surviving conqueror was put
 to death, as too dangerous to be allowed to escape.
    April 21. — On the voyage home crossed the equator, and had
 an opportunity to see verified Dr. Franklin's assertion, that oil
 thrown upon agitated water will smooth it.           A South Sea whaler
near us pumped out her bilge-water, which was mixed with oil ;
when the sea for a quarter of a mile behind her became as smooth
as glass.
A practical      Treatise on Gas Light ; exhibiting a summary De
    scription of the Apparatus and Machinery best calculated for
    illuminating Streets, Houses, and Manufactories with car-
    buretted Hydrogen or Coal Gas; with Remarks on the Uti
    lity, Safety and general Nature of this new Branch of
    civil (Economy.           By Fredrick Accum. 8vo. Ackerman.
    pp.  200.
    Our readers are of course aware that the rapid increase in
price of late years, of the materials for producing light, has given
rise to a new and beautiful substitute for oil, wax, and tallow ;
this new method consists in burning the gas obtainable from
common pit-coal by distillation, and the light so obtained is
known by the name of Gas Light.                                          .
    At an early period in the history of the introduction of this
improvement into the British empire, Mr. Accum was called
upon to give the aid of his extensive practical knowledge as a
chemist, in investigating the merits of the new institution, .and
                                                                      had

                         Notices' respecting New Books.           373
  had the honour to be selected to give evidence of its utility and
  ceconomy before both houses of parliament. It is with peculiar sa
•
  tisfaction, therefore, that we find him coming before the public as
  the author of a popular treatise on this new branch of domestic
  ueconomy, convinced as we are that few could be found better
  qualified for the task.
      The more immediate object of Mr. Accum's treatise is to de
  scribe the apparatus now so successfully employed for manufac
  turing coal-gas in the large way, and to point out the means
  adopted for carrying this new mode of illumination into effect,
  for illuminating streets, houses, and manufactories.
      The work is divided into two parts : the first part is in some
  measure preliminary, and independent of the second.        The for
  mer embraces a concise and popular view of the general theory
  and production of artificial light — the illuminating powers of
  candles, lamps, and gas lights of different kinds, with regard to
  the quantity of combustible material consumed ; the mode of
  measuring the intensities of light obtained from different com
  bustible bodies, so as to ascertain their value; together with such
  other facts and observations as the author deemed necessary to
  clear the road, and enable those who are not familiar with che
  mistry fully to understand the nature of the gas-light iHumina-
.
  tion.
      This  is succeeded by a chemical view of the general nature of
  coal — the chemical' changes which this substance undergoes
  when employed in the production of gas-light — the different pro
  ducts it furnishes — the operations necessary for obtaining them
  —their quantities and applications in the various arts of life —
  together with an historical sketch of- the rise and progress of the
  gas-light illumination.
      The second part of the treatise, and by far the most copious,
  is dedicated to the summary, details of the new art of illumina
  tion. We there find the data for calculating the expense that
  must attend the application of this new species of light, under
  different circumstances, when compared with the lights now in
  use — the obvious effects which the discovery of lighting with coal
  gas must     inevitably produce upon the arts and upon domestic
  ceconomy — its primary advantages — its ulterior promises — its li
  mits — and the resources it presents to industry and public cecono-
ririy.    The author has candidly shown how far the gas-light ap
  plication is safe, and in what respect it is entitled to the publfc
   approbation and national encouragement.
      Our limits will not allow us to speak in detail of the merits of
   this work : the abilities of the author have been long known as
  a philosophical and practical chemist.       In the present work he
                                   A a3                            has

374                        Royal Society.
has displayed much candour and impartiality, and knowledge of
the subject on which he writes.      His book will be found highly
useful to those who wish to acquire a practical knowledge of the
subject on which it treats, and will enable mechanics to erect the
 apparatus necessary for carrying the gas-light illumination into
 effect.    It will remove many misapprehensions concerning the
safety of the new lights ; it will show the impossibility of streets
 or towns illuminated with coal being suddenly thrown into dark
ness by the fracture of one or more gas-light mains, or by the
destruction of one or more of the gas-light machineries, as
 has been represented by some misguided individuals ; and it will
 give to those who are unacquainted with the nature of the gas
 light illumination, a fair and not over- charged statement of the
 merits and defects of this new art of illumination; whilst at the
 same time the chemist will meet with facts relating to the sub
ject of the gas-light illumination, which will arrest his attention,
 and add to the general stock of chemical knowledge.
    The plates, which are seven in number, are neatly engraved :
 they exhibit not only the large machineries now successfully em
 ployed in lighting streets, houses, and public edifices in this me
 tropolis, but likewise the smaller apparatus made use of in ma
 nufactories and other private establishments.
     Before concluding,   we cannot avoid recommending to the
 different gas companies to pay attention to the purifying of their
 gas by passing it through water, and particularly to avoid the
 use of coals containing sulphur, as we have noticed that where-
 ever sulphur is burnt, as in vitriol manufactories, the workmen
 always lose their teeth, and very speedily too.   We mention this
 with no invidious intention ; for we consider the introduction of
 gas-light into general use as an object of great national import
 ance; and we would be sorry, should ignorance or inattention on
 the part of those who embark in- such undertakings, as objects
 of commercial speculation, induce an effect which would set the
 whole community in array against this mode of illumination.

     April 29. A. paper was read from Mr. Seppings, containing
 some additional remarks to his former one, on an improved me
 thod of ship-building.    The author chiefly directed his attention
 to some points commented on by Dr. Young, and alleged the
 insufficiency of mere theory when confronted by practice : he
 dwelt particularly on the fact, that the French never built any
                                                                ships

    phtps with diagonal timbers, and afterwards abandoned the mode
    as useless.  The utmost, he maintained, that the French had
    done, was building one ship the lining of which was placed dia
    gonally; but this, as might be expected, was attended with none
    of the advantages which his method possessed, and on the con
    trary had several peculiar disadvantages.        Mr. S. also produced
    various certificates from different naval surveyors, and others, all
    of whom concurred in proving that the ships built according to
    the plan which he had' carried into execution were almost en
    tirely exempt from hogging or becoming broken-backed.
        May 4. Sir Humphry Davy, having happily returned from
    his scientific tour on the continent, communicated an interesting
    paper on the hyperoxymuriates,         and on what Gay Lussac. calls
    chloric acid.
        Dr. Phillip, in a short paper, stated his having found a foetus
    in the abdomen of a child. At the age of two years and a half
    a hard tumour was observed in a child's abdomen ; various means
    were taken to reduce or discuss      it,but in vain; all medicine was
    ineffectual;    and when the child died, its body was opened, and
    what had been supposed       a  tumour, proved to be  a  fuetus,    Dr. P.
    thinks this an instance of one foetus being inclosed within another
     in the womb.
         May .11.    Mr. Poret junior related series of very delicate and

    pomplex experiments, in addition to his former paper, which ap
    pears in the Phil. Transactions oh the salts called triple prussiates.
    Notwithstanding the apparent accuracy, however, of his expert
    ments, he found them not quite correspondent with the atomic
    theory, and therefore rejected the inferences to be drawn from
.   them, or the facts which they developed, preferring rather to be
    lieve in the infallibility of his calculations of atoms, than in the
    correctness of his actual experiments,           The Society then ad
    journed    over  one  week.
         May 2.5.  A   paper  by  Dr. Parry was read, on the nature and
     cause of the pulse.      Dr. P. took  a review of the different theo^
    ries which, have been proposed to account for the phenomenon
    of pulsation, observing that the greater part of physiologists had
    contented themselves with the opinion of Haller, that pulsation
    was occasioned     by   the diastole and systole of the heart.         His
    view,    however,  of  the question  is much    simpler   :on  examining
     different arteries where they were exposed to no obstruction or
    pressure, he found that they had no pulse        :   by pressing the fin
     ger on an artery over   a   soft part of the body, which yielded sufr
     ficiently to the pressure, no pulse was manifested; but when
     ever an artery was pressed over       a  solid part, then    a  pulse was
     immediately found.        He repeated these operations several times,
     and uniformly found the same effects.         Hence he concludes that
                                       A ia                                 the

    376                        Royal Institution.
    the pulse is nothing more than the re-action or impetus of the
    blood to maintain its regular motion. . The arteries appear only
    as canals through which the blood flows in a uniform and con
    tinuous current ; diminish the diameter of these canals, and a
 pulse is immediately perceived.     At every junction of a vein
 with an artery, the internal diameter of the latter is diminished,
and hence a pulse always appears.        This Dr. P. thinks fully
adequate to account for all'the modifications of the pulse.
    Part of a very elaborate paper was read, detailing numerous
experiments on malic acid, analysis of several vegetables which
 contain this acid, and on the crystallization of malat of lead.
 Gooseberries, and many other culinary vegetables contain con
siderable quantities of malic acid ; but on discovering that malat
of lead sometimes formed crystals, and at others continued in a
thick mucilaginous state, the author was induced to vary his
experiments to ascertain the cause of this apparent anomaly,
when he discovered that it was owing to the presence of another
acid.    This acid also existing in vegetables when combined
with the malic, the solutions of lead in it then assume a crystal
line character.    This fact is of great importance, as malat of
lead has been deemed to be one of our most delicate tests or re
agents.
                              ROYAL   INSTITUTION.
     Mr. Brande's ninth lecture embraced a general view of the
 doctrines of chemical affinity or attraction.     This subject, al
 though noticed and elucidated by Sir I. Newton, had been but
 sparingly investigated previously to the foundation of the French
 school of chemistry by Lavoisier and his associates: with thena
 it became an object of early attention, and new ideas were formed
 upon         it,
           which    now became needful to discuss.
                         it
    The Professor observed, that at the outset of his present course-
 of lectures, the distinctive objects and character of chemistry as
 a science had been explained, but that     would have been of lit
                                               it

                                                              ;
 about the present period of his history, the wavering and doubt
 ful opinions entertained upon this head began to subside into
steadiness and certainty, and the bickerings of unsupported        hy
pothesis to vanish before the steady light of theories deduced from
experiment and observation.
    We were now also called upon to consider the improvements
in the language of chemistry, and the grand nomenclatural re
form which       1787 was presented to the chemical world under
                    in
the sanction of the united names of Lavoisier, Morveau, Ber-
thollet, and Fourcroy.

                          Royal Institution.                       377
    Mr. Brande proceeded to illustrate the effects and laws of         *
chemical attraction, by an extended series of experiments : he
observed, that a total change in the properties of bodies was the
most obvious result of a chemical action ; that insipid, inodorous,
and insoluble substances acquired flavour, smell, and solubility;
and that the third substance resulting from the union of two
bodies, did not possess the intermediate qualities of its compo
nent parts, but exhibited new and unexpected properties ; that,
change of form or state was a frequent attendant on chemical
action ; that solids became fluids and gases ; fluids were solidified;
and aeriform bodies, quitting their elastic state, acquired a liquid
or solid form.    These phenomena were separately illustrated by
experiments.
   Mr. Brande concluded his lecture with an examination 'of the
laws of simple and double decomposition, and with a general
view of the theory of definite proportions, in which he demon
strated the tendency of bodies to unite only in certain relative
weights ; and that, when they combine in more than one pro
portion, the second, third, or fourth quantities are multiples or
divisions of the first.   Mr. Brande contrasted these views with
those advanced by Berthollet in his " Chemical Statics," and
proved the correctness of the former, and the imperfection and
futility of many of the latter.
   In some experiments with carburetted hydrogen, the Professor
took occasion to advert tfl the applications of this gas to cecono-
mical purposes, which, with few inconveniencies, held out many
advantages.     The question was too extended and important to
be then entered upon ; he therefore merely noticed the quantity
of gas afforded by a given quantity of coals, and the proportion
required to feed an Argand's lamp.     We understood that a chal
dron of Newcastle Wallsend coals afforded 10,000 cubical feet
of gas fit for burning ; of which, between three and four cubical
feet were consumed by each Argand's burner per hour.
   This lecture was interspersed with several applications of the
principles laid down, to the phenomena of art and nature-.
   It is obvious, said the Professor, that the effects of chemical
combination are referable to simple laws productive of invariable
results ; and hence we discern, in the minutest atoms and com
binations of matter, the same display of unerring harmony which
is exhibited upon a great and magnificent scale throughout the
system of the universe.
   Mr, Brande in his eleventh lecture dwelt upon the advances
which had been made in chemistry during the last century, and
observed, that new and powerful instruments of research had
been discovered.     He then proceeded to discuss the relation of
the mechanical forms to the chemical constitution of bodies ;

378                      Royal Institution.
and, having taken a general view of the phenomena of crystalli
zation, noticed at considerable length tha theories which hail
been invented to account for them.                                 -
    It will be impossible to give an intelligible outline of that part
of Mr. Brande 's lecture in which he exposed the theories of
crystallization : those of Rome" de Lisle, of Haiiy, and of Dr.
Wollaston, were separately considered, and illustrated by a series
of excellent models. The Professor supported that hypothesis
which regards the primitive forms of crystals, as made up of sim
ple arrangements of spherical particles ; and some new facts upon
the subject were adduced, which, if not perfectly demonstrative,
were highly favourable to these views.
    In his twelfth lecture Mr, Brande entered upon the subject
of eleQtricity, with an historical sketch of the rise and progress
of that branch of experimental science. Theophrastus, the ce
lebrated pupil and successor of Aristotle, is the first who alludes
to this singular power of matter.          Dr. Jelbert is the earliest
scientific writer on this subject, and in his treatise on magnetism,
published in 1600, many important facts concerning the excita
tion of electricity are detailed.    Having detailed these and other
discoveries in chronological order, the Professor proceeded to a
series of experiments illustrating the laws of electrical excitation,
 The phenomena of induced electricity, and the other modes          of,
 excitation, were also considered.
     Mr. Brande said that was only within the last fourteen years
                          it
 that the chemist had been required to enter minutely upon this
 subject of inquiry for, although
                    ;                it   might have been suspected
 that an agent so powerful and so universal as electricity was not
 unconnected with the chemical energies of matter, no such re
 lationship had been demonstrated until the commencement of
 tSie present century, an sera which would ever be referred to, as
 among the most glorious and important in experimental science.
     Mr. Brande described the different electrometers, or instru
 ments for ascertaining the presence and measuring the quantity
 of electrical excitation, and concluded with details respecting
 the discoveries of Dr. Franklin, especially as to the modes of
 preserving ships and buildings from the effects of lightning, and
 with some observations on his scientific character.
     Mr. Brande in his thirteenth lecture resumed the subject of
 electricity.    He dwelt upon the different modes of excitation
 shortly noticed in    his former discourse, and referred the pheno
 niena of the thunder-storm and water-spout, to induction taking
 place between the clouds and the earth and water. He illustrated
 the meaning of the terms quantity and intensity, as employed
 by   electricians
                ;    the former signifying the absolute quantity of
  electricity diffused over any surface;    the latter, its tendency to

fly off or pass through non-conducting media: thus the electri
city of the common electrical machine is possessed of great in
tensity, because it passes in long sparks through air ; but its
quantity is inconsiderable,    for the whole is at once withdrawn
from the conductor.                                                 ;
     Mr. Brande next proceeded to the discoveries of Galvani and
Volta: the former had ascertained that, on bringing zinc and
silver in contact with the nervous and muscular parts of recendy
killed animals, violent spasmodic affections ensued ; and he
formed an unsatisfactory hypothesis to account for the effect :
but the subject soon fell into the more able hands of Volta, and
became productive of infinitely important consequences, not
merely as influencing the theory of electrical action, but as ex
tending the boundaries of that department of science, and ulti
mately of chemical philosophy.
     Volta referred the effects upon the frog, to the excitation of
electricity by the contact of the metals, and devised the method
 of accumulating the electricity thus excited, by the alternate ar
 rangements of two different metals and moistened paper.         The
 Professor having pointed out the improvements which had suc
 cessively taken place in the Voltaic apparatus, stated that its ac
 tion appeared to depend upon the disturbance of the electrical
 equilibrium by the two metals, rendering one positive and the
 other negative ; and upon its increase by induction throughout
 the series.
      The electrical phenomena of the Voltaic pile were further il
 lustrated by the construction and effects of the electric column of
  Mr. de Luc, in which an active electrical arrangement is pro
 duced by alternations of dry paper, zinc, and silver.      The con
 sideration of the general powers and chemical effects of the Vol
 taic instrument Mr. Brande deferred to a future lecture, when he
 should employ the large apparatus, consisting of 2000 series,
 constructed in the Royal Institution under the direction of Sir
  H. Davy.
      The lecture concluded with some general observations upon
  the advances which had been made in the theory of electrical
  action ; a branch of science, in which, notwithstanding the ta
  lents and abilities displayed in its prosecution, there remained
  many recesses unexplored, and many fountains unexhausted.
      Having in his former lecture described the structure and ope
  ration of the Voltaic instrument, Mr. Brande proceeded in his
   14th lecture on Saturday, May 27th, to consider the methods
  of increasing the quantity and intensity of its electricity.     He

 the plates : at the same time, however, the common electrical
 powers were diminished ; for such a pile did not affect an elec
 trometer more powerfully than when the cells were filled with
.pure water, or when paper was interposed between the plates,
 as in the column of De Luc.
      The effect of increasing the number of alternations was' exhi
 bited by the large Voltaic apparatus constructed in the Royal
  Institution by Sir H. Davy.       It produced a most brilliant arc of
  flame when two points of charcoal, connected with its extremes,
 were brought near each other ; in vacuo the discharge was some
 inches in length, and exhibited a star and halo of blue light upon
 .the negative point, and a bright spot and brush of light upon the
 positive point : these effects were particularly distinct and beau
 tiful. The fusion and combustion of the metals, and the diffe
  rent conducting powers of fluids, were also shown by the help of
  this apparatus.
 .    The increase in the quantity of electricity by increasing the
 .size of the plates, was illustrated by a battery composed of twenty
 plates, each being two feet square.           The largest apparatus of
   this kind had been constructed by Mr. Children : it consisted of
   twenty plates, each six feet wide, and two feet eight inches deep.
   Its powers of igniting metallic wires were of the most surprising
   description ; but as an account of the experiments made by
 .means of it was about to be laid before the Royal Society, Mr.
   Brande did not minutely describe them.         A singular experiment
   was exhibited, in which a wire of silver and one of the same di-
 .ameter of platina, united end to end, were made part of the cir
   cuit ; the platina wire only became red hot : the effect was re
   ferred to the superior conducting power of silver to that of pla
   tina, the heating effect being greatest where most resistance is
   offered to the passage of electricity.
 .    The Professor exhibited some other forms of the Voltaic appa
   ratus, and concluded his Lecture with some observations on the
   relation of electricity to the phenomena of heat, and on its
   power of producing or passing into radiant matter, the more full
   discussion of which would be resumed in his next and concluding
   lecture.

    Wednesday, April 19.         Part of a paper  "On    the Inadequacy
of Galvanic Hypotheses," containing         a discussion of the question
" Whether      the active principle in Galvanic phenomena be elec
tricity," was read, by M. Donovan, Esq. Secretary..               . - , 't
    The first subject of investigation was the muscular contractions
produced in dead animals by the application of heterogeneous
metals, a phenomenon which has been attributed to the resto
ration of the electric equilibrium between the metals.          That the
restoration of the equilibrium, is the cause, was questioned on ac^
count of experiments which tended* to prove, that when means
were used for restoring the equilibrium, and when this end must
have been attained had there ever been a disturbance, contract
                                                                "
tions were excited by these metals as strongly as ever.           A num
ber of experiments were then adduced to prove that muscular

contractions are never produced unless chemical action be going
forward in some part of the apparatus ; and a number of facts
which seemed to oppose this view were shown, to be of no force,
 on account of circumstances not hitherto attended to.              These
 views were supported by numerous experiments on common, and
 what has been called Galvanic electricity, all of which appeared
to harmonize with each other.          It was even stated that common
 electricity does  not   affect dead animals, although passing through
 them in exceedingly large quantities, unless circumstances be
 present which render the operation of a chemical change proba
 ble : and this opinion was supported by trials upon various dead
 animals.     Considerations     were then stated, which were con
 ceived   to prove, that    the cause of the sensation called the Gal
 vanic shock cannot depend on electricity.           Voltaic series were

shown that the component metals were of the most eiiergetic
kind, that the menstruum was very powerful with otherl&tallic
combinations, and that the want of energy did not depeija'on a
balance of electro-motive power between the metals ano^men-
gtruum.      It was then shown that the plates of Volta, commonly
urged    as a  proof that the evolution of electricity in Galvanic ex
periments     does  not depend on chemical action, afford no evi
dence, and that they have even no Connexion with the question.
    A review was then taken of the different Voltaic arrangements
which have been discovered by philosophers, and it was shown
that not one of them contradicts the statement that chemical
action is the means by which Galvanic phenomena are pro
duced : for, in every arrangementt hat possessed activity, chemi
cal action of some kind was going forward.
    The paper throughout the whole was illustrated by numerous
experiments performed before the Society.

                          [Continued  from p. 313.]
    We have already, in our notice for last year, briefly analysed
 the memoir of M. Biot, on a new application of the theory of
 the oscillations of light, read to the Class at the latter end of
 1813.      The author there announces that he has extended to the
 substances of which the double refraction is the most energetic,
 such as arragonite and rhomboidal carbonated lime, the inquiries
 which he had only applied at first to substances the double re
 fraction of which is so weak that the images of the luminous
 points, seen through glasses of parallel surface three or four
 centimetres thick, are not sensibly separated.         He has fourid in
 this way, that in these crystals, as in all the others, the luminous
 molecules begin by oscillating around their centre of gravity to
  a certain depth, after which they acquire also a fixed polariza
 tion, which ranges their axes in two rectangular directions.
     In order to observe these phenomena in any given crystal,
 we must attenuate its polarizing power, until the luminous mo
 lecules which pass through it make in its interior eight oscilla
 tions less.    We attain this either by forming with the given cry
 stal lamine sufficiently thin, or by inclining them on an incident
  polarized ray, so as to diminish the angle which the refracted
  ray forms with the a£tis of double refraction ; or, finally, (and
                                                                  which

                        institute      of France.                3S3
which is most convenient,) by employing those two methods at
once.' -V,
    We sfiall also attain the same object, by transmitting in the
first .place this incident ray through a piece of sulphated lime of
a proper thickness, the axis of which forms an angle of 45", with
the primitite plan of polarization ; for, when a ray is thus pre
pared in order that it may be resolved into coloured fasciculi, it
is no longer necessary that the polarizing form of the second
plate should be very feeble* it is sufficient for it to combat and
 weaken sufficiently the first impressions which it has received,
 in order that the difference of the numbers of oscillations operated
in the two plates may be less than eight.
    We fmd, for example, that the polarizing power of Iceland
spar is expressed by 18'6, if we take that of sulphated lime as
unity; or that it requires a thickness of sulphate of lime of 18-6
to destroy the modifications impressed on the rays of light by
one in thickness of Iceland spar.      This relation will also be that
of Iceland spar, since rock crystal acts precisely like sulphated
lime. This report would only be 17 "7, according to other ex
periments of M. Malus.          The difference is insensible, and
 M. Biot does not answer for it : all the other substances which
he was enabled to subject to a similar proof, gave him the same
equality with the ratio of the polarizing forces : and this ended
by demonstrating to him, if demonstration was still necessary,
that the theory of the oscillations of light attenuates these phe-
nomena in their infancy, and brings them back to the considera
tion of the true forces by which they are produced.
      In the work which the same author has published on the po
 larization of light, M. Biot had been led to conclude, that the_
 luminous molecules, by passing through crystallized bodies, un
 dergo not only geometrical deviations in the position of their
 axes; but that they also acquire real physical properties, which
 they afterwards carry with them into space, and the permanent
 impressions of which are manifested in experiments by affections
 completely novel.     The proofs of this result would depend on a
 ve;y delicate discussion, and would require an immense number
 of experiments.     The author has endeavoured in his     "   Memoir
  on the physical properties acquired by luminous molecules in
 passing through the crystals endowed with double refraction,"
  read to the Institute in May 1814, to exhibit less operose me
  thods to establish a consequence so extraordinary; and the theory
  itself, which he deduced from        it,
                                        pointed out to him the most
  simple means of establishing    itdirectly.
       He begins by polarizing a white ray     by
                                               means of reflection on
  •a. Hiirror. He transmits  it  afterwards perpendicularly through
                                                              a natural

a natural plate of sulphated lime of a thickness which exceeds
T-tij of a millimetre, and of which the axis forms an angle of
45° with the primitive plan of polarization.        The two bundles,
ordinary and extraordinary,    which  result, both  issue in the same
direction: besides, according to the theory formerly established,
these two fasciculi come out white; and if the thickness is only
a few centimetres, they act as being polarized at right angles,
one in the direction of the primitive polarization, and the other
in a rectangular direction.
   He excludes this second, fasciculus by transmission through a
pile of pieces of glass arranged so as to reflect it in totality, with
out, acting in any way on the first fasciculus, which alone remains
 visible through the pile.
     Then, if we compare the latter with a ray polarized in the
 same direction by simple reflection on a glass, we see that they
 appear perfectly similar as to the geometrical arrangement of the
 particles, and in the direction of the polarization ; for they act
 absolutely in the same way, when we prove them by a prism of
 Iceland spar, or by reflection on an inclined glass.      In the first
 case they are also resolved into two white images, which disap
 pear and reappear at the same limits ; in the second they are
 reflected in the same way, and escape both together from re
 flection.    Also, if we make them pass through thin lamina? of
 sulphated lime, rock crystal for instance, they also give images
 Coloured with the same tints ; and both of them cease to give
 any when these lamine have attained certain limits df thickness.
 But to so close a resemblance a capital difference is added : it
is,  that beyond these limits, the thickness always increasing, the
ray polarized by simple reflection never gives colours        whereas
                                                                ;
 the fasciculus which has in the     first place passed through the
thickness       of sulphated lime begins to give them over again,
                 e
when the thickness of the second lamina of this subtance enters
into the limits      e+ TVo of a millimetre.          It
                                                     preserves, there
fore, in this respect the durable trace of the physical impressions
which    ithad at first undergone on passing through the first cry
stallized plate, and these impressions are relative to the thick
ness     of this plate whereas the ray polarized           by
                                                        simple reflec

                                          it                     plate

crystallized of an infinite thickness.     The difference of the two
rays    is also manifested in several other phenomena, indicated
by theory, and which       would have been difficult

    In his previous inquiries respecting crystals endowed with
double refraction, the author has shown that we, may obtain
fasciculi coloured, both ordinary and extraordinary, with thick as
                                                                        well

v/ell as with     thin plates on one and the same luminous ray.
When     these   plates are of the same nature, the opposition is al
ways effected by crossing at right angles their axes of double
refraction. But when they are of a different nature, in certain
cases the axes must be crossed, and in others they must be ren
dered parallel.       This last case takes place, for instance, when
we combine the needles of beryl with those of quartz.           When
the axes of these two substances are placed in the same way re
lative to a polarized ray, the impressions which they communi
cate to it are such, that if they are successive they destroy each
other, and on the contrary they are continued and added toge
ther if the axes are crossed at right angles : this is precisely the
inverse of what we observe when we combine two plates taken
from one and the same metal. Thus, in that kind of magnetiza
tion with which crystals act on the luminous particles which
pass through them, we must distinguish two modes of impres
sion different and opposite to each other, like the vitreous and
resinous electricities, or the two boreal and austral magnetisms.
We may call them the quartzous and beryllated polarizations.
The following is a list of some substances which belong to one
or other of these denominations.
    Quartzous polarization : Rock crystal, sulphated lime, sul-
phated barytes, topaz.         .
    Beryllated polarization : Rhomhoidal carbonated lime, arra-
gonite, phosphated lime, beryl, tourmaline.
   When we combine together two crystals the polarization of
which is of the same nature, we must cross their axes in order
to obtain the differences of their actions ; and, on the contrary,
we must render them parallel if their polarizations are different.
We see that the primitive form of a crystal has no evident rela
tion with the kind of polarization which it exercises, any more
than it has with the electrical properties of the minerals.
    By studying the action of tourmaline upon light, M. Biot re
cognised in it the singular property of having the double refrac
tion when it is thin, and the simple refraction when it is thick.
 In order to make these phenomena clear, he polished the in
clined faces of a large piece of tourmaline, so as to form with it
a prism, of which the section was parallel to the axis of the
needle, which is also that of the primitive rhomboid.           If we
look at the flame, of a taper through this prism, directing the
visual ray into the thinnest part, we see two images of a lustre
sensibly equal, one of which, ordinary, is polarized in the direc
tion of the axis of the tourmaline ; and the second, extraordi
nary, is so in a direction perpendicular to this axis. But in pro
portion as we carry the visual ray into the thickest part of the
prism, the ordinary image is weakened, and finally disappears

  that which arises from absorption.
      This property gives birth to several other phenomena, which
  it is  easy to foresee when we know them, and which experience
  also confirms.       They have a considerable analogy with those
  which Dr. Brewster discovered in agate.         On examining the lat
  ter, M. Biot was convinced that they do not take place, as in the
  tourmaline, but beyond certain limits of thickness ; for, by thin
  ning the agate sufficiently, all the properties are restored to it

  which belong to crystals endowed with double refraction.

      Mr. Editor, — Happening to have known that Mr. Loesc/i-
   rnan the musical-instrument maker has been long employed, un
   der the direction of Earl Stanhope, in constructing a new in
   strument, and having heard that it was at length completed, 1
   called yesterday at his house in Newman Street, and was highly
   gratified by examining and hearing the novel and powerful ef
   fects of the single steel strings of his Lordship's invention : by
   which every desirable degree of loudness, more indeed than many
   would like in a small room, combined with a mellow sweetness
   of tone, seems accomplished, and the effect of an improved
   swell thereon, is excellent. The lower of his Lordship's Strings,
   or Wires rather, seem near or quite a tenth of an inch in dia-
   tneter, and more resemble musical bars than strings, m their
   tone and effect.       The chief difficulties have, as 1 understand,
   lain in effecting a construction of the Instrument, to bear with
   out alteration of form, so vast a strain as these strings collectively
   require, and to preserve at the same time its resonant effect ;
   and in the construction of the hammers, for duly impelling these
   massive strings, without too audible a blow, and rendering the
   touch too heavy.
      With respect to its mode of tuning, it will I trust, to all com
   petent judges of the subject, be a recommendation, and credi
   table also to his Lordship as a philosopher, to mention, that

   Baron de Zach, in his publication on the Attraction of Moun
tains, a valuable astronomical work lately published at Avignon,
in two volumes 8vo, after speaking of a Trigonometrical Survey
of the neighbourhood of Marseilles, and its utility in forming
a topographical Map of the surrounding territory, proceeds thus

this city ; among others, those where Pytheas and Gassenui made
their famous observations of the solstice.    These inquiries led us
to a careful discussion of their celebrated observations, and to the
discovery of another made by Pytheas at Marseilles, 350 years
before our sera, and which have hitherto been unknown.            We
were only acquainted with one of his for determining the sol
stice, mentioned by Strabo, to whom we are indebted for its
preservation.    That which we have found, is the observation of
an equinox ; which, according as it is related by Hipparchus,
ought to have been made at Byzantium (the present Constantino
ple), but we have proved by calculation that this observation
 could only have been made at Marseilles; and we refer it to
 Pytheas, to whom it undoubtedly belongs.        These two observa
 tions, when properly computed, according to all the elements of
 modern astronomy, have given us the true obliquity of the eclip^
 tic at this remote period, and its diminution after a lapse of two
 thousand years.     The results agree with the theory in an ex
 traordinary   manner,"                                     T. S. E.
  On the isochronous Bate    of Going of two Clocks under certain
          Circumstances.    By J. A. De Luc, Esq. F.B.S.
                           To  Mr. Tilloch.
     Sir, — I have found in your number for last March, article
 xxxi. a paper under the title of " On the Rate of Going of two
 Clocks, with Remarks on Harris's Pendulum Clock, erected in
  J 814, by Mr. Thomas Reid."
     My present remarks shall be confined to the following passages.
 * The circumstance of two clocks keeping so closely together,
 and for a period of considerable length of time, appearing ex
 traordinary and unexpected to me, is the reason why I have
 transmitted the case to you ; and should you. deem it worthy an
 Insertion in your valuable journal, it is at your service.
     " Both the clocks were going in an imperfect state, and were
 intended for further    improvement ; but the assuming the ap
 pearance of keeping so near together, made me delay the taking
 them down to make any alteration, till I saw how long they
 would continue to do so, which thev did for such a length of
 time, and might have done so for how twig, I do not pretend
 to say, had it not at last become necessary for me to put an end
 to it.'"
     I have seen a similar. coincidence, the cause of which was at
 last discovered. There were two clocks in a clock-maker's shop,
 one of which was his time-keeper, and an excellent instrument ;
 the other, which was intended to be regulated by the former, did
 not agree when it stood at a distance : he then placed it close to

                         Strontian in Arragonite.                      389
the regulator, in order to observe them easier together ; and
when they were thus situated, they agreed perfectlv.            The clock-
maker, with whom I was acquainted, communicated to me this
singular circumstance, and invited me to come to his shop to
witness it.
     We first remarked that the oscillations of the pendula were
in opposite directions ; they both receded from each other, and
both returned.        Our first experiment was to give to their pen
dula the same motion : then one relented, was a moment with
out motion, and when it began to move, it was again in the
contrary way to the other, and continued so; their contrary
motions being isockronous.          We were long without making any
 surmise on the cause of this singular agreement, when at last we
took notice that both clocks stood on a floor, the boards of
which were elastic ; when therefore the pendulum, which was
very heavy, was moving on one side, its weight occasioned a
 ftexion of the board one way, which was restored when it moved
 on the other side, and this effect surmounted the power of the
 escapement.       Having suspected that cause, we placed on the
boards some heavy weights to render them immoveable, and the
 effect ceased on the clocks, each going at its proper rate.
      I presume that this might have been the case with Mr. Reid's
 two clocks.

                       STRONTIAN IN ARRAGONITE.
      M. Laugier the French mineralogist           has published the fol
 lowing interesting     notice   on   this  subject  in the Mtmoires du
  Museum     d' Hist.  Nat.  \T An.  or  lle  des Annates.
      " Since Professor Haiiy observed that carbonate of lime pro
  perly so called, and arragonite crystallize very differently; it has
  been suspected that these substances differ also in their compo
  sition, and many chemists have engaged in their comparative
  analysis.    The greatest number, however, concluded from their
  experiments, that these two substances exhibit no difference in
  chemical analysis, and that they contain exactly the same quan
  tities of lime, carbonic acid, and water.           Of all -the chemists
  who have operated on these minerals, Professor Stromayer has
  been the most successful.         In May 1813 he addressed a letter
  to M. Haiiy, describing the process by means of which he dis
  covered the existence of strontian in arragonite, and separated
  it from the carbonate of lime which constitutes about 97 per
                                       B b 3                           cent.

   cent., of arragonite.     He has subsequently published a volu
   minous Latin memoir, detailing all the experiments necessary
   to confirm this discovery.
       M. Stromayer's opinion being directly contradictory to those
   of a great number of respectable French and English chemists,
   M. Haiiy requested .me to examine the arragonite of Auvergne.
   I readily complied, being curious to examine a fact denied by
   one and affirmed by another.       After a few attempts, I informed
   M. Haiiy that I had indeed found a saline substance which
   could neither be nitrate of lime, as it was insoluble in alcohol,
   and did not become moist in the air, nor lime resulting from the
   decomposition of a portion of nitrate, if I might judge from its
   great sojubility in water, which besides did not become the least
   turbid in contact with air.       Having this substance only in the
   state of powder, in order to satisfy myself of its nature, I waited
   till by spontaneous crystallization it should present regular cry
   stals.   The first specimen of the crystals which I obtained,
   evinced the properties of nitrate of strontian; they are trans
   parent, solid, unchangeable in the air, of a sharp acrid taste, of
   a very regular octohedral form, and give a purple colour to the
   flame of a taper.    If these crystals were not nitrate of strontian,
   they might be nitrate of barytes ; but if barytes was the base,
   the uncertainty respecting the existence of strontian in arrago
  nite would soon vanish.        On the other hand, this uncertainty
  could never have existed, if Professor Stromayer's process had
  been strictly followed, since it has been known to the French
  chemists, who probably overlooked the strontian because they
  did not use the sasae means of detecting it.
       " The process of Stromayer is susceptible of abridgement ;
  this chemist left exposed to the air the nitrate of lime evaporated
  to the consistence of honey, until it became liquefied, and the
  crystals of nitrate of strontian were deposited ; but we may im
  mediately treat the evaporated mass with alcohol, which dissolves
  only the nitrate of lime without sensibly affecting the nitrate of
  strontian.    We may wash the insoluble crystalline powder in al
  cohol, then dissolve it in a small quantity of warm water, and
  leave it to crystallize.
       " This discovery of Stromayer is an additional testimony in
  favour of the superior accuracy and utility of crystallography to
  the sciences of mineralogy and geology, and also to chemistry
  itself.   Had not the father of crystallographic science so clearly
  and firmly maintained the diversity of primitive structure in ar
  ragonite and carbonates of lime, chemists would not again have
  thought of looking for any dissimilarity in their chemical con
  stitution, after the number of respectable analysts who have pro
                                                               nounced

and crystallography mutually illustrate each other ; whereas the
empirical methods of colours and external characters are as fluc
tuating and various as the number and character of observers.
            VOLCANO OF ALBAY IN THE INDf AN OCEAN.
   A dreadful eruption of this volcano took place on the       1st day
 of February 1814.
   This volcanic mountain is situated in the province of Cama-
rines, on the southern part of the Island of Lucon, or Luconia,
one of the Philippine isles in the Indian Ocean.
    Five populous towns were entirely destroyed by the eruption ;
more than twelve hundred of the inhabitants perished amidst the
ruins ; and the twenty thousand who survived the awful catastro
phe were stript of their possessions and reduced to beggary.
   The following account of this awful visitation was drawn up
by an eye-witness, and intended as an appeal to the charitable
feelings of the inhabitants of the Manilla Islands :
    More than 13 years had elapsed, during which the volcano of
Albay, by some called Mayon, had preserved a continued and
profound silence, without giving the least sign of its existence.
It was no longer viewed with that distrust and horror, with which
volcanoes usually inspire those who inhabit the vicinity.        In the
year   1800  its last eruptions  took  place,  in   which it emitted  a
great quantity     of stones, sand, and  ashes,   (as had always  been
usual,) and occasioned considerable damage to the same villages
that it has now completely destroyed ; rendering useless a great
number of fertile fields, which thenceforth were converted into
arid and frightful sands.       In the latter part of October of that
vear the last eruption happened, and caused more damage to
those villages.
   Since that time we had not remarked any circumstance in
dicative of the existence of the volcano, and therefore all the
apprehension that it had formerly inspired was gradually dis
sipating.    Consequently, its extensive and spacious brow had
been converted into a highly cultivated and beautiful garden.
In particular, the inhabitants of Camalig and Budiao had planted
upon it many cocoa-trees, and every kind of fruit-trees, with a
variety of roots and vegetables ; which, while they afforded an
agreeable perspective, supplied, by their excellent productions,
many industrious families with food.
   In this state was the volcano on the first day of February last.
No person reflected in the slightest degree upon the damages
and losses that so bad a neighbour had been in the habit of
occasioning.      We had become persuaded, in consequence of so
                                B b 4                              long

long a silence, that it was now completely extinguished, and that
all those subterraneous conduits were closed, through which it
attracted to itself and kindled the combustible materials> which
it had formerly so continually thrown out. Nor had we seen
or remarked any signs which might indicate to us be:i rehand
what was about to take place.           In the former eruptions, there
 were heard, a considerable time previous, certain subterraneous
 sounds, that were sure presages of them.               It also exhaled al
 most continually a      thick, smoke, by    which   it  announced them.
 But lipon the present occasion we remarked nothing of all this.
 It is true, that on the last day of January we perceived some
 slight shocks ; but we scarcely noticed them, on account of their
 having been very frequent since the earthquake that we expe
 rienced on the 5th of October of the year 1811.                On Monday
 night    the  shocks  increased.    At  two  in the  morning    we felt one
 more violent than those we had hitherto experienced.                 It was
 repeated at four, and from that hour they were almost continual
 until the eruption commenced.
      Tuesday dawned, and I scarcely ever remarked at Cama-
 rines a more serene and pleasant morning, or a clearer sky.                I
 observed, however, that the ridges nearest to the volcano were
•covered     with a mist, that I supposed to be the smoke of some
 house thereabouts that had been on fire in the night.             At eight
 o'clock on that fatal morning the volcano began suddenly to
 emit a thick column of stones, sand, and ashes, which with the
 greatest velocity was elevated in a moment to the highest part
  of the atmosphere.        At this sight we were astonished, and filled
 with the utmost dread, and especially when we observed that
  in an instant the brow of the volcano was covered by it. We
  had never seen a similar eruption, and were immediately con
  vinced that a river of fire was coming towards us, and was about
  to consume us.       The first thing that was done in my village was
  to secure the holy sacrament from profanation, and betake our
  selves to a precipitate flight.        The swiftness with which that
  dreadful tide rolled towards us, did not give us rhueh time either
  for reflection or conversation.      The frightful lioise that the vol
   cano made caused great terror, even in the stoutest hearts. We
  all ran terrified, and filled with the greatest dismay and conster
   nation, endeavouring to reach the highest and most distant places,
   In order to preserve ourselves from so imminent a danger.             The
i horizon     began to darken; and our anxieties redoubled.              The
   noise of the volcano continually increases ; the darkness aug
   ments ; and we continue our flight for the preservation of our
   lives, removing further and further from an object so terrific.
   But notwithstanding       the swiftness with which we run, we are
   overtaken in our disastrous flight by a heavy shower of huge
                                                                      stones,

                  Voltano    of Albay in      the Indian Ocean.            393
stones, by the violence of which many unfortunate persons are
in a moment deprived of life. This unforeseen and cruel cir
cumstance obliges us to make a pause in our career, and to shel
ter ourselves under the houses ; but flames and burnt stones fall
from above, which in a short time reduce them to ashes.
     Who is capable of making an exact relation of scenes so sad
 and melancholy, and of presenting them to the public in the same
 manner that they occurred ? Which of us thought to escape with
 life, upon beholding such manifest signals of Divine justice ? As
 for myself, I remembered in those dreadful moments the dis
 astrous fate of the cities of Pentapolis, and I was then persuaded
that the unfortunate villages of Gamarines were about to surfer
 the same nnhappv catastrophe.                Terrible reflections, it is true,
 but founded upon the immorality of manners which had long
 been remarked in those villages !
      In this dreadful situation, we called upon God, in such man
 ner as we could, from the bottom of our afflicted and almost
 broken hearts, beseeching him for pardon and mercy.                     It be
  came completely dark, and we remained enveloped and im
  mersed in the most thick and palpable darkness, comparable only
  to that which in the time of Moses was witnessed in Egypt.
  From this moment reflection is at an end, advice is no longer
  given,, and no person recognises another.               The father abandons
  his children, the husband his wife, she remembers not her be
  loved spouse, and the children forget their parents.                 No one
  thinks    that   he   can   assist  his  fellows, because all believe that
  they are about to die.
      But as man, even in the most critical and destitute situations>
  endeavours by all possible methods to preserve life, each one of
  us, for this interesting object,, makes use of all the means and
  expedients that can be resorted to, in the terrible condition to
  which' we are reduced.            Of what various and different methods
  did not we, who have escaped with life, avail ourselves, that we
  might not perish at that time ?              In the houses we now found no
   shelter.     It was necessary to abandor them with all haste, in
   order not to perish with thern.              To go out uncovered, was to
   expose    one's   self  to   a  danger    not  less imminent ; because the
  stones that     fell  were  of   an  enormous      size, and fell as thick as
   rain itself.    It is necessary, that we may not die in the one or the
   other manner, to cover ourselves and defend ourselves as well as
   we can.      We do so. — Some cover themselves with hides, others
   with tables and chairs, others with boards and tea-trays.              Many
   lake refuge in the trunks of trees, others among the canes and
   hedges, and some hide themselves in a cave, which the brow of
   a mountain offered them.              Those only of us survive, who had
    the good fortune to protect ourselves by one or other of those
                                                                      methods ;

   394          Volcano  of Albay in   the Indian Ocean.
  methods ; but those who were in the open air, with nothing at
  hand with which they could cover themselves, almost all perished
  or were wounded.
      The horrid and frightful noise of the volcano increases to its
  utmost; the shower of stones and thick sand augments; the
 "burning stones and meteors continue to fall, and in a very short
  time reduce to ashes the most beautiful villages of the province of
  Camarines.     Would you have signs more analogous to those
  that are to take place at the last judgement?   The animals of the
  mountain descend precipitately to the villages, to seek in them a
  secure asylum.    The domestic animals run terrified with the
  greatest disorder and affright, uttering cries that indicate their
  approaching end.     Nothing interested us in those dreadful mo
 ments but the preservation of our own lives.      But, alas! Divine
 justice has already marked and pointed out, with the finger of
  Omnipotence,    a great number of victims, who are to perish in
  this day of wrath and fury, in every respect very similar to what
  we read in the holy Scriptures concerning the day of the last
 judgement.
     At about ten in the forenoon it ceased to rain heavy stones,
  and each one endeavoured to remain in the situation he then
 was, waiting until the rain of thick sand which succeeded it
 should also cease, or until some new and unforeseen calamity
 should terminate the existence of us all.
     We thus continued until half past one in the afternoon, at
 which hour the noise of the volcano began to diminish, and the
 horizon to clear a little, at sight of which there was revived in
 us the hope of life, which until then had been almost wholly ex
 tinguished.    At about two in the afternoon it became entirely
 clear,  and  we began to perceive distinctly the lamentable and
 dreadful ravages that the darkness had hitherto concealed from
 us.    We saw with terror the ground covered with dead bodies,
 part of- whom had been killed by the stdiies, and the others con
 sumed by the fire. Two hundred of those perished in the church
 of Budiao; thirty-five in. a single house in that village. The
joy tha^idl felt at having preserved life through such imminent
 dangers, was in many instantly converted into the extremity of
sorrow at finding themselves deprived of their relations, friends,
 and acquaintances.      There, a father finds his children dead ;
 here, a husband his wife, and a wife her husband ; particularly
in the village of Budiao, where there are very few who have not
lost some of their nearest connexions.         In another place, at
every step one meets innumerable other unhappy wretches ex
tended upon the ground, who, though not deprived of life, are
wounded or bruised in a thousand ways. Some with their legs
broken, some without arms, some with their sculls fractured, and
                                                              others

             Volcano   of Albay in   the Indian Ocean.          395
others with their whole bodies full of wounds.         Such were the
mournful objects that presented themselves to us during the re
mainder of that afternoon, many of whom died immediately, and
others on the following days ; the rest remaining abandoned to
the most melancholy fate, without physicians, without medicines^
aud in want even of necessary food.
   A horrible and mournful day it was, the remembrance of
which will ever be indelibly engraven upon our hearts. Not one
of us then thought to escape with life. Death presented him
self to us in various and frightful shapes, threatening to deprive      '-
us of life by different and horrible methods.       But the powerful
hand of our beneficent and sovereign God restrains him. At his
commanding voice, pale Death is appalled.       He trembles, groans,
and leaves us.      He flees, terror-stricken, to the caverns of the
earth, and there begins to mourn and lament the spoils which
he was about to make, and of which he has been deprived.          He
thought    on  that  day  to  have  imbrued   more    than  usual his
scythe with blood ; but he was obliged to humble himself before
Him who governs the empires, and at whose voice the infernal
regions shake with fear.
    Fhe sad result of the misfortunes of that day has been the
total ruin of five villages in the province of Camarines, and the
principal part of Albay; the death of more than twelve hundred
unfortunate persons, and many others severely wounded ; the
loss of every thing that the survivors possessed in the world,
being left without houses, without clothing, without animals,
without the prospect of a harvest, and without a morsel fit to
eat ; the mournful and unhappy fate of many, who have been
left orphans, abandoned to Divine Providence ; others widows,
with the loss of four, five, and even more children ; the total de
struction of their churches and parochial houses, with every thing
that they contained : in consequence of which the sacrament6
could not be administered to such as died of their wounds the
succeeding days, and who were buried without any pomp or ce
remony; and the many infants who have since been born, have
from necessity been baptized with common water, because the
circumstances in which we were placed did not permit it to be
otherwise.
   The present appearance of the volcano is most melancholy
and terrific.    Its side, which was formerly so cultivated, and
which afforded a prospect the most picturesque, is now nothing
but an arid and barren sand. The stones, sand, and ashes, which
cover  it, are so astonishing in  quantity, that in some places they
exceed the thickness of ten and twelve yards    ;    and in the very
spot where lately stood the village of Budiao, there are places in
which the cocoa-trees are almost covered.          In the ruined vil

          A new    Chemical Substance. — Death           of Mr. Nicholson.
lages, and almost through the whole extent of the eruption, the
ground remains covered with sand to the depth of half a yard,
 and scarcely a single tree is left alive. The crater of the volcano
has lowered, as I judge, more than .20 fathoms; and on the south
side discovers a spacious and horrid mouth, which it is frightful
to look at. Three new ones are opened at a considerable di
stance from the principal crater, through which also smoke and
ashes were incessantly emitted.              In short, the most beautiful vil
lages    of Camarines      and   the   principal part of that province are
 converted into a barren sand.
            DISCOVERY       OF A NEW         CHEMICAL     SUBSTANCE.
     Since our last, we have received a most valuable communica
 tion on various scierftific subjects from M. Van Mons of Brussels.
 We have only room for insertion this month of the following ac
 count of a new chemical substance.                  " My friend Brugnatelli
 writes to me :      ' If we throw some indigo on burning coals, or on
 a heated plate of iron, there arises into the air a superb violet-
 coloured vapour, which I thought at first was iodine, but which
 an ulterior examination convinced me was a peculiar body. This
 vapour is condensed upon cooling into very brilliant violet-co
 loured crystals, which are square prisms.                On bringing this va
 pour    at  the moment      of  its  formation    into contact  with mercury,
 a soft and even concrete amalgam is the result : the metal must
 be heated, and the vapour ascending.'                  M. Brugnatelli consi
 ders this    violet   crystalline matter,      the  vapour of which is so su
 perb, as the colouring principle, which, with fecula, forms in
  digo; and he calls it indigo-gene: he is led to believe that it is
  a kind of vegetable metal.             When indigo has lost this principle,
  it no longer assumes after friction thaC dazzling lustre which di
  stinguishes it.       M. Brugnatelli remarks very judiciously, that if
  the system is persisted in of naming bodies according to their
  colour, this substance must still be called iode."
                    DEATH OF MR WILLIAM NICHOLSON.                 .
     With sincere regret we announce the death of Mr. William
  Nicholson, many years conductor of the Philosophical Journal.
  He died after a lingering and painful illness at his house in
  Charlotte Street, Bloomsbury, on the 21st of May.                      The loss
  of  this  gentleman     will  be   felt not  only by  his family   and  friendsi
  but by the scientific world at large.             He was the author of many
  standard works in various branches of science and experimental
   philosophy; and from his known talents, and profound acquaint
   ance with every thing connected with these subjects, he was
  usually consulted as to the practicability and general detail of all
   new scientific or philosophical works, with infinite advantage to
                                                                              their

manners     gentle ; and as his judgement     was uniformly calm and
dispassionate,    the soundness of his opinions, in the numerous
matters which were daily brought before him as a scientific um
pire, was never questioned.

     * The Thermometer
                           to-day and yesterday at midday was about 65".
    f  During the latter part of the day, that appearance was discoverable in
 the clouds which gives them the appearance of being charged with the
 electric fluid. The term Futgoric, suggested by one of* your Correspondents,
 seeras a very proper name for the fluid.
     \ People, in cleaning ditches which lie parallel and near to hedgerows of
 trees, are very apt to cut some of their roots ; a circumstance which seems
  to cause them to give way to high wind, and to determine the direction in
  which they fall. The elm in question fell at right angles to the wind.

XXX.      Historical Memoranda respecting Experiments intended
  . to ascertain the calorific Powers of the different prismatic
  .
    Rays.     By T. S. Evans, LL.D.F.L.S.
                           To Mr.      Tilloch.   .
Sir, — Discoveries       in science have been generally made by im
perceptible steps ; and improvements in the arts have succeeded
each other by such small gradations, that in many cases the shade
of differgnce has scarcely been apparent.         Inventions have often
been brought before the public with so little alteration            from
others which they possessed before. that the claim of novelty
could scarcely be allowed them ; and advances in the state of our
intellectual knowledge have sometimes been made by such simple
and evident means, that it has been rather a subject of astonish
ment they were not known long before.                 Instances are not
uncommon in the history          of   science, of   two   persons at the
same time making the same discovery or improvement,                 at a
distance from each other, and without ever having had the least
communication : but many more are to be met with, where one
person has succeeded another in the same invention, and both
have been equally entitled to the palm of merit.
    These reflections have arisen from considering our present
knowledge of the properties of light, particularly that of the dif
ferent degrees of heat communicated to the thermometer by the
coloured rays arising from their decomposition by means of the
prism ; but they would probably have arisen from considering
the history and progress of any other department of science or
art, as they have all proceeded nearly in a similar way.
    That light could be reflected and refracted, was well known
to the ancients, as appears from the few remains that are left
of their writings. Contrary to the opinion that has lately been
generally entertained, the celebrated work of Ptolemy upon Optics
is still in existence.  A copy of it is yet in the Imperial library
 at  Paris ; and  some extracts     from it have been lately given by
 the Chevalier Delambre,     in   the   Connoissance des Temps for the
 year 1814, by which, and the treatise of Euclid on Optics, it
 appears that these two properties were well understood in their
 times by the Greeks and Egyptians.
     Long before it was certainly known that light proceeded by a
 progressive motion, Dr. Hook had asserted that this motion
 could not by any means be instantaneous ; yet it may fairly be
 presumed that, up to the time of this discovery, mankind had no
 idea of any thing in nature moved with such an incredible
 velocity ; and accordingly we find Galileo and the members of
 the Academia del Cimento endeavouring to discover what dif-
     Vol. 45. No. 206. June 1815.                C c              ference

     402     Memoranda respecting Experiments         to ascertain
     ference existed between the time of the sun's appearing to rise
     to a spectator situated in any given place, and to another stand
     ing two miles further off to the westward.      Our present ac
     quaintance with the astonishing rate at which it moves makes
     us almost smile at the attempt to discover it by such inefficient
     means ; but without experiments, nothing can be known with
       certainty.
           We are indebted for our knowledge of this important fact to
       the invention of telescopes.    Mr. Olaus Romer found it from ob
       servations of the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites made at different
      distances of that planet from the earth ; and we are now informed
      that light travels from the sun to us, a distance of 95 millions of
      miles, in about 8' 13" of time.
          Mr. Boyle, who was indefatigable in his attention to every sub
      ject of importance connected with chemistry and natural philo
      sophy, has informed us of a great number of curious experiments
      which he made on light and colours ; and even at present, al
      though our acquaintance with the subject has proceeded so
      much further, his work is extremely interesting.
          It
           is,   however, to the great Sir Isaac Newton that we are in
      debted for the most valuable knowledge which we possess of
      the different properties of light and colours.     By making pencil
                                                                  a
      of rays pass near the edge of any sharp body, as that of a knife
      or broken glass, he proved that they were bent or inflected and ;
     by   making the rays pass through glass prisms, and receiving the
     spectrum at       distance, he found light to be        heterogeneous
'                         a                             a
     mixture of differently refrangible rays and that there are as
                                               ;
     many simple or homogeneal colours, as there are degrees of re-
     frangibility for to every different degree of refrangibility belongs
                      ;
    a    different degree of colour.
          The ideas of philosophers respecting the nature of colours be
     fore the time of Newton are extremely hypothetical, and unsup
     ported      bythe least attempt at experimental proof.       It   may
     therefore easily be conceived what pleasure was given to the
    lovers of truth, by so extensive a pursuit of the subject as was
    published in his treatise of Optics.     After he had thus developed
    the true theory of light and colours, he then proceeded to ex
    plain all their properties and pha;nomena, in so satisfactory a
    manner that his investigation has justly been considered as the
    best model for guiding all future inquiries into the laws of Nature.
         With regard to the absorption of warmth from coloured rays, —
    the object of our present consideration, — Mr. Boyle caused large
                                                                  a
    block of black marble to be ground into the form of a spherical
    concave speculum         and found that the sun's rays reflected from
                              ;
    it   were far from being too powerful for his eyes, as would have
    been the case had         been of any other colour;
                              it                            and although
                                                                        its

         the    calorific Powers   of the   different prismatic Rays.   403
its size  was considerable, yet he could not set a piece of wood
on fire with it; whereas a far less speculum, of the same form,
made out of a more reflecting substance, would presently have
made it flame.       He took also a large broad tile, and having
made one half of its surface white, and the other black, he ex
posed it to the summer sun for some time, when he found that
while the whited part remained cool, the part that had been
blacked had grown very hot.             For his further satisfaction he
left part of the tile of its native red ; and, after exposing it to
the sun, observed that this part grew hotter than the white, but
was not so hot as the black part.
     Mr. Melville supposed that, since there is no reflection of light
 but at the surface of a medium, the greatest quantity of rays,
though crowded irito the smallest space, would not of themselves
 produce any heat.       If this be true, it follows that the portion
 of air which lies in the focus of the most powerful speculum is
 not at' all affected by the passage of light through it, but con
 tinues of the same temperature with the surrounding air : whereas,
 if an opaque body denser than air be put into this place, it would
 be intensely heated in an instant.          Hence he observes, the at
 mosphere is not much warmed by the passage of the sun's light
 through        it,
                but rather      byits contact with the surface of the
 earth.    This he thought furnished          simple and plausible reason
                                                 a
 why it    iscoldest, in all climates, on the tops ofhigh mountains;
 they being furthest removed from the general surface of the
 earth.    On this principle we may also account for the difficulty
 which the Abbe Nollet met with             endeavouring to fire spirit of
                                             in
 wine, oil of turpentine, olive oil, and ether       as these fluids trans
                                                     ;
 mit the rays, instead of reflecting or absorbing them in sufficienta
 degree to produce the heat necessary for their combustion.
    It  was remarked        Scheele, that the thermometer when filled
                           by
 with alcohol of a deep red colour, rose more rapidly when ex
 posed to the sun's rays than another filled with the same kind
 of spirit uncoloured; but that the fluid rose equally         in
                                                                both when
 dipped together     in the  same   vessel of  warm  water.
     Dr. Franklin found that the hand when applied alternately to
 the black part of any one's dress, and then to white part, whilst
                                                          a
  walking in the sun, would feel      agreat difference in their warmth.
  He observed also that black paper exposed to the concentrated
  rays of the sun from a lens, would take fire much sooner than
  white paper      and that
                      ;         a fluid of any kind becomes warm in
  less time, when placed before the fire irt a black vessel, than in
a    white one, or in     abright silver tankard.      But the most cu
  rious experiment he made was,            exposing pieces of broad-cloth
                                            by
  of various colours to the sun,        by
                                         laying them upon snow.         Ina
  few  hours  the black, being   warmed     most     by
                                                     the  sun, was  sunk so
                                       C    c
                                            2                           low

404      Memoranda respecting Experiments             to ascertain
low  as to be below tbe sun's rays; the dark blue almost as low;
the lighter blue not quite so low as the dark ; the other colours
less, as they were lighter ; and the white remained on the sur
face of the snow, not having sunk at all*.
   It is easy to conceive that the next step in their progress to
ascertain the various properties of light and heat, would be to
examine whether rays of different refrangibility give a different
degree of heat to those bodies with which they come in contact ;
and the best and most rational mode of making this evident to
the senses, would be by causing the coloured rays themselves to
fall immediately on the bulbs of thermometers placed to in
tercept the rays.     This was first attempted, I believe, by the
Abbe Rochon, in the years 1775 and 1776.
   The experiments of this gentleman appear to have been passed
over with little or no notice, although they form an important link
in the progress of this department of science.      The air thermo
meters .which he contrived for showing the effect of the heat on
them were extremely ingenious ; yet, it must be owned his re
sults differ materially from those of later philosophers : still, how
ever, I think it will be admitted that he is certainly entitled to
the honour of having proved, beyond a doubt, that a different
degree of heat is given to the thermometer by the differently
coloured rays of light after they have been decomposed by means
of the prism.     As he appears to have conducted these experi
ments with the utmost care, and certainly could have had no
reason to falsify his observations, it is not impqssible but that in
endeavouring to discover the cause, and to reconcile the ap
parent disagreement between his results and those of others who
have followed him, some useful fact may arise, which at present
remains unknown.
   The reason why these experiments of his have not been more
noticed, may perhaps arise from the circumstance of the work
not being very commonly to be met with in this country; and as
the memoir is but a short one, and may probably be deemed in
teresting by some of your readers, I have translated            it,
                                                            and take
the liberty of sending    ityou for your  valuable Magazine, should

  It  forms an important link between the brief sketch            haveI
drawn of optical discoveries, and the highly important and later
ones of Dr. Herschel, Sir Henry Englefield, Dr. Wollaston, Sir
 *    The greater part of your readers must be acquainted with the very   in
genious experiments of Professor Leslie, proving the converse of these re
sults, that dark-coloured bodies give out. their heat much quicker than light-
coloured or polished bodies —  a fact of great practical utility, but not ne
cessary to be further dwelt upon   in   this place.

408       Memoranda respecting Experiments to ascertain
    As the thermometer used in making these experiments was
of quite a different kind from any of those in common use, it
does not appear possible, at present, to make the least compari
son of them together.     Had the author been aware of the ne
cessity of doing this, it might perhaps have been effected by ob
serving what degree of warmth communicated very slowly would
produce a certain alteration in each ; as the standard of com
parison being th-us once made, would serve at any future period
for reducing the terms of the one to those of the other.
    The difference in the results of these experiments and those
of Dr. Herschel, it must be acknowledged, is very great; and
perhaps may require some further acquaintance with the laws
of Nature, before they can he reconciled.       According to the very
interesting experiments of the latter gentleman, the greatest heat
 was found to be beyond the coloured spectrum, and on the red
side.     In these experiments the greatest degree of heat was
 obtained from the yellow orange rays ; and next to that from
 the red: then from the orange; next to that from the green:
 and least of all from the violet.    The prism which he used was
 different from that used by Dr. Herschel and others, as it had
 its refringent angle 45 3 instead of 603.        At first sight this
 tloes not appear to be a sufficient cause for so wide a difference
 in the results; and yet, if both are correct, there must be some
 rational mode of accounting for their discrepancy, depending upon
 scientific and satisfactory principles.    In these experiments the
 Abbe caused the rays to pass through a lens; and if we refer to
 the figure of his apparatus, which held the air thermometer, we
 shall immediately perceive that the rays had then to pass through
 the glass of which the bent tube was made ; and probably through
 the outer cylindrical glass receiver, that held the fluid for the pur
 pose of keeping it of an uniform temperature.        These tubes be
 ing nearly of a cylindrical shape, the rays, by not always im
 pinging upon them in precisely the same, or in a proper man
 ner, might be refracted in a different angle from that in which
 they quitted the prism, and thereby have their nature changed,
 and consequently the degree of warmth might on that account
 be found different from what it has since been determined.
     Many objections may certainly be made against the mode in
 which he has conducted these experiments; and indeed they are
 very candidly stated by himself m his account of them; for he
 says, that although he took all possible precautions, that de
 pended on himself, to ensure their success, yet he was still very
 far from being satisfied with his labour.      All that can therefore
 be done, until the difficulty of reconciling them with others has
 been removed, is to state the Abbe's just claim to the discovery,
 that a different degree of heat is produced by the absorption of

        the calorific Poivers of the different prismatic Rays.      409
the differently coloured rays of light after having been decom
posed by means of the prism . To this claim he certainly appears
entitled, notwithstanding      the great want of agreement which at
present apparently exists between his results and those of others.
    We have many instances on record, of things that appeared at
first sight to be of a very discordant nature, proving after further
investigation to be perfectly reconcileable with themselves and
with truth ; an instance of which may be taken from a subject
stated further back, of the discovery of the progressive motion of
light by Romer. The several discussions that took place re
specting it from the year 1675 to 1707, by Messrs. Cassini,
Maraldi, and the discoverer, show how difficult it is to bring the
scattered fragments of a noble edifice to agree, and build them
up again upon a firm and immoveable foundation.               When all
the parts are     found   and made out that belong to     the  theory of
light, heat, and colours, then perhaps, and not till then, these of
the Abb6 Rochon may find their place among the rest in the
general arrangement of the whole.
     The ratio of the warmth of clear red to the most lively violet,
 of S to 1, which he deduces from his experiments, does not ap
 pear to be admissible, unless the point 0 of the scale of his
 thermometer showed the commencement of all accession of ca
 loric in the fluid of which it was composed.        Thus the ratio of
 5'117 to 40-121 may be expressed in round numbers by that of
 1 to 8; but if the point of congelation, or whatever other point
 may be deemed that where the first accession of heat begins, be
 t degrees below the zero of the thermometer, then the ratio of
 8 + 5-117    to 8 + 40-121, is no longer that of 1 to 8, but ap
 proaches so much the nearer to a ratio of equality as 8 increases.
 Let u and /3 be the two original heights ; then the excess of the
 latter ratio above the former will be J~      ~. when zero is reckon-
 ed   8 degrees below.
     The heliostata, which he regrets the want of,     is an instrument
 contrived by Gravesande, and very fully, described by him in his
  Mathematical Elements of Natural Philosophy, vol. ii. page 1U7,
 edit. of 1747.      The intention of it is to avoid the double incon
 venience arising from the obliquity of the rays, and the sun's
 diurnal motion.       On account of the obliquity of the rays, some
 experiments can only be made at certain hours ; and others can
 not be made at all in particular places, although exposed to the
 sun a considerable portion of the day.       This machine consists of
 two principal parts, a plane metallic speculum, and a clock, by
 which it is kept directed always towards the sun. A metallic
 speculum is used to avoid the double reflection from a glass one.
  The plane of the clock is inclined to the horizon in an angle

 410    An Essay     on the Degree   of Warmth of coloured Rays.
 equal to the complement of the latitude of the place ; and the
 arm that moves the speculum acting in the direction of thi>
 plane, will evidently cause it to follow the sun in its diurnal mo
 tion, whatever may be its declination.        As the experiments con
 cerning light and colours must be made in the dark, the whole
 machine, when made use of for this purpose, must be shut up in
 a case or box ; and we may have the rays thrown by means of
 it in any required direction during the whole of the time he i-
 above the horizon, if the situation be open ; or, if otherwise, a*
 long as the rays are not intercepted by surrounding objects.
    Another instrument of this sort is described by Mr. Benjamin
 Martin, in page 469 of vol. ii. of his Mathematical Institutions,
 which he considers as an improvement of one described by
 M. Klingenstiern in the Petersburg Commentaries for 1747 and
  1748 : it may also be found in his Philosophic. Britannica, p. 89,
 vol. iii. edit, of 1771: but the expense of such a machine it is
 feared will prevent its being commonly applied, although it would
 be extremely useful for moving telescopes round upon a polar
 axis, in making observations of the heavenly bodies, and pur
 suing them, in an uniform manner, notwithstanding the earth's
 diurnal motion.
    The late ingenious Mr. Ramsden, whose care in the construc
 tion, and accuracy in the execution of astronomical instruments,
 could only be equalled by his genius and originality in inventing
 them, had once an idea of adapting an instrument of this sort to
 a clock that kept time very exactly, with a view to avoid the
 necessity of using time in particular cases of astronomical ad
 measurements.

 LXXI. An        Essay on the Degree of Warmth of coloured Rays.
    By M.       V AblS Rochon, late Member of the Academy of
    Sciences   of Paris, &c. &c*
In    this memoir we confine ourselves to examine, whether the
rays of light of different refrangibility produce degrees of heat
that differ in their degree of sensibility on the thermometer.
    This research requires without doubt that the colours should
be distinct and well separated ; but this analysis of them cap-
not be made without diminishing prodigiously the intensity of
 the light ; which, when thus decomposed, no longer gives any
sensible sign of warmth in our common thermometers.
    It is therefore necessary to resolve or to collect on the ball of

a thermometer a sufficient quantity of these rays, to produce ef
fects that are evident ; or else to use thermometers of a sensi
bility proportionate to the loss of intensity which is inseparable
from the light thus decomposed.         *We can always collect into a
small space a quantity of rays of a colour that will be sensibly
homogeneous, either by disposing in a proper manner several
prisms of different angles which shall make each species of ray*
to coincide on the ball of a thermometer ; or by using the burn
ing mirror of M. de Buffon, known by the name of the Mirror
of Archimedes, whose burning line is very nearly the same for
a considerable length.
    This instrument is an assemblage of small plane mirrors, which
by their respective positions will cause as large a quantity of
light as may be desired to fall on a prism placed in their com
mon focus.       Now the united rays which form this focus, or
 rather this burning line, approach so much the nearer to the
parallelism necessary for the success of the experiment in ques
 tion, as the distance of the prism from the mirrors is more con
siderable.
    We know that this method requires a large room ; but the
 one in which the experiments I am going to relate were made,
 not being of a proper size, I thought that very sensible thermo
 meters would sufficiently fulfil the object which I proposed.
    Those which I have used were air-thermometers.           It is well
 known that they owe their effect to a bubble of air introduced
 into the ball which contains the fluid.       The slightest degree of
 warmth dilates      this  bubble,  and causes  the spirit of wine to
 mount in the capillary tube of the thermometer : but this ascent
 would scarcely be sensible if the top of the tube were hermetically
 sealed ; it is therefore necessary to leave it open, and conse
  quently the exterior air, which is susceptible of many variations,
  acts on the fluid in such a way that it is necessary to have re
  course to the barometer to know the effect of the dilatation,
 which is found to correspond with the greater or less elasticity
  of the exterior air.
     These defects, joined to the evaporation of the liquor, obliged
  me to reject these thermometers, notwithstanding their prodi
  gious sensibility.    Although in my later researches I have not
  had these inconveniences to discourage me, it being sufficient to
  compare the different effects of each kind of rays that took place
  in a very short space of time, I have nevertheless endeavoured
  to avoid them altogether, by soldering to the tube of the thermo
  meter a large ball filled with air, which contains a common
  thermometer.       This ball is dipped into a fluid whose tempera
  ture is easily kept uniform, whether we choose to have it at the
  freezing point or at any other temperature.

412    An Essay     on the Degree     of Warmth of coloured Rays.
    By this method the full degree of sensibility is given to the
thermometer, without its having any communication with the
external air.
    For experiments of so delicate a nature we know that a per
fectly serene sky is necessary, and an unvarying temperature
without the least agitation of the air : this necessarily reduces
the experiments on which we may depend to a very small num
ber; and among the great variety of those I have made, I ac
knowledge that there is not so much as one with which I am
completely satisfied.
    I used a large prism of flint glass, of which the refringent angle
was 45°; I permitted an equal quantity of rays to pass through
in each case, and they successively traversed the same lens, which
I inclined according to the sun's altitude ; for I had at that time
no heliostata, and the want of this instrument has rendered my
results still less accurate.
    All my experiments were made between the hours of eleven in
the morning and two in the afternoon ; my air-thermometer was
too sensible to allow of my approaching it without occasioning
variations, so that I observed the divisions by a small telescope
at the distance of fifteen feet, and I raised or lowered the in
dexes by means of a string passing over some pulleys.
    Although from the year 1775 I have made a great number
of experiments, I do not think them worthy of being related,
because I was not then sufficiently acquainted with the precau
tions that are necessary in such delicate inquiries : those made
in 1776 are more conclusive; they give the ratio of the warmth
of the red rays to the violet rays as 8 to 1; for, by warming the
ball of the thermometer for two minutes with these. two kinds of
rays, the index would mark from four divisions and a half to se
ven, for the violet rays ; whilst for the red rays it was necessary
to place the index from 39 to 44 divisions.            These observations
were made in the month of June, Reaumur's thermometer only
varying during the whole time they were made from 16° to 17°.
    The following are the observations of this month :

    It is necessary to remark, that it is the red approaching to the
orange, and the violet approaching to the blue, that I have used.

   In the month of September, I used a thermometer of the con
struction represented by fig. 5, Plate VIII. on which the exterior
air had no influence ; the bubble of air was always similarly ex
posed, for two minutes, to the action of the coloured rays, as in
the preceding experiments ; but the sensibility of the thermo
meter no l&nger continued to be so great.

    It follows from all these experiments, and notwithstanding the
great differences which are to be found amongst them, and how
 ever attentive I was in making them ; first, that the ratio of the
 warmth of clear red to the most lively violet, is nearly as 8 to 1,
                                                                   for

    414                     Experiments and Observations
    for the extreme rays cannot be compared.       Secondly, that the
    warmth of the yellow orange differs but little from that which
    the red produces : so that it may be presumed that the warmest
    rays are between the clear red and the yellow: and from this
    point the warmth of the rays diminishes considerably more on
    the violet side than on that of the deep red.
       I was desirous of using coloured liquids and glasses, but both
    these substances, when coloured, transmit heterogeneous rays in
    too great a quantity to be used with success in experiments of
    so delicate a nature : besides, How are we to estimate the re
    flected rays, and those that are lost in these substances ?    In
    other respects, although I have taken all possible precautions,
    that depended on myself, to ensure the success of these experi
    ments, I am still very far from being satisfied with my labour.

    was regarded as their most beautiful colour, and was prepared
    from shell-fish.
       Vitruvius* says that the colour differed according to the coun
    try from which the shell-fish was brought ; that it afforded a
    colour deeper and more approaching to violet from the northern
    countries, and a redder colour from the southern coasts.         He
    states, that it was prepared by beating the fish with instruments
    of iron, freeing the purple liquor from the shell containing                   it,
    and mixing      with a little honey: and Pliny says, that for the

    both Vitruvius and Pliny say, that      was adulterated, or imita

    J     Madder was extensively used       the ancients in dyeing, and from this

     lours from the same liquor, by means of mordants.           If

/   account, they practised calico-printing          in

                                                                           a    deep

a deep-coloured    rose: and in painting, he states that it was laid
on to give the last lustre to the sandy is, a composition made by
calcining together red ochre and sandarach, and which therefore
must have been nearly the same as our crimson.
    In the baths of Titus there is a broken vase of earthenware,
which contains a pale rose colour ; where it has been exposed
to air, it has lost its tint, and is become of a cream colour, but
the interior has a lustre approaching to that of carmine.
    I have made many experiments on this colour.      It is destroyed
and becomes of a red brown by the action of concentrated acids
and alkalies ; but diluted acids dissolve a considerable quantity
of carbonate of lime with which the body colour is mixed, and
leave a substance of a bright rose colour: this substance when
heated first blackens, and when urged with a strong flame be
comes white ; and treated with alkali, proves to be composed of
siliceous, aluminous, and calcareous earths, with no sensible
quantity of any metallic substance, except oxide of iron.
 - I endeavoured to discover      if the colouring matter was com
bustible.    It was gradually    heated  in a glass tube filled with
oxygen ; it did not inflame, but became red hot sooner than it
would have done had it been merely earthy matter : on exposing
the gas in the tube to lime-water, there was a precipitation of car
bonate of lime.     Some of it was mixed with hyperoxymuriate of
potassa,   and  heated  in a small retort; when the salt fused there
was a slight scintillation, a little moisture appeared, and the gas
given off received into lime-water occasioned a very evident pre
cipitation.
    It appeared from these experiments, that the colouring matter
was a compound of either vegetable or animal origin.         I threw
some of it upon a hot iron : it emitted scarcely any smoke, and -
gave a smell which had some resemblance to that of prussic acid,
but which was extremely faint.
   When hydrate of potassa was fused in contact with            it,
                                                                  the
vapours   that  rose  had  no distinct ammoniacal smell  ;they  gave
indeed slight fumes to paper moistened with muriatic' acid, but
thisis   far from being an unequivocal proof of animal matter.
I compared this colour with vegetable lake from madder, and
animal lake from cochineal diluted to the same degree as nearly
as could be judged, and fixed upon clays.      The lake of madder,
after being dissolved in strong muriatic acid, had its colour re
stored   by alkalies, which ^was not the case with the ancient lake.
The lake of madder likewise gave much deeper tint to muriatic
                                     a
acid, and produced   a    tawny hue when its weak muriatic solution
was acted on    by  muriate of iron whereas the ancienf lake did
                                 ;
not change in colour.        The ancient lake agreed with the lake
of cochineal in being rendered of a deeper hue      byweak alkalies,

416                 Experiments and Observations
and of a brighter hue by weak acids ; but it differed from it in
being    much more easily destroyed by strong acids.               It agreed
with both the vegetable and animal lakes in being immediately
destroyed by a solution of chlorine.
    The lake made from cochineal produced much denser fumes
when exposed to fused potash, and afforded a distinct ammo-
niacal smell.     The two modern lakes when burnt in oxygen did
not give stronger signs of inflammation than the ancient.'              I as
certained the loss of weight this ancient lake suffered by com
bustion, and found it only-^j., and this loss must in great part
have depended on the expulsion of water from the clay on which
it was fixed.      This circumstance induced me to renounce the
idea of attempting to determine its nature frpm the products of
its decomposition ; which in the case of so small a quantity of
matter diffused over so large a quantity of surface could not have
afforded unequivocal results.
    The durability of this lake, whether vegetable or animal, is a
very curious circumstance ; but the exterior part which has been
exposed to air has suffered. — This durability probably depends in
a great measure upon the attractive powers of so large a mass of
alumina; for, whenever one proportion of a substance is combined
with many proportions of another substance, it is very difficult
to decompose or detach the one proportion.
    From the circumstances which have been noticed respecting
this colour, it is impossible to form an opinion whether it is of
vegetable or animal origin.          If of animal origin, it is most pro
bably the Tynan or marine purple : and by some comparative
experiments on the purple obtained from shell-fish the ques
tion might perhaps be decided*.              It is very probable that the
most expensive colour would be employed for ornamenting the
imperial baths ; and it is not impossible that Pliny may have
alluded to the palace of the Cesars when he says " nunc et pur-
puris in parietes migrantibus, et India conferente fluminum suo-
rum limum, et draconum et elephantorum saniem, nulla nobilia
pictura esr." Lib. xxxv. cap. 32.
     I have seen no colour of the same tint as this ancient lake in
any of the ancient paintings in fresco.               The purplish reds in
the baths of Titus are mixtures of red ochres and the blues of
 copper. — In the Aldobrandini picture there is a purple in the
    * M. Chaptal considers    the lake he found amongst the colours from
Pompeii (as 1 have already mentioned) as of vegetable origin; and he founds
 h;s opinion upon the circumstance of its not affording by decomposition the
 smell peculiar to animal substances: but probably this smell, even if pro
 duced by recent purple colouringmatter of animal origin, would not belong
 to colouring matter of 1 700 years old. For it is most probably owing merely
 to albumen or gelatine not essential to llie colouring particles, and much
 more rapidly decomposed.
                                                                     garment

garment of the Pronuba, but of an inferior hue ; and this pur
ple appears to be a compound mineral colour of the nature of
these. — It was not destroyed by solution of chlorine ; and when
a little of it was exposed to muriatic acid, it rendered the acid
yellow, and the remainder yielded a residual blue powder.
        VII. Of    the    Blacks and Browns       of the Ancients.
   There is one chamber in the baths of Titus of which the ground
work is black. I have found several fragments of stucco painted
black both in the baths of Titus and in the vineyard above men
tioned, and also in some ruins near the Porta del Popolo. — I
scraped off some of these colours and submitted them to experi
 ments: they were not acted on by acids or alkalies, they defla
 grated with nitre, and had all the properties of pure carbonaceous
 matter.
    I found no blacks, but three different shades of brown in the
vase of mixed colours ; one was snuff-colour, one deep red brown,
 and the third a dark olive brown.     The two first proved to be
 ochres which had been probably partially calcined ; the third
 contained oxide of manganese, as well as oxide of irpn, and af
 forded chlorine when acted on by muriatic acid.
    All the ancient authors describe the. artificial Greek and Ro
 man blacks as carbonaceous, and made either from the powder
of charcoal or the decomposition of resin, (a species of lamp
black,) or from the lees of wine, or from the common soot of
wood fires.    Pliny mentions the inks of the cuttle-fish, but says,
 "ex his non fit*." Some years ago I examined this substance,
 and found it a carbonaceous body mixed with gelatine.          Pliny
speaks of ivory-black as invented by Apelles ; he says likewise
that there is a natural fossil black, and another black prepared
from an earth of the colour of sulphur.        Probably both these
substances are ores of iron and manganese.
    That the ancients were acquainted with the ores of manga
nese is evident from the use made of it in colouring glass.         I
have examined two specimens of ancient Roman purple glass,
both of which were tinged with oxide of manganese. — Pliny
speaks of different brown ochres, and particularly of one from
Africa, which he names Cicerculum, which probably contained
manganese : and Theophrastus mentions a fossil             f
                                                     which inflamed
when oil was poured upon           it,
                                 a property belonging to no other
fossil substance now known but the black wad, an ore of man
ganese, and which    isnow found in Derbyshire.

  iron to muriatic acid, but the darker shades were not touched
  by that acid, nor by solution of alkalies.
                  VIII. Of the   Whites      of the Ancients.
      The white colours in the Aldobrandini picture are soluble in
  .acids with effervescence, and have the characters of carbonate
   ©f lime.
      The principal white in the vase of mixed colours appears to be
  a very fine chalk.     There is another white with a tint of cream
   colour, which is a fine aluminous clay.
      The whites that I have examined from the baths of Titus, and
  those from other ruins, are all of the same kind.
       I have not met with ceruse amongst the ancient colours,
   (hough we know from Theophrastus, Vitruvius, and Pliny, that
   it was a common colour: and Vitruvius describes it as made by.
   j;he action of lead upon vinegar.
       Several white clays are mentioned by Pliny as employed in
   painting, of which the Parretonium was considered as affording
   the finest colour.
   IX. Of the Manner in which         the Ancients applied their Colours.
       It appears from Vitruvius that the colours used in fresco paint
   ing were applied      moist to the surface of a stucco* formed of
   powdered marble cemented by lime; he states that the wall or
   ceiling had three distinct coatings of stucco made of this material,
   of which the first contained coarse powder of marble, the second
    the finer powder, and the third the finest powder of all, and that
    after this the wall was polished before the colour was applied.
.   The stuccos that remain in the ruins of the baths of Titus and
    Livia are of this kind, and so is the, ground of the Aldobrandini
    picture ; they are beautifully white, and almost as hard as mar
    ble, and the granular marble of different degrees of fineness may
    be distinguished in them.         This circumstance indeed offers a,
    test of the antiquity of ruins at Rome.          In the houses that have
    been built in the middle and later ages, decomposing lava has
    been mixed with the calcareous cement instead of granular mar
    ble, and the stuccos of these houses are gray or brown, and very
    coarse in their texture.
        Pliny says that purple, orpiment, ceruse, the natural azure,
    indigo, and the meline white, were injured by application to wet
    stucco, which is easily explained in the case of orpiment, car
    bonate of cdpper, ceruse, and indigo, from their chemical com
    position.

                                                                    Vitruvius

            on  llw Colours used in Painting ty the Ancients.            41ft
    Vitruvius states that in fresco painting vermilion changed if
exposed to light, and he recommends the encaustic process for
fixing the colour under this circumstance, namely, laying over it
a, coat of panic wax, and liquefying the wax so as to make a var
nish' for the colour.
     Pliny describes this process as applied in painting ships; and
we know from his authority that several pictures of the great
Greek masters were painted in encaustic, and that the different
colours were laid on mixed with wax.           I have examined several
pieces of the painted stuccos found in the different ruins, and
likewise the Aldobrandini picture, with a view of ascertaining if
any application had been made to fix the colour ; but neither by
the test of alcohol, nor by heat, nor by the action of water,
could I detect the presence of any wax varnish, or animal or ve
getable gluten.
     The pot of colours to which I have already referred, found at'
Pompeii, was blackened by smoke, as if it had been recently on
 a fire of wood,       I thought that this might be owing to some
process for dissolving gluten or varnish in the preparation of the
 colour ; but I could detect no substance of this kind mixed with
 the colouring matter.
     Pliny states that gluten (our glue)* was used in painting with
blacks : and this specific mention of its application would induce
 the belief that it was not employed with other colours, which
 adhered without difficulty to, and were imbibed by, a surface so
 polished and well prepared as the Roman stucco ; and the light
 ness of carbonaceous matter alone probably rendered this appli
 cation necessary.
                      X.   Some general Observations.
     It  appears from the facts that have been stated, and the au
 thorities quoted, that the Greek and Roman painters had almost
 all the same colours as those employed by the great Italian
 Inasters at the period of the revival of the arts in Italy.            They
 had indeed the advantage over them in two colours, the Vesto-
 rian or Egyptian azure, and the Tyrian or marine purple.
     The azure, of which the excellence is proved by its duration

  parts of powdered opaque flints, and three parts of copper filings
  strongly heated together for two hours, gave a substance of ex

  and which, when powdered, produced a fine deep sky blue.

    The azure, the red and yellow ochres, and the blacks are
the colours that seem not to have changed at all, in the ancient
fresco paintings.     The vermilion is darker than recently made
Dutch cinnabar, and the red-lead is inferior in tint to that sold
in the shops.     The greens in general are dull.
   The principle of the composition of the Alexandrian frit is
perfect; namely, that of embodying the colour in a composition
resembling stone, so as to prevent the escape of elastic matter

is worth trying whether the beautiful purple given by oxide of
gold cannot be made useful in painting in        densely tinted glass.

copper  which   contain  an oxide   and   an  acid  have  changed very
little.

   Scheele's green (the arsenite of copper), and the insoluble

unalterable than the ancient greens; and the sulphate of baryta

    Pliny speaks of the celebrated Greek painters as employing
only four colours.            "Quatuor coloribus solis immortalia ilia
opera     fecere  :  ex  albis Melino, ex silaceis Attico, ex rubris Sino-
pide Pontica,       ex  nigris atramento, Apelles, Echion, Melanthius,
Nicomachus, clarissimi pictoresf:
                                                " but as far as Apelles and
Nicomachus are concerned, this is a mistake; and it is not un
likely that Pliny was misled by an imperfect recollection of a
passage in Cicero, who describes the earlier Greek school as
 using only four colours, but the later Greek painters as perfect
masters in all the resources of colouring.                 " Similis in pictura
ratio est : in qua Zeuxim, et Polvgnotum, et Timantem, et eorum,
qui non sunt usi plus quam quatuor coloribus, formas et linea-
menta laudamus : at in Aetione, Nicomacho, Protogene, Apelle,
jam perfecta sunt omnia."               Cicero, Brutus, seu de claris ora-
toribus,     c.  18.     Pliny himself describes with enthusiasm the
 Venus dvaiuoji^hri of Apelles : and in this picture the sea was re
presented, which required azure.
    The great Greek painters, like the most illustrious artists of
the Roman and Venetian school, were probably, however, sparing
in the use of the more florid tints in historical and moral paint
 ing, and produced their effects rather by the contrasts of colouring
in those parts of the picture where a deep and uniform tint might
be used, than by brilliant drapery.
     If red and yellow ochres, blacks and whites, were the colours
most employed by Protogenes and Apelles, so they are likewise
the colours most employed by Raphael and Titian in their best
style.      The St. John and the Venus, in the tribune of the Gal-
lery at Florence, offer striking examples of pictures in which all
the deeper tints are evidently produced by red and yellow ochres,
 and carbonaceous substances.
     As far as colours are concerned, these works are prepared for
 that immortality which they deserve ; but unfortunately the oil
 and the canvass are vegetable materials, and liable to decomposi
 tion, and the last is less durable than even the wood on which
 the Greek artists painted their celebrated pictures.
    It is unfortunate that the materials for receiving those works
 which are worthy of passing down to posterity as eternal monu
 ments of genius, taste, and industry, are not imperishable mar-
    * Some excellent
                        pictures have  suffered  very much in modern times from
 the same cause; the lakes in the      frescos of the Vatican have lost much of
 the brilliancy which they must        have possessed originally.   The blues in
 many pictures of Paul Veronese       are become muddy.

      calorific Focus, and that Dr. Herschhl was mistaken in sup
      posing he separated the Heat and Light of the Solar Rays.

                                To   Mr.   Tilloch.
  Sift,—   H aving fixed         a piece of pasteboard in the frame of a
  dressing-glass,      in which    I cut an opening or slit a little larger
  than the bulb of a thermometer, and of a sufficient length to let
  the whole extent of one of the prismatic colours pass through ;
  and having placed a very sensible mercurial thermometer on an
  inclined plane of wood covered with white paper, — I placed this
  plane behind the dressing frame sustaining the pasteboard on a
  table : I now set a prism moveable on its axis in the upper part
  of an open window at right angles to the solar ray, and turned
  it about till its refracted coloured spectrum became stationary on
  the table placed at a proper distance from the window.                  The
  experiment was so regulated as to let the rays of one colour pass
  through the opening in the pasteboard and fall on the thermo
  meter, which when placed in the shade behind the screen stood
  at 50'.
       Exp. 1. — Having arranged the thermometer, and allowed the
.red, or more correctly speaking the orange rays to fall on the
  bulb ; in five-minutes it rose from 50 to 58, or eight degrees.
       Exp. 2. — I lowered my thermometer to 50°, by plungeing it
  in some dry sand at that temperature, and then replaced it on
  the inclined plane : on bringing the green rays of the spectrum
.through the opening, so as to immerse the entire thermometer
      * Copper, it is evident, from the
                                        specimens in the ruins of Pompeii, is a
  very perishable material, and therefore, even enamels made on copper will
'
  yield to time. Canvass, by beiny impregnated with bitumen, is rendered
.much more durable, as is evident from the duration of the linen impreg
   nated with bitumen and asphaltura used for infolding the Egyptian mum
  mies.
      t The artificial hydrat of alumina will probably be found to be a sub
   stance of this kind : possibly the solution of boracic acid in alcohol will
   form a varnish.' —The solution of sulphur in alcohol is likewise worthy of
  an experiment.      Many other similar combinations might be named.

as in the former           experiment,            it rose from 50 to 54, or gained
 four degrees.
    Exp. 3. — Having again reduced my thermometer to 50°, I
 placed it on the inclined plane ; and having allowed the violet
rays to fall on      it,
                      the rise was from 50 to 51, or one degree.
    So far these experiments, assimilated as much as occasion
required to Dr.Herschel's, would seem to confirm the inferences
drawn     by that celebrated astronomer.       However, so early as the
year 1802, when at Edinburgh College attending Dr. .Hope's
interesting and scientific lectures on chemistry,               was led to
                                                                         I
 doubt the conclusions drawn from these experiments, but at that
"early period did not venture to oppose such high authority.
    Exp. 4. — Having finished the former experiments,               removed   I
 the pasteboard screen, and in its place interposed a sheet of white
 paper on which the spectrum was received                    was gradually
                                                                ;   it
 approximated to within one inch of the prism, where                was pro   it
 perly  fastened   on     stand.
                            a      The    spectrum   at  this  distance   was
 one-fourth of an inch in breadth, bounded           on    the  one   side               by
orange and yellow rays, and on the other by blue and violet,
while light occupied the middle         this white light was much more
                                                   ;
powerful and luminous than the surrounding sun-beams.                      In
 deed,  it appeared exactly like the light concentrated in the focus
of  a  burning-glass, which made me strongly suspect that                 was      it
likewise more calorific. Nor was          mistaken  I for,   on; placing the
thermometer in those rays,          rose in ten minutes to 81°; the
                                             it
heat of the neighbouring sun-shine being only 70'.                The ther
mometer rose and fell alternately as          was removed in and out of
                                                         it
the spectrum.       From this experiment we must infer that Dr.
 Herschel   made    his experiments not only on the heat of the solar
 ray, but    likewise   on the heat accumulated                     by
                                                           the converging
power of the prism.        Indeed,     appears rather singular that the
                                                  it
action of this well-known instrument should heretofore have been
 so superficially investigated.    Every glass wedge must produce a
focal heat, for those rays in the vicinity of the angle must suffer
a  more powerful refraction than the others             consequently at
                                                               ;                         a
given distance the heat and light must be condensed.                  Let us
suppose the vertical section of a triangular glass wedge or prism,
resting on its base, to be represented in the following diagram                         :

    Exp. 5. — June 23, IS 14, at half past two in the afternoon,
the sun shining through an open window fronting the west,                               I
placed a highly sensible and correct thermometer (made by Mr.
Bath of the Cork Institution) on a sheet of white paper, resting
horizontally on a writing-table. In five minutes it rose in the
full sun-beams to 82f ; and after remaining for some time sta
tionary, I held a large prism at about one inch distance imme
diately over    it,and in such       manner as to convey the rays of
                                          a
light as much as possible to the prismatic focus, and also to
immerse the entire thermometric bulb and cylinder               spec      in   a
trum of transmitted light.          need scarcely again remark that
                                          1
this spectrum was composed of medion white light, bounded on
the one side    byorange and yellow, and on the other       blue and      by
violet. In five minutes the thermometer rose to 101; or,        other          in
words, the transmitted light was heated 18{° above the full sun
shine     by
           passing through the prism.         On removing the prism
the thermometer fell in five minutes, to 85°; and on again im
mersing   itin the speotric light      rose to 101°.

 of the blow-pipe, through the end of the glass rod at (a), inti>
 which a piece of piano-forte wire is fixed, that stands about an
 inch and a half above the rod, and reaches three or four inches
 below it. To the lower end of this wire two slips of Dutch
gold-leaf are fixed with gum water.        I have tried both gold and
 silver leaf for this purpose ; but Dutch gold-leaf, commonly called
 Dutch metal, an article manufactured out of copper, is far pre
 ferable.
     The glass jar w,x,y,z, three inches in diameter and seven
 inches deep, is fixed into the base EF. The slips of Dutch gold-
 leaf are each one inch in length, consequently their ends cannot
 reach the sides of the glass nearer than half an inch when the
 wire is in the axis of the glass.     The only use of this jar is to
defend the slips of metal from being agitated by the air, and
 from the action of the small particles of dust and moisture that
are constantly floating in it.
    As green bottle-glass contains no metal, I suppose that it in
 sulates better than white flint, which contains irueh lead.
    2. Another electrometer is made thus: The glass rod a, b, r,
being taken away, a stopper of sealing-wax is fitted into the
 neck of the jar, through which a piece of pian»-forte wire passes
 into the glass, and extends down its axis aboit one-third of the
distance between the stopper and the bottom" fz. To the lower
end of this wire two slips of Dutch leaf are &ed in the manner
 above described.
     This electrometer is more convenient fo some experiments
than the other, and less liable to accidents. „ .
     I have various other forms of this instrunpnt, which need not
be described in this paper.
    S. Several insulating stands, each consiting of a glass rod
ten inches in length and 2-lOths of an incfin diameter, stand
ing upon a brass foot.      These have each ajircular piece of plate
glass two inches and 3-4ths in diametq, fixed upon its top
with sealing-wax. The upper surface ofthis glass is gilt with
gold-leaf, and upon its centre a slip of Dpch leaf about an inch
in length is fixed by one of its ends.         /                    . ,

     S,   An electrometer   constructed according to Mr.     Bennet'*
directions,    and some other instruments used for the same pur
pose.      They are very ingenious inventions, but improperly called
electrometers ; they are electroscopes, which indicate the ex
istence of electricity, but not the quantity of it.
     From the following experiments it will appear that some of
the principal hypotheses which have been invented to explain
the phenomena of electricity are erroneous.
     Exp. 1. A barometer tube 4-10ths of an inch external dia
meter being excited by rubbing it with silk, and held over the
top of the wire of one of the electrometers above described, for
a short time, at the distance of six, nine, or twelve inches, ac
cording to the degree of excitement, or state of the air, the gold-
leaves will diverge to an angle between 90 and 1 80 degrees ;
 and if the instrument be a good one, this angle will gradually
 decrease during two or three days ; but these instruments in
 general will not retain electricity (piite so long.
     Exp. 2. The barometer-tube being excited as before, and
 held over one of the insulating stands with a gilt surface, at the
 distance of three or four inches, for a short time, the narrow slip
 of Dutch leaf stood erect for near two hours. At the end of that
 time, the quantity of electricity which the gilt surface contained
 was measured ihus : the wire at the top of an electrometer be
 ing' brought into contact with the edge of the gilt surface of the
 glass, the leav-s of the electrometer- diverged, and the angle
 being measured vas fomid to contain 50 degrees.        The electro
 meter being disciarged, by touching the wire with a finger, and
 applied a second time to the gilt surface, the leaves diverged,
  and the angle behg measured was found to contain 30 degrees.
 Thus the remainhg quantity of electricity was measured, and
  the sum of the anjles indicated by the electrometer amounted to
   110 degrees.
      The divergency if the leaves is measured by a graduated arc
  placed against themtside of the jar, with its centre just as high
  above the table onwhich the instrument stands, as the angular
  point of the two lesres.
      But the two elecrometers described in this paper, will not
  indicate the same ti mber of degrees in a given quantity of elec
  tricity, because theii leaves are of unequal dimensions.
    ^
      Exp. 3. After oie of the insulating stands A had been elec
 trified by induction, $ in the last experiment, I took it up by
 its foot and held it it an inverted position over the top of an
 other stand B for a Ittle time ; the distance between their two
 surfaces being about tlree inches.      The slip of Dutch leaf upon
 B, being attracted by \hat on A, stood erect, but in a short time
 the leaves ceased to inlicate any electrical signs; for the elec
                                                               tricity

                 New Outlines       of Chemical Philosophy,     427
tricky of A      was      equally divided between A and B, which be
came known by measuring them with an electrometer.
   Exp. 4. The gilt surface of the insulating stand A being
electrified by induction, as before, and held over the brass ball
No. 4 communicating with the earth, the slip of gold-leaf upon
it stood erect, pointing to that on A, and strongly attracting each
other : hence I concluded, that the two surfaces were in con
trary electrical states.    To demonstrate the truth of this sup
position,   I excited a  stick  of sealing-wax by rubbing it with a
woollen cloth, and held it    at a proper distance from the two slips
of metal : that upon the gilt surface was attracted by but the            it,
-other was repelled.
     As a further proof of this test,     I       held one of my electrometers,
 so that the wire upon the top of             it    came into contact with the
 slip  of   metal    upon    the  brass    ball.     The leaves of the electro
 meter received photogen (minus electricity) and diverged to an
 angle of 40 degrees.            The electrometer being discharged, and
 applied a second time to the slip of metal upon the brass ball,
 the leaves of the electrometer diverged with the same element
 as before  :    thus, by continuing the operation, electricity may be
 drawn from the same object as long as the gilt surface of the
 insulating stand contains power to attract               it     from the earth.
 When the gilt surface of the insulating stand                 is    charged with
  thermogen,    it    attracts photogen from the earth         ;    but when the
 gilt surface   is   charged with photogen, thermogen               is drawn from         '
vit.    These     experiments      are  delicate,    and  will not   succeed  in all
  states   of  the  earth, unless     the  electrometer be      a  very good one.
  But this          subject which remains for further investigation.
            is
            a
      The attraction between the two elements was so strong, that
  when the slip of metal upon the brass ball was bent out of its
  perpendicular direction,        by    the wire of the electrometer,           in
                                                                                it
  stantly   returned    into  its former    position,   as soon   asit  was  set at
  liberty, like an elastic fibre.
      This element certainly came from the earth for, when an in
                                                           ;
  sulated glass ball was used       in   the same manner as the brass one,
  the slip of metal upon the glass soon became electrified, but iti
  the same state as that above           it
                                          ;      for, all communication being
  cut off between the        earth   and  the  glass ball,it    could not receive
  electricity from any other object.
      Whence    it   is evident, that when the inside of       a     Levden jar      is
  receiving thermogen from the electric machine, this element at
   tracts photogen to the outside from the earth, and                it   only the
                                                                          is
  coating that prevents their           union ;    for, take   away the coating,
   and the jar will no longer contain those elements, because they
   pass through glass like light or magnetism. — This property of
   electricity admits of an experimental demonstration.                 .

    This experiment explains in a very satisfactory manner some
 of the grandest phenomena of Nature.
     If the gilt surface electrified in the manner above described
 represents a cloud highly charged with electricity, and the brass
 ball the earth, then it appears evidently, that the cloud attracts
 the contrary element out of the earth, at the same instant that
 the earth attracts that contained in the cloud; and these two
 elements of combustion, passing through each other in contrary
 directions, generate lightning.
     This experiment also explains the cause of water-spouts. A
 cloud being charged with one of the elements of electricity, at
 tracts not only the contrary element out of the sea, but has suf
 ficient power to lift a portion of the water also, which at the
 same time conducts one of the elements from the cloud to, the
 sea, and the other from the sea to the cloud.       And the moving
 pillars of sand, seen by Mr. Bruce and other travellers, upon
 the desert plains of Africa, are raised by the same two elements.
     It may, however, be deemed impossible that any power in the
 clouds should be capable of raising up such hea>y masses of
 matter as those above mentioned ; but when we compare the
 effects of a barometer-tube of only 4-10ths of an inch in dia
 meter, with the effects produced by. a cloud of some miles in
 area, this objection must vanish.        Indeed, the effects seen in
 our experiments are matters of astonishment quite as great, when
 placed in a philosophic point of view, as those produced by a
 thunder cloud.     The efficient causes are the same in both cases,
 and equally unknown to us.
     Bacon and Newton showed the necessity of building philoso
 phical theories upon geometrical and experimental principles :
 but these tedious modes of investigation are frequently avoided,
 by building theories upon some supposed principle, or erroneous
 experiment made with imperfect instruments.            Hence much
 learning and ingenuity have been exercised in building an aerial
 fabric, which vanishes like a shadow seen through a transpa
 rency, as soon as the novelty is over, or on the first appearance
 of an experimental demonstration.
     It has been a disputed point ever since electricity was brought
 into the form of a science, whether glass is permeable by the
 electrical fluid. This uncertainty has not been owing to the
  want of ability or attention in those who cultivated the science,
 but probably to the imperfection of the instruments which they
.used in making the experiments.
     Dr. Franklin and his friends concluded from their experiments,
 that glass is impermeable by the electric fluid ; and this hypo
 thesis seems to have met with general approbation.
     In the year 1780, the Rev. John Lyon, of Dover, published
                                                                some

                   New Outlines       of   Chemical Philosophy.                429
some experiments and observations on electricity, in which he
attempted to prove that glass is permeable to the electric fluid.
The gentleman who wrote a critique on that work in the Monthly-
Review, being a Franklinian, objected to the experiments which
related to the permeability of glass, in a manner which did not
exactly accord with the author's ideas of the subject.          In the
year following, Mr. Lyon published       some  " further proofs that
glass is permeable by the electric effluvia."      The same gentle
man who reviewed the former work reviewed this also ; and some
drops of ink were spilt between the two disputants, which might
have. been spared without doing much harm to the subject.
    I do not remember to have seen, since that time, any attempt
to subvert the Franklinian theory (as it is called), till I read the
papers of Mr. Donovan and M. De Luc in the present volume.
Mr. Donovan observes " that glass               is,
                                           in the strict sense of the
word, permeable to electricity, yet the fluid passes through                    it
with so much difficulty and so slowly that Franklin's position
might be admitted."
    In the first observation Mr. Donovan       certainly correct; but
                                                       is
as to the time of its passing, this learned philosopher seems to
have been deceived,             by
                            his having made use of coated glass.
    My experiments on this subject prove, not only that glass                    is
permeable        the electrical elements, but that they pass through
                  by
it  instantaneously.

the other end being fixed with sealing-wax to that part of the
stopper which goes into the decanter. This tube being suspended
 in the axis of the glass, its mouth was closed                  by
                                                        the stopper as
perfectly as could be done with glass, without the use of the
blow-pipe.

or three inches, the gold-leaves vibrated nearly as much as they
would have done had the glass been open at the bottom.

              a
ratus,    concluded that the electrical elements pass through glass

                                 it
went   into the glass between  its neck and the stopper.       This              is
not impossible, though not probable for the element must have

that the electrical elements pass through glass instantaneously,
I ordered a glass ball three inches diameter to be blown with a
long neck, that a thermometer-tube      might be sealed into it
with the blow-pipe. But as the artist to whom I gave the or
der did not execute it so soon as he might have done, he gave
me an opportunity of trying what might be done without his
assistance.
   It is well known to every tyro in this science, that animal sub
stances are better conductors of electricity than glass.    On this
principle I supposed that the electrical elements might be pre
vented from entering into a glass phial, as effectually as if iti
mouth were hermetically sealed.
   To try what might be done on this principle, I procured a
Florence flask, and fitted into the top of its neck a glass stopper,
but not by grinding, for that was not necessary in this experi
ment.     To the lower part of the glass stopper, one end of a
strip of Dutch plate-glass, a quarter of an inch in breadth, was
fixed with sealing-wax ; to the other end twb slips of Dutch leaf,
each an inch and a half in length and a quarter of an inch in
breadth, were fixed.    The strip of glass being suspended in the
axis of the flask, its neck and stopper were covered with moist
bladder.
     The palm of the hand being laid upon the stopper, and an
excited barometer-tube carried over the back of it with a vibra
ting motion, not the least effect was produced in the leaves within
the flask ; for all the electricity communicated to the hand was
conducted to the floor, through the person of the experimenter*.
     But the flask being taken up by its neck and an excited tube
of glass held under the bottom of             it,
                                             at the distance of two or
three inches, the leaves instantly diverged          and when the tube

five times   in    second,

formed, in the same time,           by
                                    the leaves within the flask: and

    Tlie ball, in its natural state, contains the two elements of
electricity, thermogen and photogen,                diffused over its surface :
consequently,         if the tube   be   charged with thermogen (positive
electricity) it will repel      that   element from the surface of the ball,
because elements of the same kind repel each other ; but the
other element, photogen, will remain upon the surface of the
ball undisturbed.
    To prove the truth of this theory by experiment, I placed an
electrometer with the top of its wire in contact with the under
side of the ball ; and a barometer-tube, rubbed with silk, being,
brought so near the ball as to electrify it by induction, the leave*
of the electrometer diverged, containing thermogen.
    This electrometer and the excited tube were taken away from
the ball, and another electrometer being applied to it became
electrified, but in a state contrary to the former.
    Thus, the two electrometers became permanently electrified,
by the two elements which the ball possessed in its natural state.
The first electrometer received a portion of thermogen which was
repelled from the ball by the excited tube, but the other was
electrified by the photogen which remained upon the ball afte*
the tube had been removed.
     Exp. 7- Two Dutch-leaf electrometers, being placed upon a
table at the distance of about an inch asunder, and an excited
barometer-tube held over them at the distance of about two
inches from each, became permanently electrified.                   One of them
received the same element as the excited surface, but the other
received the contrary element.
                                   Explanation.
  . All the metal contained in one of these electrometers,                  No. 1,
weighs only three grains, and consequently the quantity of elec
tricity which it contains in its natural state may be deemed,
almost nothing ; wherefore electrometers of this construction
always receive that element to which they are exposed, whether
thev receive it by induction or direct communication*.
     But the other electrometer, No. 2, had a brass ball of an inch
in diameter fixed upon the top of it ; and as soon as the excited

No. I.
   From the two different electrical states of the electrometers,
with and without the brass ball, it will be easily understood, that
there is a certain construction of the instrument which will not
remain permanently electrified.   When the surface of the ball is
equal to the surfaces of the two leaves, all electrical signs will
vanish as soon as the excited surface is removed.

I laid thermometer-tube upon an insulating stand in a hori

zontal position, and hung a pith-ball electrometer upon it near
one of its ends.    These balls being immersed in an atmosphere
of thermogen diverged with that element.

balls in an atmosphere of thermogen, they diverged, but in                              a
contrary electrical state, for the reasons given in the two last
experiments.

The     following account of certain peculiarities attending a
spring of fresh water, which was tapped in boring within the
harbour of Bridlington quay, Yorkshire,       given from repeated
                                                         is
observations made during a residence of some weeks there, in
the months of July and August 1814.       The harbour of Bridling

             is                             rivulet which traverses

                                  it

   Mr. Rennie, civil-engineer, was consulted in the year 1811,

          Ori- an   elhing and flowing Stream at Bridlington.          433
well to be described, was bf£;un under the direction of Mr. Milne,
collector of the customs for the port.           The spot fixed upon is
opposite   to  the  termination of  a  street  leading to the harbour,
and has about six feet of water, at high water, in ordinary
 tides.         ,
    After the workmen had bored through twenty-eight feet of
very solid clay, and afterwards through fifteen feet of a creta
ceous flinty gravel, of a very concrete texture, the auger was
perceived to strike against the solid rock; but as they were not
able to make any impression upon         it, the work was given up for
that tide, without any appearance of water from the first. In
 an hour or two afterwards, the'bore was found filled to the top
with fresh water, of the most limpid appearance:             itsoon flowed
over, and was even projected some inches above the summit of
the bore, in    a stream equal to its calibre. . When        it  was ascer
tained that the water was of the purest quality and taste, per
fectly fit for washing, and every culinary purpose, the bore was
properly secured       by
                        an elm stock, ten feet long, and perforated
with  a  three-inch auger, driven to its full length a copper tube,
                                                         :
well tinned cm both sides, of     a circumference to admit its being
passed through the bore of elm stock, and thirty-two feet in
length, was then forced to the bottom of the bore, so as to rest
on the rock.       The upper part being properly puddled round the
elm stock, and the well thus completed, the following singular
circumstances wore observed, and have continued with great
uniformity ever since.
    As soon as the surface of the sea water in the harbour, during
the flowing tide, has arrived at level of forty-nine or fifty inches
                                     a
lower than the top of the bore, the water begins to flow from            it
in stream equal to its calibre, the impetus of which
  a                                                               increased
                                                                  is
as the tide advances, and may be observed to be propelled with
much force after the bore       is overflowed by the tide.         The dis
charge continues from four to five hours,          e. till the tide in re
                                                    i.
turning falls to the same level where           began to flow: at this
                                               it
point,     ceases completely till the nest flood shall have regained
          it
the same level, when the same phenomena recur, in the same
succession, and without any variation, but what arises from the
different degrees of elevation in the tides.        The rule appears to
be, that the column of spring water in the bore              isalways sup
ported at a height of forty-nine or fifty inches above the level of
the tide, at any given time.         This at least was the result of
every observation      Imade during several successive weeks, in the
months of July and August last and   ;   I   am assured      by Mr. Milne,
en whose ingenuity and habit of accurate observation          I   can place
the  firmest  reliance, that his habitual experience,      for  three years

 past, goes to convince him, that the variations from the rule
  stated above, are very inconsiderable during the summer and
  autumnal months ; but that in winter, after any unusual fall of
  rain, he has known the column of fresh water raised eight feet
  above the level of the tide, and the period of its discharge pro
 portionally prolonged.
     For the use of the town and shipping, a reservoir of brick
  work, capable of containing one thousand gallons, has been con
 structed within two or three yards, and upon somewhat a higher
 level than the summit of the bore, and is made to communicate
 with it by a tube of the same diameter, fitted with a valve, to
 prevent any reflux into the well.     Two waste pipes are placed
 within a foot of the top of the reservoir, for the regular discharge
 of the water, and it has also been made to communicate with a
 pump adjoining, by which the reservoir may be emptied; and as
 the bore of the well is now closed and secured at the top,, it is
 obvious that the commencement of the flow of water, from the
 pipes of the reservoir, will happen a few minutes sooner or later
 at each tide, according to the quantity of water it contained at
 the time.     Such, however, is the known regularity of the dis
 charge from the waste pipes, that at the expected time of the
 tide several of the inhabitants are always on the spot with their
 vessels, and are rarely obliged to wait for more than five mi
 nutes.
     Such is the state of facts, and it appears to open a subject of
 curious investigation to those whose habits and practical know
 ledge qualify them for it.     The appearance? seem not to admit
 of any satisfactory explanation, without supposing some mode
 of subterranean communication, by which the water of the sea,
 and that of the spring in question, are brought into actual con
 tact, so as to exert a reciprocal action.     This supposition re
 ceives considerable support from a circumstance which I had no
 opportunity to observe, but which Mr. Milne has had frequent
 occasion to notice ; and which he describes by remarking, that
after stormy weather, when there is a heavy sea on that coast,
 the water is discharged, even from the waste pipes of the re-
•ervoir, with an evident undulation ; which, of course, would be
more considerable from the original bore.
    Mr. Milne has framed an hypothesis to satisfy his own mind
on this curious subject.      He believes the stratum of clay found
in the harbour, to extend oyer the whole bay in front of       it,  as
far as the Smithwick sand, which forms    a  bar across the opening
of the bay, in a    direction from Flamborough head towards the
Spurn point,     and   about four miles from the quay in   a   south
easterly  direction.    This bankis   supported by   a reef of  rock ;

        On an eliing and flowing Stream al Bridlington.           435
 and though there are openings, which are well known, and ad
 mit vessels of considerable burthen at all times of the tide, there
 is in general but a small draft of water on this bank, when the
 tide is out.     On the outward or east side, towards the ocean," the
irock is quite perpendicular, and a great depth of water is imme
 diately behind it.     As the copious source pf water, which has
 been tapped in the harbour, lies at such a depth, and under a
 stratum .of clay, there is no reason to think that it can be dis
 charged any where in the bay, till it arrives at the ledge of rock
 where the clay terminates.      Here, among the fissures of the rock,
 it may find its exit ; and this is the more likely, as it is known
  that the bed of the sea at the back of the Smithwick sand is at
  so much a lower level.
      Admitting this supposition to be correct, or nearly so, it seems
  to follow, that the issue of a body of fresh water, through a fis
  sure in rock forming the bed of the sea, would meet with more
  or less resistance at different times of the tide ; because the two
  columns of fluid in meeting, would act upon one another in the
  ratio of the altitude of each, taking into the account the difference
  of their specific gravity; and thus, if there is any approach to
  an equilibrium, an operation would result, analogous to the flux
  »nd reflux of the tide, near the mouth of rivers.
      This hypothesis is specious, and accounts for the flux and re
  flux of the water from the bore, as well as for the singular un
  dulation of the discharge in a boisterous state of the sea : but
  the greater relative altitude to which the column of spring water
  js elevated after much rain, and the consequent prolonged dis
   charge of it during each tide, seems to militate against its cor
   rectness ; since, in a ease, where by the supposition a balance is
   nearly established, an additional impetus communicated to the
   column of spring water, ought to produce the opposite effect,
   by enabling it to overcome the resistance of the same column of
   sea-water during a longer period of each tide, than under the
   usual circumstances.
       It is not improbable, that this whole subject might be eluci
   dated, by a more perfect acquaintance with the peculiarities of
   the springs on this part of the coast, provincially termed gipsies.
   The water in this district of the east riding of Yorkshire pos
   sesses that limpidness which is usual in cretaceous soils; but for
   many miles of the Wolds behind Bridlington, very little water is
   to be seen.     There are few rivulets, and these are very low in the
   summer, and most of them quite dry in autumn.           The account
    to be collected from the inhabitants  is, that in two or three weeks
    after the commencement of frost, the springs begin to run co
    piously; and in many, the water  is   projected with such impetuo-

 Sir,— I he vast importance both to their owners and the
 public, of the extensive and curious Works which are carried on
 underground in these Kingdoms for procuring that truly essential
 article fossil Coal, seems to have failed of attracting such a ge
 neral attention to them, and to the principles on which they are
 or may be best and most securely conducted, as their importance
 has demanded; until of late, that the sympathy and feelings of
 a portion of the public has been roused, by the lamented losses
 of Lives that have occurred.    Although on one hand, the rights of
 private property, and the respect due to characters of the first re
 spectability who are Owners and Lessees of Coal-works, to the
 professional talents and to the private characters of the Agents,
 Over-lookers, and Men employed, call for and require the utmost
 delicacy, in speaking or writing for the public Eye, on their in
 dividual concerns or proceedings ; yet, on the other hand, m a
 matter of so much importance as the preventing of the distressing
 catastrophes which have of late years wrung the hearts of the
 Inhabitants of Durham and Northumberland, it may appear lit
 tle short of criminal apathy, in those who may happen to have
 seen much of the management of Collieries in this or other di
 stricts, not to endeavour, by as plain and intelligible descriptions
 a- possible, to make the true circumstances of the unfortunate
 cases fully known to the public, and in temperate and proper

in your very useful miscellany, for describing the leading circum
stances of Htulon Colliery, from the materials kindly furnished
by your Correspondent N. at page 364, and from other sources,
and which will be best done, I conceive, by beginning with a
clear idea of the situation of the seam or stratum of Coal which
is wrought or dug in this Colliery, where the same formerly ap
 proached near to the surface.
    The Tyne River has its course nearly from W to E, where it
passes close on the S side of Newcastle Town, between it and
Gateshead ; about £ of a mile below the Bridge of Newcastle,
a small stream or rivulet falls into the Tyne, from the North : —
if from the Tyne we go northward up the bottom of the sudden
?alley or burn in which this rivulet runs, we shall pass Useburn
on the N Shields Road, and leave Heaton-Hall and its grounds (the
'eat of Sir Matthew White Ridley, Bart.) on the rising ground
E of this Burn, at about 1| m. distant from the Tyne: and
along the surface in the bottom of this Burn, or at no great di
stance below        all the length, the Heaton seam of coals, about
                     it,
?ix feet thick, may be conceived            by

                           N

called its roof and its floor) has a considerable declension or dip
to the eastward, causing          to descend deeper and deeper, the

that the Coal was not reached in these perpendicular pits until
near 110 yards deep: — according to the usual practice of Col

them W, as will be further described respecting the new or pre
sent Colliery, all the Coal lieing up the slope or rise of the
stratum to the W, from these Level Gates, was wrought out,
almost to the basset or near appearance of the stratum of Cos!
on the surface in the Burn, I believe, as already described.
    The reason of Engine-pits being mentioned above, arises, from
a vertical fissure or crack of some width, breaking through all
the strata from the surface to a great and unknown depth (and
ranging SW and NE, I believe) called a Fault or Dike, which
divided this old Colliery into two' parts ; in the northern part of
which, the Coal-seam and all the strata above and below       it, were
found raised or thrown up, with respefct to those in the southern
part, 16 yards in height, and this fault or natural barrier, so
lidly filled with water-tight clay and earth called Fault-stuff?
the old Colliers were careful never to penetrate, so as to con
nect the waters in the underground works of these northern atid
southern parts of the old Colliery.
    On the abandonment of the old Colliery,     it  should seem, fhtttf
the vertical pits of the northern part were closed or filled up-wiffi'
 earth or rubbish, but some of those of the southern part, in
front of Heaton-Hall', were strongly floored or scaffolded over, at
 10' yards below the surface, and1 the pit only filled up with Earth
above this flooring, leaving the lower part open to the hollows
or excavated chambers, whence all the Coal had been taken, that"
it  was judged safe to remove, without letting down the roof on
the heads of the workmen.          And  by  the soakage of rain-water
 through the strata (and     by their edges) from the surface, these
 old' hollows soon became quite full of water, resting against the
unwrought or whole Coal of the seam, below the Level Gates, on
all the E     or deep side of this1 deserted Colliery, rising several-
yards   up  the   open pits, and thereby giving  a   hydrostatic pres
sure, equal    to  this column of water in> the vertical pits, to great
part of t!he body of Water in these Goal-hollows.

to the  E,  or in the deep of the former Engine-pits of Heatbn-Bank
 Colliery, that the Coal-seam was; not reached therein rill the
depth of 1454* yards and in order to avoid the expense of sinking
                    ;
two Pits, one for the pumping and the up-cast or ascending cur
rent of light and contaminated air, and another for the drawing
of Coals and the down-cast or descending column of fresh air
 (as would in most other districts of Britain have been done, where
the Coals lay at no greater depth than here) one wide pit, se
parated   by   a boarded partition from top to bottom, was made to

of lring chambers, galleries or board-ways therefrom, up the sfope
or plane of the Coal-seam, and leaving intervening pillars thereof,
has eVer since been going on, by means of this one vertical Pit '!.
    In this Pit, ample power of Engines and Pumps had been
provided, for lifting to the surface (or to the Day-Level or drain,
which naturally discharges the water) all the water which it was
calculated' would' soak through the whole breadth of strata (or
enter by their exposed edges) covering the present Colliery, and
the' two parts of the old or Heaton-Bank Colliery, in the rise of
it : and it fortunately happened, that when the Boards or work
ing Gates first proceeded neaV to the Level Gates of the southern
division of the former Colliery to the W, its vast subterranean
reservoir of water, was quietly and' by degrees discharged into
the new works,' so as not to drown them or over-power rii#
Engines : but the large body of water in' the' norther n division of
the former Colliery still remained> penned> up, atid threatening
sudden destruction to the men, on cutting through the Fault and

    It has already been hinted by a Correspondent, in your 117thV
page, that too few pit's are sunk, in many of the Collieries ih
this' district, to prevent the dangerous accumulation of inflam
                                                     I
mable gas ; and the same conclusion: must, think, occur to every
reader of the above description, and particularly as to the wanti
of an Air-pit (of even more than one perhaps) at the western
extremity of the new Colliery at Heaton, where the depth of the
searn is stated not to exceed 110 yards beneath the surface; and'
through which the unfortunate Men and Boys now lost to So
ciety, might with certainty have escaped !1 I would not be sup-,
posed' to maintain, that this defect of management, in having
trio few vertical1 Pits, is peculiar to the districts of the Tyrie and
the Wear, although it would be wrong to deny that it seems more'
prevalent there as a system, than elsewhere ; because, I have
   * In Ordinary   cases, where the extent of  the works and quantity    of hy-

misinformed), and cause the fresh Air to descend by the Pumping-pit, and
jju out therefrom by the Water-JLevels; and the same- Air, after visiting and

had occasion, to notice and investigate similar defects in the
Colliery management of place's, very distant from these districts,
 and where the lives of the Men have been dreadfully endangered,
by long-extended inclined planes of works and hollows, rising up
into, Grounds, wherein no pits were sunk (even where vast re
servoirs of water in old works were actually undermined), and in
which cases, it is next to impossible to preserve from accidents,
the artificial current of air, which must be so many times tarried
up the slope and down it again, for airings all the different parts
of the works, so that finally this heated and lighter part of the air,
shall descend to the lowest part of the work, in order to enter
the bottom of the deep up-cast Pit, to make its escape: nor is it
possible to prevent the Men being sometimes shut into the upper
works, for a time in hourly dread, of being drowned, and after
wards of being suffocated or starved to death !.
    The objections or difficulties that I have heard stated or seen
with regard to sinking more Pits, have been of three kinds: 1st,
the expense of such extra pits; 2d, the danger of letting down
water from the upper strata or Measures by each of such Pits ;
and 3d, the Occupiers of the Land, either on the score of profit
or pleasure, objecting to the breaking of the surface.
    I propose to say something on each of these heads: and,
    First, as to the expense of sinking Pits, it is usual in most
districts to sink two Pits in the deep of the intended works, the
Engine-pit and its Bye or Drawing-pit ; and by help of them
to drive two parallel Gates up the slope to the extent of the pro
posed works, and there to sink an up-cast or air-pit, which al
ways remaining open (except in extreme cases of deficient draft)
and being sometimes furnished with ladders, provides the sure or
ready means of escape, in case of 'such a catastrophe as has be
fallen several Collieries within my knowledge, besides the recent
and more severe one at Heatpn.
    In such very deep works as those near Shields, it certainly
is of the utmost importance to the profitableness of- the concern,
to save the very serious expense of sinking a Pit, whenever it
can with safety be omitted, and the making of one Pit serve in the
deep, when divided by Boarding, for the preliminary operations
of running out the Level-Gates and the Rise Gates to the Air-
Pit4 to be sunk at the top of the works (unless the old Engine or
drawing Pit there, can be had for such purpose), and afterwards to
serve for the descent of air aud for the Pumping and Drawing of
 Coals, seems allowable : — if I should be told, that the profits of
tliese very deep Collieries, would not pay for such extra Pits, I
should answer, that this can only have arisen, from one or more
of' four things; viz. 1st, these Pits had been opened before their

             The Objection to sinking mere        Pits, olviated.        441
prober time, while extensive parts of the same or other Coal-
seams remained unwrought, in situations where they might be
raised and conveyed at less expense * ; or 2d, the Coal-owners
had stipulated for a higher part or share of their Coals, than
their depth, and not being yet ripe for market, had entitled them;
or 3d, that the Lessees or workers of the Coals, required greater
profits than the nature of the adventure they had entered on,
entitled them: or 4th, that too great a spirit of rivalry and com
petition had existed among the workers of Coals in this deep
district, in lowering the price of their Coals, so as to have sunk
the general profits below their just standard.
    It would be unjust in me, to leave what I have said, subject
to the interpretation, that I have anywhere found the blame of
this niggardliness of sinking Pits, directly or fairly chargeable, in
any case, on the Owners or Lessees of the Coal-works I have
alluded to, because the facts seem rather to have been, that the
 Overseers, to whose skill and practical knowledge entire defe
rence has been paid, as best understanding what was necessary,
and as daily and hourly sharing with their Men the dangers, of
omitting or neglecting any necessary plan or precaution, have
alone made themselves responsible, for the deplored consequences
that have followed : and their Superiors have remained ignorant,
of the dangers and risks that were unnecessarily run in their
works, until apprised of it by the shocking relations, that have
come before the public.
   And respecting these Superiors, I will not suppose that a British
Land or Coal-owner, when properly instructed and advised, on
the system of precautions proper to be pursued in his Coal-
works, would not as highly and indeed more truly value a Coal-
overseer, who should be ready and anxious to prove to him, that
the lives of the Men were never unavoidably risked in the work*
under his care, yet with due regard to ceconomy in all the plans,
pursued, than he would another Overseer, who should pride
himself, on having netted as much or more money from the quan
tity and nature of the Coals wrought, than any of his brother
Overseers, on the same or adjoining Estates, without mention
ef the comparative security in which this was accomplished; 'much
less would they value or retain one, who should evade this in
quiry, or gloss over the cruel facts, by saying, that no greater
   *  I forbear on the present occasion, entering on the unparalleled cir
cumstance, of those vast expurting districts of the Tyne and the Weir,
 being yet unfurnished with any public Canal or Rail-way (where so many of
the latter are wanted) for the conveyance of Coals to the ships or the River
Barges or Keels, and the system of" way leaves" being substituted, where
 by so grievous and direct a tax is levied by private individuals, on the In
 habitants of all the cast and south coast of England, and even of its south
eastern interior.
                                                                        risks

risks were run than usual, and such as* Men iiiptertly could be
got lo run for the ordinary pay, and stfch as' his wages induced
hint to run t.
   Secondly, faith' respect to ihe letting down of Water into the
vfd¥ks, by new Pits, ft must be admitted, that the upper measures
ffe^tfently connect with such ah dxtent of porous surface ex
posed to the rain's,- of to the beds of Rivers or large waters', that
every hew pit sunk, with only the ordinary precautions in its'
walling or lining, Would infallibly increase' the quantify of water
in the Coal-works' beneath, almdst beyond the expense' of En
gines, that could, at the pi'esent selling price of Coals, be em-
ployed td'nVnnp it out : yet on the dt!hef han'd1, the method of
tigtit walling the Pits, in the' water-setting Of Lias Lirhe\ as
has long begh practised in' the vicinity of the Soihers'Ctshirt Coal
Canal, with such perfect success, as to be enabled to extend their
Coal-works, that are perfectly dry, down the stdpfe from' their
Pit bottom, to' vast d'eptn's beneath the' surface, some of them to
near* twice' the depth of any Pit near tlie T yne, I beliievC, might
be as certainly practised in the latter district, whose' upper mea
sures afC not' more charged' with water, than those 'dyer tn<S'd£iep
wdfks in Sdrhefs'et'shif e : and1 even Without this tight-wallittg,
thieve' are numerous instances where the soakag'e' water, in' dan
ger of being let down into' a deep Colliery by hew Pits, might be
otherwise drawn off, by soughs of drains, or          lie prevented enter
ing the measures,         by
                          attention to the bottdfVis    of  the Brooks. and
Rivulet's,  and' the  pfotecting    of   the pdf'ous' tacks'  of strata ffom.
access' of such water, by      a' sufficient covering    of  clay or water'-
tight earth,   by  motif' attentibn'-te' draining the surface, (see ni\r
Derby. Report,        351'), &c.
                    i'.
   The' necessity of either dispehsTng with somc of the' Pits that
would' be proper, of of tight-walling suclij arises in rhahy iii-
statices, froth the pen of water hi' the old works in tlie rise (and
in the range, in' many other' instances') standing in the old Pits
against the porous rocks and strata that are ciit through thereiii,
and which mUstfhe again dirt?; tllrougrl' in" every' new> Pit, charged'
with such constant supply of water, to' be thereby let down into
the deep works, as long as sUcli pens of water in the old works'
are suffered' to reinain, wliidh they ought' no longer to do, as              I"
shall further mentibn presently.
   Thirdly, as to the almost insuperable objection, which Gen
tlemen and' Farmers have, to permitting Colliers to sink ill, or
have access to their' Parks, ILawns Or Fafms, whenever             it   is in
their power    to  prevent    it:   it must  be  admitted,   that  the  spoil
and disfigurement of the surface, which the Collier generally
makes, in a very-short time after his Commencing operations, and
the wide and careless spread which he        is   too apt in time to give,

                                                                             to

to his devastationa of the Land, hare so justly and seriously
alarmed nVay GentTertnen, that they will sooner forego the aldvan-
tage. of working their Coal, than submit to it ; while Several
others whom I know, would on almost tfhy terms buy up the
Coal-Lease that themselves or their Fathers had granted, if this
were in their pbWer : it is not therefore to be wondered at, that
in almost all Coal Leases of modern dates, the exact limits
within which the Collier may at Ms discretion commence and'
pursue his operations from the surfa'ce, are exactly defined, and
beyond' Which limits He must first obtain Leave of the Land
owner, before he" dan sink Pits, make Roads, &c.
    tinder such circumstances, I have known art instance of the
Overseers- going on', to work from a pair of Pits in the deep, great
distances up the slope, under the ancient works in upper Coals,
the' Pife of which were yet open in the Lessees' Park ; and although
Whole gangs' or shifts of Men Were repeatedly and instantly killed
by Fire-damp explosions, the Gentleman or his Land Agents,
were never once applied to by the Overseers, or their employer
the Lessee, who lived at a distance, for* permission to open an
Air-pit to the higher part of the low Coal, which might have*
been done, by only deepening one of the nuiner'Ous pits already
opteA in the Park, with little or no interruption thereto, and
Which' would readily have been granted, and even offered, if              it'
had occurred, or been stated to' the Owner, that such a measure
Was- any-way essential, particularly for saving the lives of Bis
pafi-shibners and tenants.
     If in any instances Gentlemen have refused permissions that
may have been asked'                    by
                                  their Coal Lessees, to enter restricted
grounds, cannot believe, from anything have seen or heard,-
             T                                     I
that such refusals have been attributable to any thing else, than
the want of a' sufficiently clear statement, and representation of
 the case, showing the importance of the indulgence asked, fof
 the security     of the workmen, and that the interest of the parties,
 in cheaper Working their Coals or more readily disposing of them,
 were not the chief          not the only motives for the application, to
                              if
 enlarge     the  powers  of  the Lease.
   It   does not always sufficiently occ,Ur to Coal-Lessees and Over
 seers, that the occupation                  of
                                      the surface ofthe Land, in    apro
 fitable as well as      apleasurable point of view,     not less import
                                                        is
 ant to others, than their own pursuit to themselves, and that
 while  it   is   for their own interest, to avoid' every unnecessary
 damage,       or the  continuance of such beyond the necessity that
 gave    rise to  it,
                    it    also well worth their While to study, and even
                         is
  at some cost, to circumscribe their trespasses, both in extent and
  duration, as much as          practicable, in order that the Occupiers
                                   is

414       The Objections to sinking more Pits, obviated.
and Owner of the Lands may be kept in good humour, and be
disposed to assent readily to every necessary indulgence.
   By a judicious forecast, and contrivance of the underground
works, the Air-pits or additional drawing Pits, may often be made
to fall in the angles or by the sides of Fields instead of the mid
dle thereof, as too commonly happens.          Where it may be re
quisite to open an air-pit in a Gentleman's Park or near his
House, the rubbish as fast as drawn, might be moved to some
near Pit or broken ground, or to a low place, previously bared of
its top soil, to be re-spread on the rubbish as soon as levelled ;
and a ring of plantation made with care, might almost imme
diately -or very soon protect and conceal the mouth of this Pit
from the cattle and the view of the House and grounds, unless a
tall chimney for draught, might prove necessary, (after trying
to do without) , in which case, any architect or ornamental gar
dener of good taste, might easily design such an erection, as
though not costly, might prove ornamental rather than other
wise.
    In ordinary cases, coals sufficient for supplying the Fire-pan,
occasionally necessary in the Air-pit, might be reserved near iis
bottom, and worked and drawn here by two Men, who need re
 quire only a single path, to approach and enter the small ring
 of plantation appropriated to their operations : and in case of
eafety Ladders being provided in such a Pit, the ingress of the
 Colliers to the reserved grounds, by this means, might be pre
vented, by a tall fence and locked Gate within this ring of plan
tation.
    In case of old Coal Hollows standing full of water at the time
of putting down a new foundation, that       it is,
                                                 sinking an Engine-
Pit   more in  the deep,  on the same  Coal,       rarely advisable to
                                                  is
ever let this water clown to the new Engine, but a separate En
gine should be erected on the old level, to continue to lift this
water to its outlet:    and in case of the proper place for such an
upper   Engine,  being  now occupied   bya Park or the near vicinity
of House, &c.
  a               it  frequently would  be practicable, to choose a
situation not far distant, in some gully     by   Road, or behind a
                                                  a
Hill or tall Grove, where a new Engine-Pit might be sunk, and         a
level from its bottom be driven, to meet the old Coal-level at its
nearest point, and thus, without material annoyance to any one,
especiallyif  the Engine fire burn its own Smoke, the old accu
mulations of Water might be gradually all raised, without unne
cessary magnitude of Engines and Pumps, loug before the new
Works could approach the old ones, so as possibly to incur similar
danger, to that of late years pending at Heaton, and as          isstill
doing at many scores of Collieries     in Great Britain, particularly
                                                                where

     Commissioners   of Mineral Drainage,     tWc. recommended.      445
where the old Basset Hollows, or drowned rise-workt, are in dif
ferent Estates from those in which the new foundations have been
put down.
     It has often appeared to me to be improper, that a Coal-owner
having wrought out his Coals to his very boundary line in the
deep, and perhaps beyond it in places, as too commonly happens,
by accident, and left an immense reservoir of water under
ground, which did not originally exist there, resting against the
 Coals of his neighbour in the deep, should be able to insist on
 retaining this in terrorem over such neighbour, for suddenly over
 powering his Engines, unless the same are made much larger
 than necessary, and perhaps of drowning a great part of the Men
 in such deep works!.
     A general Law, appointing Commissioners of Mineral drain
 age and ventilation, on similar principles to those so very long and
 beneficially acted on by the Commissioner s of Sewers, on or near
 the surface, might remedy these hardships, in the ways I have
 suggested above, o» any other more equitable and eligible modes,
 which the professional abilities that they would be enabled to
  call around them might devise and recommend : such Law, to               .
  empower Air-pits to be opened and maintained (at the expense
 of the party wanting them) for the purpose of freeing the dry
 old Coal-hollows in Estates under different owners or tenures, of
  their not less fatal reservoirs of noxious Airs, accumulated in.
  modern times by the acts of the parties, and therefore fit subjects'
  for legal removal, in common with recent ^nuisances of every
  kind, for which our Laws provide the remedy.
      Your Correspondent N, in page 365, very properly hints, that
  the drifting through the up-cast Dike or Fault, in the efforts
  making in the rise of Heaton Colliery, for letting off the water of
  the northern division of Ileaton-Burn Colliery, ought to have
  induced more subsequent caution: — indeed, the cutting through
  this natural barrier, ought not to have been attempted (and per
  haps was not) without first boreing through the Fault -stuff and
  several yards beyond, in the obliquely rising direction in which the
  Coal-hollows lay on the other side ; and this prece-tiiig of the drift,
   by a bore- hole of several yards in length, ought not to have been
   omitted on any account, until the water was thus first tapped
  by the bore-hole, and through which it might safely discharge a
  part at least of the penned waters: it unfortunately, however, ap
   pears, that theOverseer in this case, from insensibility of the danger
   he was running, and inducing to others, neglected this precaution
   ary boring, when most wanted; and even when the Drifters
   pointed out the alarming dripping of water from the joints in the
   bottom of the Coal-seam, which then formed some space of the
   roof of the oblique ascending drift, instead of immediately or
                                                                    dering

t\yo or three necessary for the boring, or at least apprising the
whole of their imminent danger, and stationing persons to give
ingtant alarm for their escape : the operation of boring was not
only put off several hours, but directions seem to have been given
for increasing the danger, in an eminent degree, hi the mean
time, by " squaring up the work," that                     is,
                                                  working out the an
gles of the sides and end of the drift, ready for measuring                       ;    by
the commencement           which operation,
                                     of           seems probable, that

there seeuied no other immediate mode of extinguishing. This

pit at Brora in Sutherland, in the North of Scotland, which hap
 pened last Summer, of which mention is made in an anonymous
 paragraph in p. 314, of your April number, did not happen
through any peculiar property of these Coals, occasioning their
spontaneous combustion, as is there asserted, but happened, not
on the pit-hill, as any one reading this loose and extraordinary
notice might have supposed, but below, in the works, and is said
by my Correspondent, to have been solely occasioned by the neg
lect of preserving proper air-gates therein, as I will mention below ;
by which neglect, inflammable gas was accumulated, although the
same is evolved in very small quantities only, in these works, and
 the accidental firing of this gas, set the gob or waste Coals and               t
 rubbish on fire, that had been improperly left in loose heaps in
 the works j but which was very soon extinguished,                    and the
 works    goon  after resumed, instead      of  the   Fit remaining shut up
 six or seven months after the event, " partly on account of this
peculiar property of the Coal," i. e. of spontaneous deflagration,
 as js there asserted.
     In your xxxixfh volume, p. 337, an account is inserted, of the
horeing which preceded the sinking of the present Pits at Brora;
and in vol. xlii. page 53, it is mentioned, that tlie workings of
 Coals at Inver-Brora (or Mouth of fhe Brora River) commenced
in 1598; it seems rather surprising therefore, to see the con
trary opinion to there being any Coals north of the fay, again
revived in your work, and represented as not proved to be un
founded, until the discovery about two or three years ago !.
    As this is the most. northern Coal-field known in Britain, and
is in the near vicinity of mountains containing Granite, I have
thought that the following account of it may not be unacceptable
to your Readers.         Accounts are preserved in Sir RoberJ Gordon's
history,    which    I saw  at Dunrobin, in 1812, that Coals were first
wrought      on  the   shore  S of the mouth of the Brora River, by
Jane Countess of Sutherland, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth,
in 1598, and where she erected Salt-works*; also that in 1614,
    * It furnishes  a curious proof of the progressive rise of the Sea, of which
J have    had similar proofs on every coast of Britain, that the remaining
walls of this old Salt-house are washed now to a considerable height by the
ordinary Tides, which mostly flow higher than the tops of the fire-phiccs,
which are still visible, on which the sak-pans stood ! and the tops of the
Coal-pit hillocks that were made at this period, are most of them since co
vered by the sta-beach.       On the shore at Mostyn, in Flintshire in North
Wales, the Pits sunk about the year 1640,in which the fire-^lamp explosion'i
happened which are recorded in the Philosophical Transactions, No. 136,
and where the water-wheel and chain pumps were used, that were drawn
in 16fVl,and have been since engraved in Mr. Pennant's" Account of Holy
 well and Whiford," have now long had their topi covered, by idmost every
 Tide  !.
                                                                           John

 448          History of the early working of Coals in Sutherland.
  John the 5th Earl of Sutherland, the son of the above Countess,
  re-opcned these Pits.
     In the early parts of the last century the Earls of Sutherland
. prosecuted the Inver-Brora Coal-works; and tradition     points out
  one of the Pits ,of this period, in Shean Park, ;n which 15 Men
  lost their lives at the same time, by the falling in of the roof of
 the.   Pit.
   About the year 1764, the working of the Inver-Brora Coal
was again resumed, by Mr. John Williams, the since well-known
author cf " The Mineral Kingdom," under a lease from the late
Earl of Sutherland, and at the same time, Messrs. Robertson and
Mackenzie of Portsoy, erected new Salt-works there, under a
lease from the Earl, and Mr. Williams contracted to supply them
with Coals, at a stipulated price per ton. The Coal-seam then
m work, was three feet eight inches thick, in two beds ot a good
quality of Coal, but having between them, an eight-inch black
pyritic dirt bed ; it appears, however, from the information of
Major Hugh Houston, of Clyne House, who when young, assisted
Mr. Williams, and has preserved many papers and documents to
which he kindly allowed me access, that Mr. W's practical
knowledge of collierying was then very scanty, (although in 20
years afterwards he acquired so much knowledge and reputation
in this art,) so much so, as not to discover the mischief, of
cutting down this pyritic dirt among the Coals, which also the
smallness of his Coal-rooms and mode of working, rendered ex
ceedingly broken and small : nor did he discover (as will appear
from his Miri. King. 2d Edit. vol.      p. 32) that this dirt among
                                              ii.
the broken Coals, occasioned the spontaneous firing, of         large      a
heap of these small mixed Coals on the Pit hill at Inner- Biora,

   These defects of management, occasioned Mr. Williams's sale
of coals to fall off, except to the Salt Company (whose pans and
grate-bars were rapidly wasted           by
                                    the use of these foul Coals), and
his affairs to become embarrassed, and being also threatened                     by

                    I              in  my Report on that county, vol.     i.p. 348;

  the Kirk officers, on account of a natural child which was born
  to hivn (who was still living near Brora in 1812), he gave up his
  •Coal-Lease and Works, to the Salt-Company, and in the year
   1 769 removed to East Lothian, where the foundation of his well-
  ileserved fame as a writer on Coal Works was laid, and his work
.compiled.
      Mr, Houston succeeded to the management of Inver-Brora
  Coal-works, for the Salt-Company, merely pursuing the system
, he had seen under Mr. Williams, until January 1776, when Mr.
  William Beaumont, a coal-viewer from Limekilns in Fifeshire,
.
  being employed to examine and report on these Coal-works, he
  first pointed out the defects of management that have been
  mentioned aliove : — in consequence of which, larger rooms were
  adopted in working the coal, and a very careful separation of the
.pyritic dirt-bed was made, as Mr. Beaumont had recommended;
  and thereupon, the Coals proved free from sulphur in the burn
  ing, ov of any other defect, as the very ready sale of several car
  goes of them at Inverness and Aberdeen, when subsequently sent
  there by Mr, Houston (as the produce of a new seam) fully
, proved ; and which         account of the quality of this seam was
  confirmed to me by the Colliers at work at Brora in 1812, who in
  the previous year had opened the Inver-Brora Coal-seam on the
  .Shore, and raised and burnt this Coal for some time in their houses,
  and which, when divested of the middle dirt, proved sweet-burn
  ing, and of good quality.
      The Salt-Company would now have put down a steam-engine,
  and entered on a spirited working of this Coal-seam, of which
. a considerable       space remains yet unwrought; but their Lease
  being   too  near   expiring, and the Tutors of the present Countess
•of Sutherland       being unable in her minority to grant a new one
  of sufficient length, they soon after relinquished the concern al
  together, and the Colliery at Inver-Brora has since lain un
  wrought.
      When the Marquis of Stafford and the Countess of Sutherland
  his Lady, entered on their spirited and general system of im
  provements, on this fine, but hitherto much-neglected County,
  in the hollows of the thick Coal, taking fire after several months, if the
  external air be not sooner excluded, is owing to some distinct bed of dirt
  between the Coats, that might be found and separated, and remove piis
  evil, that occasions the waste of so many Coals.     At Lasalla, Fontaines,
  and other places in the Aubin Coal-fidd in the department of Aveyron in
  France, the same thing happens, see Nicholson's Journal, vol. xxix. p. 352.
  On Cefn-mawr Colliery Pit-hill in Ituabon, in Denbighshire, a large heap
  of mixed dirty Coals, intended for lime-burning, took fire, after the rain of
   a thunder-storm in hot' weather, in 1809; and other instances might be
  quoted, but none I think that would show, that Coals themselves, in any iiv-
  &La nob take fire spontaneously.                    '

    450           Account   of the   new   Coal-lVorh at Brord.
        Mr. William Hughes,     a coal-viewer from Flintshire, fixed on a
     spot, higher   up the  River, where advantage might be taken of it*
     fall, to turn wheels for pumping and drawing the Coals, if found ;
     and which on boreing there, were found, in a new double seam,
     of excellent quality at 79 yards deep, the upper bed being. 3 \ feet,
     and the lower 1 J- foot thick, separated by 2 feet of black clunch,
     and dipping 1 in            to the SE ; several tons of which Coals
     had been raised previous to my examining Brora, and were daily
     burned at Dunrobin Castle, while I was there, and gave great
     satisfaction to every one, from their quality in burning; but I was
     deprived of the advantage of inspecting the seam myself, by tlte
     Pits then standing full of water, until the water-wheels and
     pumps should be finished.         Although the vast beds of Gravel
     and blocks of stone scattered on this coast, and peat-lakes on
     these, rendered the Field very difficult of investigation,       yet it
      appeared   from  my survey, pretty clearly,    I think,  that there  is
     another workable seam of Coals, between that so long worked at
      Inver-Brora, and this Brora seam, and several thin ones below
     this, furnishing altogether a body of Coal, for ages of pretty ex
     tensive workings, or for centuries of supply to this County and
     its vicinity.
         From the sea-shore at Dunrobin Pier, in front of the Castle,
     to Golspie Bridge, and thence to Rhives Farm, there appears
     a very singular conglomerate Limestone Rock, having in some
     places large masses of compact steatite imbedded in          it,and in
     others, imbedding grains of quartz, almost exactly like the mor-
.    tar of an old wall on revising now my notes on this Rock, and
                       ;
     comparing them with my subsequent observations on the Alber-
     bury conglomerate Limestone (which also contains quartz grains)
    I   see so many points of resemblance, as makes me think        it pro
     bable, that both may alike belong to the unconformable yellow
    .Limestone, 9ee page 168, of your present volume, and that these
     very distant Coal-fields of Sutherland and Shropshire, may here
     after prove to be of the same strata   ?;and even, that the micaceous
     red sandstone, imbedding masses of varied conglomerate, in which
     the pieces of reddish Granite are of all sizes, in Sutherland, may
     prove to be over-lieing and unconformable to this Coal series, and
     answer to the upper Red Marl, in which the Charnwood- Forest
     and Malvern-chase Granites, and perhaps those of Devon and
     Cornwall counties also, are imbedded .      ?
         But must hasten to mention a few other particulars of the
             I
     Brora Coal-work, &c. which have been communicated to me by-
     Letters, since returned from Sutherland.

  management of the concern was entrusted to them, until the
  spring of 1814, when it being seen, that they were unequal to the
 task, they were changed for another Overseer and Men, engaged
 in the Coal-field of the Forth and Clyde : it was however soon
 found, that these Men managed, with even still less skill or pro
 priety than their predecessors, " the levels had been lost, no
'air-roads cut, the face of the Coal irregularly carried forwards,
 and the gob thrown against it, and part of it permitted to get on
  fire," &c.
      Whereupon the Marquis sent down Mr. John German, a Coal-
  overseer or Bailiff, from his Staffordshire Collieries, and a gang
  of Men who had been used to work there under him, who are now
  settled at Brora, and are successfully prosecuting the works: the
  level Gates have been cleared and perfected for about 100 yards
  SW and NE, and rail-ways laid in them: air-gates have been
  driven about the same distance up the rise, and two new Pits are
  now sinking; the roof has proved very sound and good, and the
  Coal easily parts from it : no Faults of the least consequence
  have been met with, only a few trifling ones or slips, which de
  range the Coal but a few inches.
      From this Colliery, a Rail-way has been laid by the side of the
  River Brora, to the shipping-place at its mouth, and ere this,
  the shipment to Portsoy, Inverness, Aberdeen, &c. and to nearer
  places on the Coast, has I believe commenced.
      Two Salt-pans had been some time erected, for evaporating the
  sea-water, and two others were erecting, in consequence of the
  success that promised to* attend this manufacture.       A Stafford
  shire brick and tile-maker had settled at Brora, and was success
  fully employed : and plenty of clay, found adapted to the making
  of stone-ware, on trial by Mr. Spode, of Stoke, in the Stafford
  shire Potteries, being discovered, trials were making, to get some
   Scotch Potter to settle at Brora.   In addition to the many pleas
  ing instances of important rural Improvements lately introduced
  in this distant county, which retaining still all the abuses arising
   out of its former feudal state, required new settling, as it were,
   when the Marquis and Lady Stafford and Earl Gower their
   Son, commenced the patriotic exertions, which are detailed in
   the Appendix to Captain Henderson's Agricultural Report, and
   from the inspection of which Improvements, of almost every kind
   known in England, I derived so high a satisfaction while in
    Sutherland ; I have learnt, that a Company had engaged with
   the Marquis, for erecting a Tan-work on a considerable scale at
    Golspie, with an extensive Piggery, and houses for slaughtering
   and curing Pork, and perhaps Beef, for exportation to the ports

   Lxxyii.       Qu eries and Observations relating to the Formation
        of the Superficial Part of the Globe.                  By Robert Bake-
       well*,     Esq.
   In    the .present chapter          I propose to offer some remarks and
   queries respecting          the   formation     of the rocks and strata that
   compose the superficial covering of the globe, and to state the
  inferences which appear to me deductible from the contempla
   tion of existing phenomena.               1 heg, however, to be distinctly
   understood as offering these ohservations to the consideration of
  geologists, without any desire to obtain their assent, further
   than may be warranted hy the evidence of facts, or by rational
 'probability. Whatever may be thought of the queries here pro
   posed, they cannot, I trust, prejudice any candid mind against
  the preceding parts of the volume.                   If philosophers, instead of
  fabricating hypotheses, had proposed their speculations in the
  form of queries, in imitation of Newton (in his Optics, book 3),
  thev would have rendered a more essential service to science. Thus
  relieved from the* labour of defending their own system's, they
  Would have been more free to follow truth wherever the light of
  evidence and induction might lead them.                     Many important dis
  coveries might have been anticipated, which could not be brought
  forward as parts of a system, because the connecting links in the

The power of man to penetrate the earth          is very limited : few
mines "have been sunk to so great a depth as five hundred yards ;
yet by the fractures and dislocations of the strata we are fre
quently enabled to measure their thickness as they rise in suc
cession to the surface over a considerable extent of country.
But the regularity of rise is limited, and the strata are last as we
proceed further or incline in an opposite direction, so that the
greatest aggregate thickness that has been any where examined
does not perhaps exceed eight miles.        The diameter of the earth
is nearly eight thousand miles, to which the depth of surface
that we are acquainted with bears no greater proportion than
the thickness of a wafer to the diameter of a three-feet artificial
globe.            .
     Were we to bear these facts in mind, the fractures, dislocations,
and overturnings of rocks and strata, and even the up-heaving
of the bed of the ocean, phenomena which appear so over-
whelmning to the imagination, sink into comparative insignifi*
cance : instead of being astonished at these changes, we should
be more disposed to admire the stability of nature, in preserving
the incrustation of the globe so perfect amidst the conflict of
tumultuous elements.        There are a few leading facts in geology,
which we may consider as clearly ascertained by existing phe
 nomena.        Among these we may enumerate, 1st, That the pre
sent continents were once covered by water.            2nd, That the
 strata in which organic remains occur, were formed in succession
 over each other.      3d, That every regular stratum was once the
 uppermost part of the globe.         Let us further inquire, whether
 there remain any appearances in nature that may indicate in
what manner these strata were formed, or the source from whence
 the matter of which they are composed was evolved.           The two
 great agents in the decomposition     and  formation  of mineral  sub
 stances, either artificially or in nature, are water and fire : any
 theory which should exclude the agency of either from the for
 mation of the crust of the globe would be manifestly defective.
     The numerous volcanoes scattered over the globe abundantly
 prove the existence of fire in the deep recesses of the earth.
  During a former state of our planet, this internal fire must have
 been more intense than since the records of authentic history.
  This is shown by the remains of mighty volcanic craters, which
  far exceed any that are active at the present time 5 for, the cra
  ters themselves being formed by the eruption of volcanic matter,
  their size bears evidence to the magnitude of their former ope
   rations.
      It is natural to inquire what part these tremendous agents
  have performed in the oeconomy of nature : Are they accidental
  appendages, or essential parts of the terrestrial system ?        The

454:           Queries and Observations relating to
geologists who exclude the agency of fire from the formation of
rocks, seem to forget that the only instances we have of actual
rock formations are volcanic : beds and strata] more than thirty
miles in length, and of considerable breadth and thickness, have
been spread over the surface of the globe in our own times: and
according to Mr. Humboldt, the further back we trace these erup
tions, the greater is the similarity between the currents of lava
and those rocks which are considered by geologists as the most
ancient.     The enormous volcanoes whose craters are many
leagues in extent had doubtless an important office to perform in
nature : and can it be unreasonable to believe that the earth it
self is the great laboratory and storehouse where the materials
that form its surface were prepared, and from whence they were
thrown out upon the surface in an igneous, aqueous, or gaseaus
state, either as melted lava, or in aqueous solution, or in me
chanical admixture with water in the form of mud, or in the
comminuted state of powder or sand ?        Inflammable and more
volatile substances may  have  been  emitted in a gaseous state, and
become concrete on the surface.
   These primeval eruptions, judging from the size of the an
cient craters, may have been sufficient to cover a large portion
of the globe.    Nor can it be deemed improbable that still larger
and more ancient craters have been entirely covered by succeed
ing eruptions.    In proportion as the formation of the surface
advanced, these eruptions might decline, and, when their office
was performed, might finally cease.
   It is not necessary to suppose that these subterranean erup
tions consisted only of lava in a state of fusion.       The largest
active volcanoes at present existing, throw out the different earths
intermixed with water in the form of mud.         Nor should we li
mit the eruptions of earthy matter in solution or suspension to
the known volcanic craters: the vast fissures or rents which in
tersect the different rocks may have served for the passage of
the subterranean matter rising to the surface.      Silex or quartz,
either pure or combined with other earths, constitutes two-thirds
of the crust of the globe ; and the veins which intersect the
lowest granitic and schistose rocks are most frequently filled with
this mineral.    Whether the elementary parts of silex are easily
soluble in water, or fusible by fire, we have yet to learn ; but we
know there are natural processes by which its solution is effected,
and may not the strata of crystalline sandstone have been formed
from these solutions ?     Calcareous or cretaceous matter is also
ejected during aqueous eruptions.      (See page 317.)     The beds
of limestone may have been formed by similar calcareous erup
tions ; and the numerous remains of shell-fish in limestone might
appear to indicate that the calcareous solutions were favourable
                                                                  to

 to the growth of animals whose coverings contain so much cal-           .
 careous matter.       Nor is it necessary to suppose that these
 aqueous eruptions were always sudden, and attended with vio
 lent convulsions ; for, when a passage was once opened, they ,
 may have risen slowly and been diffused in a tranquil state, and
by gradual condensation may have enveloped the most delicate
 animals or vegetables without injuring their external form.            ,
     The long intervals of repose between the great igneous vol
canic eruptions may have allowed time for the growth and decay
 of animals whose remains are found in different strata ; whilst
 the formation of other strata may have taken place, under cir
cumstances incompatible with organic existence : and accordingly
 we find in the rocks most abounding with organic remains, cer
 tain strata in which they never or rarely occur.      The same agent
 which enveloped living animals in mineral matter without in
juring their external form, appears in some instances to have
 immediately arrested the functions of vitality.         Petrjfied fish
 have been discovered in solid rocks in the very attitude of seizing
 and swallowing their prey.       A sudden eruption of a hot fluid
 saturated with the different earths (or the elements of which
 these earths are formed) might destroy in a moment the animals
 previously existing, and form round them a siliceous or cal
 careous incrustation which would protect their remains from
 further destruction.
     Ages of tranquillity might elapse in the interval of different
eruptions, and beds of gravel and breccia be formed by the gra
 dual disintegration of the higher parts of the earth.      These beds
 might be afterwards covered by, or intermixt with, the crystalline
 beds from subsequent eruptions ; and may we not in this manner
 explain the alternation or intermixture of crystalline rocks with
 those of mechanical formation ?       Dislocations of the strata by
 earthquakes and other causes might also take place between the
 periods of different formations, in which case the upper beds
 would rest on the subjacent ones in an unconformable position.
     As the strata which cover each other are often composed of
 very different mineral substances, may we not infer that the suc
cessive ancient eruptions, whether igneous or aqueous, contained
 different elementary parts ?     At the present day, the lavas of
 succeeding eruptions even from the same crater differ both in
 external character and constituent parts.         Hence we may ex
 plain the formation of strata of ironstone and beds of other me
  tallic ores alternating with earthy strata ; and we can have little
 difficulty in the admission, as it is now known that the bases of
  the earthy strata are also metallic.      Two or more mineral sub

of chemical affinity: but it Seems exceedingly difficult to admit,
with the Neptunian geologists, that all the substances which com
pose rocks and strata were coexistent in the same fluid, and that
this fluid after it had deposited Only a small part of its contents
was capable of supporting animal life.                       . .
    The succession   of aqueous and igneous eruptions would ac
count for the alternation of volcanic rocks with others of aquatic
formation.    The occurrence of obsidian and basalt with clay
and sandstone may be parts of the same series of phenomena ;
and thus the two opposing systems of Werner and Hutton may
both be true to a certain extent, and agree with existing facts.
However vast these operations may appear, they sink into insig
nificance, compared with the bulk of our planet itself,          tf a
three-feet globe were to contain within it a fluid eapable of ac
quiring consistence by exposure to the air, and Were this fluid
from time to time to exiide through minute eracks or punctures,
and form over different parts of the surface successive coats of
varnish whose aggregate thickness was less than that of a wafer,
this would be a greater change with respect to the artificial
globe, than the formation of all the rocks and strata with respect
to the earth.    And the numerous dislocations and fractures, by
subsidence or other causes, are nO more in comparison to the.
magnitude of the earth, than the cracks or inequalities of this
superficial varnish would be to a globe of that diameter.
    I have already stated my opinion *, that all the secondary
Strata are local formations originally deposited in detached lakes,'
which have covered part of our present continents when the sea
began to retire ; for the inequalities of the surface must have'
been greater before the deposition of the upper strata had filled up
the lower concavities.     In proportion to the quantity of matter
thrown from the interior of the earth might be the subsidence
of the surface in other parts ; and as the waters retired further
from our present continents, the size of the lakes which then
covered them would be diminished ; but their number would be
increased, and also the number of local, or independent, forma
tions of strata.     Similar causes still continuing to Operate ill'
different situations, might produce general features of agreement
amidst the diversity of rock formations which were taking place.
Now this is precisely what We observe in comparing the succes
sion of rocks in distant countries.       We have no sufficient rea
son to believe that those rocks which are called primitive, are in
reality the original coat' of the nucleus of bur planet, nor that
the similar rocks of distant regions are contemporaneous ; the
great diversity which prevails both in their order of succession
ami composition appears to oppose the theory of. universal for-

ma tiofts, there being no two countries in which the order of sue'-'
cession is found to agree ; and a recent examination, by Ram
mer, of the very district in which the Professor of Freyburg laid    '
down the law of succession for the whole globe, is said to have'
shown that Werner's descriptions do not even agree with the
actual order of succession in which the rocks of that district are
arranged.
    Granite, porphyry, sienite, green-stone, and basalt pass by
such inseijiible gradations into each other, and into rocks known
to he" Volcanic, that the probability of their having a similar
origin can scarcely be denied.       And if the internal fire9 that
have acted successively on the surface of the globe were of vast
exterft, as the remaining craters indicate, they may also in ittl*
rfrerolis infantes have melted or softened pre-existing rocks and
strata, and occasioned the bending and contortions of the strata,
and other phenomena on which the theory of Dr. HiittOH Was
founded.      The defect of that theory consists, 1 conceive, in ex
tending the operation of this cause further than existing ap]}ear-
ances will support.
    Were we to adiiriit that rocks are loeal formations produced
by successive igneous and aqueous eruptions forced through
eraters and fissures of the surface, these, with subsequent eleva--
tjons and subsidences of the surface, might be sufficient to ex
plain all the various r)h(enomena which the position, contortion,
succession, and alternation of rocks and strata present to our
notice.     In some situations granite mountains are covered with
a series of schistose rocks, to which sueceeds the mountain
limestone, and oh this are laid the sandstones of the coal forma
tion. In other instances these sandstones rest immediately on
granite, without the intervention of schistose rocks.      Here then
we may suppose that no eruptions of matter took place between
the formation of the granite and the sandstone ; while in other
situations a succession of formations had produced all the inter
 mediate rocks.    In some countries the eruption of matter Which
formed granite, after ceasing for ages had again taken place, and
 thus sometimes we find granite covering rocks to which it is
most frequently subjacent.      To a like cause may we ascribe the
 occasional appearance of beds similar to the lower rocks alter
 nating with or appearing in the upper strata.     The siliceous and
calcareous solutions in a state of tranquillity might also envelop
 the fragments and sand from" pre-existing rocks, and form the
 various breccias and aggregated sandstones.       Saline and bitu
 minous matter may also have been thrown up in detached lakes,
 and subsequently consolidated, as in the pitch-lake in the Island,
 of Trinidad.    The local formation of beds of trap, alternating
 with other rocks has before been alluded to, and the graduation

458                   Queries and Observations,      &c.
of basalt into clay, or sand, will be consistent with this mode of
formation. Many of the solutions containing terrene matter
might be erupted at a boiling temperature, like the siliceous
water thrown out of the hot springs in Iceland, and on cooling
they might deposit their contents, the matter from each eruption
forming a separate layer or stratum*.
    In some parts of the earth the quantity of matter thrown out
during one eruption may have been sufficiently great to admit
the crystallization of whole groups of mountains.               In other in
stances it may      have  been   so widely diffused as to form very thin
strata.      And here it may be proper to remark, that different
beds and strata are not arranged in nature in the order of their
specific gravity; the lowest are not always the heaviest, neither
are they arranged according to their more perfect crystallization ;
for, though generally the lower rocks are more crystalline than
the upper, we not unfrequently find some of the upper strata
more perfectly crystalline than the subjacent rocks.             Now if the
matter of which the upper and lower rocks are formed had been
•o-existent in the same fluid medium, one or other of the above
affects must have taken place ; but if each stratum were formed
by a separate eruption and deposition, they might vary both in
specific gravity and degrees of crystallization, without any regard
to the order in which they were deposited f.
     In endeavouring to trace the causes of very complicated phe
 nomena, those explanations are to be preferred which apply. to
the greatest number of cases, and are consonant with existing or
 analogous facts.       Now I conceive that the alternation of aqueous
 and igneous eruptions offers a more satisfactory explanation of
the formation of rocks than any that I am acquainted with. At
the same time it assigns an office to the immense craters and
fractures which have once perforated or intersected the globe.
     It is an acknowledged maxim, that Nature, or to speak more
    * To   compare great things with small, there is an analogous formation
 taking place every day in the channels which receive the boiling waters from
 some of the steam-engines in the county of Durham.       This water contains
 a large quantity of earthy matter which is deposited every day, except Sun
 day, in regular layers that may be distinctly counted, with a marked line
 for the interval of repose on Sunday, between each week's formation :
 hence the stone got out of these ohannels has received from the country
 people the name of Sunday stone.
    f By considering each stratum as a local formation, we are relieved from
 the difficulty of accounting for the disappearance of the vast beds of sand
 stone and chalk, with all the upper strata, in countries where they arc not
 found at present. Could we be presented with an accurate delineation of
 the elevations and depressions of the earth's surface, sufficient vestiges of
 its ancient physical geography might still remain to enable u? to trace some
 •f the great basins, or lakes, in which the separate formations of the upper
 strata took place.

carburetted hydrogen, nearly destitute of water.          This mine was
won about     four  years ago,    and  is  carried  on  by the means of
three shafts ; one, called     the  Success   Pit, is  one hundred and
eight fathoms deep.      At five o'clock in the afternoon of the.
2d of the month, a cloud of dust and smoke was seen to issue
from the mouth of this shaft, by which the workmen at bank
were convinced that an explosion had taken place below ground,
and in a few minutes one of the trappers, who was not above
six years of age, cried out to be drawn up ; he was quickly fol
lowed by fourteen men and boys, most of whom were shockingly
scorched, four only having escaped the effect of the inflammable
gas.     But a short time was allowed to elapse before several in
trepid pitmen descended into the mine, where they found the
corpses of fifty-seven of their unfortunate fellow workmen
stretched on the floor; — some of whom appeared to be burned
to death, but the greater number to have been suffocated by the
after -damp, or azotic gas left by the combustion of the hydro

but expired on being brought into the atmospheric air. From
these circumstances it is evident the blast was partial ; for many
of the men had quitted the boards where they had been at work
apparently unhurt, but met their fate on the waggon-way, being
suffocated before they could reach the shaft.           Of the nineteen
horses in the mine, six only were killed ; those in the stables
having survived, for the air-courses were soon restored.            It is

issued from an adjoining waste carelessly holled into in the
course of working, but I believe this point has not as yet been

                           Joseph Skinner, Esq.
                               To   Mr. Tilloch.
     Sir, — JTermit     me to enter  into a brief detail of a contrivance
    I fell on  some years ago to help defective vision.         I reached
    Malta in the summer of 1808, and was not long in experiencing
    the rapid decay of an organ already impaired, through the effect
    of the powerful glare of light reflected there by the white sur
    faces which continually meet the view, the houses and hiclosurcs
    being of stone, and the surface of the island in general rockv,
    with patches of green, chiefly seen from the eminences, inter
    spersed at intervals to cheer the sight. After a lapse of two years
    my vision became so obscured, that I could not recognise an in
   dividual acquaintance at a short distance ; but by looking through
    a fine aperture made in a very thin metallic substance, and held
   close to the eye, I found the surrounding objects so completely
   defined, that I could see them distinctly when looking towards
  ,each extremity of the street in which I dwelt.      This contrivance,
   by   the admission  of  a  small portion only of direct rays, without
   the interposition of any oblique rays of light, allows the object
   to be seen at any degree of proximity, or of distance proportioned
   to its magnitude ; insomuch that when an object, very fine print
   for instance, is brought close to the eye, it is powerfully magni
   fied, agreeably to a well-known law of optics; and being di
   stinctly seen at a remote distance, it follows that an indefinite
  focus is obtained, always relative to the size of the object viewed.
  Whenever I had recourse to this expedient, I constantly found,
  on withdrawing the instrument, that I could distinguish objects
  with more precision than before ; and, as I conceive, for this
  reason, that having been looking for some time through a chas
  tened medium of light, I was better enabled to meet the broad
  glare than I should have been if constantly exposed to its actio;;.
  In the employment of convex spectacles, or magnifiersj the re
  verse happens: the rays of light being then concentrated, the
  surrounding objects, when they are withdrawn, become for a
  time less distinct than before their application.      In this view the
•contrivance of metallic spectacles may be considered as a pre
  server of the sight, independently of the advantages I am about
  to detail.    Since my return to England, Mr. Thomas . Jonas,
  optician, No. 62, Charing Cross, has with great ingenuity con-
•trived a pair of adjusting metallic spectacles, by the means of
•
  which he measures the distance between the pupils, so as to
  adapt the instrument to any individual, and bring the two sights
                                                                     into

    462         On a Contrivance to help defective Vision.
   into one.     On the principle above explained, of the admission,
   through    the  small apertdre, of a portion of direct rays only, the
   peculiar quality of a defect of vision ceases to be of any import
   ance, the contrivance being equally adapted to short-sighted
   persons having a great convexity of the eye, or to those whose
   natural lens has been flattened by time.        The cases which have
   already presented themselve are in full proof of the efficacy of
   the metallic spectacles.       In three instances of mal-conformation
   where    concave   glasses  have  not afforded any relief, they have
   enabled    those   on whom the trials were made to distinguish ob
  jects clearly, thus exercising an organ of the use of which they
   had been hitherto deprived.
        Further trials will, I have no doubt, give a wider scope to their
   application.      As they are calculated to meet any state of defec
   tive vision, where the two eyes, instead of being alike, are, as
   frequently occurs, of an entirely different conformation, they
   may, with their aid, be brought into equal exercise.        In strabis
   mus or squint, where the distortion of the pupil, as generally
   happens, lies chiefly, if not wholly, on one side, the small aper
  ture may on that side be gradually brought in an oblique line,
  towards- the centre,»until the pupil by habit finds its true station,
   by its efforts to gain the light.      There will be a less strain on
  the optic nerve, which is always affected in the case of theta
   distortions ; and it will recover its tone in proportion as the
  pupil takes its right position. It is needless to observe that the
  exercise of vision should be confined to the side on which the
  distortion lies, the other eye being covered by an imperforated
  metallic plate, so as to shut out its view.       Where the distortion
  is on both sides, the remedy is obvious.
       As a substitute for an eye-glass, a single metallic spectacle
  will be found of great utility, wherever the light is strong enough
  to admit of its use.         Without-doors it can be constantly em
  ployed with the best effect ; and has the advantage of durability,
  not being liable to any accident.        It frequently happens that nn
  eye-glass adapted to a particular defect of sight cannot be
  found.                     ,
      The smallness of the field which presents itself in looking
  through the metallic spectacles is an inconvenience which will be
  icmedied by use.         They can only be employed where there is a
  sufficient light ; but this light being chastened in a considerable
  degree, they become preservers wherever a powerful glare is to
  be encountered.        Where the sight has been much impaired by
  time, it may be recommended not to exercise it in a broad light,
  unless through this chastened medium.           The strain on the optic
  nerve will be 'thus avoided.        In southern climes, where there is

             LXXX.       On   Metallic Salts.        By A Correspondent.
                                        To   Mr. Tillock.
        Sir,—        H aving
                          continually observed that metallic solutions
      had an excess of acid; although it appeared contrary to the
     opinion of those whose merited reputation in the chemical
     world is so firmly fixed, I was led to think that this acid was
     essential to the salt; and the few experiments I made on the sub
     ject seem to justify my doubts.
         Sulphate (or rather the super-sulphate) of iron was the first salt
      I examined. It was submitted to a heat sufficient to drive off a
     portion of the acid (as I knew without this process the solution
     was acid) : water being added, the super-sulphate was in solution,
     and some oxide precipitated.        I endeavoured to saturate the
     excess of acid by an alkali ; but before it could be neutralized a
      part of the oxide precipitated, leaving the super-sulphate in so
     lution.    If the acid was not a component part of the salt, it
     might be saturated with a base, provided the salt produced would
     not decompose the metallic solution : — if therefore it was not
     essential, the alkali would saturate            it,
                                               and the whole form a neu
     tral solution; for the dissolved salt     not subject to decomposi
                                                     is
     tion by treating     with an alkali saturated
                             it                                 by
                                                        the corresponding
     acid to  that  which the  metal    dissolved
                                               is  in.
         In the case of mercury, the salts termed the super-sulphate,
     the sulphate, and the sub-sulphate, show acid properties when
'
     dissolved: — then the sulphate and the sub-sulphate in the at
                        if
     tempt at solution are converted into the super-sulphate,          na   it   is
     tural to infer that they are not perfect salts, but peculiar mix
     tures of the super-sulphate with the oxide. — And as the excesa
     of acid in the super-sulphate      held   is       by
                                                 so small an affinity,            it   is
     not more entitled to be called an acid salt than those whose
     bases possess a superior affinity for their acids, and are not like
     this decomposed by water.       Why       mention the combinations
                                                    I

 tities of water for the purpose of freeing them from *ny ex-
.traneeus matter, is in the operations of ehemistry the most im
 perfect ; for a salt, without entire solution, cannot he subject to
 the influence of water on all its parts; and as the washings are
 acid from the commencement of the operation till after the yel
 low precipitate is formed, a neutral salt cannot be produced in
"any part of the process, but the whole of the mercurial salt is
 carried off in the state of a super-sulphate.       If without the aid
 of water we cannot discover     the existence  of acids  (which is ob
 vious in those which are crystallized), any dry substance being
 treated with water, and answering the acid tests, cannot in the
 dry state be considered neutral ; as the properties of aeids de
 pend so much on their combination with water ; and as when
.water is added to the above-mentioned salt (the supposed sul
  phate) it is acid, it must in the dry state be an acid salt with an
  excess of oxide mixed with     it,caused     the evaporation of part
                                               by
  of the acid in the process of drying.        I therefore conclude, in
  the opinion that metallic salts cannot exist in the neutral state  ;
  for as in the bumid way w.e discover acid properties in this class
.of salts, and as acids in die dry -state do not possess acid proper
ties, we must allow the metallic in every state to be super salts.

                            To   Mr.    Tillnck.
 Sir, —In your Philosophical Magazine for May last, gentle   a
man long eminent and respectable as          philosopher in the arts
                                               a
and sciences "has presumed" that the two clocks of mine,
whose rates of going were inserted in your Magazine of last
 March,   " might have been in the same circumstances" as those
 which  he has mentioned.     These kind of circumstances are not
 new to me such or similar observations of two clocks going
              ;
 on in this way} and whose pendulums affected each other, were
.made long ago      by
                    the late ingenious Mr. John Ellicott, and may
 have been made      by
                      others besides him, for aught that     Iknow.
 But these clocks  were   not properly fixed, being on such elastic
boards as thoke which Mr. De Luc mentions,             Ishould have
                                                              thought

thought my time very ill applied in attempting to regulate those
astronomical clocks (with which I have been engaged) to that
degree of nicety to which of late years I have been accustomed,
had they been on such flimsy fixtures as those in question. The
two. clocks, the rate of whose going and keeping so closely to
gether I gave you, were free of every floor, or of any elastic
board whatever, were strongly attached to a firm wall, and every
part connected with the pendulums uncommonly well bound,
particularly in that of their suspensions, so that any extraneous
weight, or any motion on the floor, could not possibly affect them,
nor was it possible that the motion of either pendulum could
have affected that of the other.       It is nevertheless wonderful
how the motion of a pendulum may be affected, even where
every part of the fixture of it is such, that little or no doubt can
remain of its not being strongly fixed ; and yet I have made their
rate alter not a little by afterwards forcibly driving home for a
second time the screws of the fixtures, in order to be certain that
«!1 was firm and secure, when      I well- knew that the first fixing
 was much beyond that of any pendulum which had come under
rr.y notice.  The consequence which followed the. second fixing
 here was quile natural, the arc of vibration being a little in-
 oreased to what it was before.    There is no man in the kingdom
who has paid that attention to the firm fixing of a clock pen
dulum which I have done, and none know better the great ad
vantages of it. The second turret clock which I made about
twenty-eight years ago, had the scapement part of it in a. frame
separate from that of the clock, which together with the pendu
 lum (whose ball a sphere about 70 lbs. weight) were firmly at
tached to the wall of the church, and at a little distance from
 the clock itself * : the advantage gained by this was not ob
 tained but at some expense.       There is -a mistake made in Mr.
 De Luc's paper regarding Harris's pendulum clock being erected
     * Tills clock, after having
                              been brought to mean time, was carefully ob
served  from time to time by means of a sun-dial, which was correctly put
up close by the Observatory at Hawk-hill and by those concerned with the
Observatory, (I not having then the advantage or use of a transit instru
ment,) and did not deviate thirty seconds from mean time during the course
                              I
of eight months. Not that think much of such trials, or the comparing the
going of a clock with a sun-dial, where nice observations are required; yet
allowing the error to be even the double of what the result gave, it cannot
be called great. Seeing the good going of the clock, the person who had
the charge of winding it up was requested to pay particular attention to it,
and by no means to neglect the windmg of it. However, this request was
not strictly complied with, and the clock was one day unfortunately forgot,
and allowed to run down. This circumstance, and others which soon af
terwards supervened, made me in future to bestow less attention to it  than
it otherwise merited. The pendulum-rod of this clock was     a  wooden one,
 1568 inches in length.

omittfed to affix, and which you were so obliging as to supply.

   * In your last number, Mr. Singer asserts that a " Mr. Lightfoot first
suggested   the employment of an inflexible pendulum as a means of con
verting- the reciprocating motion usually produced by the column into a
source of rotary movement; and the correctness of this idea was soon af
 terwards practically verified by me," (whom he chooses to designate by the
appellation of his pupil)
                            " with the assistance of a watch-maker."
    lie also observes, that " the rotary motion obtained by this indirect
means is however rather curious than useful, for it is scarcely so correct an
indication of the power of the column as the simple pendulum, &c." I do
not notice the first remark, for the purpose of claiming either for myself or
for Mr. Gorham the watch-maker any merit in so simple a contrivance,
but to protest against the ambiguous construction of the paragraph, by
which, if he does not mean         he appears desirous of having
                                        it,                          understood,

that either directly or indirectly derived the idea from the suggestion of
    I
Mr. Lightfoot, and thus appears to insinuate plagiarism. Now, even               if
I  thought he did mean to make this insinuation,       would not trouble either

I     notice the second remark, only for the purpose of observing that his
instruction would      this case lead those into error who might be induced
                        in
to avail themselves of the advantages which          derive in using the clock

    that in choosing the term Electrico-galvanic agency, your view
    of  a subject (contaming so many contrary opinions) is founded
    upon a far more extensive knowledge of it than I can pretend
•   to. Mr. De Luc remarks that the instrument is not to be called
    electrico-galvanic, but electric column as he has named
                                                                  " since   it,
    there are no galvanic and only electric effects."     iThe reason of
    my concurrence with him in the use of the terms electric column
    and electric agency       is,
                            because     think his ingenious experiments
                                              I
    and forcible deductions, and their subsequent confirmation bv
    the experiments of Sig. Zamboni and others, go far to prove the
    truth of the proposition which Mr. De Luc here advances. At all
    events, he has started game which may afford good sport           and         ;
    it no doubt will do, so          pursued with the indefatigable ar

    attached, a fine platina wire as a girth round. my cork-ball, and found that
    its indications then agreed with those of the other pendulums and needles;
    but have now procured from my good friend Mr. Teid a ball of silk with a
    very fine platina girth, so light that     weighs but little more than the cork.
                                              it
    I     presume   ithas been shown, that the frequency or quantity of the elec
   tricity of the column at different intervals does not always bear a constant
. ratio to its intensity; and therefore, that any apparatus where a pendulum
    in constant limited oscillation  is   used, cannot measure both these powers.
    Even the frequency with which the leaves of Mr. Bennett's electrometer
    open and strike the sides for a certain number of seconds, does not be
    come a    comparative measure of the power of the column at different times,
.   if  this expression  isused in  a. general sense.
    I     .have a small column to which           attached a large electrometer for
                                                   is
. measuring     by   the divergence of the leaves its intensity, and to which          I
    sometimes attach a smaller electrometer for measuring its frequency by the
•
    striking of the leaves.     This apparatus proves the fact very clearly; for
    sometimes, when the large one indicates a certain intensity, the small one
    by .being applied to the column will strike its sides much more frequently
     than at others, although the divergence of the large one remains the same,
     or has even diminished. Sometimes the intensity and frequency will go on to
    increase together in corresponding ratios to a certain maximum, and then
  . alter. At other times the former will stop, and the latter go on to increase.
/. These phenomena depend,          I  believe, principally upon the variation in the
     hygrometric state of the disks of paper. The influence of moisture to in
     crease the general power ot the column to           a certain extent Mr. De Luc
     first observed. On columns inclosed in glass tubes           of course cannot act
                                                                 it
    so powerfully   ; aid moisture,      being deposited on the glass, may, as Mr.
                                        by
     Honldv has shown, diminish its power by injuring the insulation. But, by
     subjectini;

     usual hygrometric state of the air, the state of insulation has little or no
     sharein   the above phenomena.

                            ROYAL SOCIETY.
      June 1.   The    conclusion of Mr. Donovan's paper on the
  berries of the mountain ash or roan-tree, the Sorbus aucuparia
  of Linneus, was read. In the series of ingenious experiments
  devised by the author, on apples, pears, crabs, and roanberries,
  he discovered the existence of a new and peculiar acid in the
  latter, which he calls sorbic acid. The roanberries, although an
  object of vulgar superstition in all the northern countries of
  Europe, in which they have been deemed an antidote against
  witchcraft, and of a very peculiar taste, have never been sub
  mitted to any chemical analysis, since Scheele discovered in
  them and other vegetables the existence of malic and citric
  acids.    Some experiments have indeed been made on malic acid
  by Vauquelin and Proust, but our knowledge of this and many
  other vegetable acids is still very imperfect.          The researches
  and discoveries of Mr. Donovan will doubtless attract the at
  tention of chemists to these substances.       In preparing the sorbie
  acid Mr. D. pursued the method of Scheele as improved by
  Vauquelin; he expressed the juice of the ripe berries, boiled it
  saturated with carbonate of potash, and added acetate of lead,
  which was precipitated in the state of a compound salt contain
  ing malat of lead* the latter was again precipitated, and the
  sorbic acid obtained pure.      The author related a great number
  of experiments on roanberries and apples, to ascertain the rela
  tive quantities of acid which they contain : he found that the
  sorbus berries yield nearly one-half their weight of juice, con
  sisting of sorbic and malic ac;ds, the former of which was much
  more abundant, — but that apples contain a very small proportion
  of sorbic acid, and that plums, pears, &c. have none.          The dif
  ference between the salts    formed  by  these  acids is very striking ;
  the sorbats of potash, soda or ammonia are crystallized salts, so
  luble in water but not in alcohol ; the malats, on the contrary,
  are not crystallizable, are deliquescent, and slightly soluble in al
  cohol.     Mr. D. also tried several experiments on other sub~
  stances, and found that there is no sorbat of alumina: this fact
  will facilitate the complex analysis of many minerals containing
  alumina,     which have hitherto occasioned the appearances of
  some anomalies which do not exist in nature.          The author then
  proceeded to offer some original conjectures on the composition
  of vegetables in general, and what has been called the bitter
'
  principle in particular : the substance which communicates a
  bitter sensation he considers as the matrix or radical of the malic
  and sorbic" acids.     He seemed to think that these acids may

 rather be chemical products than educts.               The artificial ex
istence of tannin favours. his conjectures, which he proposed,
 however, with great diffidence, as things yet to be investigated.
     A short paper by Sir Everard Home, Bart. V.P.R.S. was read,
 detailing some observations on the organs of respiration in lam
 preys and other analogous genera of fishes.
     June 8. A mathematical paper by Mr. Babage was laid be
 fore the Society, On the Calculus of Functions ; but its contents
 were of a nature not to be read.
     Dr. Herschel furnished a long and very elaborate paper on
 the satellites of the Georgian planet. The Doctor has ascertained
 the existence and general laws of seven different satellites to this
 remote body ; but he acknowledges that their extreme distance*
 and the numerous difficulties which arise in observing them,
 render him very cautious in determining any thing dogmatically
on the subject.         The introduction to the paper contained some
interesting observations on telescopes in general, and the means
best adapted to observe such distant objects.           The structurev^rid
management        of  telescopes being     the author's most  familiar de
partment, his directions are the more valuable.           He observes that
no glass under 20 feet is fit for viewing the satellites of the Geor
gian planet; that his principal observations have been made
 with one 25 feet; but that his great 40-feet telescope re
quiring so many persons to manage           it,   and being incapable of
acting   at  all times    with   sufficient rapidity, when the light and
atmosphere suit, he has very rarely succeeded in using            it   when
viewing these satellites.          He next speaks of the, necessity of
having sufficient light on the reflecting mirrors, which cannot
always be obtained, and many other difficulties which impede
the progress of our knowledge of these heavenly bodies.             Lastly,
he related his observations on the different satellites which he has
already noticed around the planet in question, and stated the
probability that some more might still be discovered as our            in
struments improve.
  A    short letter from Dr. Brewster to the President was read,
stating some further experiments on the multiplying powers of
Iceland spar. These powers he found to depend on the surfaces
of the spar, and he can now imitate them at pleasurev
    June 15.   A      paper on the lamprey and echineis,        by   Sir E.
Home, was read. The author considered these genera as herma
phrodites, and forming    a     link between fishes and vermes. Sir E.
stated the appearances on dissection, and also his observations
on the living animals, which justified him in his conclusions.
  A    curious paper    by    A. Carlisle, Esq. was read, on vascular
and extravascular parts of organized bodies.             He described the
process   of the   formation   of shells, particularly those of snails and
                                                                    fishes

 &c.    One experiment was on iron. He and Mr. Pepys took a
 piece of soft iron, made a cavity in it to hold some diamond
 powder, and then submitted it to the action of the Galvanic bat
 tery ; when the iron was instantly converted into blister steel,
 and the diamond entirely disappeared.        This experiment, the
author concluded, was quite satisfactory to prove that the dia
 mond contains nothing but pure carbon,       i
    The title of a paper by Mr. Lee, On the dispersive Power of

                         ROYAL INSTITUTION.
    Professor Rrande in his fifteenth and concluding lecture pre
sented his audience with a succinct account of the origin and
progress of electro-chemical science, and dwelt particularly upon
the brilliant and important discoveries and researches of his pre
decessor, Sir H. Davy.
    The application of electricity to chemistry seems to have ori
ginated with Beccaria and Canton, and to have been brought
into more general notice by the experiments of Dr. Priestley, and
the refined and masterly researches of Mr. Cavendish ; but no
thing very important was achieved in this branch of experimental
                                                               '
philosophy previously to the discovery of the Voltaic pile.      In the
earliest experiments with tlis instrument some of its leading
chemical powers were developed, especially its decomposing
energies in regard to water and saline solutions : it was also ob
served that the electrization of distilled water was attended with
the extrication of acid and alkaline matter, a phenomenon in
explanation of which a variety of crude and unsatisfactory hypo
theses were indulged in: it was conceived that pure water was
capable of producing acids and alkalies, by uniting with positive
and negative electricity ; that these bodies passed from the bat
tery through the conducting wires into the water; and that there
resulted -from the decomposition" of the aqueous elements, oxy
gen and hydrogen. The amusement of hypothesis being thus pre
ferred to the drudgery of experiment, the advances towards truth
were slow and imperfect, and philosophers seemed rather in
clined to talk and reason upon the remarkable and new pheno
                                                                 mena,

mena, than to endeavour to remove the veil of mystery in which
they were enveloped, by the toilsome but sure method of ex
perimental research, —a task happily reserved for, and ably per
formed by, Sir H. Davy.          Mr. Brande illustrated these investi
gations by   a series   of  experiments with the large Voltaic appa
ratus employed in his former lecture, and, having summed up the
leading conclusions, enumerated the discoveries of which they
had been productive.         It was proved that the acid and alkaline
matter was derived from the presence of foreign bodies ; that the
elements of water and of the atmosphere had given rise to nitric
acid and ammonia ; and that, every extraneous body being care
fully excluded, water was resolved by the electrical energy into
oxygen and hydrogen only.            Having taken a cursory view of
electro-chemical      theory in general, and having reminded his
hearers of the discovery of the nature of alkaline and earthy
bodies, — a discovery resulting entirely from these researches, — the
Professor concluded his lecture with some general observations
 concerning the nature of electricity, illustrated by several new
 and interesting experiments: he combated the idea of its being
a peculiar fluid, and of its phenomena resulting from the pre
sence of any distinct subtance or form of matter : it might be so,
hut we must not say it is so, till it be proved.

   In addition to the steam-boat now plying between London
and Gravesend, a very fine vessel of this description has recently
commenced sailing between London and Margate.            She is named
the Thames, was built at Port Glasgow from the plans furnished
by Mr. Robertson Buchanan, engineer, and is the same vessel
the drawings of which, vtdth a description by Mr. Buchanan,
were given in a preceding number of the Philosophical Magazine.
The Thames previous to her arrival in the river had been navi
gated from theClyde to Ireland across the Irish channel, by the
Land's End, and round to Portsmouth and the Downs, a voyage
of 1500 miles, in perfect safety.
