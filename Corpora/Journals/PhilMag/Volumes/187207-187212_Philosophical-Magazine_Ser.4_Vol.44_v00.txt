IT future
    is an opinion which is daily gaining
          time, perhaps not far distant,
                                                                         ground that at some

sciences will  brought under few general laws and princi
                        be                            a
ples.  However wide and diversified physical phenomena may
seem      first sight, and however great and radical the apparent
          at
distinction between the several sciences, yet          the eye    the          to            of
thoughtful physicist, who sees deeper into the subject, they
begin      appear
            to        but the varied modifications
                             as                           few common            of  a
principles.     For example,  Heat,  Electricity, and  Magnetism  are
in  their ordinary phenomena very unlike each other; yet modern
investigation    has shown that they are mutually convertible.
Heat can        converted into Electricity, and Electricity into Mag

tricity into Heat.       This indicates that these corresponding
sciences are not radically distinct, that their phenomena have                                           a
common origin, that                  in

2        Mr. J. Croll             on What determines Molecular Motion                              ?—
our conceptions by finding one of a higher order—and so on, ever
trying to reach the highest unity, the most general conception
possible.
   The point, however, which more immediately claims our spe
cial attention at present is this:—As the physical sciences pro
ceed in their generalization, they advance more and more towards
Molecular Physics. We may illustrate our meaning by examples
without number from any of the sciences.        In Electricity, for
example,      the  all
                  ordinary  questions—such      how   Leyden jar               as         a
becomes charged,       how the electricities are supposed
                                    or                                                                  to       be
decomposed               on
                   conductor, a    what uneans one body charged
                                                            or    by
positively will act upon another body charged negatively—were
formerly considered                             be
                            answered quite satisfactorily without
                                        to
making any reference whatever
                                                                                                        to of
                                   the molecular condition    the to
bodies under the electric influence.   But when we come                                                         in
quire more deeply into what           meant     induction—what that

peculiar condition      which constitutes the charged jar, and the
                                    is
nature     that hidden change which takes place
              of                                          the conductor              on
while what we call                      its
                          electricities are being decomposed,—we
begin     find that we are entering upon deep and difficult ques

                              the electrified body.     Electricity was

    To determine (1) the constitution of the ultimate atoms and
molecules of matter, what they really are, and (2) their beha

themselves for solution; but neither               them,                 of

the grand and fundamental problem.

refer      the second, which,         consequence  in     its more immediate       of
               the ultimate question
               to                             scientific inquiry,
                                                                of                                         is

more    importance    than the first.
    The second problem, we have seen, refers not                 the nature                      to                      of
the molecule, but               to
                               motions.its  Now        regard          physical

motion may be, there are               the very outset two fundamental
                                                   at
questions which suggest themselves:–(1) What produces the
change—causes motion              (2) What determines
                                             ?                   directs it?                     or
   In   regard     the first question, there
                      to                                 diversity     opinion.   no                       of

All   agree  that what    produces     change       causes motion         Force.                             is
The second question, however, viz. what determines                  directs the                       or
motion,                                       This question        not only the
                       of so
              not
               is      easily answered.                                                           is
more difficult       the two, but also                           is by
                                                far the more important.
    All physicists agree that what              called Physical Law          just                                   is

motion, but what produces the particular kind of motion ?        It
is not what gives existence to the motion, but what determines
its  direction    This ?evident, because the particular phenome
                                        is
non, regarding which our inquiries are concerned, does not                                                              di

 force which produces one phenomenon would probably produce
 any other phenomenon, were determination         the proper direc
 tion   given           to    it.     It
                           the determination is   the force which                      of in

are therefore led    the following proposition,
                                   to                                                       viz.:-
   (1) The Production                        of
                          Motion and the Determination                                                       of   Motion
are absolutely and essentially different.
   The radical and essential distinction between motion and the
determination         motion could not possibly have escaped the
                              of
observation       physicists;
                         of     but the important bearing that this
distinction has       physical inquiry has certainly been overlooked.
                                 on
       physics
      In                      we
                     have been accustomed        attribute every thing        to
to force; force,       least, has always been regarded
                                 at                          the all-im                            as
portant element.        This, however,      mistake; for,       we shall
                                                                    is

see, far more depends upon the determination           force than upon                      of
 itseacistence, and therefore, unless force     determined     force, the be                             by
most  important    element     physical       in

the Determination of the motion.   It must be evident to every
one who will consider the matter that these two things are
radically distinct. And they are not only radically distinct,
but must be separately accounted for. To account for the
mere existence of motion, does not account for   happening                                  its                               in

an act, we account for it by means of a something which requires
itself to be accounted for in a similar manner.      To make the
matter still more plain, suppose that an effort or exertion A of
force has been produced.      It has not only been produced, but it
has been   produced  at a particular time and in a particular place,
and in reference to some particular thing; that is to say, the
effort not only got existence, but a particular determined exist
ence.    There are, therefore, two things which require to be ac
counted for:—(1) the mere exertion of the force—its simple pro
duction; and (2) why this particular effort A was made instead
of B, or C, or any other possible effort, and why it happened at
this particular time and place rather than at some other.   That
is,                                                        its

nation.  Now what we are inquiring after          present,    not what          A, at
produced this effort    exertion    orpower                of

ertion of force.  Hence, be the cause of the determination what
ever it may, it cannot possibly be an act or exertion of force.
   In a similar manner we can prove that motion cannot be de
termined by motion. Motion will produce motion, but motion
cannot determine motion. A ball A in motion will produce
motion in a ball B, but the motion of the ball A will not deter
mine the motion of the ball B, either in regard to direction or to
the times of               its
                   happening. The particular direction taken                                                                   by

find that it is produced by no such cause. The mere motion of
the planet is indeed due to these forces; but the path taken by
the moving planet cannot be referred to forces at all. The cir
cular path of the planet is not the result of forces, but of the way
in which the forces are applied. The planet moves in virtue of
centrifugal and centripetal force; but it moves in a circular path
because these two forces are so adjusted to each other that the
one tends continually to pull the planet in a straight line towards
a point called the centre of the orbit, while the other tends con
tinually to make it move at right angles to that line. But it
may be replied that this particular adjustment of the two forces
can be referred to a force; for, according to the nebular hypo
thesis, the motion of the planets in their orbits results as a con
sequence from the condensation by gravitation of the nebulous
matter out of which the system was formed.                 It is no doubt in
all   probability true that the entire energy              planetary motionof

10        Mr.   J.   Croll         on   What         determines           Molecular Motion             ?—
something which determined or directed the action                                                of the forces
concerned in its existence.
   The vague and indefinite idea that the arrangement of the
molecules of matter into crystalline and organic forms is due to
the action of forces, appears to be implied in such terms in com
mon use as “structural forces,” “formative forces,” “crystal
building force,” &c. It is supposed that if our mental powers
were enlarged or strengthened so that we could perceive every
thing connected with the forces operating in nature, we should
then be able to explain the process by which the organic forms
of nature are built up. This, however, is evidently a mistake.
Though our acquaintance with the forces of nature were abso
lutely perfect, the question as to how particles or molecules ar
range themselves into organic forms would probably still remain
as deep a mystery as ever, unless we knew something more than
force.
   The mystery is not what are the forces which move the par
ticles, but what is it that guides and directs the action of the
forces so that they move each particle in the particular manner
and direction required.      Force gives motion to the particles;
but we are not concerned about the cause of the motion, but
about what directs that motion. It is replied that motion can
not possibly take place without       being    some particular di
                                                               its            in
rection. But this does not prove that the two things are the
same.        only proves that they are inseparably connected.
               It
Neither does     prove that the same thing which
                         it                           assigned                              is                 as

cause for the one will serve as cause for the other.   aTwo effects
may       inseparably conjoined and yet result from different
          be
causes.    But the two effects under our consideration are not                                                 in
separably connected.           true that It molecule cannot move
                                                 is                       a
without  moving      some  particular
                              in      direction; and thus far the
two effects are inseparable; but molecule may move without    a
moving      the proper direction.
               in                  These molecular forces cannot
act without acting       some particular way; but they may act
                                    in
without acting      the proper way.
                              in       Now what       that deter                         is   it

a force  gives motion to the molecule; but out of the infinite
number of possible directions in which the molecule may be
moved the force moves it in the right direction. What is that
something which thus guides the force? The force guides itself,

or guide itself? What is the nature of that something in virtue

foreign to our present purpose to enter into the consideration of
this distinction in relation to mental phenomena.     This I have
done at considerable   length in a work on the fundamental prin
ciples of Theism, published several years ago", to which I beg
to refer any who may be interested in this aspect of the subject.
   What is the causet of determination ? What is that some
thing which determines the energies of the universe and guides
the motion of the material particles? That this is the all-impor
tant question, whether as regards life-theories, theism, or evolu
tion, will be still more obvious after considering the next and
third proposition to which we are led, viz.:-
  (3) All the Energies and Forces of nature are probably                                         the same,
and differ only in regard to their modes of operation.
   This proposition follows as a consequence from the principle
of the Conservation of Energy, viz. that the sum total of the
energies in nature remains    constant, the amount neither being
increased nor diminished.                  -
   Suppose now that two substances (say, oxygen and hy
drogen) combine chemically.      Heat is evolved as a consequence.
The energy in the form of heat is derived from the energy in the
form of chemical combination. The energy which disappears
in chemical combination reappears as heat. We have first
chemical energy and then heat; not first annihilation of che
mical energy and then creation of heat. The energy which now
appears as heat is the self-same energy which previously existed
as chemical energy.    The energy has only changed          form, and                its
 nothing more.
   Suppose the heat            applied to     be
                                           move              to

perform mechanical work. What appears             mechanical energy        as
 (mechanical motion)  disappears      heat;   and the energy stored
                                                        as
is uppotentially         as
                  work performed, say,       the raising      weight,
                                                                                         as of

    the self-same energy which previously existed            chemical
 energy and then     heat.    The same holds true whatever may
                              as
 be the number of the transformations. Chemical combination
 will produce    electric current; the electric current will pro
                        an
 duce magnetism; and the magnetism will produce motion                                                 in   a
 machine; and the machine will generate heat           perform work.            or

Here we have the energy assuming in succession five or six differ
ent forms. While the particles are combining we call the
energy chemical; when the electric current is produced we de
signate the energy electrical; when magnetism is produced we
designate it magnetic; and when the machine is in motion we
call it mechanical, and so forth.        It is the same energy under
all   these various forms. The only difference between che
mical, electric, magnetic, and heat energy              merely

are the same; only they act differently.     But if this be what is
meant, then assuredly every force in nature is either chemical or
physical. But this would be using the terms chemical and
physical energies in a peculiar and unusual sense.
   We are accustomed to name forces and energies according to
their mode of operation.       Oxygen and hydrogen unite under
the force of their affinities;  and we designate the energy of the
combining substances “chemical energy.” After combination
the energy assumes another form; and we call it “heat.”                   The
heat is applied to the thermo-electric           pile and becomes trans
formed; and we call the energy under the new form by the name
“electricity” or “electric current.” The electricity is applied
to the electromagnetic machine; and the energy assumes another
form, to which the name “magnetism” is applied.                   The mag
netism   propels   a machine and      performs     mechanical    work;     and
we then call the energy “mechanical energy.”                 These various
names are applied to the various modes of operation of the self
same energy.        Chemical energy, for example, in the case under
consideration, differs from heat only in the mode of              operation.         its
    We have also been accustomed              group    heat,

city, magnetism, gravity, cohesion, &c., under one class,               which               to
 we apply the general term physical,          physical energy,

distinction       chemical energy.
                  to                     We thus distinguish chemical
energy from            all
                     the other   forms,   because we conceive                               it       to   be
concerned with the combinations and motions of the atoms or
elements     ofsubstances, whereas the other class deals with the
molecules and masses of matter.
    Now when the advocates            the physical theory

We see, in endless complexity, beauty, and simplicity, the most
perfect adaptation of means to ends.                  The advocates of the
physical theory are at least bound to show how it is probable
that this exquisite arrangement and unity of plan could have
been produced by means of chemical and physical agencies.

20     Mr.      J.      Croll on What                 determines              Molecular Motion                 ?—
is not an object in nature that does not stand in the relation
ship of a means to something as an end. And there exists a unity
in the ends as well as in the forms. All molecular motions must
consequently have this double relationship of plan and purpose.

22    Mr.    J. Croll      on        What      determines       Molecular Motion               ?—
physical emergies?                  What is it that directs the operation of those
energies.
   But in ascertaining whether chemistry and physics can explain
the mystery of nature, the point we have to consider is whether
or not there is any thing in the known modes of operation of
physical and chemical energies which can in any way account
for the determination of molecular motion. If the advocates of
the physical theory can show that the modes of operation of those
energies do explain the determinations of molecular movement,
then their theory is established, and the ulterior question as to
what is the cause of those modes of operation will be worthy
 of consideration, for it will then in reality be the grand pro
blem of nature.     But if the modes of operation of physical and
chemical  agencies  do not account for the determination of mole
 cular motion, the physical theory must be abandoned, and the
 solution of the mystery of life and nature must be sought for
somewhere else than in chemistry and physics.
   Enormous advance has been made in molecular physics and
in the science of energy of late years.      But it has not thrown
much additional light on the cause of the determination of
molecular motion, the reason being that the discoveries relate
more to the quantitative relationships of energy than to the
modes of       its
                 operation.        has been found that the total
                                               It
quantity    ofenergy remains constant, that whatever disappears

whatever may           form,

of the motion of the molecules.          We may in thought conceive
heat to be a cause of the motion of the molecules; but we can
not conceive any adaptation in the mode of operation of heat that
can explain the determination or direction given to the molecules.
Whatever may be the nature of that molecular motion called
Heat, we have simply a repetition of the same mode of motion;
and there is consequently nothing in it to account for the endless
diversity of molecular motion which exists in organic nature.
Heat, instead of tending to build up complex organic structures,
tends, on the contrary, to produce the opposite result. The ten
dency of heat is to produce homogeneity—to reduce                  bodies                                  all
 toone molecular condition.       Its direct  tendency       not    build                       is           to
up, but         to
             tear asunder and break down.              short, Heat tends           In
to produce dissolution, not evolution.

24     Mr.       J.   Croll on What determines Molecular Motion ?
   Molecular physics has made great advance of late years; but it
has not made much advance in that particular direction which
can be of service in explaining how molecular motion in organic
nature is determined.    It is thought, however, by the advocates
of the physical school that although at present we are unable to
explain how organic nature can be built up by the play of the
ordinary chemical and physical forces, yet at some future day,
when we shall have come to know far more of molecular physics
than we do at present, then we may be able to explain the mys
tery. This is the cherished hope of modern Evolutionists, and
of the advocates of the physical theory of life. But it is a mental
delusion, a dream which will never be realized.    A little consi
deration might satisfy any one that Chemistry and Physics will
never explain the mystery of nature.
  The terms Light, Heat, Electricity, Magnetism, &c. are different
names which we apply to different modes of molecular motion;
and it is true that at present little is known regarding the
nature of these modes of motion; but notwithstanding this we
have reason to conclude that, although we knew               that abso                  all
lutely can      known regarding them, yet

disks. The spirals have an internal diameter of 4 inches and
an external diameter of 10 inches; and each contains 49 feet of
wire in 26 turns. The four terminals of the spirals are con
necting-screws, two of which serve to join the spirals so that a

are so placed that a line joining their centres will pass through
the centre of the magnetic needle.

tralized any exterior disturbance which may tend to deflect the
needle from the magnetic meridian.
   The needle may be also rendered astatic in the usual way by
suspending it by a silk fibre, and attaching to this needle a wire
which passes through a hole in the condeuser and in the inclined
mirror and carries beneath the latter another needle with poles
reversed.
   In working with thermal currents we use a smaller needle
and condenser, which allows the spirals to approach nearer; but
for thermal currents it is better to wind close round the needle
a flat coil only one wire in breadth, and to use a suspended
astatic system, of which the lower needle is the stronger and is
under the control of the damping-magnets*.         The breadth of
the coil used in this last device need not exceed ºo of an inch;

was carried off by the river Auche. The pipe was formed of
planks of poplar nailed lengthwise on wooden frames; their
joints were carefully made water-tight; and when the pipe was
fixed, the space between it and the channel of the stream was
filled with earth rammed down. As the water was entirely to
fill the pipe, it was necessary that each end should be under
 water. A bar was for this purpose provided across the stream
 at the upper end of the pipe, so as to keep the level of the water
 above the mouth, and a dam was made across the stream 20
 metres below the lower end of the pipe, high enough to keep
 the water also above the level of that end. The upper edge of
 this dam could be raised at will, so as to keep the lower end of
 the pipe (by which the efflux took place) immersed to any re
 quired depth.     It was by varying the height of this dam that
 the  quantity of water which flowed through the pipe in a given
 time was made to vary.       The end of the pipe by which the
 water entered it was 129 metres from the point where it was
 received from the canal into the open channel.     Having flowed
  129 metres   freely  along the open  channel of  greater   section
than the pipe, it could not but have acquired a greater amount
of vis viva than that with which the water ultimately flowed from
the pipe.
   Since      h is       the effective head of water,               where h is the           ver
 tical   hºt of the     top over the bottom of the pipe, and the
 effective height is increased by the barrage which brings the
 level of the water where it enters the pipe above the top of                               it,   it
 follows that       ydiminished

the late M. Darcy appear to me, as regards scientific precision,
the admirable design of the instruments used in them, and the
admirable industry with which they were carried on, among the
greatest scientific labours of our age. I could not have arrived
at my results without them ; but these are not founded upon
them, but on the principles of mechanical philosophy. They
have served me rather as the scaffolding on which my structure
has been raised than as the foundation; the scaffolding being
withdrawn, the structure stands by itself.

this additional element of variation in beats is thus recognized,
dissonance is      still, as in the earlier editions, represented as due
to alternations of intensity only.               The following paper is an
attempt to show that the pitch-variations are important consti
tuents of dissonance, and ought, in a complete view of the sub
ject, to be taken into account.
     I am not aware whether M. Guéroult originated the observa
 tion the result of which he laid before Professor Helmholtz, but
 may remark that in a paper read before the Cambridge Philo
 sophical Society in 1857, by the late Professor De Morgan *, the
 existence of alternations of pitch in beats is distinctly asserted
 as a known fact which he had himself experimentally verified.
     It will be convenient to begin by laying down theoretically
 the conditions under which pitch-variation occurs, as the results
thus to be obtained facilitate the experimental examination of
the phenomenon.
    Let two simple         tones of different intensities, but of nearly
the same     pitch,    coexist.     An assigned molecule of air will be si
 multaneously       solicited by two sets of sound-waves.             Each of
 these may be represented by a curve of sines, the times elapsed
 from a given epoch being denoted by distances measured along
 the axis of abscissae, and the contemporary displacements of the
 molecule by corresponding ordinates.              The problem to be solved
 is the composition of the two series of vibrations. Two cases
 must be distinguished, according as the higher or lower of the
 two tones is the more powerful.             We begin with the first of these.
     The waves acting on the molecule may have any degree of
  difference of phase.        The two extreme cases, where they are in
 complete accordance and in complete opposition, are represented
  in figs. 1 and 2 respectively.          The strong line in each is half a
 wave   of the resultant curve.         O is the origin at the undisturbed

those of the primary tones.      Hence, when the two sets of waves

tone therefore a   maximum,   its pitch will    between the two pri

the moments when it is loudest and
weakest  respectively. In order to as
certain what happens at intermediate
points of time, we have only to deter
mine the resultant curve for a suffi

done in fig. 5, which is constructed
for the interval of a semitone (16:15),
and represents completely the state of
things from a maximum of intensity
to the adjacent minimum. The higher
tone is taken as the louder of the two.
  The wave-lengths here gradually di
minish as we advance from the maxi
mum to the minimum of intensity ;
and, accordingly, the pitch of the va

through every gradation which sepa

the first order with the lower of the two fork-tones. The former
sound is much weaker than the latter; the variations of inten
sity cannot, therefore, be considerable, though the sourness of

two simple tones forming the interval of an imperfect fifth, where
the dissonance arises between combination-tones of the first and

    Suppose the chucks disconnected and the chuck-table Y fixed;
then by placing Q on a determinate point of Y, we thereby place
P in the position to trace out (on the moving chuck-table X) a
curve of determinate form. For instance, the bicyclic chuck X
being adjusted in any given manner, it is easy to draw on the
fixed chuck-table Y a locus which is such that, Q being placed
at any point thereof, the curve traced out by P shall be cuspidal
 (the locus in question                is,           position only, the

him up to easy problems producing simple equations.           For instance,
such a question as the following occurs very early in the book:—
“A and B began to play with equal sums; A won 30 shillings; and
then 7 times A's money was equal to 13 times B's : what had each
at first " But before letting the learner try such questions, he is
set a number of exercises like the following:—If a stand for a num
ber of shillings, and if A has 13 shillings and B has 21 shillings,
(1) what will A have after spending r shillings? (2) What will B
have if he receive twice as many shillings as A has spent? (3) If A
receives a shillings from B, how many will each have            and so on.
On the whole the book seems very well done; and the large number
of examples which it contains will doubtless make it useful to
learners, who are at first mainly concerned to acquire a sort of me
chanical ease in manipulating algebraical expressions.
A    Treatise on Attractions, Laplace's Functions, and the Figure of the
    Earth.    By John H. PRATT, M.A., F.R.S., Archdeacon of Cal
    cutta.   Fourth edition. London and New York: Macmillan and
    Co. 1871. Crown 8vo. Pp. 245.
    The third edition of this book was the subject of a rather long
notice in our pages (vol. xxxi. pp. 144–149); we shall therefore limit
 our notice of the present edition to making mention of the chief
 points in which it differs from its predecessor. These are three in
 number:—(1) The chapter which treats of the Attraction of Table
lands, Mountains, &c. has been greatly enlarged.               The author
 has introduced a discussion of certain formulae for calculating the
effect of variations in the density of the earth's superficial mass, which
 formed the subject of a pamphlet written by him in 1868. (2) The
 chapter which treats of the Earth considered as a Fluid Mass has
 been modified to bring it into accordance with the author's recogni
 tion of the fact that the variations of the force of Gravity on the
 Earth's surface are not in themselves sufficient to prove that the
 earth was originally fluid.   (3) In the section on the determination
 of the mean figure of the earth, supposing it to be spheroidal, the
 author gives at much greater length than in the earlier edition his
 views of the best method of deducing the mean value of the Axes of
 the Earth from the principal measured long arcs, viz. the Anglo
 Gallic Arc, the Russian Arc, and the Indian Arc. The substance of
 this addition appeared in our pages (vol. xxxiii. p. 10). Besides
 these there are several minor alterations, the result of the whole
 being to increase the volume by 83 pages. The preface is dated
 Calcutta, November 8, 1871, not long before the author's death;
 this date, compared with that of the second edition of the author's
 Treatise on the Mathematical Principles of Mechanical Philosophy
 (October 5, 1841), shows that his life in India extended over more
 than thirty years; and when we remember that his scientific pursuits
 were entirely additional to his professional duties, that they were
 pursued under the disadvantage of the climate of Calcutta, involved
 laborious calculations, and were continued up to the end of his life,
 we cannot but regard the composition of the volume before us as a
 striking instance of devotion to science.

90° of rotation; and if the analyzer be turned in the same direction,
the colours change, but in the reverse order.        The explanation of
this is to be found in the fact that when the       plates A and B are
crossed, the retardation due by A is compensated by that due to B;
so that the only effective retardation is that due to the crystal C.
But upon this depends the rotation of the plane of polarization;                                                    if,
therefore, the polarizer and analyzer remain fixed, the colour will
remain unaltered.     When the plates      and   have their axes parallel

   To pursue this matter further. Suppose that, the arrangements
remaining otherwise as before, the analyzer be turned round; then
in any position intermediate to 0° and 90° the rings will be con
tracted and extended in opposite quadrants, until at 45° they are
divided by two diagonals, on each side of which the colours are
complementary.       Beyond 45° the rings begin to coalesce, until at
90° the four   quadrants  coincide again.      During this movement the
centre has    changed   from   bright   to dark.    If the motion of the
analyzer be reversed, the quadrants which before contracted, now
expand, and vice versd.     Again, if the crystal (say positive) be re
placed by another (say negative), the effect on the quadrants of the
rings will be reversed.        This method of examination therefore
affords a test of the character, positive or negative, of a crystal.
   A similar process applies to biaxial crystals; but in this case the
diagonals interrupting the rings are replaced by a pair of rectangular
hyperbolas, on either side of which the rings expand or contract;
and the effect is reversed either by reversing the motion of the
analyzer, or by replacing a positive by a negative crystal, or vice
versd. The experiment may then be made in biaxial crystals by
turning the analyzer slightly to the right or to the left, and observing
whether the rings advance towards, or recede from, one another in
                                                                         in if,

coloured rays, and so produce the most vivid effects.    The dispersion
of the brushes by  a plate of quartz, however, may    be studied by em
ploying an additional polarizer and quartz plate between the source
of light and the whole system previously used. By turning this
polarizer round we extinguish each ray of the spectrum in turn and
tint the whole field with the complementary colour. The brushes
will then appear to revolve about their centres                          as the tints vary
continuously from one end of the spectrum to the other.        If the
polarizer be turned still further round, the tints which had changed
continuosly from red to violet, or vice versd, change suddenly from
violet to red, or vice versd, and the brushes jump suddenly back to
their original position.                                   -
   This last optical arrangement may be employed to examine the
more important phenomena of the dispersion of the optic axes
produced, not by a quartz plate between the usual polarizer and
crystal, but by certain biaxial crystals themselves.

   Pure zinc is incapable of decomposing pure water, even at 100° C.,
 but at a considerably higher temperature it is known to combine
 with     its
         oxygen.   Davy exposed pure water for two days    the action             to

  The first action, therefore, was about five times  as great as in the
case of the copper; and it diminished more rapidly, doubtless through
the zinc becoming more quickly protected by oxide.
   Lest, it might be contended that the free oxygen, usually present
in distilled water, had been the means of starting this action, the ex
periment was repeated with water as free from oxygen as could be
obtained by boiling.         One metre of the same zinc-foil, covered with
copper, was employed; and the result was nearly as before, 40 cub.
centims. of gas being obtained the first day at the mean temperature

       ON  THE INFLUENCE OF PRESSURE ON THE LINES                    OF  THE
                    sPECTRUM*.           BY M. L. CAILLETET.
      HE   experiments which I have the honour of making known to the
         Academy are founded on the spectroscopic examination of the
induction spark produced between two platinum wires sealed to the
upper part of a tube of thick glass, in which a gas can be compressed
to an exactly determined pressure.
    The pressure is furnished by the apparatus described by me cn the
occasion of my researches on the compressibility of gasest.                   The
glass tube which contains the platinum wires is joined to a reservoir
in shape like a thermometer; it thus contains a relatively consider
able quantity of gas, which, when driven back by the mercury into
which the open part of the reservoir dips, will occupy a height of
several centimetres around the platinum wires.                    The apparatus
containing the gas under experiment is enclosed in the laboratory
tube of steel, and the upper portion of the glass tube is alone visible.
To avoid accidents from its breaking, this tube is covered by a sheath
of very transparent crystal.           In case of explosion, as I have often
proved, the projected fragments cannot break this envelope, which
shelters the observer from all danger.
     When, between the platinum wires, 2 or 3 millims. apart, the
spark produced by a Ruhmkorff's coil excited by three Bunsen's
 elements is caused to pass, the light is very feeble and presents in
the spectroscope pretty sharp lines standing out upon the scarcely
illuminated background; if then the pressure be given slowly and
 gradually, the lines soon become brighter and brighter, then widen,
 become less sharp, and at last dissolve in the field of the spectrum,
 which has become brilliant and vividly coloured.               At that moment,
 if the   pressure  be still  augmented,     the electric light  suddenly ceases.
     I made     many   attempts    to   remedy   this inconvenience ; but my
 efforts were not successful.         I  sought especially   to avoid the deposit
 of a   very small  quantity   of alkaline water which     constantly   condenses
 on the sides of the glass tube; for this purpose I lined the interior
 of the tube with a varnish of gum lac, and inserted a piece of caustic
 potash. These various expedients did not sensibly retard the moment
 of the cessation of the passage of the spark.              I augmented the    in
 tensity of the electric current employed; the spark furnished by a
 coil of 3 decims. length excited by 8 large Bunsen elements had not
 sufficient energy to clear the space of less than } millim. which
 separates the platinum wires.
     A stronger electric current, by the sudden heating it produces,
inevitably determines the breaking of the glass tube.               It is at about
40 to 50 atmospheres that the sparks cease to pass; the sides of
the tube then become feebly luminous in the dark.
    *  I had  recently, at Rome, the opportunity of seeing the Rev. Father
Secchi; and      I am anxious to thank him for the encouragement and           ex
cellent advice he kindly gave me on the occasion of the experiments which
constitute the subject of this Note.

    The gases I have examined are hydrogen, atmospheric air, and
nitrogen, previously dried by passing over caustic potash or concen
trated sulphuric acid.         The red line (a) of hydrogen assumes great
splendour as the pressure increases; and when the tension of the
gas is near 40 atmospheres, the red region of the spectrum is so
luminous that the line a hardly stands out upon the brilliant back
ground. At this moment the line y is completely dissolved in the
most refrangible portion of the spectrum.             The lines of the other
gases which I have examined produce the same effects; and the
least sharp among them disappeared when the pressure became such
that the luminous current ceased.              In these experiments it often
 happens that the glass is attacked; then the sodium-line appears
very brilliant.       When the points of the wires are dipped in a salt
of   sodium,   lithium,    thallium, or one of the metals easy to recognize,
the lines characteristic of these metals assume a splendour which
 goes on increasing with the pressure; and when the gaseous lines
 are almost effaced, the metallic lines, although much less sharp, are
 still conspicuous on the spectrum, which has become sensibly con
 tinuous.     Several experiments have left me the impression that, if
 it were    possible     to observe under stronger pressures, continuous
 metallic  spectra    would probably be obtained.        I have measured the
 proportion in which the luminous intensity of the spark increases
 under pressure.         For this purpose I employ two induction-coils of
 the same    dimensions,     giving sparks of the same intensity.      I then
 compress the gas contained in one of the luminous tubes; and I can
 compare, by one of the known means of photometry, the primitive
  spark with that increased by pressure.          I have thus been enabled to
 prove that, by varying from 1 to 40 atmospheres the tension of the
 gas in which the spark is produced, the latter becomes at least 200
 times as bright. In fact a spark which at the atmospheric pressure
  is scarcely visible, will under pressure light up a spacious laboratory.
     From the facts here stated we may, I think, conclude:--
     (1) That the spark which readily traverses the rarefied gas in a
  Geissler's tube or the electric egg, encounters considerable resistance
  when produced in compressed gas; it is likewise probable that the
  heating of the sides of the tube facilitates the flow of the electricity,
  as is shown by M. Regnault's experiments.
      (2) That the brightness of the spark obtained under the ordinary
  pressure becomes at least 200 times as great when the tension of
  the gas is increased to the point at which the luminous current ceases.
  This confirms the beautiful experiments of Frankland on the com
  bustion of hydrogen under pressure.
      (3) That the luminous intensity of the gaseous lines increases
  with the pressure, and that at about 40 atmospheres, when the tem
  perature must be very high in the vicinity of the wires, those lines
  almost entirely disappear in the field of the spectrum, which has
  become very luminous and sensibly continuous.--Comptes            Rendus de

are connected with the phenomena of anomalous dispersion; and,

when the rays are partially transmissible through the mirrors as
when the portion which escapes reflection is completely absorbed by
the mirrors.   I said also that in the case of the rays being polarized
perpendicularly to the plane of incidence a very little modification
of Fresnel's hypotheses or equations is sufficient for arriving at a
formula very well representing the phenomena.           In fact, if we
admit that at the most superficial part of an opaque medium trans
mission commences as Fresnel conceives it to do in transparent
media, but under the condition that the vis viva of the incident ray
does not all reappear in the reflected and in the refracted ray pro
perly so called, the equation of the vires viva may be written in the
ordinary notation

it is right to remember that in a solar spectrum, especially when it is
obtained with glass and Iceland spar, the heat is almost entirely
confined to a space which does not occupy one sixteenth part of
the total length of the spectrum. The value of n employed in this
case is the mean of those corresponding to the different single rays
of that narrow region.
   I have thought it proper to notice the accord shown in the pre
ceding Tables; but I mention it as a fact, without wishing to enter
into any theoretic discussion.  Equation (1), which stands here in
the same form as in my former communication, might quite as well
be written

     Equation (3) would then become

their absolute quantity.                      I

   During the last few months                          I
                                     have been observing spectroscopi
cally gun-cotton flame, and have obtained results which it is thought
will prove of importance in calculating for the safe storage &c. of
that combustible.      During my researches it was necessary, after
heating gun-cotton previously to ignition to various temperatures,
that    I
        should ascertain the true temperatures of the resulting flames.

Now,        by
           taking the algebraic sum         the first two cases, and        on
subtracting from      the sum it   the last two, we obtain,

the external molecules of aether must therefore tend to repel the
aether within the body from the surface to the central parts.
Let us now suppose a body presenting a deficit of aether, having
less than the quantity                         required for equilibrium;
                                                      the resultant
of the repulsion of the   external molecules will necessarily have
the preponderance, and    the aether molecules of the body will be
driven from the surface   to the interior. As, then, the body con
tains a less quantity of aether now than when it is in the neutral
state, the result must be a deficit at the surface.
   The condensation of the aether when a Leyden jar or a Frank
lin's tray is charged may be explained in an analogous manner:
the current of the electric discharge is simply the passage of the
aether out of one body into another”.
    * As we know, Franklin attempted to explain the electric phenomena
known in his time by admitting only one electric fluid. He could not,
however, account for the repulsion between two electronegative bodies
without attributing to ponderable matter properties which it does not pos
sess.     For this cause the opinion of Franklin and the “unitarians” on the
nature of electricity had to give place to that of the dualists, who established
the hypothesis of the two fluids, admitted to this day.                 Some attempts
have been made recently with a view to explain electric phenomena as pro
duced by the aether or a single fluid.            Without entering into a detailed
account of these more or less happy endeavours, we think it necessary to
observe that, relatively to the properties or the motions of the aether, they
 are                   on                                                           ques

   3. Electrodynamic phenomena.-The galvanic current consists,
in our opinion, in this:—that the electric aether moves from one
point to another in the circuit, the intensity of the current being
determined by the product of the density of the aether in motion
and  its velocity;           or,
                             other terms,
                                      in          proportional                                           to
                                                                 it  the  is

                                                                 is
tromotive forces from which the current derives          origin cannot                  its
create  aether;    their action     restricted    istransforming    into      to
translatory motion the oscillatory motion which already exists
under the form            of
                      heat.    From this     follows that heat should
                                                                it

                the  point      the circuit where the electromotive
                                           in
force is  acting—which        proved, moreover,
                                        is             Peltier's pheno             by
mena.      In this way the origin      the galvanic current becomes
                                                       of
singularly simple: the electromotive forces create nothing new                                                       ;
they merely, like ordinary machines, transform one sort              mo                                  of
tion into another.
   The numerous experiments which have been made for the
purpose     of ascertaining the velocity         electricity     of
                                                                  wires have                  in

prehended.      Wheatstone and Faraday have shown the important
part played,       regard

   In the sequel we shall make use of a proposition which has
not, to our knowledge, been yet established as a principle in the
explanation of natural phenomena, but which appears to us none
the less axiomatic.   This principle     that every thing which      is,
                  or
takes place                     external nature requires

of time and space have been improved.           For example,       was                                           it

that this   is    by      no

that   galvanic current does not

100        M. E. Edlund      on the Nature           of Electricity.
when produced by positive and when by negative electricity has
been regarded as a proof of the existence of two electric fluids.
But, as we know that the difference disappears in a vacuum, it
seems impossible to draw from it any certain conclusion for or
against either opinion.    It is doubtless the same with some other
phenomena to which it has been thought we ought to attach
some importance with respect to the matter in question.
   On the other hand, several phenomena decidedly support the
opinion that the substance which constitutes the basis of electric
phenomena is simple and indivisible.        We note, among others,
the fact studied    by  Wiedemann and other physicists, that a
liquid traversed by a galvanic current is mechanically impelled
in the direction of the positive current. To account for this it
is necessary to admit that the negative current does not possess
this property at all, or at least that it possesses it only in a less
degree—although for the explanation of several other phenomena
it must be admitted that the positive and the negative currents
behave identically in relation to matter. With the circumstance
just stated is connected the known fact that the positive pole of
a voltaic battery, and the positive knob in the formation of sparks,
are principally, if not almost exclusively, corroded and destroyed.
In the second part of this memoir we shall give the explanation
of the fact that the negative pole is not left altogether intact, as
well as of the phenomena investigated in so remarkable a man
ner by M. Quincke”.      The idea which has been formed of the
mode of propagation of the positive and negative current in op
posite directions in a conductor is by no means simple, and is
consequently any thing but natural. The explanation of these
phenomena is infinitely more easy to understand by admitting
the presence of one electric fluid only.   The existence of the
aether is as certain as that of the atmosphere which encompasses
     globe.   If, then,      possible   prove that the phenomena
                                            in to

fectly well assured that there exists     special electric fluid; for

ifnature can produce certain phenomena          means   by one agent    of
only, she will not employ two.

XI.   Reply to             some       Remarks” of the Hon. J. W. Strutt on Ga
   seous Pressure.                    By Robert Moon, M.A., Honorary Fellow
   of Queen's College, Cambridget.
                my doctrine that density alone does not deter
          criticising
IN   mine pressure but velocity also requires to be taken into
account, Mr. Strutt evidently thinks that he has placed me in a
dilemma by asking, “What is here meant by velocity ?”      Is it
“the absolute velocity which is intended,” or does it mean “the
velocity relatively to the containing vessel ?”
   To this I reply, certainly not the velocity relatively to the
containing vessel, which, since “no account is taken of friction
or viscosity,” may, as Mr. Strutt has pointed out, have any ar
bitrary motion in a direction parallel to    axis without affecting   its
the motion of the air within it.
   But     am asked whether the velocity

refrangible regions is to give an apparent dilution to them, while
the less-refrangible are concentrated.      The relative position of
the colours must also   vary;  the fixed lines must be placed at dis
tances  greater  than their true distance as the violet end is ap
proached.”      I am quoting from the fifth chapter of a work ‘ On
the Forces which produce the Organization of Plants,’ published
by me in 1844.      In this chapter one of the chief points insisted
on is the necessity of using wave-lengths in the measurement
and discussion of spectrum results—a suggestion which believe                       I
I  was the first to make, and which                        I
                                           renewed in the Philoso
phical Magazine, June 1845.
   The importance of these remarks respecting the peculiarities
of the prismatic or dispersion spectrum may perhaps be most
satisfactorily recognized on examining such a spectrum by the
side of a diffraction or interference one.      By the aid of fig. 1
 (Plate II.) this may be done.
    Regarding the space between the fixed lines D and E as re
 presenting the central region in each, the fixed lines D and E
 are made coincident in both. The other lines are laid off in the
 prismatic spectrum as they appear through the flint-glass prism
 of the spectroscope; those of the diffraction spectrum are arranged
 according to their wave-lengths.       It thus appears that in the
prismatic spectrum from the fixed line D to A the yellow, orange,
and red regions occupy but little more than half the space they
do in the diffraction spectrum; while the green, blue, indigo, and
violet from the fixed line E to H occupy nearly double the space
in the prismatic that they do in the diffraction spectrum. The
 general result is that in the prismatic the less-refrangible regions
are much compressed and the more refrangible much dilated.
And it is plain that the same will hold good in a still greater
degree for any invisible rays that are below the red and above
the violet respectively.
    Now, if a thermometer of any kind were carried in succession
from the greatly dilated more refrangible regions to the greatly
condensed less refrangible, could the measures obtained be ac
cepted as expressing the true distribution ? The thermometric
surface being invariable, would it not receive in the less-refran
gible spaces more than               its
                               proper amount        heat, and    ofthe                  in
more   refrangible  less than    proper    its
                                          amount                  7

           were       to

it were possible to make satisfactory heat-measures on the dif
fraction spectrum, in which the coloured spaces and fixed lines
are arranged according to their wave-lengths,      the admission
would be substantiated.
  . In view of these facts              I
                            did attempt many years ago to make
heat-measurements     on the diffraction spectrum ; but so small
 is the heat, that, as may be seen in the Philosophical Magazine
 (March 1857), the results were unsatisfactory. More recently
I  have tried another method of investigation, on principles which
I  will now explain.

    For the sake of clearness, restricting our thoughts for the
moment to the more familiar case of the visible spectrum, if we
desire to ascertain the true distribution of heat, would not the
proper method be to collect                      all

                          Heat in the Spectrum.                   109
by those experiments was that the heat in the invisible is eight
times that in the visible region. But had there been an error
in estimating the position of the extreme red by only two milli
metres, so much would have been taken from the invisible and
added to the visible that they would have been brought to equa
lity, and then the slightest turn of the screw that carried the
pile toward the dark space would have given a preponderance to
the visible.     It is obvious, therefore, that there cannot be cer
 tainty in such measures unless the fixed lines are resorted to as
 standard points.
     (2) A ray which has passed through a solution of sulphate
 of copper and ammonia possesses no insignificant heating
 power.     I  took a stratum of a solution of that salt of such
 strength that it only permitted waves to pass which are of less
 length than 4860. Seen in the spectroscope, the colours trans
 mitted through it commenced with a thin green fringe, followed
 by blue, indigo, violet. It therefore gave rays in which, accord
 ing to the accepted views, little or no heat should be detected.
        I
 Yet found that such rays produced one ninth of the heat of
 the entire solar beam.        Does not this indisputably show that
 the more    refrangible  rays have a higher calorific power than is
 commonly imputed to them 7
     (3) Again, by the use of the apparatus presently to be de
  scribed, I found no difficulty in recognizing heat in the violet
  region; but in the mode of conducting the experiment hereto
  fore resorted to it could not be detected in rays more refrangible
  than the blue. It was this result which gave so much weight to
  the conclusion that in the more refrangible regions the calorific
  power is replaced by chemical force, and strengthened the idea
  commonly entertained that the solar radiations consist of three
  distinct principles—heat, light, and actinism. In the memoir
  above referred to as soon to be published,    I shall present some
  facts which   apparently   make this view indefensible.
      (4) If waves of light falling upon an absolutely black surface
  and becoming extinct thereby are transmuted into heat, if the
  warming of surfaces by incident light be nothing more than the
  conversion of motion into heat—an illustration of the modern
   doctrine of the correlation of forces, heat itself being only a
   “mode of motion”—it would seem extraordinary that this con
   version should cease in the green or blue or in any ray.    On the
  contrary, calorific effects ought to be traceable throughout the
  entire length of the spectrum.      These views on the transference
  of motion from the aether to the particles of ponderable bodies,
  and conversely, I endeavoured to explain in detail in a memoir on
  Phosphorescence, inserted in the Philosophical Magazine, Feb.
  1851, p. 98 &c.       I had previously indicated them in the same

             Prof. R. Clausius                   on one     of Mr. Tait's              Remarks.                117
   In the title of this memoir I have employed the phrase “Dis
tribution of Heat’ in accordance with general usage; but if the
conclusion arrived at be true, it is plain that this should be ex
changed for “Production of Heat.” The heat observed did not
preexist in the incident rays, it is the result of their extinction.
  The remark has been made that these results are essentially
connected with photometry.       In fact, any thermometer is con
verted into a photometer if    bulb               its
                                       other receiving surface    or                                            be
coated with   perfectly
                    a   opaque non-reflecting substance.
 XIII.       A      necessary Correction                of      one    of   Mr. Tait's Remarks.
                                       By        R.   CLAUSIUs”.
     INCE I   refuted the objections made          previous article         in   a                              by

                                     raises new objections.     These
would      just
          be             as
                    easily invalidated;   but the tone     which Mr.                           in
Tait has written renders       impossible for me
                                             it          continue the                     to
discussion.
  There        is   one point, however, which                          I    must not leave               uncor
rected, because          it   relates        to   athird party, who highly esteemed  is

                                            had made

has been deliberately  attempting     deprive me        my just   to                            of
claims.  Of Sir W.  Thomson, however,    have not said,    even        I                                 or
remotely hinted, anything        the kind.    Quite the contrary:
                                                  of                                                           I
have  expressly  called attention      his frank recognitionto    my                                      of
works.     Mr. Tait  himself,   the close        at
                                             his article speaks quite  of
differently    the relation between Sir W. Thomson and myself
                  of
—where,       order
               in       countenance his own attacks upon me,

says:—“ and       think that Thomson has done mischief

This makes the first-mentioned passage concerning Thomson

          is         page distant)

          XIV.           The Atomic Theory, in Reply to                          Dr. Wright.
                              By R. W. Atkinson, F.C.S.*
     T is exceedingly gratifying to find that Dr. Wright gives a
       practically unqualified assent to the Atomic Theory.            He
attempts to distinguish between the atomic hypothesis and the
atomic theory; but when he defines a theory to be a proposition
the predictions of which are “mostly verified by experiment and
observation,” it will be seen that, even according to his own de
finition, the term theory is more applicable than hypothesis to
Dalton’s statement.       Now, as he in no place attempts to criticise
what he terms the “ atomic theory (as employed in University
College laboratory),” and as it can be shown that this view is
merely a further development of Dalton's original views, we may
fairly accept the weight of Dr. Wright's opinion in favour of the
theory.
    Dalton represented elementary bodies as made up of an assem
blage of globules, each of which consisted of a central atom of
solid matter surrounded by an atmosphere of heat. The only
difference between this view and that now accepted by chemists,
apart from the difference in the theory of heat, is that they do
not commit themselves to any assertion as to the nature of this
central atom,      certainly not as great a modification as adopting
the mechanical in place of the material theory of heat, which no
one would regard as altering the main features of Dalton's con
ception. Chemists treat such atoms in the same way as astro
nomers treat the planets—that                                 is,
                                                 practically indivisible,
                                                                       as
although        astronomer would assert that they are
                    no                                           their na                   in
ture indivisible: the question         not raised.      is
    By his analysis       Dalton's proposals into generalization, con
                                   of
vention, and hypothesis, Dr. Wright has not escaped from the
dilemma        which
                 in                he
                          was placed with regard         the combination          to
of  elements      definite and multiple proportions.
                      in                                       this three              If
fold division had been real,           would have afforded
                                                   it            very fair                  a
            escape; but the three propositions are           inextricably              so
             upof
means
bound        together that           not possible

from the rest.      Dr.  Wright   represents   “the   quantitative   com
position      any homogeneous body

accrue by concealing from oneself the fact that this is only a
clumsy expedient for getting rid of the word atom 7 the essential
idea conveyed is that of an indivisible portion of matter, i. e. an
atom.     Thus, then, the generalization being bound up with the
hypothesis, it follows that the convention is also bound up with
them, the symbols and suffixes merely being used as an abbre
viation for such an expression as “one atom of chlorine weighing
35-5 times an equal volume of hydrogen combined with one
atom of hydrogen weighing 1,” indicated by the formula HCl.
 Hence Dr. Wright has not shown that symbols can be used to
represent the quantitative composition of bodies without invol
ving the notion of atoms.                  done
                                                 If,  Dr. Wright, sym

bols       be
          used      represent
                          to   elements,  and suffixes      indicate the                 to
multiple        some fixed number mentally associated with that
                    of
symbol,         itmerely putting the notion
                     is                             atoms        form         of              in   a           of
speech which       calculated
                          is       produce the erroneous impression
                                                to
that that idea has been dispensed with.
    Having thus shown, first, that the atomic theory now             use                                in
is  only     development        Dalton’s   original

                                                                                                               of is
                a
perfectly consistent with                      it,
                                  and, secondly, that the notion
 atoms     involved
            is           Dr. Wright’s account
                                in                     Dalton's conven         of
tion, his objections       my remarks can
                                     to          easily disposed         be                             of.
    The first objection has already been noticed.       The generaliza
 tion and convention cannot         separated from the theory which
                                                 be
 Dalton proposed, they are                     so
                                  completely interwoven.      But, from
 Dr.  Wright's   remark,     would seem useless
                                      it              discuss this point       to
 further.

XV.         Remarks on the alleged ambiguity, insufficiency, and unne
         cessariness of the Atomic Theory.   By ALFRED TRIBE*.
   T  has been observed by a great thinker “ that those who con
     sider it simply the part of science to record results of ob
servations, and not to endeavour to connect them with one
another, know not what science is.” It may further be remarked
that facts, without some means of connecting them, do not con
stitute science.   The only means known at present by which
the numerous facts relating to the transformations of matter can
be connected is by what is generally termed the atomic theory.
It matters little whether this fact-connector and mental help be
called theory, hypothesis, or the “invention of a mechanical or
carpenter's mind;” there is no ignoring the historical facts that
 itsdiscovery threw light where utter darkness prevailed, and that
the vivid pictures (always      harmony)       enabled the mind
                                                  in                            it                                      to

fingers.”   As the comparative amounts of mental exertion re
quired for these operations remain undetermined, it is an open
guestion which requires the greater; but the fact that Dr.Wright
compares the mental help which is afforded by a theory to that
of the mechanical process of counting on the fingers, explains in
a more forcible manner than                           I
                                can why he charges the atomic

erect his edifice with facts only; but imagine, were he a builder,
he would wish for something more than bricks. Also that
he would deprive the investigator of using the power of imagi
nation—one of the greatest possessions of an intellectual being;
but were he to examine the work which has been done in che
mistry and physics, above the grade of the artisan, he would
find such evidence of the value of theory or the power of imagi
nation that he, whom                       I
                             know to be actuated by love for our
science, would be    sorry  to see chemists debarred from the legi
timate use of their mental instrument of research.
   Were the anti-atomists to attack the object of their aversion by
experiment, no one could doubt their sincerity, and in         proba                                 all

 XVII. A    Contribution to our knowledge of Atmospheric Waves.

      issue of weather-charts              by the Meteorological Office
THEplaces  at the disposal of such           amateurs as may be willing
to subscribe for them very valuable data bearing on the general
affections of the atmosphere, temperature, pressure, wind, &c.
Having given some little attention in former years to the subject
of atmospheric    waves,  I have looked into the weather reports and
charts for evidence   bearing   on these movements, and have suc
ceeded in  finding   some   important  corroborations of the views                    I
announced more than a quarter of a century ago, as well as
some of a novel nature which the data then in my possession
were unable to elucidate.
   In the interval that has elapsed between the present and my
former researches, a most important generalization has been
arrived at ; it is that, whatever may be the direction of the wind,
the region of lowest pressure is on the left of this direction, and
the region of highest pressure on the right. Observation shows
that winds are arranged in two ways—cyclonic and linear; and
in both, this law, known as Buys Ballot's law, holds good. If
any wind of a linear arrangement be considered in relation to
pressure, places on the left of the line of this wind will have
lower pressures, with either the same wind or winds appertaining
to the slope of a wave coexistent with that of which it forms a
part, but which is moving in a different direction; and places on
the right of the line of wind will have higher pressures, also with
the same wind or other winds, as in the case just alluded
                                                                                  is to.

in order to distinguish it from that of a true cyclone, which cir
culates around a region of depression, it has been termed anti
cyclonic, as circulating in a reverse direction around a region of
elevated pressure.

 of air along the eastern coast of Great Britain, direction N.N.W.,
 curving over the eastern counties of England and crossing the
 channel as a N.E. wind. The isobars or lines of equal pressure

angles approaching more or less to right angles; and these heights
and winds may be eahibited in Tables showing the decrease          or in
crease of pressure   from regions of high to low barometers, and the
reverse.
   Diurnal isobars, which are simply lines of equal pressure re
sulting from existing natural arrangements, do not exhibit any
meteorological entity.        To find such natural arrangements it is
necessary   to resolve the isobars and wind-curves into their      baro
 metric and anemonal elements.

fall at Brussels was 0.07 only, the barometer standing at
29:72.     Another note-worthy feature is the synchronous preser
vation of the wave-form with the general decrease of pressure, a
feature of great importance as bearing on the principles of storin
prevision.

   In casting the eye over the differences of fall along the line
of trough, it will be seen that the greatest diminution of pressure
occurred at London, Dover, and Cape Gris Nez; and on com
paring the heights of the barometer at these stations (29-21 to
29:15) with the lowest point in the cyclone of the 20th in the
S. of Ireland (29.46), it will be seen that not only did the cy
clonic depression travel from the S. of Ireland to the N.W.
of France, but the diminution of elasticity increased as it pro
gressed;    so that the decrease of nearly 0-60 in the S. of Ireland
from a pressure of about 3000 between April 19 and 20 ap
peared in the neighbourhood of Dover on the 21st, reducing the
pressure there by about the same amount from about 29-71 or
29-72 the readings of the 20th. Changes of elasticity of this
nature modify, but do not destroy the wave-forms, which ordi
narily continue to travel in their normal directions.
    The line from Valencia to Christiansund (barometer from
29-60 to 2986) represented the crest of a slope of which the
trough extended along the English Channel. This trough                             in
tersected the trough from Thurso to Paris at the stations Dover
and Cape Gris Nez; and near this point of intersection a semi
cyclone was established.        The winds of this semicyclone are
marked with an asterisk (*).
    The anterior slope between the crest, extending from Valencia
to Christiansund and the trough along the English Channel, did
 not pass onward towards the S.E., but was apparently broken up
 over the British Isles by a still further reduction of pressure. It
 is the study of this phenomenon of decreasing (or            opposite  its
     increasing) pressure, irrespective

     Avery important point to investigate in such inquiries as
these, has reference to changes of elasticity in large bodies of
air, such as occurred on the 20th and again on the 22nd per
fectly independent of any progressive movement.      Table V.
shows that the distribution of pressure and wind was much the
same as on the 22nd, but that during the twenty-four hours
elapsed  from 8 A.M. of the 22nd to 8 A.M. of the 23rd the
trough of the S.W. wave had advanced but a very short distance
towards the N.E. from        locality         its

   This Table is one of the most interesting of the series; it ex
hibits  a general rise of the barometer over the entire area, and
the establishment of the posterior slope of the N.W. wave, the
direction of the trough of which has been specified in Tables
III., IV., and W. It would appear at first sight that the wave
had progressed towards the N.W.; but it is likely that this ap
pearance arose from the irregularity of increase of elasticity
being greatest along the English Channel.         It     however,                  is,
noteworthy that with the extension        the trough towards the

subject     barometric fluctuations, said “it would

              barometrical fluctuations we could either make out

   predict them,     any peculiarity
                            or         their physiognomy
                                                     in        which                      by

might possibly be led to the prediction of great storms.”
Although up to this time no such law has been REcognized by our
leading meteorologists, it may be permissible to inquire if the steps
which have hitherto been taken, such as are exhibited in the
preceding Tables, and capable of being rendered still more                                                      in
telligible by curves and sections, have not developed these prin
ciples, viz. that the vast bodies of air, possessing regular grada
tions of pressure analogous to wave-forms associated with cer
tain definite winds which always accompany these gradations of
pressure, move in certain directions, viz. from N.W. to S.E., and
from S.W. to N.E., and also if such regular motions are not of
the nature of “laws” different from Buys Ballot's law. The
present paper shows that other forces of a still higher character
than wave-motion come into operation, producing changes of
elasticity the laws of which require to be investigated.      This
work is a laborious one, but without it little progress will be
made in meteorology.      The study of atmospheric waves must
conduce to a clearer   conception  of the changes giving rise to
the production   of new or the modification of existing waves.

THE“The   Action of Oxygen on Copper Nitrate                in a state of Ten
sion.”     By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.R.S., and Alfred Tribe, F.C.S.
    In our experiments on the action between copper and nitrate of
silver in solution, we frequently noticed that the tips of the silver
crystals became red, as though coated with a thin layer of metallic
copper.                                                                          -
    This apparent deposition of a positive on a more negative metal of
course raised our curiosity, and led us to look closely into the
circumstances under which it occurred.              We found that it took
place only when the nitrate of silver was exhausted, and only on
those silver crystals which remained in metallic connexion with the
copper.      We found, too, that the cupreous coating formed most
readily where air had the freest access, and, in fact, that it would
not form at           allvessels from which oxygen was excluded, nor
                                in
on   those white    crystals   which were far below the surface                the                    of

was perceptible on the copper.      On continuing this experiment for
three  hours,  it was found that the copper plate lost 0:003 grim., and
the silver plate  was increased by 0:004 grim. On cleaning the plates,
and  reversing   their position, the copper was covered with a film of
oxide, while the silver remained free from cupreous deposit.        We
believe therefore that, through the simultaneous action of the two
metals, the dissolved salt is put into such a state of tension that
oxygen brings about a chemical change which otherwise would be
impossible, and that this change is initiated in close proximity to the
more negative metal.
   Though we have examined only this particular reaction, we have
satisfied ourselves that it is not an isolated fact.    Each of the ele
ments concerned may be replaced by others: thus the sulphate may
be substituted for the nitrate of copper, or platinum may be used
instead of silver; chlorine may take the place of oxygen, with the
production of the subchloride instead of the suboxide; and zinc may
be employed as the positive metal, with zinc chloride as the salt in
solution, in which case copper may be taken as the negative metal,
and on         its
            surface will form     deposit   oxide a  zinc.          of           of

142    Royal Society     –The   Astronomer Royal    on a supposed
two days, no sensible error would be introduced by interpolating be
tween the numbers for the days immediately preceding and following
the omitted days.
   The years selected for this examination were 1850, 1851, 1852,
1868, 1869, 1870; and the beginning of the first period in each year
after the first was thus found:—Fourteen periods of 26 days each
amount to 368; days. For convenience, after completion of the an
nual winter adjustments, the first period in 1850 was made to com
mence on January 17; therefore the first period in 1851 was com
menced on January 21, and that in 1852 on January 25.        Similarly,
the first periods in 1868, 1869, 1870 commenced on January 1, 4,
and 8 respectively; and the beginnings in the three later years are
not unconnected with those in the three earlier years: for, from 1852,
January 25, to 1868, January 1, are 5820 days, and 221 periods of
26 days each are 5819; days; but as the years are widely sepa
rated, and a small error of period would produce a large discordance,
it has appeared best to exhibit the results of the two three-years'
groups separately.
    Some periods, in which there were unusually large interruptions, or
which were partly occupied with experiments, were omitted entirely.
The following is a complete list of periods omitted:—In 1850, that
 beginning with December 24 for horizontal force; in 1851, that be
 ginning with March 14 for western declination, and those beginning
 with March 14, June 28, July 24, for horizontal force; in 1852, those
 beginning with February 20, May 9, December 6, for both elements;
in 1868, those beginning with February 23 for declination, and      Ja
 muary 1, January 27, February 23, and December 8 for horizontal
 force; in 1869, those beginning with October 21 and December 12
 for both elements; and in 1870, those beginning with June 15 and
 December 16 for declination, and that beginning with December 16
 for horizontal force. Interpolations of three days occur only in the
 following instances:—1850,     (dec.) Feb. 4-6, (h.  f.)  Feb. 9–1  1,

   1. “Further Notes on the Geology of the neighbourhood of
Malaga.” By M. D. M. d’Orueta. Communicated by the President.
   In this paper, which is a continuation of a former note laid
before the Society (see Q. J. G. S. xxvii. p. 109), the author com
menced by stating that his former opinion as to the Jurassic age of
the rocks of Antequera is fully borne out by later researches upon
their fossils. They apparently belong to the Portlandian series.
The author made considerable additions to his description of the
Torcal, near the foot of which he has found a sandstone containing
abundance of Gryphaea virgula and Ostrea deltoidea.           This he re
gards as equivalent to the Kimmeridge Clay.         In the Torcal he has
also found a soft, white, calcareous deposit, overlying the limestones of
supposed   Portlandian age, and containing a fossil which he identifies
with the Tithonian Terebratula diphya. The author discussed the
peculiar forms assumed by the rocks of the Torcal under denuda
tion, which he supposed to be due originally to the upheaval caused
by the rising of a great mass of greenstone, portions of which are
visible at the surface on both sides of the range.
   2. “On the River-courses of England and Wales.”     By Prof. A.
C.  Ramsay, LL.D., F.R.S., F.G.S.               -
   The author commenced by describing the changes in the physical
conformation of Britain during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods,
and the relations which the deposits found during those periods bore
to the Palaeozoic rocks of Wales and the north-west of England.
He stated that the Miocene period of Europe was essentially a con
tinental one, and that it was closed by important disturbances of
strata in Central Europe, one effect of which would be to give the
Secondary formations of France and Britain a slight tilt towards
the north-west.    To this he ascribed the north-westerly direction
of many of the rivers of France; and he surmised that at this
period the rivers of the middle and south of England also took a
westerly course. The westerly slope of the Cretaceous strata of
England was also, he considered, the cause of the southern flow
of the Severn, between the hilly land of Wales and the long slope
of chalk rising towards the east. The Severn would thus establish
the commencement of the escarpment of the Chalk, which has since
receded far eastward.
   The author believed that after the Severn had cut out        its
                                                               valley
the Cretaceous and other strata were gradually tilted eastwards,
causing the easterly course        of
                                  the Thames and other rivers         of
southern and eastern England.           In
                                      these and other cases adduced
 by the author, the sources   these rivers were originally upon the
                              of
Chalk near   itsescarpment; and         it the recession

more northern part of England, and indicated their relations to the
general dip of the strata.

    The following communications were read:—
    1. “Prognathodus Güntheri (Egerton), a new Genus of Fossil Fish
from the Lias of Lyme Regis.”          By Sir P. de M. Grey Egerton,-
Bart., M.P., F.R.S., F.G.S.
    In this paper the author described a new form of fossil fish
having a broad premaxillary plate somewhat resembling the incisor
tooth of a gigantic Rodent, a single maxillary plate like that of
Callorhynchus, and a mandibular dental apparatus closely resembling
that of Cochliodus. For this form he proposed the establishment of
the new genus Prognathodus, and named the species P. Güntheri.
Ischyodus Johnsoni, Agassiz, also probably belongs to this genus, as
it agrees with P. Güntheri in the characters of the premaxillary
teeth. The author was doubtful as to the exact position of this
genus, which had a head extended in a horizontal instead of a ver
tical plane, suggesting a resemblance to Zygaena, but covered with
hard plates like the head of a sturgeon, and exhibited in the dental
apparatus the curious combination indicated above.
   Dr. GüNTHER pointed out the interest attaching to the dentition
of this fossil fish as being an additional evidence in favour of the
connexion between the Ganoid and Chimaeroid forms. The exist
ence of three teeth instead of one on each side of the jaw, as in
Ceratodus and others, presented in it a generic character; but the
type was still the same.    On one point he slightly differed from the
view of the   author;  and that was as to the application of the terms
maxillary and premaxillary to the teeth. He thought the former
belonged rather to the pterygo-palatine arch, and that the teeth in
the front of the jaw should be regarded as vomerine. He illustrated
this by reference to the jaws and dentition of sharks, Chimaeroids,
and certain Ganoids, such as sturgeons. In these the teeth, instead
of being connected with the maxillary and premaxillary bones,
were, in fact, connected with the pterygo-palatine arch.       He con
sidered that this furnished additional grounds for including all three
forms in one subclass.
   2. “On two specimens of Ischyodus, from the Lias of Lyme
 Regis.” By Sir P. de M. Grey-Egerton, Bart., M.P., F.R.S., F.G.S.
    In this paper the author noticed a new example of the greatly
 developed rostrum of a male Chimaeroid, an inch shorter, more
 slender, and more attenuated at the apex than that of Ischyodus
orthorhinus, Egerton, having a projecting median rib along the upper
surface, and the tubercles of the lower part smaller and fewer than
in I. orthorhinus.    For this form the author proposed the name of
                                   L  2

the whole of the so-called “Punfield formation” of the Isle of Pur

                  us has occupied himself with the phenomenon of
                 experienced, under the magnetic influence, by the
electrical jet produced, by means of the Ruhmkorff coil, in a rare
fied gas. We have just resumed the experimental study of this pheno
menon, in order to effect a better determination of its nature and its
conditions.
     In this extract we limit ourselves to   a statement of only a few of
the results we have      obtained,   reserving  the details of the experi
ments, and the description of the apparatus, for the memoir which
is about to be printed.
   In a first series of experiments we sought to determine the influ
ence of the degree of rarefaction of the gas, and of             nature,           its                on

the jar of which the air had retained the pressure of 13 millims.
The small differences of velocity observed in the jar in which the
pressure remained the same were occasioned by this—that the aug
mentation of pressure in the other, of course, diminished somewhat
the intensity of the current transmitted successively through the
two jars.
  This experiment (repeated several times, and always with the
same result, though under different forms) shows that the velocity              .
of rotation of the jet varies, catteris paribus, with the density of the
gaseous medium, but that it diminishes in a less ratio than that in
which the density increases.
    Carbonic acid gave the same result as atmospheric air. The gas
being at 30 millims. pressure in one of the jars, and at 15 millims.
in the other, the number of turns of the jet in 30 seconds was 30 in
the first, and 50 in the second.
    One of the jars being filled with air, and the other with carbonic
acid, and the two gases being at the same pressure of 20 millims.,
the number of turns in 30 seconds was 40 in the air and only 30 in
the carbonic acid—which shows that the density of the gas, inde
pendently of the pressure, exerts a great influence on the velocity of
rotation.
    We likewise experimented on some other gases; but, with the
exception of carbonic acid, the compound gases, being rapidly de
composed by the electric jet, cannot give exact results.     Hydrogen
is not in the same category; but in it the velocity of rotation is so
 great that it is very difficult to appreciate it directly.  We shall
 afterwards return to the results given by the employment of this gas.
    These first experiments having shown the resistance opposed to
the electric jet by the medium in which it moves, we were led to
try what resistance would be exerted upon it by a moveable solid
 obstacle.
   With this view we suspended in a wide and high bell-glass, by
means of a cocoon-thread, a small square of gummed paper disposed
so as to present its vertical face to the action of the horizontal elec
tric jet.   Every time that the jet, in its rotation under the action of
the magnetism, encountered the square of paper, this received an
impulse, renewed at each passage of the jet, so that at last it oscil
lated like a pendulum. The air in which the experiment took place
was at from 15 to 20 millims. pressure.
   For a better study of this mechanical action of the jet, we replaced
the little pendulum by an ivory swivel with an agate socket, move
able on a pivot placed in the centre, so that it could revolve in a
horizontal plane, parallel with the jet, but a little below          it.

  In the last experiment the jet was no longer visible; there was
only a slightly luminous circular sheet between the central knob and
the metallic ring, which, turning rapidly under the magnetic action,
carried the swivel with it.
    A numerous series of experiments was then devoted to the study
of the variations in intensity to which the current producing the jet
is subject when the latter turns the swivel. To measure these va
riations, we employed the same derivation-apparatus which we used
in our preceding work, and which M. de la Rive has described in
his first memoir on the subject.
    We thus ascertained that the intensity of the current sensibly di
minishes when the jet sets the swivel going.                In air at 9 millims.
pressure the motion given to the swivel by the jet induced a dimi
 nution of 10° in the deflection of the galvanometer, viz. from 42° to
 32°, and in air at 8 millims. a diminution of 11°, viz. from 45° to
34°.     In another experiment, with the air at 14 millims. pressure,
the swivel making 18 turns in 30 seconds, and the jet 72 turns,
the deflection fell 8°, or from 32° to 24°.
    With hydrogen the decrease of intensity is less sensible than with
air; this results from various causes—in particular, from the greater
 electric conductivity of that gas. In the most favourable conditions
it is scarcely more than 5°; and with high degrees of rarefaction it
is still less.
    From the diminution of intensity produced by the resistance of
 the swivel, we presumed that, without the latter, the resistance which
 the surrounding gaseous medium must oppose to the jet in                    rota                                       its

                                   a diminution
the swivel and 82 turns of the jet in 30 seconds.
   With hydrogen, without the swivel the rotation induces no sen
sible diminution of intensity.   It must be remarked that in this case
the jet disappears and divides into an infinite number of threads
throughout the mass of the gas, as an ordinary electric current in a
liquid conductor does in the same circumstances, so that the whole
of the gaseous sheet turns under the action of the magnet.
    Nevertheless, before concluding from these last experiments that
the diminution of the intensity of the current is due to the mecha
nical force exerted by the jet upon either the swivel or the gaseous
medium, we must take account of a circumstance which may have
some influence on that diminution, viz. the cooling which the jet
undergoes in                its
                      rotation                    by

   The following are the results which have obtained in testing the
electrical condition of the flame of a Bunsen burner with a Sir                              Wil
liam Thomson's quadrant electrometer. The degrees given refer to
the arbitrary divisions of the scale, upon which a spot of light is
reflected from the mirror of the instrument.
   Upon connecting the testing-plate of one pair of quadrants of the
instrument with the flame, while the other pair were connected with
the metallic burner and with the earth, the flame was found to be
negatively electrified.
   The following are some of the experiments, selected from a series
that were made.
   Exp. 1. Flame 12 centims, high; plate at the height of 7 centims.
                                                                        -
A negative indication of 130°, very steady.
   Exp. 2. A platinum wire, substituted for the plate, and meeting
the flame 3 centims. above the burner, gave a deflection of 30° in a
negative direction.
   Exp. 3. With the testing-plate just above the tip of the flame,
the instrument showed a positive deflection of 70 to 80 degrees.
   Exp. 4. With the testing-plate 5 millims. from the outer surface of
the flame, on all sides, a feeble positive charge was obtained, the air in
contact with the flame being apparently charged positively, the indi
cation in no case exceeding fifty or sixty degrees on the scale of the

electrometer.
   Exp. 5. The metallic tip of the burner was found to be charged
positively, giving an indication closely agreeing in the number of
degrees with that corresponding to the negative indication of the
flame. This indication was quite constant.
   Exp. 6. When a glass tip was substituted for the metallic tip, no
 charge was found upon             This was the case when any non-con

repeated, when the air in the room indicated a negative charge, with
no difference in the results.
                                                                   I
    At the suggestion of Dr. Wilcott Gibbs, Rumford Professor, tried
the above experiments with a Bunsen blast lamp, by means of which
I   could increase the heat and the flow of air and gas at pleasure.
Slight deviations in the scale-readings were obtained by this means:
the flow of air appeared to affect the charge of electricity upon the
metallic tip, rendering it less constant.         The above experiments
were in the main confirmed. The nature of the metallic plate sub
mitted to the flame, and the degree to which it was heated, appeared
to have a very slight influence upon the charge.
     Sir William Thomson, in the Proceedings of the Literary and
 Philosophical Society of Manchester, March 1862, has a paper upon
 the electricity of the air in rooms.       He finds that it is generally
 negative.     By placing a spirit-lamp upon the prime conductor of an
 electrical machine, he was enabled to change the tension of the air
 from a positive to a negative state and the reverse.         He carefully
 separates the results obtained from the idioelectric effect of the flame,
 which, he states, in no case gave a tension equal to either pole of a
 Daniell's element.
     During the past winter observations made in the laboratory tend
 to confirm these views.      I  have, however, found on some days the
 air within strongly positive. The room is in the north-west corner
 of the building; and there was a strong north-west wind blowing at
 the times this was observed.       I  noticed, also, while experimenting
  with the flame of a Bunsen burner placed near the water-dropper
  used by Sir William Thomson in investigating the electrical state
  of the atmosphere, that the positive charge of the air in the neigh
  bourhood greatly decreased, and in some instances became feebly
  negative, by the presence of the flame.
      The popular idea that great fires are followed by a change in the
  atmosphere inducing rain, does not seem to be unwarranted from an
  electrical point of view. The electricity of the air during cloudy and
  rainy weather is generally negative, or at the most feebly positive.
  The flames being negative would tend to change a strong positive
  charge in clear weather to a negative one, and thus bring the air to
  the state noticed in cloudy and rainy weather.
      The following are the conclusions to which the above experiments
  lead:—                                         -
      1. The flame of a Bunsen burner is negative, while positive elec
  tricity accumulates on the burner itself, if it is a good conductor.
  With orifices made of non-conductors, no charge was found upon
  the tip.
      2. The stratum of air in contact with the outer cone of flame is
   slightly charged with positive electricity.     The partly consumed gas
   of the interior cone is neutral.
      3. The presence of flames tends to change the nature of the atmo
   spheric electricity at the given place, reducing a positive tension to
   a feebly negative one.—Silliman's American Journal for July 1872.

ON    THE PRIMARY SPECTRUM          OF  IODINE,    NOTE BY M. G. SALET.
    The emission of      a ‘red light by the vapour of iodine strongly
heated appeared to me so interesting that I was induced to study
more closely the spectrum of that metalloid.
    MM. Plücker and Hittorf did not succeed in producing with iodine,
by means of Geissler's tubes, a spectrum of the first order corre
sponding to the absorption-spectrum;         I have been more fortunate
by employing a sheathed tube; for I have been able at will, and in
the same apparatus, constructed entirely of glass, to obtain the line
spectrum described by Plücker and also a new spectrum, of which
the less-refrangible part represents, so to say, the negative proof of
the fine absorption-spectrum so well studied by M. Thalén.            It is
accompanied by excessively diffuse bands in the commencement
of the blue and the end of the indigo.        These bands become more
luminous when the tension of the vapour is increased; but then
the lines of the secondary spectrum appear. The light of the tube
is of a bronzy yellow in the cold; it becomes violet-blue with heating.
 - To obtain the new spectrum, it is important to use an electric
source of feeble tension, such as the induction-coil accompanied by
a jar.    It is not very bright, unless particular skill is employed for
its observation and the section of the narrow tube is presented to
the spectroscope.       Each bright band, brought under the cross-wires
of the telescope, is replaced by a black band when the vapour is illu
minated from behind.
    Here, then, is a fresh example of multiple spectra.       It cannot be
supposed that the substance furnishing the new spectrum is a com
pound of iodine ; for it would be the same compound that gives the
bands so well known of the absorption-spectrum;            in other terms,
the characteristic coloration of iodine, that from which it derives its
name, would be due to an impurity.
    It therefore seems to me proved that one and the same elementary
substance may have two spectra, as it may have two allotropic states.
This was Plücker's old opinion.
    It became interesting to know if the continuous spectrum of
iodine heated to redness would show indications of the primary
bands, as required by the theory of the proportionality of the emis
sive and absorptive powers.        By securing the most favourable con
ditions and employing strong dispersion, I have in fact succeeded in
detecting the principal of them.—Comptes Rendus de l'Acad. des
 Sciences, July 8, 1872, pp. 76, 77.

 adjusting the ball and disk to a proper distance, a nebulous aigrette
 surrounds the latter, quite filling the interval between it and the
 wall of the tube, while the part of the tube between the disk and
 ball is crowded with innumerable hazy streams converging upon the
 positive pole, or simply causing the latter to be covered with a faint
 glow.     A current of air or oxygen sent into the tube must pass
 through this, and ozone is very rapidly produced and in great quan
tity. The condensers are of course not used with the machine when
 this apparatus is employed.
  . There appears to be an advantage in causing the oxygen to pass
from the negative toward the positive within the tube; for the gas
 through which the discharge passes is transported in the contrary
 direction, as may be readily seen on bringing a candle-flame between.
 the poles of the machine, or causing a thin column of smoke to rise
 through the polar interval.        The flame and the smoke are deflected,
 and stream off towards the negative pole. If the gas should be
 admitted in the direction mentioned, there would be a tendency to
               of its
 obstruct        flow somewhat, and thus keep               longer under the

the tube very slowly, the issuing gas, when inhaled, produces a
painful burning sensation in the lungs and causes violent coughing,
which persists for a considerable time.
    When oxygen is used, it is found that the electrodes must be se
parated to a much greater distance than is necessary for air, otherwise
sparks pass and destroy a large proportion of the ozone already
formed.     With air, the direct spark in the apparatus could not be
made to pass over an interval of more than 7 centims. ; but in oxygen
they did not cease until the poles were separated about 11.5 centims.
When the tube was filled with air and the poles were 7 or 8 centims.
apart, the discharge was of the silent kind; but on admitting oxygen
it immediately took the form of direct sparks.
    The quantity of the solution used in these experiments was much
greater than would be needed in order to exhibit the characteristic
reactions of ozone to an audience of moderate size.         One half or
 one third of the amount would be quite sufficient; and the time re
 quired for the reaction would be proportionally shorter.     The great
quantity of the ozone, as well as the ease and rapidity with which it
is produced, render the apparatus especially serviceable for use in
the lecture-room.—Silliman's American Journal for       July  1872.
  ON A SINGULAR APPEARANCE OF MAGNESIUM IN THE CHROMO
    SPHERE OF THE SUN.          By M. TAccHINI, IN A LETTER AD
    DRESSED TO M. FAYE.
    I have just observed a phenomenon which is altogether new in the
 series of my observations.     I had already, from the 6th of May,
 discovered in the sun    regions remarkable by the presence of mag
 nesium—very extensive regions, i.e. comprising arcs of 12–168°,
 whilst preceding observations give arcs of only 66° at the most.
    At the meeting of our Société des Sciences on the 18th of May,
 I  presented  a drawing of the entire margin, executed May 6, with
 indications of the position of the magnesium, and added some special
 considerations on the observations of the following days. Although
 the extent of the magnesium showed itself always considerable, I
 noticed that the longest and most characteristic streaks were found
 on the western limb, as I had proved also, for the preceding obser
 vations, in the Bulletin de l'Observatoire, 1871, No. 9. This pre
 dilection, as it were, for the western limb was difficult to account
 for; consequently it was of interest to continue the study of the
 magnesium-lines all round the margin; and this I am doing every
 morning when the atmosphere is clear and calm.
    At last, on the 18th of June, I was able to verify the presence of
 magnesium in every part of the solar margin—that is to say, that
 the whole chromosphere was invaded by vapours of that metal. To
 this general ebullition (which accords so well with your theory)
 corresponded an absence of protuberances, which seems to me very
 natural; on the contrary, the flames of the chromosphere were very
 pronounced and brilliant. I seemed to be witnessing the renewal of
 the surface of our grand source of light.
    The more pronounced and brilliant the flames, the brighter and

160                         Intelligence            and Miscellaneous Articles.
broader appeared the magnesium-lines.       At 288° very brilliant and
characteristic flames were observed ; I said at the time, to some
persons who happened to be present, that at that point there must
certainly be a fine facula.   In fact, on examining the sun by projec
tion, we discovered at the place indicated a very luminous facula
which was precisely on the limb of the sun; this was one of those
verifications which I have repeated by myself so many times, with
perfect accordance. The granulations showed very distinct; and
on the contour of the disk the number of small faculae was every
where in accordance with the presence of magnesium.
   At each position of the spectroscope I likewise noted the relative
intensity of the lines; and I many times observed that the varia
tions of breadth of the lines corresponded perfectly with the varia
tions of luminous intensity of the chromospheric flames observed
through the line C.
   The great abundance of magnesium still continues to be manifested,
but no longer on the whole margin.
   These observations seem to me to demonstrate that we ought to
admit, not local eruptions, but rather complete eruptions—that is to
say, a mixture of certain metallic vapours with the chromosphere, a
mixture which extends to every part of the surface of the sun, which
must consequently be in the gaseous state.
   More than one person have told me that at the present time
the light of the sun has not                                   its
                                     ordinary appearance; and we                                                       at
the  observatory  have   thought  we noticed the same thing.      This
change should      attributed    the magnesium.

                                              entirely independent
follows that the current through one coil is
of the total resistance in the other; and as the two coils are sup
posed to have equal magnetic momenta and equal resistances,
                                                  becoming equal ;
balance can only be established by the currents
that is to say, at or near balance each coil must receive a current

to be measured, and which is supposed to be
given electromotive force of the  testing battery.
   At balance the diagram of this differential galvanometer is
therefore represented by fig. 1.

   Now, as far as the magnetic effect of the two coils is                    con
cerned, we may substitute                  for

signated by p.    It must be borne in mind that p represents an
absolute number,   which theoretically may be any thing with the
exception of 0 and oc.   If p had a value equal to either of these
two limits, the instrument would be a simple galvanometer with
a shunt, and not a differential galvanometer.

    Now it is clear that equations (II.) and (II'.) are not necessarily
identical, as long as p does not fulfil certain conditions, and
therefore the first set of equations (II.) and (1) may give entirely
different values for g and g’ from those obtained from the second

    XXII.     On an Electrical Experiment                with an Insulated Room.

S9).        ten years ago, in a series of articles in ‘The Electri
       cian,” afterwards   published in book-form,        submitted    I
some new views on the      explanation    of the action which takes
place in various well-known electrical phenomena.            endea          I
voured to prove by reasoning that the ordinary explanations
given of the discharge of a charged conductor by communica
tion with the ground were erroneous; and           suggested an ex I
periment with an insulated room as a means of proving the
fallacy of these ordinary explanations of discharge &c. This
experiment        I
               performed in May 1869 at Keyham Dockyard; and
I  think the results are worth placing on record.
    To make the bearing of the experiment intelligible, however,
it is necessary to recapitulate a little of what have before urged.I
    It is generally stated in books on electricity, that, when an
 electrical machine has its rubber to earth, on the action of the
machine the prime conductor becomes charged positively and
the equal quantity of negative electricity which is generated is
lost in the earth—and that when the prime conductor is then
placed in contact with earth,                 its
                                      discharge    merely the conse

quence      of   its
                sharing     electricity with the earth, the propor

tion remaining        the conductor being,
                       on                        virtue       in
                                                           the almost  of
infinite size     of
                 the earth    compared as with the conductor,  almost
infinitely small and consequently quite inappreciable.
I     will not weary your readers                by
                                        quoting, but will merely refer
them     to:—Professor Daniell’s “Chemical Philosophy,           241;           p.

    When, therefore, the ordinary experiment of charging the
prime conductor is performed in an insulated room, according
to the theories which I deny, the negative electricity being
unable to share itself with the earth, some differences in the
effects produced should be attained.              The negative electricity,
for   instance,   if it tends to flow to the earth, should influence
an electrometer placed in contact and exterior to the room.
Again, if the room is connected to the earth during the charging
of the prime conductor and is afterwards insulated, the prime
conductor, if touched to the room, ought not to be discharged,
 since it can only share                  its
                                   electricity with the room instead                                             of

    The room was about 8 feet by 9 and about 8 feet high.
 The floor was of wood, and the sides of wooden framework
 covered with calico and with pieces of tinfoil pasted about it
 to make it a good conductor. It had a door and two windows
 of wire gauze. A small table was placed in        and  frictional                           it,         a
 electrical machine was placed      this. The room was suspended

 wooden    frame, the floor being about    feet from the ground.                4
 The gutta percha was covered with paraffin; and the whole room
 was tested for insulation with five hundred Daniell’s elements
 with   delicate astatic Thomson’s reflecting-galvanometer,

gave        no

 on the ground outside; and                           of a A

                            to the window.     The table was con

prime conductor with the rubber connected to surrounding ob
jects, consists simply of the resistance of the dielectric sepa
 rating the prime conductor from the surrounding objects,
 and is therefore the same whether the room is connected to
earth or not.   More complete views on this subject will be found
in what         I
          have written before, both in my ‘Electrical Accumu
lation’ and in a paper “ on Inductive Circuits, or the Application
of Ohm’s Law to Problems of Electrostatics,” in the Philoso
phical Magazine for May 1868.
   Dr. Ferguson, in his ‘Electricity, seems to have a tendency to
discard the older explanations; but at times his explanations ap
pear to me incomplete, so that it is impossible to form an opinion
as to what his theory is as regards the actions that take place.
   The following paragraph, however, appears to me remarkable,
as    it   seems to show a tendency towards the theory which                                                      I   have
advocated:—
     “We        have hitherto taken                         no notice for             of the   -E that,                   in
stance, is said to be lost in the ground when glass is charged
positively.   Now it may be lost, and the                   induced by the               –E

it.   But       also possible, nay, even probable+, that this —E

back towards that point the aether which is in the vicinity of a.
As soon as the rarefaction about a has reached a certain limit,
the molecules enter a new state of equilibrium, which they pre
serve as long as the increase of density at a continues.              now                        If
the increase suddenly ceases, the molecules about a resume their
primitive equilibrium, and in this case travel, although in the
opposite direction, the same path as when the density was                                              in
creasing.
    A corresponding modification must be effected in the state of
equilibrium of the surrounding molecules if the aether at a be
rarefied instead of compressed; but in this case the direction of
the motion of the molecules is the reverse of what it was in the
preceding: they approach a at the commencement of the rare
faction, and recede therefrom when it ceases; and the amount of
displacement is the same in the approach as in the recession. It
is moreover evident that the modification of the state of equili
 brium of a molecule, or the amount of                               its
                                                 displacement, does not

   Now this formula expresses the induction of the first instant
only, before the molecules both of the wire and of the surround
ing medium have been able to quit their primitive positions of
equilibrium.      But the induction continues until the new posi
tions of  equilibrium    are reached, when the inductive force be
comes zero.       The force of induction undergoes a continual
diminution from the commencement to the end of the duration
of the induction; and formula (15) only gives the maximum
value during the first instant. The result should be, that at the
commencement of their existence induction-currents appear very
strong and then diminish in intensity—a fact which has been
proved by experiment+.             then, we wish     If,  calculate the                      to

     follows from this that the induction of the clement ds is
the same in both the halves into which the induced circuit is
divided by the plane of y2, and that the induced currents go in the
direction inverse to that of the inducing current on the same side.
   But it is evident that each element of the inducing circle has
the same inducing action as the element ds above considered.

cedure Dr. Sundell has made some experiments, which have
given no certain appreciable results; and this likewise cor
roborates the theoretic deduction explained above.
   The true law of induction between two clements is therefore
expressed     by the above-given formula (20). In virtue of the
principles on which our present theoretic investigations are
founded, it is evident that the formula in question applies also
to the case in which induction takes place with a current of
constant intensity, resulting from the distance between the                                                        in

are   governed             by
                      D'Alembert’s     Principle.      These three axioms
being granted, mathematical reasoning founded upon them leads
to   general differential equations, from the integrals                 which                               of

means   of the factor       ;       As there is an analytical distinction be
tween these two cases, according to the before-cited rule there
must exist, consistently with the principle of geometrical conti
nuity, a corresponding difference in the actual circumstances of
the motion.       It
                 is possible to point out such difference by em
 ploying the following argument. In case [udr] be an exact
 differential, the equation [udw]=0 is the differential equation of
 a surface the curvature of which is generally finite, and conti
 nuous through at least an indefinitely small extent.         Hence it
 follows, since the normals converge to two focal lines, that the
form of the element to which the coordinates a, y, z apply at the
 time t is undergoing change.       The same is the case with respect
 to  any other  element,  the continual change of form of identical
 portions of matter being a general characteristic of a fluid mass
 in motion. But it is also possible that a mass of fluid may
 under certain circumstances move in such manner that each ele
 ment continues to be of the same form throughout the motion—
 for instance, if the fluid rotate about a fixed axis, and the velocity
be a function   of the distance from the axis. For by the prin
ciple  of easy divisibility  the fluid may in that case be conceived
to be divided into indefinitely thin cylindrical shells, having as
their common axis the axis of the motion, the velocity of rota
tion of any shell being at the same time a function of the dis
tance from the axis.         Also on the same principle each shell
might have, in addition, a motion of translation parallel to the
axis, the form of every element of the shell still remaining
constant.
   8. In articles 18 to 25 of the communication in the June
Number I have shown that for the above-mentioned cases of con
stancy of form of the elements in motion, [udw] is integrable by
a factor, and that this analytical circumstance not only proves
that such motions are compatible with the principle of geome
trical continuity, but also distinguishes them from               all
                                                           other mo

                            in
tions under which these motions satisfy the general equations
 (b)and (c), whence      appears that they must

under that condition.
   14. Respecting the origination of the gradations of atomic den
sity, it will suffice for my present purpose to say that in galvanism
the producing cause appears to be chemical action between dis
similar substances in contact; in magnetism the act of magneti
zing may be supposed to generate a gradation of atomic density
which is afterwards maintained, with more or less persistence,
by the intrinsic atomic and molecular forces of the magnetized
body; and in frictional electricity the friction seems to superin
duce an abnormal state of equilibrium of the atoms of an ex
tremely thin superficial stratum of the electrified substance,
together with an interior gradation of        atomic density, depend its
ing,    asdegree and permanence,

which is an exact equation, applying to the fluid at every point
of space it occupies, provided it is acted upon by no extraneous
force.   It will be seen that I have not here substituted the con
stant a' for a, as in art. 8 of the Theory of Magnetism, the reason
being that, according to the hydrodynamical principles which                                                         I
have long maintained, the substitution is not required when the
motion is steady.
   17. Respecting the above expression for p, it is to be ob
served that it not only applies to the whole of the fluid in steady
motion, but applies also whether the steady motion be simple or
be compounded of two or more steady motions.        For, according
to  hydrodynamics,  such motions    may coexist, and the resultant
is consequently steady motion. (See ‘Principles of Mathematics
and Physics, pp. 242 & 243.)       As V will always be very small
compared with a, instead of equation (d) we may use

  18. Let us conceive, at first, the spherical atom to be fixed,
and to be acted upon by a stream of the aether in steady motion.
Then if the lines of motion were parallel, the distribution of
density on the surface of the sphere, due to the sphere's reaction,
would be symmetrical with respect to a plane through         centre                                     its

cause these   rectilinear motions are produced under arbitrary
conditions.   Besides, it does not appear that for such motions
*  has the character of a maximum or minimum. The validity
of the foregoing argument is confirmed by the fact, which I
think I have on previous occasions sufficiently certified, that the
two cases of rectilinear motion just mentioned cannot be mathe
matically treated with success till the circumstances and laws of
the rectilinear motion now under consideration       have been as
certained.
    26.    It is
              further to be noticed that, as the indication of recti
linear motion was arrived at by employing one general equation
without reference to the other two, the result is not of general
application, and we are not compelled to infer from it that the
motion is always and everywhere rectilinear. Yet, according to
the rule already laid down, the indication must be significant,
and cannot without error be left out of consideration on proceed
ing to draw inferences from the other two equations.           Accord
          I
ingly propose the following course of reasoning.
   As the motion is not exclusively rectilinear,             supposed                 let
                                                                                        it   be

vibrations of an elastic fluid agrees, to the first order of small
quantities, with that which is commonly adopted.              For instance,
I solve the    problem    of the resistance of the air to the vibrations
of a ball-pendulum exactly as Poisson has done.                Also the re
verse problem of the acceleration of a ball by vibrations of the
air, which is more to my present purpose,             have solved to the   I
same approximation in an analogous manner.                 From the solu
tion of the latter problem it appears that, so far as is indicated
by the first approximation, aetherial waves produce vibratory
motions of the atoms without permanent motion of translation.
The impression of such vibrations on the atoms of nerves of the
eye may be considered to be the proximate cause of the sensation
of light.
    29. In order, therefore, to determine whether the aetherial
vibrations are capable of giving to atoms a permanent motion of
translation, which is a question of essential importance in the
proposed theory of the physical forces, it is necessary to proceed
to the second approximation. The obvious way of doing this
would seem to be to start from the first approximation, and then
make use of         it,
                    according       the usual rules,      advancing

          of
partially successful.   The arguments employed for this purpose
 in pp. 439–455 and         pp. 490–498
                                   in         the above-mentioned     of

 204         Prof. Challis on   the Hydrodynamical Theory     of
work involve two unknown constants H1 and H2, for which no
analytical expressions are obtained, and their values are conse
quently left undetermined. On this account the theories which
attribute the forces of heat, molecular attraction, and gravity to
action on the atoms by pressure of the aether in vibration are
incomplete.         Recently, however, a different course of reasoning
has occurred to me, which, although it does not directly meet the
difficulties of the second approximation, seems to give an intel
ligible account of the way in which vibrations of an elastic fluid
are capable of producing an accelerated motion of translation of
a small sphere.         This new process     I shall now endeavour to
explain.
   31. Supposing at first the small sphere to be fixed, let a series
of plane-undulations be incident upon it in a given direction.
Then, if a line of abscissae (w) be drawn in that direction through
the centre of the sphere, it is evident that the whole of the mo
tion and condensation will be symmetrical with respect to this
line as an axis, and that the condensation (a) on the surface of
the sphere will be a function of a and t.             We may therefore
make the      general   assumption  that a =  a, f(r,t),  and take a, to
be the condensation at the time t in the          plane  perpendicular to
the axis through the centre of the sphere, so far as it is unaf
fected by the disturbance of the motion by the reaction of the
sphere.       (I have reason from previous researches to say that
throughout this plane, and therefore where it cuts the surface of
the sphere, the condensation has that same value ar.) The un
dulations are supposed to be incident in the positive direction
of  ar.
   32. Now there are three circumstances            which determine the
distribution of condensation on the surface of the sphere: first,
the reaction of the sphere against the incident vibrations causes
a certain annount of condensation, which is so much the smaller
as the sphere is smaller, and for spheres the diameters of which
are very small compared with X is extremely small; secondly, after
taking account of the condensation produced by this reaction,
the proper condensation of the incident undulations is not im
mediately disturbed, and is therefore, cateris paribus, the same
at the surface of the sphere that it would have been at the same
points if the sphere had not been there; but, thirdly, the distri
bution of the condensation is modified by the circumstance that
the undulations are composed of spontaneous direct and trans
verse vibrations, in consequence of which, when they are dis
turbed by incidence on the sphere, lateral action is brought into
play. The kind of effect thence resulting may be conceived of
as follows.       If undulations of very small breadth were incident
on a    very  large  sphere, the condensations which reach the further

half of the surface would be much diminished by reason of their
limited lateral divergence on being transmitted beyond the first
half.   In extreme cases a portion of the fluid in contact with the
second hemispherical surface might be altogether undisturbed.
On the other hand, if waves of large breadth were incident on a
small sphere, the condensations might become by lateral diver
gence greater on the second half surface than on the first, because
the conditions of the motion would approximate to those of
spontaneous motions along an axis, in which the condensation
corresponding to a given velocity is greater than in plane- com
posite waves in the ratio of a” to        Accordingly,     far    a”.

action      of
          the spontaneous vibrations takes effect, the condensa
tion     the surface might either decrease
           on                                      increase                            or                      as   a    is

206            Prof. Challis on the Hydrodynamical Theory of
the acceleration of the sphere by the proper condensation of the
undulation has a constant ratio to the acceleration of the fluid
where the sphere is situated.     Now, since the fluid is just as
much accelerated in the condensed as in the rarefied parts of the
wave, the positive and negative velocities being exactly equal
(art. 27), it follows that the sphere, not being of variable den
sity like the fluid, is acted upon by greater accelerative forces
when in the condensed part of a wave than when it is in the
rarefied part.    Since, however, for each part the positive accele
rative forces are exactly equal to the negative, there is no residual
accelerative action in either direction, and therefore no tendency
to produce permanent translation.

For taking the next step in the argument reference is to be made
to a law already admitted (art. 27), according to which the vi
 brations of an unlimited elastic fluid must be such that for every
acceleration and movement of a particle in a given direction
 there must be an equal acceleration and movement of the same
in the opposite direction. Let therefore a, and a<U+017F> be conden
 sations corresponding to movements so related.           Then we shall
 have

 no arbitrary constant being added, because plainly a, and a<U+017F>

 be one positive and the other negative.          Let o' be negative, so
 that it   belongs  to the rarefied portion    of a wave. Then, since

 to the condensed portion; as plainly should be the case.           Also,
  from the above equation,
  Therefore
   This equation gives the residual acceleration of the atom when
   the actions upon it at any two corresponding positions in the
   condensed and rarefied portions of an undulation are taken into
   account simultaneously; whence it may be inferred that the
   total condensations and rarefactions accompanying every com
   plete vibration of the fluid backwards and forwards produce on
   the whole an acceleration of the sphere in the direction of the
   propagation of the waves if H be negative, and in the opposite
   direction if that quantity be positive.      These effects correspond
   respectively to repulsive and attractive forces.

double what it was at zero Centigrade.       Even their velocity
through glass is 55,000 times less than the speed of aetherial
undulations, and the extreme slowness of change of temperature
in the “conduction of heat” (as contrasted with the rapidity
with which the vibrations of the aether exhaust themselves, be
coming insensible almost instantaneously when the action of the
exciting cause ceases) marks distinctly the essential difference
between molecular and aetherial vibrations.      It appears to me,
therefore, a very crude hypothesis to imagine a combination of
atherio-molecular vibrations as accounting for the very minute
difference in the retardation of doubly refracted rays in crystals.

212           Dr. H. Hudson       on Wave-Theories     of
equal and enormous self-repulsion or elasticity and both existing
in equal quantities throughout space, whose vibrations take place
in perpendicular planes, the two media being mutually indiffer
ent, neither attracting nor repelling.
   Common light, therefore, will consist of waves (equal in every
respect and undistinguishable by our organs of vision) in each
medium, the vibrations being in a plane perpendicular to the
direction of the wave's progress.        But the reflected ray in the
one medium will, I conceive, present the qualities of the refracted
ray in the other; and it is manifestly impossible, no matter how
perfectly similar they may appear to be, that any interference
can take place between waves thus propagated independently in
different media.
    By this slight modification of the physical conception on which
                              I
the wave-theory is founded believe every difficulty will be re
moved, and the cause of the equal quantities of polarized light
 obtained by reflection and refraction is obvious.
   I  think we have a proof of the existence of two distinct media
 in the aether in the fact that the “ordinary” and “extraordinary”
 rays (when produced by two similar plates of the same crystal in
 rectangular positions) will interfere, whereas the two rays of the
same denomination (even when brought into the same plane) are
 incapable of interference.      The reason is obvious if the two or
 dinary rays (thus produced) are in different media, while the
 ordinary ray from one plate and the extraordinary ray from the
 other are in the same medium.         As a further test of the hypo
 thesis, I beg to suggest an attempt, experimentally, to make the
 “ordinary refracted” ray (through Iceland spar) show any indi

    With regard       calorific waves,    believe that they are due

   In reference  toluminiferous (or transversal) vibrations, Fres

being transversal and unaccompanied by any change of density

In this case it is obvious we cannot have recourse to a “theory
of exchanges;  ” and yet the explanation of the phenomena must,
I conceive, on the undulatory theory be similar for both light
and heat.         I
               may add that a diminution of the index of refrac
tion produced   by increasing the temperature of a medium (as
shown   experimentally  by Gladstone, Dale, and Landolt) appears
an obvious consequence of the views here indicated.
   Whether we consider the case of sound, light, or heat, there
can be no doubt that “intensity’ depends on the amplitude of
vibration, and quality (viz. pitch in music, and colour or refran
gibility in light and heat) depends on the number of vibrations
in a given time.    Increased temperature thus represents greater
amplitude of the vibrations of the molecules of matter as con
tradistinguished from those of their associated aether, which,
however, we must consider as generally synchronizing with the
former, although their number per second must be enormously
greater.
     When   we consider molecular motions separately, we can
scarcely   doubt that the momenta of the molecules (W x
 W) of two bodies at the same temperature are equal; that is
 to say, the “velocity of vibration ” (in chemical language “the
 capacity for heat”) varies inversely as the molecular weight—a
 deduction which is in accordance with experiment.
    A curious consequence appears to flow from these views when
 we compare the same substance at the same temperature in dif
jerent states of aggregation.   Thus water and ice at zero Centi
 grade have the same molecular momentum.            But the specific
 heat of ice is only  one half that of water (viz. as 0-5050: 1),
 therefore the molecule of ice should be to that of water as 2: 1
 (to maintain their equal momenta). Again, in comparing water
 and steam (at the boiling-point), their specific heats (as 1:0:4805
 per Regnault) appear in like manner to indicate a ratio of 2:1,
 whence it would in fact follow that the molecular weight of
 water is only one half of the molecular weight of either ice or
 steam | Thus if the molecular weight of steam be taken as 9
of (in
     accordance with hydrogen's gaseous unit), then the molecule
    water can only      4.5, and the atomic weights
                              be                            hydrogen      of

matter, from which they can be separated and a portion trans
ferred at pleasure from one surface to another without losing
their distinctive properties.           I
                                  believe, therefore, that they must
be admitted to have a real existence, and cannot be regarded as
mere motion or as properties of matter.        Assuming this, it ap
pears to me that Wheatstone's experiment with the revolving
mirror leaves no doubt that electricity consists of two self-repel
lent fluids, and can no longer be considered merely the excess or
 deficiency of a single fluid.
    In addition to the above properties, it is generally assumed
 that there is a mutual attraction between the two fluids; but a
 careful consideration of the phenomena has led me to the conclu
 sion that this opinion is erroneous, and that they are mutually in
different.
    An experiment    of Mohr’s appears to me strongly in favour of
this  view;   viz. when an electrized body was placed at 1 centim.
from one end of an insulated cylinder (65 centims. long), the
neutral point was found to be at only 1 centim. from this extre
mity of the cylinder.            If
                               attraction existed between the two
electricities, we should expect a large accumulation of the oppo
site fluid at the end of the cylinder nearest to the charged body,
while the actual result appears plainly to indicate MERELY a re
pulsion of the electricity of the same denomination with that of
the charged body.
    The facility with which the two fluids are separated even by
the slightest friction, and their not instantly disappearing again
 (as separate entities) when eliminated, first excited a suspicion
 on this point, which has grown up into a firm belief that      the               all
statical phenomena           supposed       to
                                       establish mutual attraction can
 beaccounted for            by
                        the attraction                of
                                               each for matter and the
self-repulsion of  each fluid.   Assuming,      therefore, this                   be
                                                                          to to

soning (1) that the weight    W will fall, and (2) that it will not
fall.       The same may be said of the other arguments.      Now,
whether air obey Boyle's law or not, surely an ideal fluid may
be imagined which shall do so without any inherent contradic
tion. However interesting Mr. Moon's problems may be as
logical paradoxes, they convey no information on the physical
question which is under discussion.
   In his restatement of the analytical arguments by which it is
proved that p is a function of v, Mr. Moon has made some
alterations the effect of which is to obviate the objection that                                        I
urged in the July Number.
     “If we have three relations,

where the forms of fi,              f.

        In
       the second place,                            I
                               wish to observe that even if Mr. Moon
were right in rejecting Boyle's law when there is relative mo
tion, it would still be without physical significance to express p
as a function of v. That this might be done in any particular
case of motion in one dimension is admitted; but the statement,
though true, would express, as it stands, no physical law. What
the pressure at any point of a fluid in motion may be under pre
scribed circumstances is (as                                      I
                                         said before) a purely physical
question; and we are agreed,                                     I
                                        believe, that the magnitude of
the actual velocity at the point, whether measured absolutely or
relatively to other parts of the fluid at a distance, has nothing to
                   of it.
                                                                                                                  of        as

   contact with the sides of the flask, does not undergo in one or many
  points a notable diminution of surface-tension.
       II.  That if we deposit on the surface of a supersaturated saline
   solution a drop of a liquid of feeble tension, it spreads, and crystal
   lization takes place immediately or after a short time.
      III.   That while a liquid of feeble tension produces crystallization
  after a time more or less short, a liquid of considerable contractile
  force (such as pure water) not acting chemically on the solution, may
  be brought into contact with it without producing change of state.
      IV.   That as a liquid of feeble tension produces crystallization, so
  a solid covered more or less with a film of such liquid produces change
  of state, either at once or after a short time.
      But before any conclusions could be drawn from the results of
  experiments as to the relation between the surface-tension of liquids
  and the state of supersaturation in saline solutions, it was necessary
  to measure the surface-tension of the solutions of Glauber's salt
 operated on. Accordingly the following data were determined, first,
 for a solution containing 1 part of salt to 1 of water, and, secondly,
 for a solution containing 2 parts of salt to 1 of water. The dia
 meter of the capillary tube was 1:598 millim.*
         Specific gravity of the solution l salt to 1 water at 17°C. =
             1.
         The capillary height     11 millims.
         The specific gravity of the other solution = 1.289.
         The capillary height 8-7 millims.
      These data give, according to the formula        t- r. h. d       (in which
 t is the    tension, h the height, d the density, and r the radius of the
 tube), for the superficial tensions of the solutions in question, not
 a greater value than from 4 to 5’2.
      If  the states of supersaturation of saline solutions depend on the
 maintenance of surface-tension, according to the first proposition,
 any force or substance that produces a notable diminution of such
 tension will cause the state of supersaturation to cease.
      Such a force is heat, while such substances as camphor, benzoic
acid, &c. have a marked effect in lowering the superficial tension of
water, and in doing so undergo those remarkable gyrations which are
so    well known.
      And first with respect to heat, applied not so as to affect the
whole solution, but locally, so as to raise the temperature at one part
or point of the surface, while the other parts remained at the tem
perature of the atmosphere.
     Experiment 1. Four flasks, each about half full of a supersaturated
solution of Glauber's salt (2 salt to 1 water), were exposed to a tem
perature of 32°F. for an hour. A red-hot poker was then passed
down the neck of each flask, and in two of them the hot metal was
brought into contact with the surface of the solution so as to raise a
volume of vapour. There was no separation of salt in any one case.

  ether, of alcohol, and of similar volatile liquids, as well as of certain
  oils, both volatile and fixed, spread over the surface of the solutions
 and act as powerful nuclei.             On the surface-tension theory, a liquid
 such as ether, of which the tension= 1.88, or alcohol =2'5, or wood

     Mr. Mallet also explained the dynamic conditions under which the
water from water-bearing beds, such as that of ooze beneath the
Cachar clay-beds, becomes elevated in the fissures formed, and gave
approximate expressions for the minimum height to which the water
can rise in relation to the velocity of the elastic wave particle. The
paper concluded with some explanatory remarks upon the continual
noises, like the irregular fire of distant artillery, heard long after
the shock had passed, and when the country had become perfectly
 quiescent.

 Oldham, and forwarded to Mr. Mallet, illustrative of the physical
features of the huge earth-fissures and other effects of this earth
 quake, were exhibited to the Fellows present, and are well worthy
 of attentive study.

    ON  THE INFLUENCE        OF PRESSURE  IN THE PHENOMENA        OF EN
            DOSMOSE     AND EXOSMOSE.      B.Y. M. BECQUEREL.
          various causes to which the phenomena of endosmose, exos
 THE   mose, diffusion, and dialysis are due have been the object of the
important researches of Dutrochet, Graham, Liebig, and other physi
 cists and chemists, who have determined the part that each of them
 contributes in the production of the phenomena observed; but they
 have not taken into consideration all the conditions which intervene
 in that production, especially the following:—(1) the pressure which
 acts as soon as endosmose has raised the level of one of the liquids
 above that of the other, whence results a filtration, through the se
 parating film, of the most pressed liquid towards that which is less
 so, the effects of which appear to be subject to very simple laws, as
 we shall see; (2) the formation of an insoluble compound by the
 reaction of the two liquids upon each other when this takes place,
 a case which had not yet been examined; (3) the action of the
  electrocapillary currents resulting from the same reaction, which I
 have already brought before the Academy in several memoirs.
     I commence by giving a very succinct analysis of the researches
  of Dutrochet and Graham, as well as of those of Magnus and Liebig,
  on endosmose, in order the better to establish the relation of the
  effects which they observed to those about to be considered, relative
  to the influence of pressure on the filtration which takes place
  through a capillary film—an influence which makes itself perceptible
  in the phenomena of endosmose and exosmose, as well as in the
  effects resulting from the circulation of liquids in the tissues of
  living bodies, especially of the blood in the arteries and veins. Two
 apparatus were set up to exert pressures up to 2500 millims. of
  water or another liquid, and were provided with a cathetometer
  which permitted the determination of the height of the liquid columns

with great accuracy.       For diaphragm I took successively parch
ment paper, bladder, and a porous vessel of unglazed porcelain.
The results obtained show that the ratios between the quantities
of liquid which pass through and the mean pressures are constant;
that     is,
         whatever       the liquid, the quantity which passes through
                                  be
in   agiven time      proportional
                                 is      the mean pressure, alcohol not

excepted.
 I   have found that, during the filtration, the outside           the porous                           of
vessel becomes covered with bubbles proceeding from the air con
tained      the water and
               in               the diaphragm, which

passing through the latter          consequence        the capillary affinity

              upon the liquid. These bubbles, more
                    it                                       less obstructing                      or
the pores, render the filtration irregular—an inconvenience which                                                       is
in  great part got rid                           by

force the sulphate through the diaphragm; I did not succeed in
doing so.    In seven hours the column was lowered one sixth ; but,
what is remarkable, the stalactites were not formed; merely a not
very thick and pretty compact layer of crystals of sulphate of lime
was deposited on the surface in contact with the sulphate solution.
The pressure therefore hindered the formation of the stalactites and
the passage of the sulphate solution into that of the nitrate.
    Some filtration-experiments were also made with defibrinated
blood under 150 millims. pressure of mercury, equal to that of the
 blood in the arteries; the filtrate consisted of serum only.               -
    It is to be presumed that in the arteries, under the pressure of
 150 millims. to which the blood is subject, there must be an infil
 tration of serosity through the walls of the arteries in quantities
 proportional to the variations of the pressure. It has been said above,
 that the flow through the organic membrane distended the cells;
 under the empire of life nothing like this should take place, at least
 in the normal state; equilibrium in the constitution of the vessels
 must be constantly maintained.
     We have now some conception of the possible origin of exosmose:
 it is due partly to diffusion, and partly to the filtration resulting from
 the pressure of the column of liquid resulting from endosmose.                       I
 conceive that it was hardly sensible in the experiments of Graham,
 who operated with large surfaces affording but little elevation to the
 liquid columns resulting from the endosmose.          Dutrochet was right
 in saying that exosmose transports more of salts than endosmose, as
  exosmose results partly from pressure, which causes the liquid to
 filter through with the salt which it holds in solution.—Comptes

    ON   THE ACTION   OF OZONE UPON VULCANIZED CAOUTCHOUC.

        As nothing containing sulphur had been used about the apparatus,
 the acid was evidently derived from the ebonite itself. The first
thought was that the material had been heated in the process of
vulcanization sufficiently to oxidize the sulphur; but as the sulphu
rous oxide, if thus formed, would be dissipated by the heat, this
could hardly be regarded as the source of the sulphuric acid, especially
as the latter did not appear until after the apparatus had been used.
It is well known that vulcanized caoutchouc is affected by ozone,
and that the ordinary rubber tubes through which it is passed are
attacked and quickly perforated by                 seemed most probable, then,

insulators; and experiments were made which entirely confirmed

sulphurous acid, this in turn being converted into sulphuric acid by
the further action of the ozone.   The absorption of moisture from
the atmosphere by the sulphuric acid produces the dew-like deposits
observed.
   The deleterious effect upon the insulators can be remedied by
neutralizing the acid with some substance which will not form a
hygroscopic compound or essentially lessen the insulating power of
the ebonite.     I have used oxide and carbonate of magnesium with
very good effect. A little of either of these substances in fine pow
der is sprinkled upon a soft cloth or piece of chamois leather and
rubbed over the insulators. The excess is removed with a wet cloth,
and the surface, after drying, cleaned and polished by rubbing with
a soft woollen cloth very slightly moistened with carbonic disulphide.
As the ebonite is attacked by the latter substance, care should be
observed, in employing          use only it,    to

litate the polishing process without injuring the surface. The
ebonite may            be

  Among the products obtained in consequence of slow actions in
a vessel    hermetically sealed during twenty years, and which have
their analogues in nature, I will mention the following:—
   (1) Some crystals of arragonite, formed upon a piece of gypsum
shaped like a spearhead, 1 decim. in length and 1 centim. in thick
ness, digested in a solution of bicarbonate of potash contained in a
vessel hermetically sealed; the sulphate of lime almost entirely dis
appeared, and there remained a thick coating of crystals of arragonite.
    (2) Operating with a solution of subcarbonate produced rhombo
hedric crystals of carbonate of lime.
    (3) A similar piece of gypsum, kept during the same time in con
tact with a solution of arseniate of ammonia, gave crystals of arseniate
 of lime, perhaps as fine as the natural ones.
    (4) With a solution of aluminate of potass and gypsum, I obtained
 crystallized double sulphate of lime and potass, which is no other
 than glauberite in which soda has been replaced by potass.
    (5) Pieces of galena, immersed during twenty years in a solution
 of bicarbonate of potass, gave well-characterized crystals of carbonate
 of lead belonging to the system of the right prism with rhombic base.
    (6) With pieces of limestone immersed in a solution of plumbate
 of potass, I obtained hydrated carbonate of lead in crystalline scales
                                                             w
 with a nacreous aspect.
    (7) Malachite (bibasic carbonate of copper) I had already obtained
 by the reaction of a solution of nitrate of copper upon limestone to
 change it into submitrate, which was then digested with bicarbonate
 of soda to form a double carbonate, which was decomposed with a
 fresh solution of nitrate of copper.       Working thus I obtained a
 crust of more or less thickness adhering to the surface of the lime
 stone.     I studied this formation again, modifying the process. The
 limestone was in slabs of 1 centim. thickness; and the operation
 took place in vacuo, in order that the solutions might penetrate the
interior of the slabs and the gases formed there escape.  By working
with a solution not much concentrated, it was ascertained that the
first two transformations sufficed for obtaining a slab of malachite
sensibly free from lime and nitric acid, having the same grain as the
limestone; the epigeny, therefore, was complete. The grains are in
the crystalline state. Under high pressures the same result may
probably be obtained with rather compact limestone.
    The effects of the slow actions we have here considered, and
which sometimes produce epigeny (that                is,

tion of nitrate of lime can only issue completely from the pores by
placing the transformed limestone in the vacuum of the air-pump in
contact with the water and renewing it from time to time.
   When the subnitrate is placed in contact with a solution of bicar
bonate of soda to change it into malachite, nitrate of soda remains
for a long time in the pores, which in time effloresces upon the sur
face of the malachite, so great is the molecular attraction exerted by
the walls of the pores upon this compound.
   I do not speak of the electrochemical effects which may intervene
in the actions of which we have spoken, because I have already
described them.

            REPLY      TO PROFESSOR                 CLAUSIU.S.          BY P. G. TAIT.
   Professor Clausius has so long, and so repeatedly, claimed as his
own the correct proof of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, that
no one can be astonished to find him unwilling to allow that his
claims are unfounded.
        I
   But must protest against his making accusations of deliberate
suppression (Absichtlichkeit) &c. and repeating them in the indirect
and offensive form of a statement that he did not apply them to
Sir W. Thomson.
   There has been nothing in the language I have employed, even
had it been tenfold more pointed, which is not admissible in fair and
temperate discussion.                I
                               have made no charges (though strongly
tempted to do so by Professor Clausius's first letter), I have simply
examined historical facts and given what appears to me to be the
natural and inevitable conclusion from them.               But, after having
taken   every  precaution    to insure  accuracy,     to be first accused of
deliberate suppression, and then to be told that the tone of my far
too mild reply renders it impossible for Professor Clausius to continue
the discussion, is a trifle too much.
   In common with           all
                            the scientific friends      have consulted,

                    By MM. JAMIN         and Rich ARD*.
       ULONG and Petit, in their     celebrated work on the laws of
       cooling, studied first the effect of a vacuum.  They found
that the velocity of  cooling   of a thermometer in the centre is
expressed by the formula
                                 v=ma”(a’—1).
   a is an invariable quantity, m a coefficient proportional to the
surface and the emissive power of the thermometer, t + 6 and 6
the temperatures of the thermometer and the enclosure.
   No objection can be made to this law, which has moreover
been confirmed by the admirable researches of De la Provostaye
and Desains.
   The second part of the work, which is devoted to the study of
gases, is not so unexceptionable.   Dulong and Petit, remarking
that in this case the diminution of temperature is more rapid,
assume:—(1) that the radiation persists without alteration, just
as if it took place in vacuo; (2) that the augmentation of the
observed effect represents the cooling-power of the gas.   They
then measure the total velocity of cooling, W, from which they
subtract v (that which would take place in vacuo for the same
values of 6 and       t),   and find that the remainder              v'   satisfies the
relation
                                     v'- mHC#1233.

curves of the values of h, taking the times for abscissae.    They
differ from one   another;  and it is   immediately  seen that the
cooling is as much more rapid as the pressure H is less.
   These curves express the phenomenon graphically; we must
now find the equation.     We thought at first that, the excess of
pressure h being very small, Newton’s law hi-Me-" could be
applied.   Indeed it differs very little from experience, which it
represents well enough for a time not very great; but it cannot
embrace  the whole of the observations.   We made the compari
son by three operations.   First we took, upon the curve, abscissae
in arithmetical progression: the successive ordinates were to be
in a constant ratio; they were not found to be exactly       Then                                       so.

the values of log             (— %)          are represented              by the ordinates of a

   We will indicate how the verifications were made, taking hy

millims,     ...,
              the value of h was observed every five seconds (as
was said before); then, on one and the same sheet of ruled paper,
the values of h were constructed, the time being taken for ab
scissa—which gave as many curves as there were series of ob
servations; and upon these curves the points having equal
ordinates h 200,   190,                ...,
                              were marked by horizontal lines.

250        Mr. T. E. Thorpe                 on an Improved form of Filter-Pump.
The edges of the slit were thus left sharp; and on applying any
outward pressure to the tube they readily adhered, making a
perfectly air-tight conjunction.       The valve was then pushed
within the tube    B,  which was marrowed at the end so as to retain
the caoutchouc tube perfectly air-tight.     The other end of the
caoutchouc tube DD was connected with the vessel to be eva
cuated.    On allowing the water from the main to flow through
the vertical tube, the caoutchouc tube commences to pulsate
rapidly as it falls over the upper edge of the tube A, and periodi
cally closes the opening. The Bunsen valve in consequence
intermittently opens and shuts, and rapid suction is set up; and
it is thus easy to obtain a vacuum equivalent to 0.7 metre of
mercury. The working of the apparatus is obviously akin to
that of the hydraulic ram; so easily and efficaciously does it
exhaust, that it will doubtless take the place of the Bunsen filter
pump. It has the great advantage of portability over the older
form, since it may be so constructed that it can be transported to
any position in the laboratory: it obviates the necessity of a fall
of upwards of 30 feet, and therefore requires no alteration in the
existing arrangements of pipes and fittings; and, lastly,          cost                               its

258          Dr. A. M. Mayer                           on a precise Method              of determining
Barker        I am     also indebted for the iodide used in the experiments
I here present.
    The first use                     I    made of this substance was to track the heat
conducted by bars and plates of metal+; and the sharpness of
the boundary of the colours instigated me to test the value of
this mode of experiment by applying it to a determination of the
elliptical contour of the isothermal of conduction in the principal
section of a quartz crystal.
    Sénarmont, in his beautiful researches on this subject (Ann.
de Ch. et de Ph. S. 3. vols. xxi. & xxii.), has carefully determined
the ratio of the axes of this elliptical figure by coating a thin
longitudinal section of the crystal with wax and leading through
it a silver wire, by means of which heat was brought to the centre
of the plate, whence it was conducted outward, and           progress
                                                                                                     of its
and isothermal contour determined          the melting      the wax.       by

260        On the Boundary of a Wave of Conducted Heat.
    The remarkable change of colour which heat produces in this
iodide led me to hope that this molecular change would be ac
companied by a simultaneous variation in             radiating-power.    its
 To  solve this problem    made the

it,  and caused this      to

these  plates (which had been  purified with hot concentrated sul
phuric acid, distilled water, and ignition in a gas-flame) the
electrical current was passed into and out of the distilled water,
which filled the glass trough to a height of 53.5 millims.     The
specific conducting-power of the distilled water used was, at
15°5 C., about one 4640 millionth of that of mercury.

not as much as 0.0000375 mgrm. of hydrogen was liberated in a
second on the entire surface of the metal electrode; so that the
polarization of the platinum electrodes might be neglected.
   Thick copper wires connected the battery with two mercury
cups, which by a suitable commutator could be connected with
the two brass plates of the air-condenser as used by Kohlrausch”.

elements from each         other is here of very great influence; yet we
cannot calculate on         getting results accurate to 5 per cent. with
positive or negative       electricity, unless the battery be set up with
freshly amalgamated         zinc and platinum plates, with concentrated
nitric acid and dilute sulphuric acid of 1:2 specific gravity, and
the cylinders have lain for several days in just such sulphuric
acid.   I  could not bring the accuracy of the observations nearer
than 2    per   cent. of the entire value, except when         took the      I
mean of a    great  many experiments, while Kohlrausch attained an
accuracy of 1 per cent.       Kohlrausch, indeed, like other observers,
met with    greater   differences in the tensions of the free electricity
of the two    poles  than      I
                              have given; but he used elements which
were filled with badly conducting liquids.          But the liquids in
my Grove’s battery were the best conductors known (apart from
metallic mercury); and hence it was extremely surprising, not
electricity of the two

264            M. G. Quincke on Electrolysis, and the
interpolar wire of the circuit which are in conducting communi
cation with the condenser-plates.       This difference does not vary,
whether the circuit is open or is closed by a resistance which is
very great as compared with that of the circuit itself. In accord
ance with this these experiments show the same quantities of +e
or —e even with varying values of l.
    When the circuit was closed by columns of water of smaller
 section  I obtained the same result.
                                  § 58.
    In another series of experiments the current of a Grove’s bat
 tery of ten elements traversed, in the manner described above, a
 column of water 440 millims. in length, 60.4 millims. in breadth,
 and 46.5 millims. in height.      The brass plates of the condenser
 at a distance of 1 millim. were connected by insulated copper
 wires with the poles of the open circuit, or of the circuit closed
 by the column of water, but ultimately with two Wollaston’s
 electrodes, which were at a distance of 101 millims. from each
 other in the water which was traversed by the electrical current.
 The Wollaston's electrodes consisted of platinum wires 0.076
 millim. in thickness, fused in glass tubes of 2 millims, diameter
 for a length of 35 millims.      By the two circular platinum sur
 faces at the end of these electrodes two analogous points of two
 sections of the column of water were connected with the con
 denser, which sections were therefore at a distance of 101 millims.
 from   each other.   The quantity of electricity accumulated in one
 condenser-plate (while the other plate was connected with the
 earth) must theoretically be proportional to the difference of po
 tentials of the free electricity in the two sections of the linear
  conductor traversed by the current which are connected with
  the condenser, and must thus be proportional to the distance of
  these sections.   Hence it must be immaterial which point of one
  and the same section we connect with the condenser.
     The following Table contains in the second column, under l,
  the distance of the two scetions of the column of water connected
  with the condenser,    under e and —e the positive or negative
  charge of the condenser-plate.     The fifth column gives the mean
  of these two observations, and the last (sixth) column the value of
  this mean calculated from the charge with the open circuit.
  The numbers in the first column give the order in which the
  experiments were made.       In No. 4 each Wollaston's electrode
  was  placed  in the  corner,  in No. 5 in the centre of the corre
  sponding rectangular section of liquid.

the platinum electrodes.    This change in the conducting-power
of the water by  the solution of the glass covering of the elec
trodes would then explain the imperfect agreement of the ob
served and calculated values of the condenser-charges       in the
Table at the beginning of this section; for there would thereby
be produced a change in the curves of the current: the electri
city would no longer flow in the direction of the normal of the
section of the column of water; and so the potential of free elec
tricity could not be constant within the same section.

require a condenser, the thick insulating shellac layers of which
may readily become electrical without         being noticed, and      its

intensity with mirror-reading.     The magnet, which was a steel
ring in a copper sheath with a plane silvered mirror, came to
rest in a few seconds.     From the ends of the resistance W, which
consisted of German-silver spirals, thin silver wires passed to the
 pairs of quadrants of the electrometer. The values of the current
intensity i and the values of u–w, measured by the deflections
of the electrometer, are measured in arbitrary divisions of the
instrument, and are the mean of two positive and two negative
deflections.    The calculation was made with the aid of equations
 (2) and  (4), under the assumption that the resistance R of the
circuit and of the conducting-wires amounted to 10 mercury
 units.

     The deviations of the observed and calculated values are for
measurements     with the multiplier and the electrometer of about
the same   order, and may be explained by the difficulty of avoid
ing alterations in the resistances on the passage of the current.
As resistance decreases in liquids with increase of temperature,
but increases in metals, the influences of the heating of the two
will compensate each other in the action on the multiplier; but in
the action on the electrometer they will act in the same direction.
    The difficulty of keeping the resistance constant is far greater
 in liquid conductors—for instance, solutions of cupric sulphate;
for their resistance changes with the temperature to a far greater
 extent than that of the metals.

     When, by means of Wollaston's electrodes of thin copper wire,
 two different sections of the solution of sulphate of copper were
 placed in conducting communication with the pairs of quadrants
 of the electrometer, while the electric current of a battery of six
  cells passed through the solution, the electrometer showed a con
  stant deflection when the electrodes while at a constant distance
  were moved parallel to the direction of the current, and were in
  the corner or in the middle of a section.

      The difference of the electrical potential, already mentioned in
  § 57, which the positive and negative poles of a Grove's battery
  show when the other pole is in connexion with the ground, is
  very striking.        The irregularities show themselves in the same
  manner with Dellmann-Kohlrausch's electrometer, as well as in
  the Thomson's quadrant electrometer, though the latter instru
  ment has the advantage of measuring the difference of the
  electric potentials at two points of a conductor; hence the
  potential for a given point of the conductor may be 0.

                             follow one another
they were made.      With observations 2 and 3 one of the pairs
of quadrants was connected with the ground (through the gas
pipes of the house); with the others they were both completely
insulated.    We see that the mean of the positive and negative
deflections, for the same electromotive force, is almost constant;
and for half that force it has half the value, as the theory re
quires; on the other hand, the difference of the positive and
negative deflections varies, being sometimes positive and some
times negative, independently of the electromotive force.
   In another series of experiments with a new Grove's battery

 itsorigin in the earth,     sufficient

given liquid a separation of partial molecules, or, what is the
same thing, a chemical decomposition of the liquid, can only
occur when the current has acquired a certain density.                                                             If,

this definite magnitude, then many molecules will          suddenly                              be

magnitude Be—B'e' is constant) the force K is perfectly inde
pendent of the section of the conductor, and increases with the
magnitude nG, the electromotive force of the constant battery em
ployed.   This electromotive force, however, is taken in the ex
periments by no means so exceedingly small, simply to prevent the
cessation of the electrical current in consequence of the polari
zation which is set up; and it is very possible that, for a very

small value      of   the quotient “...,   l        no   electrochemical      decomposition
would be perceived. There are certainly a number of liquids
which cannot be electrolyzed, which do not conduct the constant
current of a liquid battery. There are, in my opinion, such
liquids with respect to which the magnitude Be-B'e' has a very
small value, and which for a short distance, and by the appli
cation of a constant battery of a sufficient number of elements,
might very likely undergo chemical decomposition.      The value
of this magnitude (Be—B'e')=A(Ce—C'e') depends on the con
stants denoted by CC' and ee'.
   I shall afterwards return to the value of the latter. With
solid bodies, the constants C and C are very small, because the
molecules are hardly mobile, and with solid salts no electro
chemical decomposition is observed. The liquids which (though
their particles are certainly mobile) do not conduct electrolyti
cally, are insulators. The constant Be—B'e' is consequently
with them very small; and in them at                  events only veryall
great electromotive forces, great values        nG, can bring about
                                                                 of                                   a
decomposition.
  It   follows from this consideration that constant batteries,                                       at
least with the number         elements which are usually

276         M. G. Quincke    on   Electrolysis, and the
compartments      of equal size by a thin plate of mica parallel to
the smaller side of the prism. The two compartments commu
nicated by a very small aperture of about 0.2 millim. diameter,
and were filled to a height of 42.5 millims. with concentrated
solution of pure sulphate of copper.      The current of a Grove's
battery of 77 cells passed into one compartment and out of the
other by means of two copper plates coated on the back, with
sealing-wax, which were of the same size as the smaller sides of
the trough, and were placed parallel to them.
    Thus the electrical current flowed within two cones with rect
angular base, the summits of which touched one another at the
opening in the mica plate.      The intensity of the current was so
much the greater the nearer the section of the conical conductor
formed by the solution was to the opening in the mica plate:
    In the course of the experiment the opening in the mica plate
 increased to a section of about 3.9 square millims. ; and when
 the copper electrodes were at a distance of 30 millims. from the
 mica plate, 0611 grim. of copper were deposited in ten minutes.
    On closing the circuit, gas-bubbles were given off abundantly
 on both sides of the mica plate, and near the opening the tem
 perature of the liquid rose several degrees. From the increase in
 volume also of the air-cavities in the mica it was evident that
 near the aperture the temperature was high, which also very
 probably occasioned the enlargement of the opening. At the
 large copper electrodes no evolution of gas was observed.
     It may be observed that this rise in the temperature of the
 liquid, when it is unequally distributed, causes a difference of
  specific gravity in the two chambers and by that means a cur
  rent through the opening of the mica plate from the other
  chamber to the one in which the greater heating has taken place.
  Of course this current of liquid then carries along with it the
  small gas-bubbles.
     In order to determine the nature of the liberated bubbles of
gas, they were collected in inverted glass hemispheres of about
20 millims. diameter, in the top of which a platinized platinum
wire was fused.    When the glass vessels containing the gas
bubbles were  placed  near one another in a large vessel contain
 ing dilute sulphuric acid, and the platinum wires connected by
 means of a delicate multiplier, the current did not correspond to
 the current of a Grove’s gas battery, as would have been the case
 had the separated gas consisted of oxygen and hydrogen. More
 over when an electric spark was passed through a mixture of the
 two gases obtained as has been described, no explosion took
 place.  This, together with the fact that the gas-generation gra
 dually becomes weaker and weaker, plainly shows that the gases
 liberated consisted of atmospheric   air   which, previously absorbed

by the solution of sulphate of copper, was given off in conse
quence of the increased temperature caused by the current.
  The following experiment confirms this explanation. A highly
concentrated solution of commercial sulphate of copper was
boiled for a long time in order to free it from the absorbed air.
It was poured whilst boiling into a large beaker and cooled as
quickly as possible in a freezing-mixture of snow and common
salt. When the solution was cooled to a temperature of 20°C.,
the glass trough was filled with it to a height of 42.5 millims.,
the two electrodes were placed on each side of the mica plate at
a distance of 30 millims., and the current of a Grove's battery
of 77 cells passed through                       it.
   At first    few gas-bubbles were generated; but these pro
                 a
ceeded from the air        the hollow spaces
                                   in            the mica plate, and       of
soon completely    ceased.
   The liquid near the opening became very warm. At the cop
per plate which served        cathode   as
                                         evolution     gas wasno                   of               to     be
seen; but       appeared abundantly when, instead
                 it                                         the broad                   of

the section          of
                the wire was    very much greater than the opening
in the mica plate.

278          M. G. Quincke     on Electrolysis, and the
"25 of a millim. diameter in a horizontal direction, fell on a
plane-convex crown-glass lens, of which the focal distance was
1 metre and the diameter 100 millims.          The rays traversed the
solution of  sulphate  of copper  in the glass trough almost at right
angles   to the direction of the electrical current.        The glass
trough was placed close to the crown-glass lens, and projected,
at a distance of about 3 metres behind the lens, a real image of
the small illuminated aperture.       This image, which was from 1
to 2 millims. in   diameter,   was so screened by a diaphragm with
a straight vertical edge standing in front of the ocular of an
astronomical telescope placed at the opening of the mica plate in
the solution of sulphate of copper, that only a small portion of
light could reach the telescope. On closing the battery, cloud
like veils were seen from the opening of the mica plate in the
 solution of sulphate of copper passing out on both sides of the
 mica plate, similar to those observed by Toepler     to be produced
 by induction-sparks in air. The phenomenon           was exactly  the
 same with a different direction of the electrical     current in  the
 solution, and was manifestly due to the heating      of the liquid in
 the narrow opening by the electrical         current. Although the
 telescope commanded the whole space between the copper elec
 trodes, apart from the phenomenon described nothing unusual
 could be perceived within the liquid.
     When the aperture in the mica plate was enlarged, then the
 quantity of gas liberated here, if it had arisen from the decom
 position of water, must have increased with the size of the aper
 ture, since the intensity of the current increased in the whole
 circuit so long as the density of the current sufficed for the de
 composition of water in the solution of sulphate of copper. This
 latter condition was fulfilled, as the experiment with the copper
 wire as cathode showed; and yet the evolution of gas diminished
with the enlarging of the aperture, just because the heating was
 smaller.
     According to this the whole phenomenon does not depend on
  a selective property of the electrical current, but on a purely
 secondary    chemical action.
     Whether the separated hydrogen results from decomposition
 of the water, or from a trace of sulphuric acid which is still
  present in the solution, might be very difficult to decide.       On
  account of the exceedingly small specific conductivity of the water,
  we should incline to the latter view; it will, however, be diffi
  cult to give a stricter proof.
     When in the same glass trough with the mica plate and a
  small aperture in the latter the current of the same Grove's bat
  tery of 77 cells was passed through a solution of pure common
  salt or sulphate of potash in water mixed with some tincture of

                Passage    of Electricity through Liquids.              279
litmus, then     I noticed on the electrodes, but not in the interior
 of the  liquid  or in the opening of the mica plate, a change of the
 chemical    condition—though,        of course, numberless bubbles of
 oxygen and hydrogen gas were developed                 on the anode and
 cathode.
    In  vessels in which water was poured over a concentrated so
lution of the above-mentioned salt, on passing the current a
 change was observed at the boundary of the water and the solu
 tion of salt, as Faraday” also had already found a separation of
hydrate of magnesia at the boundary of water and a solution of
 sulphate of magnesia when the current was passed.
                                     § 64.
    The equations in § 55 contain so many unknown magnitudes
that it is for the most part extremely difficult to determine the
latter more accurately.        Only in a few particularly simple cases
can any thing be said about the magnitudes C and e.
    The simplest case is that of a salt fused by heat.             We may
then   neglect   the summation and the index         r, and equations (21),
(23), (24), and (16) give
                            e= —e',

or                         e=  2.
    This relation must hold as long and        as accurately as Faraday’s
law   holds,  therefore for   every  liquefied  salt which is decomposed
by means of the electrical current at any given temperature.
The quantity of electricity 2 is measured by the same unit as the
current-intensity i ; and that quantity of electricity has been put
 =2 which decomposes one equivalent of an electrolyte through
which it passes. Hence we have this proposition:-
    If any salt in a liquefied condition is decomposed by the elec
trical current, then there is a quantity of free electricity +2 on
the complex atom which forms the one partial molecule, and a
quantity of free electricity      –2    upon the complex atom which
forms the other partial molecule.
    The quantity of electricity +2 or        -2    is just as great as that
positive or negative quantity of electricity which must flow
through the liquid conductor in one or the other direction in
order to decompose this one equivalent of salt.

280           M. G. Quincke                     on Electrolysis, and the
    This is the more remarkable because it holds for a great
series of combinations in which the liberated partial molecules,
according to modern theoretical views, may be univalent or plu
rivalent. On account of the difficulty of separating the direct
action of the electrical current from the secondary of the libe
rated substances, we shall not for the present be able to decide
with certainty whether the electrical current only splits up the
total molecules, as appears to be mostly the case, into partial
molecules of an equal number of units of affinity (compare $55).
   The aforesaid relations will not hold when a salt is dissolved
in water, alcohol, or the like.
                                                     § 65.
   Equation (24) S 55 gives the dependence of the specific con
ductivity of a liquid on the constants Cr,          p, &c. Since      er,                            as

                     is          these quantities, only the known

facts regarding   the conductivity    the electrolytes can

be  compared with that expression.
   The conductivity increases with the concentration         the solu                of
tion   ofsalt, with      p,
                       and with the heating, because through the

latter the constants         become greater and the particles more
                               C'
easily displaceable.       the concentration increases too much,
                               If                                                                    so

   All this    is   accordance with experiment.

 282                        M. G. Quincke            on Electrolysis, and the
 which has been proved by numerous measurements by Faradayº,
 Bufft, Sorett, Hittorf S,                           and others.         And    I   have convinced
myself of this by experiments with watery solutions of blue
vitriol, which at different degrees of concentration and very dif
ferent densities of the current confirmed the law to within 0-8
per cent. of exactness.
    With respect to the proportion of the quantities of salt decom
posed simultaneously, Hittorf| found that, with an aqueous
solution of iodide of potassium and chloride of potassium, the
proportion of the quantities of chlorine and iodine was not altered
when an electrical current was passed through the liquid for a
long time and the density of the current varied in the ratio of
 l: 3 or l ; 4.
   The current passed through a liquid which contained an equal
number of equivalents of iodide of potassium and chloride of
  otassium, also liberated an equal number of equivalents of
iodine and chlorine; in an aqueous solution of 3:157 equivalents
of KCl and 1 equiv. of KI, 3:157 equivs. of Cl to 1 equiv. of I
were liberated by the same current.     The partial conductivities
of KCl and KI appear from this to stand, in the same solution,

    Notwithstanding the very different circumstances under which
the various observers performed their experiments with different
apparatus, yet they give nearly the same value of n.                   Owing to
the disturbing influences already mentioned, we certainly cannot
expect greater concordance, and may put

    In  most cases n differs from #; and then the partial mole

 immediately from equations (7) and (17).

    With a few solutions of salts, and certainly the concentrated
 solutions  of I*Cd, Cl* Cd, Cl*Zn, I*Zn in water or diluted solu
 tions of the same salts in absolute alcohol, and I*Cd in methy
 lated alcohol, Hittorf” observed an increase of the concentration
  at the anode; and this led me to conjecture that here we had
  the case given in expression (11b) (§ 54), that both e and e!
  would have the negative sign.
     Hittorf assumes that the partial molecules are always propelled
  in opposite directions by the electrical current, and endeavours
  to reconcile this with the phenomenon discussed in the foregoing
  sections, by assuming that the concentrated solutions of the salts
  in question contain double salts, which consist of two or more
  equivalents of the corresponding salt, for example I*Cd, and are
  acted  upon by the electrical current like double salts formed of
  two different metals.        As the electrical current resolves aqueous

solutions of double chloride of mercury and potassium into
(Cl* Hg-H Cl”)2 K, or of double iodide of cadmium and potas
sium into (I*Cd-HI”) 2K (where the brackets include the com
plex molecule liberated at the anode), so iodide of cadmium is
supposed in a similar manner to be resolved into (I*Cd-HI*) Cd,
and that the interpretation that cadmium and iodine are both
driven to the anode by the electrical current is obviously to                                                      be

  From the theoretical views here developed this appears to me

whether the electrolytical action of the battery itself might not
occasion these differences.        Against such an assumption, how
ever, is the fact that sometimes the positive and sometimes the
negative pole preponderates.
    The following experiments were for the purpose of ascertaining
whether, when an alcoholic solution of iodide of cadmium is
electrolyzed, greater differences would appear than in the earlier
experiments.
    To this end a glass trough 106 millims. long and 27.5 mil
lims. broad was filled to a height of 23 millims, with a solution
which contained 1 part by weight of crystallized iodide of cad
mium to 0.967 of absolute alcohol, and had a specific gravity of
1.432.       The electrical current of a Grove’s battery of 17 ele
ments, which stood upon a cake of resin and was filled as de
scribed in § 57, was passed into and out of the liquid by means
of amalgamated plates of cadmium which could be shifted par
allel to the smaller sides of the trough. The free electricity of
the poles of the battery was determined in the manner above
described (§ 57), by means of a Kohlrausch-Dellmann's electro
meter, but without a condenser, one pole being led to the earth,
the other connected with the electrometer.             When the battery
was open or was closed by a column of liquid of the length l,
the quantity of accumulated electricity was determined, +e or
 —e according as the positive or negative pole of the battery was
 connected with the electrometer.           In the following Table the
 measurements are placed together.           The notation is the same as
 in § 57. The first column contains the time which elapsed be
 tween fixing the battery and making the corresponding obser
 vation.

   The electrometer shows almost the same deflection with dif
ferent lengths of the interposed thread of liquid, as was to be
expected from equation (4) (§ 60).
   When Wollaston’s electrodes of cadmium wire coated with pa
raffin were dipped into the alcoholic solution of iodide of cadmium
at a distance of 35 millimetres from one another and connected
with the pairs of quadrants of the electrometer, the deflection of
the latter was 26.75 divisions of the scale; whilst when the cad
mium plates were at the ends of the column of liquid 320 mil
lims. long, a deflection of the electrometer of 243 divisions was
observed.
   The deflection of the electrometer remained the same whether
Wollaston’s electrodes were placed on the edge, in the middle,
or on the side of the column, and almost perfectly agreed with
the value 26-8 calculated theoretically.

and closed at both ends with corks. Two amalgamated circular
cadmium plates were soldered to copper wires which passed air
tight through the corks to the outside.    In the axis of the tube
a hollow glass thread of 0.7 millim. outer and 0.3 inner dia
meter was fixed, which was filled with mercury, and communi
cated with the outside by means of suitable openings in the
cadmium plates and corks.    By a small glass tube in one of the
corks the apparatus could be filled with liquid without taking it
to pieces.
   The electrical current passed from one cadmium electrode,
through a column of liquid 200 millims. long, to the other elec
trode, and then immediately back in the axis of the tube through
the thread of mercury.   Such a conductor could exercise no de
flecting force on a magnetic needle when the intensity of the
current was the same in the electrolytes       and in the metal wire
in the axis. The tube thus arranged            was placed on a small
slide, parallel to the magnetic meridian      inclined to the horizon
at an angle of 45°; and, together with        the slide,     centre was                   its

XXXIV.    Notice respecting some new Facts in the early History of
  Logarithmic Tables. By J. W. L. GLAIs HER, B.A., F.R.A.S.,
  Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridget.
     main facts with regard to the original calculation of
THElogarithms are briefly as follows:—In 1614 Napier pub
lished his Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio, in which
Napierian logarithms were introduced. Briggs perceived the
advantages of the base 10, and in 1624 published the Arithme
tica Logarithmica, containing the (Briggian) logarithms of the
natural numbers from unity to 20,000 and from 90,000 to
100,000, to 14 places of decimals. There was thus left a gap of
70,000, which was filled in by Vlacq, who published in 1628, at
Gouda, his Arithmetica Logarithmica (which he called a second
edition of Briggs's work of the same name), containing the loga
rithms of           all
                numbers from       100,000,         places.

Table     that from which
         is                  every Table    logarithms   that has         of
subsequently appeared has been copied.        contains,     course,       It                       of
many errors, which have gradually been discovered and corrected
in the course             of
                   the 244 years that have elapsed; but        fresh                                    no

            the work performed                              by
                                      Briggs and Vlacq are those
that still appear      our Tables. The first logarithmic trigono
                               in
metrical canon was published          Gunter     1620;          oy

logarithmic sines and tangents for every minute      seven decimals.                to

292           Mr.       J. W.         L. Glaisher on              some new Facts               in
maseyn.”     The negligence of a bookbinder enables us to clear
up some confusion in rather a singular manner.               Sherwin states
that he examined his Table by one of Vlacq’s, in large octavo,
printed at Gouda in 1626, of which Table we find no other men
tion. The Table before us corresponds in every respect except
that there is no author's name; but no one except Vlacq can be
mentioned who was in the least likely to have printed logarithms
at Gouda in or about 1626.          At one time we thought that this
Table was the original of the long series of small Tables called
after Vlacq; but this was a mistake (see 1625* Gellibrand), and
the mistake was partly due to the following circumstances.              This
 Table (Gouda, 1626), having the title, when not cut away, above
 described, and which we have also seen with a Dutch title and
 preface, is the Table which is always bound up at the end of the
 ‘Sciographia, or art of Shadowes . . . . by T.f W<U+017F>ells], Esq.”
 London, 1635, large octavo. . . . . That the book was intended
 to have these logarithms bound at the end is evident from every
 page of     it.Now the fact stands         follows:—A sufficient num
                                                              as
 ber  of  copies        the logarithms having been procured from
                             of

 logarithms, and        append them
                             to            the work.      Accordingly most
 copies have           no
                   title    the logarithms, which look quite like part
 of the work.      But                in to
                             some copies the binder has not cancelled
 as required we have obtained two (since our first article was

ourselves, the which we call the second volume of the new Arith

the present book in the mean while; and after describing       con      its

 f    The reasons for this assertion are given   the paper    the ‘Monthly    in                        in
Notices     the Royal Astronomical Society,” cited
                of                                    the text (p. 295, 2nd             in
line). The same title-page and introduction were prefixed     Miller both                               by                          to

examined four copies of Miller’s edition; and in a paper read
before the Royal Astronomical Society on May 10, 1872, and
printed in the ‘Monthly Notices’ for that date, which was
written before             I
                  was aware of the existence of Decker’s work,                                                I
made the following remark:—“Three out of the four copies
mentioned contain, after the English introduction and before the
Tables, a title-page on which is printed, “Tafel der Logarithmi
voor de Ghetallen van                laf
                             tot 100,000, while the corresponding
page in Vlacq’s Table is inscribed, Chiliades centum Logarith
morum pro Numerus (sic) ab Unitate ad 100,000. This shows
the Dutch origin of Miller's Table; and it is besides curious, as
it seems to imply that Vlacq meditated a Dutch translation of
his work, but the Tables intended for the purpose were bought
and published by George Miller.”           This surmise is confirmed
by Decker's statement.     It is possible, but not very probable, that
an edition of the Arithmetica with a Dutch introduction absolutely
was issued.    The fact that no such copy seems to have been
met with by Hutton, De Morgan, Murhard, &c. is not conclu
sive as to the non-existence of any—as it is most likely, if there
was a Dutch edition, that nearly                        all
                                         the copies would remain
Holland; for although now the Table the only thing that         is                                      is   of in
interest, the authors     that time seemed
                                     at           regard their own trito
gonometry, explanations, &c., which were prefixed           the Table,                  to

This has created much confusion; and, besides, the title-page does not
correctly describe the contents                of  the latter work.

with Decker's first Table.     A comparison of any two corre
sponding pages is enough to establish this; but the best proof
is afforded by the g of Logarithmi (which is Italic instead of
Roman) at the top of the page the first number on which is
7801. The second Table is not the same as the second in the
Telkonst, but gives logarithmic sines, tangents, and secants”;
further, it is not printed in the fine bold type which charac
terizes Decker’s work (and the other Tables printed by Ram
maseyn), as well as many of the subsequent small Tables printed
at Amsterdam, 1681, Frankfort and Leipzig, 1757, &c., and
known by the name of Vlacq. The reason for the change in this
Table is evident, as Decker merely reprinted Gunter's Table.
But in 1628 appeared Vlacq’s Arithmetica (containing loga
rithmic sines &c. to every minute), and in 1633 his Trigono
metria Artificialis (giving the same for every ten seconds), in
both of which the results were carried to more decimals than by
Gunter, and consequently very many (chiefly last figure) errors
of his detected, so that by 1635 Gunter’s calculation had already
been superseded.    It will be noticed that the title-page to the
Tables in the Sciographia only applies to the first (or otherwise
the date could not be 1626, as there given); and          have no                    I
doubt that the second Table has no connexion with the first,
having been probably printed in England.           Sherwin’s words in
 the preface (1705) to his well-known Tables are, “The Tables of
Logarithmic Sines, Tangents and Secants were examined by a
Table of the said Vlacq, in large octavo, printed at Gouda, 1626.”
That there must be some error here is quite clear,              Vlacq’s        as,   by
own statement,         only became acquainted with Briggs's Arith
                            he
metica    inthat year.        seemsIt  me quite clear (for reasons that

then offered to procure him his licence as of old, if he would
buy from them copies of two books which they had printed at

years, with the hope of                     its

 up                   10
                     places.    The French manuscript Tables only ex

 tend  to        places   (the twelfth figure being uncertain);              that                      so
 even  if  they were published, Briggs's original scheme would not
 be  completely carried out.
     Briggs perceived the advantage                            of
                                                  centesimal division
                                                                   a          the                          of
 right angles, and made           step    athis direction
                                                    in          the Britannica,       in
 where      hedivided the degrees, not into minutes, but into hun
 dredths.        Inthe Artificialis Vlacq expresses his entire approval
 of  this change,    but proceeds       add that,
                                               to     those who were accus as

  sion is retained (the intervals being 10").          Hutton has made the
  remark   that,  had     not been for
                           it           Vlacq’s  publication,      partial refor           a
  mation    of the sexagesimal system might have taken place then.
  This seems very true; and                     on
                                         consideration        appears that the       it
  only time when the change could have been conveniently effected
  was when the use               of

  curious that Vlacq, while expressing his approbation                         the                         of
  change introduced                  by

are several references    to him in the preface: but this communi
cation is already so long that I refrain from making quotations;
it is enough to mention that Decker states that he was unac
quainted with Latin, and that Vlacq, who was then applying
himself with great zeal to geometry”, made the translations for
him.     There does not appear to be any mention of the octavo
work in the preface; but I have not examined the book with
sufficient care to be quite certain on this point.            At first                          I
thought it possible that this was the publication to which
Decker referred as the Groote Werck in the octavo work, and
not the (improved) reprint of Briggs's Arithmetica; and the pro
bability of this seemed increased by the fact that, in a printed
 extract from a bookseller's catalogue gummed on to the title
page, the book was described as Eerste (en Tweede) Deel &c.
A careful reexamination of the preface to the octavo work, how
ever, has convinced me that the words cannot possibly have any
 other meaning than that here attributed to them; so that the
quarto work was the Eerste Deel, and Briggs's Arithmetica,
 translated into Dutch, was intended to have been the Tweede
 Deel, the octavo work being merely a makeshift till the appear
ance of the latter. The inaccuracy in the bookseller's catalogue
 is accounted for by the fact that Napier divided his Rabdologia
 into two books, so that the Dutch headings run Ioannis Neperi
 Eerste Boeck and Ioannis Neperi Tweede Boeck, and the com
 piler mistook the latter for the Tweede Deel.         I did not succeed
 in finding the Graves copy of the octavo work; but this is of very
 little consequence, as         its
                              interest would      almost wholly biblio

 graphical. To show not only the great scarcity                  Decker's       of
 works, but also the total oblivion into which           and they havehe
 fallen,I    may mention that his name does not appear                               at   all   in

XXXV.       On the Definition of Intensity in the Theories of Light
     and Sound.    By Robert Moon, M.A., Honorary Fellow of
     Queen's College, Cambridge*.
                                                                                             depend

   is clear that the loudness of a note must         on the
            of motion which it produces in the nerves of the
ear.      But                         indefinitely, in which case
                    a note may be prolonged
the amount of motion of the nerves of the ear will be prolonged
indefinitely, without producing any increase in the loudness of
the note.
   If a note be prolonged through a definite interval of time with
out undergoing any change of character, either as to intensity or
otherwise, the amount of motion in the nerves of the ear pro
duced by it will obviously be proportional to the length of the
interval during which the note continues; whence it is clear
that the true measure of the loudness of a sound must be the
amount of motion of the nerves of the ear which it occasions,
divided by the time during which it operates.
   And since the only test we are ever likely to get of the
amount of motion of the nerves of the ear in any given case is
the amount of motion of the aërial particles through the inter
vention of which the nerves are stimulated, it follows that we
must take for our test of the loudness of a sound the ratio of the
aggregate amount of motion of the particles producing it to the
time of its continuance.
   In estimating the aggregate amount of motion above spoken
of,  it   is   to   be
                observed that        not the algebraical sum

   The definition of intensity in the theory of light must of
course be precisely similar.
   It may be useful to compare the definition at which we have
thus arrived with that ordinarily given in approved text-books
on the theory of undulations. Of these      shall give four ex              I

that amount of energy which is necessary to decompose again
the carbonic acid and water into their clements, to separate the
oxygen, to give it back to the atmosphere, and to collect the
carbon and hydrogen of the water and carbonic acid in the
body of the plant itself. It is not yet possible to show that
there exists an accurate equivalent proportion between the power
or energy of the solar rays which are absorbed by the green
leaves of plants, and the energy which is stored up in the form
of chemical force in the interior of the plants. We are not yet
able to make so accurate a measurement of both these stores of
energy as to be able to show that there is an equivalent pro
portion. We can only show that the amount of energy which
the rays of the sun bring to the rank is completely sufficient to
produce such an effect as this chemical effect going on in the
plant.      I will give you some figures in reference to this. It is

sues, it would be interesting to acquire some idea of the storage
of power effected by a given area of leaf-surface during the
course of a day, and to compare this with the total available
energy. Here we are dealing with strictly measurable quanti
ties, provided we could determine the equation of chemical
transformation.
   Boussingault's recent observations on the amount of carbonic
acid decomposed by a given area of green leaf seem to me to
afford interesting data for a new determination of the efficiency of
sunlight.    By experiments made between the month of January
and October under the most favourable circumstances in atmo
spheres rich in CO", one square decimetre of leaf was found to
decompose in one hour, as a mean, 5:28 cub. centims. of CO",
and in darkness to evolve during the same period of time 0:33
cub. centim. of CO".     In other words, one square metre of
green surface will decompose in twelve hours of the day 63-36
cub. centims. of CO", and produce in twelve hours of the night
3.96 cub. centims. of CO2+.
  This quantity of carbonic acid decomposed does not represent
the whole work  of sunlight for the time, as water is simultane
ously attacked in order to supply the hydrogen of the carbo
hydrates.   Boussingault, in summing up the general results of
his laborious researches on vegetable physiology, says, “Sil’on
envisage la vie-vágétale dans son ensemble, on est convaincu que
la feuille est la première étape des glucoses que, plus ou moins
modifiés, on trouve répartis dans les diverses parties de l'orga
nisme ; que c’est la feuille qui les élabore aux depens de l'acide
carbonique et de l’eau.”—Ann. de Chemie, tom. xiii. p. 415.
The fundamental chemical reaction taking place in the leaf may
therefore be represented as           follows:—
            (1)       CO, O +       H2O       =        CO, H2      +     0, O
            (2)       6(CO. H*)               =        C5H12O6
      In
      the first equation carbonic acid                     and water are simul
taneously attacked, with the liberation                   of a volume of oxygen
   * The rate at which the leaf functions is dependent on the luminous
intensity. The relative amounts, therefore, of carbonic acid decomposed
through the action of the different coloured rays are proportional to their
luminous power; and the curve of assimilation is found to follow the curve
of Fraunhofer.    This proves that the judgment we form of equal luminous
impressions is in reality due to equal mechanical effects associated with the
different coloured rays.    Professor Draper, of New York, in his recent
paper “On the Distribution of Heat in the Spectrum,” by dividing the
spectrum into two portions of equal luminous intensity, obtained identical
thermal cffects by absorption.    This does not prove that each ray has the
same total energy, but only that in       all
                                         probability those    equal distances
                                                                    at

tion of a substance having the composition of methylic aldehyde.
The second equation represents the condensation of this aldehyde
into grape-sugar.    The transformation induced in (1) necessi
tates the  absorption of a large amount of energy; and if we
neglect the heat evolved in the combination of nascent CO and
H*, which can be shown to be very little, the calculated result
is made a maximum ; whereas the condensation of (2) being
attended with an evolution of heat, diminishes considerably the
 amount of power required. Happily Frankland’s direct

  It will be seen that the greater part came off within the first two
hours and a half; but the process lasted fourteen hours and a half,
and was not entirely over at the end even of this time. The heat
had been gradually raised from dull redness to something nearly ap
proaching whiteness at the end of the time; and when the experiment
was stopped very small but still perceptible traces of gas were still
coming off, though their appearance was immediately arrested when
ever the temperature was allowed to fall but a little below the high
point which had been reached.
   The piece of iron taken out from the tube when it had become quite
cold was found glazed by a thin film of fused phosphide of iron
and nickel (Schreibersite), thickest on the edge which had been low
est, this phosphide having oozed out from the mass at the very high
temperature used.
   The tubes used to collect the gas during the first portion of the
time occupied in the experiment were found slightly moistened on
the inside, and the moisture, which had a distinctly acid reaction,
was proved to contain hydrochloric acid, this having no doubt been
derived from the chlorine existing in the iron in combination with
that metal and with nickel.

    “On the Law of Extraordinary        Refraction in Iceland Spar.”   By
G. G. Stokes, M.A. Sec. R.S.
                                    I
   It is now some years since carried out, in the case of Iceland
spar, the method of examination of the law of refraction which           I
described in my report on Double Refraction, published in the
Report of the British Association for the year 1862, p. 272. A prism,
approximately right-angled isosceles, was cut in such a direction as
to admit of scrutiny, across the two acute angles, in directions of the
wave-normal within the crystal comprising respectively inclinations
of 90° and 45° to the axis.         The directions of the cut faces were
referred by reflection to the cleavage-planes, and thereby to the axis.
The light observed was the bright D of a soda-flame.
   The result obtained was, that Huygens's construction gives the
true law of double refraction within the limits of errors of observation.
The error, if any, could hardly exceed a unit in the fourth place of
 decimals of the index or reciprocal of the wave-velocity, the velocity
in air being taken as unity. This result is sufficient absolutely to
disprore the law resulting from the theory which makes double
refraction depend on a difference of inertia in different directions.
   I  intend to present to the Royal Society a detailed account of the
observations; but in the mean time the publication of this prelimi
nary notice of the result obtained may possibly be useful to those
engaged in the theory of double refraction.

REPoRT on A MEMOIR BY MM. F. LUCAS AND A. CAzIN, on THE
  DURATION OF THE ELECTRIC SPARK.                BY EDM. BEcquEREL*.
      M. F. LUCAS and A. Cazin purposed to estimate the duration
        of electric sparks in some determinate circumstances, especially
when the dimensions of the exciting batteries are changed, and the

exploding     distance, the nature of the electrodes, and the resistance
of the circuit traversed by the electricity are varied.
    Two methods have hitherto been employed to render appreciable
the duration of a spark.          One, devised by Wheatstone, consists in
causing the image of the spark to be reflected upon a mirror move
able about an axis parallel to the length of the spark. Although the
spark of an ordinary electrical machine exhibits no duration appre
ciable by this means, yet, with a certain velocity of rotation, battery
discharges give images elongated in the direction of the rotation of
the mirror, a proof of a sensible duration, but with diminution of
luminous intensity.         With the aid of this mode of experimenting,
M. Feddersen has been able to study the constitution of the dis
charge, and even                 its
                          subdivisions.

the lines of the disks, as well as on the number of the lines on the ver
nier, has been determined by experiment, and has been found to be
equal to 0-70; that is to say, if an instantaneous spark be produced
at any instant whatever, it will illuminate a line 70 times out of 100,
and 30 times not. The probability might be different with another
apparatus.
    Let us now suppose the duration of the spark to be a little greater
than that of the passage of a line of the moving wheel over two
lines of the vernier; then, if the spark commenced at the instant of
the first coincidence, by reason of the persistence of luminous impres
sions on the retina the bright line resulting from this first coincidence
will be visible at the same time as that from the second, and we
shall see two lines at once. If with the same duration the spark
bursts forth between two coincidences, it has ceased when the third
arrives, and only one bright line is seen, corresponding to the second.
On this supposition, therefore, we ought to see one or two coinci
dences of bright lines at the time of appearance of the discharges.
    But if the duration of the spark is a little longer than the prece
ding, it will be comprised between two numbers easy to determine,
the difference of which is equal to the time which elapses between
two successive coincidences.         Meanwhile the approximation can be
carried further; and the authors have shown that, in consideration
of the above-mentioned probability of coincidence, by estimating the
total number of visible lines resulting from the observation of a
known number of sparks, as well as the velocity of rotation of the
moveable disk, we can deduce therefrom, with an ascertained degree
of approximation, the duration of the visible spark.
    When the apparatus is in operation, only a limited number of
coincidences can be seen at one time; so that when the duration of
the spark becomes greater and is such that for a velocity of rotation
of the disk more than five or six coincidences appear at once, the
velocity has to be diminished in order to keep within the limits of
that number of coincidences; and from these two quantities the
duration of the spark is determined.
    It must be remarked that, by the duration of the visible spark,
must be understood the time which separates the moment at which
the spark commences from the instant at which, in consequence of

rotation is augmented;        so that, in the conditions under which they
operated, the alteration of luminous intensity did not sensibly modify
the results of their observations.          Still it would be desirable that
the authors should be able to        explain   in what manner the luminous
intensity intervenes when comparisons are made between sparks of
unequal brightness, especially when the discharges explode between
electrodes of various metals, placed at different distances, in gases
at divers pressures, and that it should be possible for them, in cer
tain cases, to operate with the same sum of light illuminating the
lines of their apparatus.
    Since the coincidences of the lines of the fixed and moveable disks
depend on the duration of the spark up to a certain limit of lumi
nous intensity, it must be remarked that their number might be
increased in consequence of the phosphorescence of the moveable
disk; but mica being one of the solids in which the phenomenon of
persistence of this luminous action is the least marked, it follows
that no sensible perturbation can arise from the interposition of a
moving disk of that substance between a luminous focus and the eye
of the observer.

fraction of half wave-length at which the sympathetic fork is
placed on the line OX.
    It is now readily seen that if we could place the fork B at
two successive points (as Bº and B") on the line OX so that
exact concordance of flexures should be seen at each of these
points, then evidently the fork would be at two positions removed
from each other by a wave-length; for at these points the air
would have, at the same instants, the same phases of vibration.
Thus we should have measured a wave-length.               Furthermore,
if by any means we could move the fork B around A so that
during this motion it always preserved, in reference to A, the
same relation of vibratory phase, we should determine, the
form of the wave-surface produced by the propagation of A's
vibration.

who thus describes, in his excellent l’Acoustique (Paris, 1867,
p. 272), a method of observing the flames of two similar sound

flames arranged so that the point of one flame reaches above a
small fixed mirror which hides                            its

                         the other flame.     This produces the illusion
ofa    single flame.        now we observe this hybrid image

mouth of the resonator with a delicate membrane, and fill the

XL.     Notes on Bessel's Functions.                                 By the Hon.         J.   W. Strutt,

      HE value of Bessel's functions is becoming generally recog
       nized.    By means of them can be solved important pro
blems in mathematical physics relating to the conduction of heat
or electricity, the flow of an incompressible frictionless fluid
which has been once at rest, and the vibrations of an elastic me
dium, when the nature of the question imposes conditions which
are to be satisfied on spherical or cylindrical surfaces. Of late
}.     the development of the subject has been mainly in the
  ands of German mathematicians.
   In the present paper, which is of a somewhat fragmentary
character, are contained some results of more or less novelty,
some demonstrations of known theorems by what appear to me
to be simple or more instructive methods, together with a few
examples of applications to physical problems.

investigations. So far as concerns     form, the Bessel's func       its

Both the ascending and descending series fail in such a case if z
is comparable with n.     Light is thrown on the question by a
consideration of the differential equation (1) itself. The ascend

              The purely axial vibrations correspond to a zero
value of K. A similar analysis would apply on Euler and La
grange's hypothesis if the ends or the side of the cylinder were
open, though in the latter case the result would be no approxi
mation to the truth.    At the plane ends we may legitimately
take as an approximation (p=0, provided that the radius of the
cylinder bears but a small ratio to the wave-length of the vibration
under consideration.      (See a paper “On Resonance,” Phil.
Trans. 1871.)
   In the problem, partially considered by Fourier (Théorie Ana
lytique de la Chaleur, Chap. VI.), of a cylinder of uniformly con
ducting material heated arbitrarily and then allowed to cool by
radiation, the cosine factor containing the time would be replaced
by an exponential, the coefficient of t being negative, and (18)
would have to be used as boundary condition, but otherwise
there would be little change.
   Hitherto we have had to do with integral values of n only ;
but if instead of the complete cylinder we take the sector cut off
by 6=0, 6–8, fractional values will be introduced. The ele
mentary solution for the acoustical problem in two dimensions
then becomes

does not cease here.
     If this       latter is exposed in hot solution in benzole to strong
sunlight for many hours, it deposits, on cooling, needle-like
crystals which are almost colourless, and give a spectrum by
fluorescence which corresponds very closely with that of the so
lution of the same body mentioned already.         Its bands, how
ever, are far less strongly marked than those of the unsolarized
material; and                 I
                   have little doubt that, as with impure anthra
cene, they are due, not to the mass of the material, but to a trace
of a coloured substance which is not, like chrysogen, entirely
decomposed by sunlight, but only so far modified as to occasion
the above changes.
   To avoid circumlocution in speaking of these bodies in future,
I would propose to call the white material petrolescene, from                                           its

350                  Dr. W. Marcet on the Nutrition of
sues, these inquiries relating more particularly to the nutrition
of muscles and lungs in health and when affected with phthisis:
       I
and must begin by acknowledging the valuable assistance of
Messrs. H. Bassett, F. A. Manning, and M.        Salter in the ana  J.
lytical portion of the inquiry;                  I
                                       am much indebted to these
gentlemen for the care they have bestowed on the work.
   The subject is treated by methods of investigation which
may be considered new ; it is therefore necessary that        should               I
enter into their details, so as to make the mode of reasoning, the
analytical process adopted, and the results obtained equally and
thoroughly clear to the reader.      By this means only can     hope                   I
to forestall objections and establish the correctness of my work.
   I  must beg leave to begin with a few introductory remarks
relating to liquid diffusion, a subject which has been so admira
bly treated by Graham.
    If we suppose a solution of common salt, on which a flat piece of
cork is floated, and if a stream of water be poured carefully upon
the cork, the water will not mix immediately with the solution
of salt, but form an upper layer in the receiver, while the solution
will occupy the inferior layer. Supposing no cause whatever
to agitate the fluids, that they be neither shaken nor subjected
to any current of air, they will, however, undergo a tolerably
 rapid process of mixing, the solution of salt moving into the
water, or, in other words, distributing itself throughout the water.
This phenomenon is called Liquid diffusion.
   The rate at which diffusion takes place varies according to the
substance in the solution ; hence it is said that different solutions
have different rates of diffusibility.   Chloride of sodium may be
regarded as   yielding aqueous solutions possessed of this property
in a very high degree; while white of egg or blood allow of the
distribution of their albumen through water at a very slow rate
indeed.
   Now, supposing that a jelly be prepared, by dissolving isin
glass in a weak solution of chloride of sodium (in a strong solution
the jelly may not set). If distilled water be poured over this jelly,
the salt will by degrees find     way out itsthe jelly into the water,
                                                               of
and will continue doing     until   so distributed equally through
                                                it   be
out the jelly and the water. Should the water and the jelly occupy
the same bulk, we shall find, after certain number   a     hours, the         of
same amount          of
                 chloride     sodium of   the jelly and the water.

 tissue is formed          of fibres running parallel with each other in the
form of bundles, which are not in mutual contact, but separated
from those in their immediate vicinity by connective tissue.
These fibres consist physically of animal matter and water,
held together by a peculiar power which cannot be considered
due to a chemical property, but appears to exhibit the character
of colloid attraction. The present view rests on the following
considerations:—
    1st. That muscles have a soft pliable consistence, and are dry
to the touch as a jelly would be.
   2nd. That Kühne, of Heidelberg, has obtained from muscular
tissue a real jelly he has called myosine.
   3rd. That muscular tissue contains a proportion of water
which does not appear to vary in health.
   4th. That chloride of sodium, in a certain proportion, inter
feres with the setting of gelatine; and muscular tissue is nearly
free from this substance, while blood (which remains liquid)
contains it in a comparatively large quantity. And it is worth
  noticing that when blood loses              chloride  its  sodium      dialysis
                                                                          of                   by

unless the presence of these channels be admitted.      That such
a nutritive material really exists must be acknowledged, as
(Quain’s ‘Elements of Anatomy,’ vol. ii.) “the capillaries des
tined for the proper tissue of the muscle form among the fibres
a fine network with narrow oblong meshes, which are stretched
out in the direction of the fibres . . . . none of the capillary
vessels enter the sarcolemma or proper sheath of the fibre.”
There must consequently be a material intermediate between
blood and tissue, reaching every particle of the tissue to be
nourished; and with this object in view, there must exist proper
means for the thorough distribution of this material.       I have
shown (Bibl.   Universelle, Feb. 1865), by  a very  simple   obser
vation of a physical nature, and without the use of a microscope,
that a system of channels ramifies through muscular tissue,
containing the material destined to the nutrition of flesh.
   On considering the physical condition of flesh, it occurred to
me that there would be no difficulty in determining whether
muscular tissue is strictly a colloid mass like a jelly or not, by
merely immersing a piece of muscle or raw meat in water.
Should it be a solid colloid body, no albumen could be expected
to diffuse out of the meat into the water; on the other hand, if
it was a porous mass, and should these pores or minute channels
contain albumen, some of the substance would necessarily pass
out of the meat into the water by a process of porous distribution,
as would take place if a sponge containing white of egg were
immersed or hung up in water.
   It is an observation nearly of daily occurrence that raw meat
steeped in cold water yields albumen.    200 grammes of ox-flesh
wereminced and extracted with 125 cub. centims.of distilled water,
the phosphoric acid and albumen being subsequently determined
in the extract.   On the other hand, a piece of raw beef weighing
200  grammes    was immersed for 26 hours in 125 cub. centims.
of distilled water, when the phosphoric acid and albumen were
also determined in the fluids: the result of the analysis showed
that the amount of albumen which had passed out of the meat
in the water was less than half of that which had been obtained
by extraction; while there was separated by diffusion more than
half the proportion of phosphoric acid contained in the extract.
The numerical results were as follows:—
                                                          In   100 cub. centims, fluid

                                    centims. extract.             been immersed.
  Phosphoric Acid          .         .        0.233                    0.169
  Albumen       -          -         .        2:925                    1-067
  This experiment shows that flesh is permeated in every direction
throughout   its   mass with   a   multitude        of   minute channels charged

                  Muscular and Pulmonary Tissues.                                         355
with the material destined to its nutrition, to which the albumen
belonged. It might be objected that a small quantity of blood
was possibly left in the tissue after slaughtering, which would
account for the presenceof albumen in the water in which the meat
was steeped; but meat from slaughtered animals is perfectly free
from blood. On triturating minced ox-flesh with salt water                                  I
could not find any blood-corpuscles by subjecting various por
tions of the mass to microscopical examination, while on adding
one or two drops of serum containing some blood-corpuscles to
a few ounces of the pulpy mass, and agitating the whole
together, the blood-corpuscles could be detected most readily.
In the tissue of the heart of the ox, however, I usually found
small quantities of blood, and had to give up determining the
albumen in extracts of that organ because of the results being
too high on that account.      On these occasions I had no diffi
culty in detecting the presence of blood.
                                   I
   Returning to my subject, hope to have succeeded in showing
that muscular tissue consists of a solid material permeated by
channels containing an albuminous fluid, and that the consti
tuents of the solid material are bound together by a force similar
to that which connects gelatine and water in a jelly.
                On the Mode of Nutrition of Tissues.
    A tissue consists of a solid portion containing a fluid nutritive
material within        its
                       mass.       must appear obvious

that if   the solid portion        colloid, the material for
                                  is                                 for            its
mation must also        colloid; indeed

assume, also the magnesia), which enter into the composition                                of

milation.    This partly assimilated colloid material has the same
composition as that of the insoluble fibres; indeed        shall be             I
able to show that the whole of the colloid material destined to
become assimilated has the same composition as the fully deve
loped and insoluble tissue; so that the passage from fluid to
solid is a mere morphological change.
  I   must now state how the composition of the above three
different classes of materials was determined, these materials con
stituting:—
    1st. The fibrous insoluble mass;
    2nd. The colloid fluid, destined to form the insoluble mass;
    3rd. The crystalloid solution, destined to remove from flesh
the effete material it contains.
    A few words will suffice, I trust, to make the method of ana
lysis quite clear.    Having prepared the extract of 200 grammes
of flesh with 500 cub. centims, of water as stated above, the
albumen, phosphoric acid, and potash, with the soda and chlorine,
it contained were determined.        On the other hand, the fibrous
mass in the muslin, after the estimation of its water, was sub
 mitted to analysis for the determination of the same substances
  (with the exception of chlorine), and also of            nitrogen,      its
which was done              by
                         combustion with soda-lime.       The water
 (estimated      by
                 desiccation)  represented the bulk      the extract of
 left after straining the fibrous mass; and the composition                                of
 this portion        of
                   the extract (retained      the fibres) was calcu
                                                      in
 lated from that which had been found for the solution separated
 from the flesh            by
                       extraction.    Now,                 by
                                                subtracting respec
 tively the numbers obtained for the constituents           the por        of

found for the constituents       this fibrous residue,

that the result represented the composition                     of
                                                   fibrous mass free
from extract.    The composition                 of
                                      the colloid material     solu                  in
tion destined     nourish the tissue was calculated from that of
                      to
the insoluble fibrous mass (insoluble fibrous mass considered
free from extract), assuming that the relation the constituents
held   toeach other     both cases was the same—an assumption
                            in
which  I   shall show            to
                              correct.be  The proportion       albumen      of

   The colloid material was calculated, as previously stated, on
the assumption that it possessed the same relative composition
as the insoluble fibrous mass; and I must now show the truth
of this theory. It will be necessary to begin by establishing the
fact of the colloid nature of the solution. The proof that this
material is colloid is derived from the consideration that albumen,
 itsmain constituent,           possessed
                                  is          strictly colloid properties.

   In     this analysis the colloid substances contained               in solution
in juice of flesh plus these same substances as constituents of
the insoluble fibrous mass, bore to each other respectively very
nearly the same relation as the constituents of the mature or
insoluble tissue.    Other experiments undertaken by dialyzing
extracts of muscular tissue yielded similar results; it happened,
however, occasionally that they differed—obviously on account
of the method of analysis, by means of a dialyzer not being in
variably reliable.                 -
    It follows that the material destined to become transformed
into the insoluble portion of flesh, or ripe tissue, undergoes a
 mere morphological change, one molecule of the ripe tissue as
it wastes away being replaced by one molecule of the nutritive
material having precisely the same composition.
    I shall not take into account my earliest analyses, amounting
to fourteen in number, which are incomplete in several respects.
 Moreover the methods of analysis then adopted were not near so
correct as those with which the subsequent inquiry was con
ducted.         I
               have to report seven analyses of muscular tissue.
 For the first four, the flesh was taken from the muscles of the
 neck of as many oxen immediately or but very few hours after
 slaughtering.     For the last three analyses, the muscular tissue
 was obtained at the Consumption Hospital (Brompton) from
 human subjects after death from phthisis, before decomposition
 had set       in.
                The composition      these last three samples varied
                                             of
 but  slightly from that     the other four; and the result respect
                                     of
 ing the phosphoric acid and potash effete was precisely the same.
I   shall    present consider only the first four analyses.

formed of molecules disposed according to a certain definite
structure, and consisting of albumen, phosphoric acid, potash,
and magnesia, which, however, do not exhibit fixed proportions,
but vary within certain limits.
   These materials are constantly undergoing destruction, and
may be considered as dying very shortly after they are ripe.
   The regularity with which the nutrition of this mature por
tion of flesh takes place is strikingly shown by the fact that the
soluble and coagulable albumen in a given weight of tissue
always bears the same proportion to that of the albumen assi
milated in the insoluble fibrous mass. The absolute quantity
of albumen assimilated in a given weight of muscle varies, pro
bably in a great measure on account of the different proportions
of fat muscle contains; but the relation of this assimilated
albumen to the soluble and coagulable albumen remains very
nearly the same in every case, as shown in the following Table:—
           Found in 200 grammes of ox-flesh.                                  In   100.

From which results the fact, that for every molecule of albumen
assimilated or converted into insoluble muscular tissue, an equal
 uantity of albumen is withdrawn from blood into the tissue.
  his mean proportion of soluble to insoluble (or assimilated)
albumen is as 16-97 to 83:14, or l to 4:9, which means that
there is 49, say 5 times as much assimilated albumen in flesh
as in its nutritive fluid.

   Hence the nutritive fluid of flesh contains a mean of rather
over one half more albumen than is present in the solution of
the effete material.  Now it is obvious that if a muscle should
retain a certain composition, which it does within certain limits,
it must draw upon the blood in proportion to        waste. There           its

by such low numbers.        They were obtained by the dialysis of a
certain bulk of the     extract, and determined volumetrically in
portions of the fluid outside the dialyzer, being finally calculated
for the whole bulk of the fluid in and out of the dialyzer.
   The proportion of soda present varied in six analyses from
0-155 to 0-333 gramme in 200 grammes of flesh submitted to
analysis, being about twice as much as the chlorine would require
to be made into chloride of sodium.       Some of the soda is there
fore eliminated in combination with one or more of the organic
acids resulting from the decomposition of the organic portion of
flesh.
    My present object, however, is mainly to show that chlorine
and soda take no part in the actual formation of flesh.         With
this object in view, 300 grammes of sheep's flesh were minced
and extracted with 750 cub. centims. of water, as usual.         The
fibrous mass and dry extract were incinerated slowly with pure
lime, and the ash was mixed with water, in which the chlorine
was determined volumetrically.
    The extract retained in the fibrous mass yielded (by calculation)
0.032 gramme of chlorine, and the fibrous portion 0.035 gramme
of chlorine—the difference amounting to 0-003, or 0.001 gramme
per 100 grammes of flesh, which is insignificant and proves the
absence of chlorine in the ripe or insoluble tissue.
    The experiment relating to the soda was undertaken             by
mincing 200grammes of ox-flesh, adding water to the mass, and
dialyzing the whole for twenty-four hours. The soda was then
determined in the diffusate; and the amount of diffusible soda
retained in the colloid portion was calculated from the volumes of
the fluids in and out of the dialyzer. This was subtracted from
the soda found in the total colloid mass—the difference amount
ing to only 0.004 gramme, or 0.002 gramme per 100 grammes of
flesh, which is insignificant; and   I conclude that the ripe or   in
soluble muscular tissue contains no soda. The object of the pre
sence of chloride of sodium in flesh appears to me to be con
nected with the distribution of water throughout the tissue.
This would be a subject interesting to investigate, and likely
to yield important results.                                   +

    In  the present case the proportion of albumen of the nutritive
material is no less than twice as large as in ox-flesh; and about
two thirds of the amount of this substance present was in excess
of that required for immediate use. The necessity of this large
store of nutritive material in salmon's flesh may be accounted
for by a consideration of the rapid growth of the fish, amounting
in a few months to several pounds during their migration to
the sea.       (I could not ascertain where the fish was taken.)
    The    high   proportion of phosphoric acid and potash in the
effete state is a remarkable                      circumstance,              considering that
salmon is constantly subjected to loss of substance from liquid
diffusion; but this is explained by the fact that phosphoric acid
and potash in salmon, in the effete condition, are not present in
the exact proportion to make a crystalloid potash salt; there is
an excess of phosphoric acid present; and therefore these sub
stances are less crystalloid and consequently less diffusible than
in the higher class of animals.

366        Prof. Clausius on the Connexion of the Second Proposition
   That the second proposition of the mechanical theory of heat
is connected with the principle of least action was also stated by
me, and, as            I
                 subsequently learned, also still earlier by Boltz
mann+.     This connexion becomes, as M. Szily quite correctly
insists, still more striking when the amplified expression given
by Hamilton of the principle of least action is employed.
   But for this purpose Hamilton's equation must not be taken
in the form in which it is usually cited in the text-books of me
chanics and is found, for example, in Jacobi's ‘Lectures on Dy
namics,” p. 58: viz., for a system of material points in motion

 sary condition that with the altered motion the ergal                                             is   to       be
 expressed        by
                the same function                         of

 the  original motion;   while my  equation  remains valid even when
 the function     coordinates which represents the ergal undergoes
                       of
  an alteration. As the simplest case      this kind, we may assume
                                                               of

 presupposes that this quantity with the altered motion has the

 plained this difference between the two equations, and have there
 shown more particularly how far Hamilton's equation would                                                       be
 incorrect for the case       which the ergal undergoes

 M. Szily has not quite correctly understood my notation.
      For the more convenient elucidation           the matter, we will  of
 here confine ourselves                to

ration of the motion and the energy respectively, and denote by
v the velocity of the point, and if we further, with variable quan
tities, indicate their mean value by putting a horizontal stroke
over them, we can give to Hamilton's equation as quoted under
(2) the following                form:—
                                            8(mºi)=ióE..                  .    .       .       .        .        .           (2a)
     In first forming             my equationt             I    wrote         it thus:—

But       I
       did not there employ the letter U as a universally valid
symbol for the ergal, but said explicitly that it only denoted the
ergal for the original motion. In a subsequent memoiri, in order
to show the difference very clearly, I wrote the equation in the
following form:—
                                                          82=                                  logi;
                      #3r+ #&#                       dz           #3;          +mv°8                             .           (3a)
and       I   added,       “The       sum
                                  d   U             dU           d'U
cannot at once be regarded as the variation of the ergal, and
hence, if the signification of U be extended so that it shall re
present the ergal not only for the original, but also for the
altered motion, cannot at once be denoted by 8U.”
   If we assume for example the above-mentioned case, that the
function U contains, besides the coordinates, also a quantity c
which is constant with each motion, but may change         value                                                its

   In order that we may conveniently compare together the three
mutually related equations with which we have to do in the
newer considerations on the mechanical theory of heat, in refer
ence to their applicability, it will probably be advisable to sum
marily recapitulate the differences which prevail between them.
The equation which expresses the principle of least action in                                                   its
original form, and which       our notation

presupposes     that the ergal     representedis       invariable func     by   an
tion     of
         the coordinates, and also that the energy has            invari                             an
able value.            In
                   the Hamilton's equation (2a)         invariable func          an

         is                                                       Lastly,

function representing the ergal are admissible.
   The latter generalization was absolutely necessary for the ap
plication      the theory
               to                        of
                               heat, because, with the changes      state                             of
of of
     abody which there come into consideration, occur variations
    the effective forces which are independent           the space-coor

   Besides this,  other difficulties are met with     the cases                                            to   be
considered          in

                                 heat, which render the immediate
appplication          of
                 the Hamilton's equation (2) inadmissible.
   Equation (2) presupposes that          the material pointsall   the                                    in
system under consideration take for their motion one common
time    which with the change
         i,                         motion changes  of  like manner                    as

PRESENCE           of Arsenic.—The great drawback in the ma

for purification             we
                        must take into account the various uses                                               to
which the acid           is put.
                              to    be     my intention

gases   of sulphurous and hydrochloric acids into the air, alkali
works must bear the blame            polluting the atmosphere with the

still more dangerous substance—arsenious            acid.   Although the

between these and the amounts of arsenic found                the acid ma           in

0-21    to0.31 per cent. arsenic we have acid containing from                                             1   to
1.5 per cent. arsenic, showing that some mistake has been made
in   the analyses.
   Taking, for instance, the analyses      various pyrites given     of                                       in

 372            Mr. H. A. Smith    on some Points in the
      Deposit in flue leading from kilns to lead chamber.—This flue
  when cleaned out presented a strange appearance.            Its length
  was about 20 feet, and, with the exception of about 10 feet from
  the “kiln” end, was thickly coated (and even partially filled) with
  a shining deposit, which on examination proved to be a mass of
  sulphur in a perfectly viscous state, containing (as a mean of four
  analyses) 46'360 per cent. arsenic trioxide.
     When lighted it burned with the ordinary blue sulphur-flame,
 and on inserting a piece of cold porcelain in the vapour, gave a
  deposit of sulphur along with a considerable amount of arsenious
 acid. (See Table II.)
      Sulphuric Acid.—Passing along the flue into the chamber, I
  find the sulphuric acid containing a large amount of arsenic. As
  an average of twelve analyses, 1:05.1 per cent. arsenious trioxide
 is the result; so that in passing through the flue above men
 tioned it must have lost a large proportion of that originally pre
 sent in the pyrites. (See Table II.)       It is from the sulphuric
 acid itself that the arsenic should be removed, as this acid is the
 groundwork of the whole following alkali-manufacture.
     Deposit on bottom of lead chamber.—On the bottom of the lead
 chamber and sometimes on the sides, a grey siliceous mass is
 found, interspersed here and there with clusters of delicate regular
 crystals, the transparent elongated prisms of arsenic acid. The
 transformation from the arsenious acid we find in the flue to the
 arsenic acid of these crystals, has evidently been completed along
 with the oxidation of the sulphurous acid.        In this deposit the
 percentage of arsenic trioxide varied from 1811 to l'9 per cent,
 the rest consisting of sulphate of lead and silica. (See Table II.)
     Hydrochloric Acid—When the sulphuric acid made from py
rites is mixed with common salt in the reverberatory furnace for
the formation of sodium sulphate, the arsenious acid present in
the acid is converted into the terchloride of arsenic, and escapes
along with the hydrochloric acid to the condensing-towers. This
 conversion is very nearly complete, as the amount of arsenic pre
 sent in the sodium sulphate is very small.       In the hydrochloric
acid a mean of    eight analyses gives 0.69 per  cent. arsenic trioxide,
the amounts     varying from 0.589 to 0-911   per cent. (See Table II.)
     Sulphate of Soda.-The amount present in this is very small.
As mentioned above, the conversion from the teroxide to the ter
chloride of arsenic is wonderfully complete, the percentage in the
sodium sulphate being only 0.029 per cent. (See Table II.)
     This still shows us how careful we ought to be in obtaining
pure sulphate of soda for medicinal purposes.
    Deposit in flue leading from salt-cake furnace to condensing
towers.-This flue, about 20 feet long, leads for the most part in
the open air, from the salt-cake furnace to the condensing-towers.

    Air influefrom condensing-towers to chimney.—Not only is
the decomposition  of the arsenic terchloride not completed in the
towers, but a considerable amount of arsenic (in what condition
I am not aware) escapes from the flue leading from the conden
sing-towers to the chimney of the works. The amount of air
passing through this flue was 31,722 cubic feet per hour; and
for each analysis 500 cubic feet were taken. The method em
ployed for collecting the arsenic (trioxide 7) contained in the air
passing through this and the next mentioned flue was as fol
lows:—The air was aspirated through three bottles containing
respectively H*O, HCl, and AgNO”.         The gas was allowed to
bubble very slowly through the solutions; the bottles containing
them were capable of holding 40 ounces, and were about half
filled.  It was found in most cases       might almost
                                                    (it    said               be     in

HCl absorbing      all

    As  an average       of

the 120 grains per day are from the chimney     one works only,    of

                         Section         II.    Methods            of removal.
   Two precautions have to be taken into account in the methods
employed for the removal of arsenic from sulphuric acid.
    1st. The substance or agent which is used in the purifying.
process must have no deleterious effect on any article in the
manufacture of which the acid is required.
   2ndly. We must prevent our works, as far as in us lies, from
becoming a nuisance to our neighbours.
   The item of expense is naturally a matter of course.
   The following purifying agents have been carefully tried, with
the following results.

them, as the bursting of such a retort over a fire carries with it
great danger.  This plan then was thrown aside.      Although it
could compete with any in cheapness, yet it carried too many
inconveniences   with it to become practicable.                       The following
numbers   may  perhaps be interesting:—
            Sulphuric Acid.                           Sulphuric Acid.

   The above figures show that the decomposition was not per
fect enough for the plan to be made use of on a manufacturing
scale.   I had found it to answer perfectly in my laboratory ex
periments, and so hoped that, when extended to the working
scale, it would be equally successful.
   Hydrochloric Acid.—A stream of hydrochloric acid gas was
passed into the acid required to be purified, supposing the decom
position in this case would be similar to the above. This, how
ever, was open to the same objections as the former, with the
additional one that the expense entailed by the process is too
great for any practical purpose.
    In looking over the foregoing processes, one or two natural
conclusions force themselves upon me. The process which, as
far as I can yet see, we must rely upon for the purification of
our acid is that which depends upon the use of sulphuretted
hydrogen.     Precipitation is much surer, and, indeed, more per
fect, than decomposition.   The latter is dependent upon too many
conditions. The heat, the completeness of decomposition of the
salt, the rapidity with which the liberated bubbles of hydrochloric
acid gas pass through the acid,           all
                                           exercise great influence upon
                                                          a
the success     of the process.     Whilst sufficiency      gas  ofthe only is
requisite  in   the former    case,  the latter  depends   upon  too many
causes, too many conditions.             Certainty         in
                                                        this case must                  be

the higher may                    be   clearly heard through the lower.  That the

382     Mr. R. H. M.     Bosanquet  on the Relation between the
effect sought is really a predominance of the upper notes, appears
as well from the statement of the voicers as from some of the
means employed to produce the desired effect.      Thus one organ
builder uses two pipes instead of one throughout his trebles;
others employ a heavier wind in the treble; so that we must
allow that in organ-stops the intensity of the treble is required
slightly to exceed that of the bass. But, allowing for a variation
of this nature (namely, a slight excess in the intensity of the
treble over that of the bass), it seems reasonable to assume that
the apparent intensity of the different notes of a well-voiced
organ-stop is the same.
    The work consumed in an organ-pipe in a given time is mea
sured by the amount - of wind it draws from the bellows in that
time.
    There is a statement in Töpfer's work on the organ (1842,
reprinted 1862, Körner, Erfurt and Leipzig), that when a stop
is scaled according to his measures, and properly voiced, the
wind-consumption of the pipes is proportional to their lengths,
or to the wave-lengths: this law is stated without reasons or
measures; so that some verification was essential ; but before
passing to the verification I will notice the immediate conse
quences of the law, if true.             -
    The quantities of wind consumed by the pipes in a given time
are measures of the work done by the weights on the bellows.
We have to assume that in similar pipes the work converted
 into sound is a constant proportion of the whole work supplied;
for undoubtedly loss takes place in the pipes.       Subject to this,
we derive from    Töpfer's   law the statement that the work con
verted into sound by the pipes of an organ-stop in a given time
is proportional to the wave-length of the tone, or the periodic
time.
    Admitting, then, that the notes of an organ-stop are fair repre
sentatives of a series of tones of different pitch and equal appa
rent intensity, we have more generally:—Tones of different pitch
have equal apparent intensity when the work consumed by them
in a given time is proportional to the wave-length or periodic
 time; or if W is the work consumed in a unit of time, the        in
tensity is measured by the fraction     y   where  t  is the periodic
time—assuming that the intensity in notes of the same pitch is
proportional to W, which will not be denied.
    For the purpose of obtaining some verification of Töpfer's law,
I   employed the new open diapason on the great organ of
the instrument in St. John’s Chapel, Oxford; it draws wind
enough to observe conveniently as far up as about the top of the
treble staff, and is tolerably uniform in tone.      Some difficulty

Energy and Apparent Intensity                of Sounds of different Pitch.                  383
was found   in following out Töpfer's method of observation with
accuracy, until the minutiae which follow were attended to. The
object is to observe the time of descent of the bellows under dif
ferent circumstances.    A pendulum of bullet and string was
employed to observe the time, by counting the oscillations; the
eye was thus occupied.     The points of full and empty were de
termined   by  the feel of the bellows-handle, as follows:—The
excess-valve is placed between the bellows and one of the feeders;
so that, when the bellows is overfull, the pressure of the wind
comes on the feeder, and destroys the equilibrium of the handle,
causing a downward pressure, which is sustained by the hand.
At the moment of closing of the excess-valve this pressure dis
appears, and thus the moment of departure of the observation is
distinctly announced.    A similar sudden change of pressure                                 in
dicates the emptying   of the bellows and close of the observation.
Until this method was adopted it was impossible to obtain the
accuracy required; but with it the accuracy was great, so that,
if thesame element was observed repeatedly, the number came
almost always the same.
   As a preliminary experiment,                       I
                                 observed some time ago the

384              Mr. R. H. M.                      Bosanquet          on the Relation between the
the three middle observations, which agree closely.           This is
easily explained, and the rejection of the observation for our
purposes justified as follows:—The largest basspipesofthe manual
in an organ have almost unavoidably a deficient supply of wind.
 In consequence of the heaviness of the touch caused by large
valves, the valves and, therefore, the wind admitted by them are
limited in size and quantity respectively; and as this limited
amount of wind has to be distributed amongst a number of large
pipes, each has to put up with less than a full supply; and it is
well known that the power of the bass invariably suffers more or
 less in consequence of this difficulty.
    The number for c” is rejected because the quantity to be ob
served is in that case too small, with reference to the method of
 observation, for accurate results.
    So far as the above slight observations went, they appeared,then,
to corroborate Töpfer's law.       But with the view of ascertaining
more exactly how far the uniformity sought for prevails, subse                                                        I
quently observed the wind-consumption of each pipe from tenor
C (co) to treble C (c") inclusive. Several months had elapsed and
the organ been tuned, which must account for the difference in
the relative behaviour of the C pipes on the two occasions.

The   probable  errors of these arithmetic means are appended.
From the near equality of these in the results of the two se
parate octaves, we infer that the estimation by the ear of equal
intensities of tone has about the same accuracy whatever the
pitch may be.
   This discussion establishes almost beyond a doubt the exist
ence of the law of Töpfer as a basis; but the results are affected
by irregularities of a more continuous nature than are to be ex
pected in ordinary cases.   The upper half of the tenor octave,
for instance, furnishes the mean 419, which deviates widely
from      all

whence proceed the following                             propositions:–
     In      notes      of   different pitch the apparent intensity varies                                          as   the

 Energy and Apparent Intensity of Sounds of different Pitch.                                                          387
square of the amplitude, and inversely as the fourth power of
the wave-length or periodic time.
   In series of notes of equal apparent intensity, but of different
pitch, the amplitudes vary as the squares of the wave-lengths or
periodic times.
        In
      some works which allude to this subject, a confusion exists
between the energy of a vibrating instrument, as a string, and
the intensity of the tone produced thereby.    It is necessary to
remember that the energy of the instrument has nothing to do
with the tone heard, as it is only that portion of the energy
which is lost to the instrument by being communicated to the
air that causes the spread of the tone. Thus the energy of a
string set in vibration is gradually exhausted by communication
to the air, and the energy of the string does not represent the
apparent intensity of the tone at any instant, but the total energy
expended during the duration of the tone until it dies away.
Again, in an organ-pipe there is reason to believe that the energy
actually stored up in the vibrations of an organ-pipe in steady
motion is considerable; in fact it goes on storing until the com
munication of energy to the outer air equals the accession con
stantly received from the source of power.       Thus the energy of
vibration within the    pipe  may be much   greater than that which,
so to speak, flows through          We have neglected    it.the fore                                        in

    that parted   with     the surrounding   air. The result     then                                            is
different from that propounded heretofore; for the energy                                                             of

 The Orbs around us: a Series of familiar Essays on the Moon and
    Planets, Meteors and Comets, the Sun, and coloured Pairs of Suns.
    By Rich ARD A. PRoctor, B.A. (Camb.) London: Longmans,
    Green, and Co. 1872.
             are two classes of scientific authors—one   consisting of men
 THEREwho chronicle the results of their researches obtained     by the aid
 of observation or experiment, the other of men who, gathering up
 these results, present them to the public in a pleasing and attractive
 form.    In each of these classes we find men who are justly entitled
 to be regarded as “the leaders of scientific thought,” and from the
 general character of the now numerous works that have issued from
 the pen of Mr. Proctor, the position of “leader of popular astronomic
 thought” may be unhesitatingly accorded to him.
    The work before us contains a series of essays originally published
 in ‘St. Paul's,’ ‘Fraser's,” and the “Cornhill’ Magazines, on spec
 trum-analysis, the habitability of the planets Venus, Mars, and
 Jupiter, meteor and meteor-systems, comets and their tails, the
 sun's corona, and the colours of double stars.       Most of the subjects
 are treated in a lucid and familiar style, particularly that of spectrum
 analysis, under the title of “The Gamut of Light,” and also that
 of “Meteor Systems.”        Musical readers who possess an acquaint
ance with the science of sound will have no difficulty in following
our author in his exposition of the phenomena of the spectrum, “The
 Gamut of Light; ” and his exposition of the connexion between
meteor-systems and comets will at once commend itself to the
 thoughtful reader who can appreciate the difficulty that must have
been experienced by the eminent mathematicians who worked out
the orbits, and who showed the close connexion between the two
great meteor-systems now known to belong to the solar system, and
the two comets with which they are intimately associated.            Occa
sionally our author departs from his more popular style, indulging
in one somewhat more abstruse, particularly in the enunciation of
theories which he has originated; and we find in several instances
a spice of the fanciful, bordering on the sensational, as in such
titles as “the planet of love,” “the planet of war,” and a “minia
ture sun,”—also in the very frequent use of the word “startling.”
as if the sober realities of science were so far removed from the
general track of ordinary thought that the unravelling of the
symmetrically woven web of natural knowledge should be accom
panied by sensations different from that of a deep feeling of admira
tion at the power given to man to read, mark, learn, inwardly digest,
and understand the great book of Nature spread open before him.
    Viewing the book as the production of a recognized leader of
popular astronomic thought, we have marked a few passages in
which we apprehend the author has fallen short of his high vocation.
Speaking of the attempt to secure clearness of illustration with
strict scientific exactness, he says, “Scientific exactness can come
afterwards,” &c.      In one or two instances the author has followed
his own rule (as we conceive) detrimentally.         He tells us that Dr.

Huggins has proved that Sirius is receding from us at the rate of
several hundred miles per second.     Now Dr. Huggins has done
nothing of the sort; his earliest determination of the motion of
Sirius before Mr. Proctor wrote his essay was twenty-five miles per
second; he has since found reason to reduce the velocity to eighteen,
or at most twenty-two miles per second.       Another instance    that                                                 is,

readers would have been really more enlightened had the two limits
              to N.

    However this may be, the method that                  adopted is better in           I
every respect, except perhaps one. Having provided myself with a
grating by Nobert, with 3000 lines ruled over a square inch, I printed
from it on sensitive dry plates in the same way as transparencies for
the lantern are usually printed from negatives.
    In order to give myself the best chance of success, I took as a
source of light the image of the sun formed by a lens placed in the
shutter of a dark room.                           I
                                    hoped in this way that, even if there
should be a small interval between the lines of the grating and the
sensitive surface, still a shadow of the lines would be thrown across
it.    Results     great promise were
                     of                       once obtained, and after
                                                                     at      little                                 a

     UN THE ANOMALOUS DISPERSION EXHIBITED BY CERTAIN
                  SUBSTANCES.      B.Y. M. J. L. SORET.
M * CHRISTIASEN            and M. Kundt have recently published some
         very remarkable experiments upon the anomalous dispersion
that certain substances, such as the aniline colours, permanganate of
potash, and others, exhibit when examined in concentrated solutions.
A prism formed of these fluids between two plates of glass shows a
spectrum wherein the sequence of the colours differs from that of
ordinary substances, blue and violet being less refracted than red.
When performed in this manner the experiment presents a certain
difficulty, inasmuch as the fluids are of a very deep colour, and the
light can therefore pass through but a very limited thickness thereof,
so that the pencil can only be allowed to traverse the fluids quite
close to the edge of the prism.
    The importance of the phenomenon in question will not have
escaped the notice of any physicist; and I therefore conceive it may
prove of some interest to specify a consequence thereof that may be
rendered evident by an experiment which can be repeated without
difficulty. It consists in the inversion of the spectrum. This is
effected by putting the solution under examination into a hollow
prism of about 30°, and placing this prism in a cell with sides of
parallel glass, which is filled with the fluid used for forming the
 solution of the substance with anomalous dispersion experimented
upon. One can then observe the inverted spectrum in a less con
centrated, and consequently more transparent solution, than when
the prism remains in air.     I will cite a few instances.
    Fuchsine, or Magenta.-Take a spectroscope, and having removed
the ordinary prism, replace it by a hollow prism filled with a con
centrated solution of fuchsine.       If one employs an intense pencil
of light falling very near the edge of the prism, one succeeds in
getting a sight of the inverted spectrum without having recourse to
the cell spoken of above—that is to say, when the prism is left in air.
With a solution of fuchsine that is only moderately concentrated
the spectrum is normal, or, in other words, the red is less refracted
than the violet. With a solution of intermediate strength, the spec
trum becomes reduced almost to a single bright red-coloured band;
in this case the inverted dispersion due to the fuchsine is almost
 exactly balanced by the opposite dispersion brought about by the
 alcohol employed as the solvent;          we have deflection without
dispersion.
    If we now remove the prism filled with this latter solution into
the cell containing alcohol, the general deflection of the rays is nearly
entirely annulled, while the anomalous dispersion of the fuchsine
remains; the deflection of the red exceeds that of the violet. It is
no longer required to employ so intense a light, or to let it fall close
to the edge of the prism.
    On measuring the angle of deflection for the solution in question,
 I found, when the prism was in air, that it amounted, for the red
 band, to about 11° 30', but when put into alcohol there was scarcely

396                         Intelligence                 and Miscellaneous Articles.
any deflection of the violet, while that of the red was 15', and that
 of the orange-yellow 23'. With a far less concentrated solution of
fuchsine the deflection of the violet was also nearly imperceptible,
 while that of the red was 6' and of the orange-yellow 16'.
    Hence, for the violet rays, solutions of fuchsine have almost the
 same refractive index as alcohol, but for the red rays a higher one.
    Aniline violet.—With an aqueous solution of this substance, and
with the prism situated in air, I obtained a normal spectrum, wherein
all the colours were visible; the deflection of the red was 10°24', and
that of the violet 10° 43'.       On placing the prism in the cell filled
with water, the spectrum became reduced to two bands (one blue, and
one of a carmine red), which overlapped when the slit of the spec
troscope was not extremely narrow.           When sunlight was made use
 of, there was,      addition,

   From these numbers we perceive how the addition                   substances                           of

 point (quantity of electricity on the unit of surface) is proportional
 to the potential.
    The proportionality between the difference of potential and the
 intensity is easy to verify by means of the mirror-electrometer which
 I   described in a communication on the 19th of February last.                                                One
 of the pairs of sectors of the electrometer takes the same potential as
 A, and a quantity of electricity proportional to that potential; the
 other pair takes the same potential as B.
    Between the poles of a pile, liquid or metallic resistances were in
 terposed; Pouillet's tangent-compass gave the intensities for the
 strong currents, Weber's for the feeble ones.         The electrometer
 measured the differences of potential or tension * corresponding to
 the extremities of various coils of known lengths of telegraphic
 wire. The results which follow are referred to a kilometre of wire,
 equivalent to 100 metres of Pouillet's unit (a column of mercury of 1
 metre length and 1 millim. section).
    The difference between the two poles of a Daniell's element, open,
 is represented by 100.

    If fromtime to time we make a comparative measurement at once
with an electrometer and     a tangent-compass in the preceding con
ditions, the numbers given by the compass, multiplied by a coeffi
cient, will show the difference between the tensions corresponding
to the extremities of 1 kilometre of wire; we shall thus have the
exact value of the total resistance of the circuit, if the elements em
ployed are fresh. That value will only be approached if the electro
motive force of the pile has diminished.
   The use of the electrometer for the determination of the intensities
of currents is known; the results obtained at different periods are
comparable if we are careful to measure at the same time the differ
ence of the tensions at the two poles of a Daniell's element.
   The Daniell's element gives constant differences between             two                                              its

A mirror in the prolongation      of the torsion-thread permitted the
measurement of the displacements of the moveable ball, and, at the
same time, of the torsion of the thread.
   The two balls were at first connected with each other and with
the earth; afterwards they were charged permanently by the nega
tive pole of a pile of Daniell's elements, the positive pole being led
to the earth.
   Here are the details of an experiment, the units adopted being
the millimetre and the milligramme:-

  The equation #1 cos; = nº gives the quantity                          q   of electricity
which is found on each ball.
   d is the distance between the two balls.   To find its value, a tele
scope placed at a measured distance permitted the angle to be mea
sured under which the centres of the two balls were seen; d-32’6
millims, when the two balls communicate with the negative pole of
the pile.

    n represents the force necessary to twist the thread an arc equal
 to the radius. This quantity is obtained by causing the thread to
oscillate after replacing the stick of gum lac by a metallic spindle of
known weight and length. The thread of the balance was 30 cen
tims. long; n=5:47; with the units employed it required a force of
5:47 milligrammes, applied at the distance of 1 millim., to twist the
 thread an arc equal to the radius.
    p is the angle of torsion. The rule being divided into millimetres
and placed at 3:13 metres from the mirror, p=                     #;;   -

               NOTE ON THE SPECIFIC HEAT OF HYDROGENIUM.
                            BY JAMES DEWAR.
    The real specific heat of a substance, according to Clausius,
 ought not to vary with the physical state; and his calculation of the
 theoretical true specific heats of compound gases assumes this con
 stant, in the case of the elementary bodies, to be identical in the free
 and combined state. Kopp's value of the atomic heat of combined
 oxygen is considerably in excess of that of the element, being 4 as
 compared with 2:48, whereas hydrogen is taken as 2.3, nearly
 agreeing with 24, that of the free element. As Kopp's numbers
 rest on the assumption of the atomic heat of a compound being
 equal to the sum of the individual atomic heats of the elements con
 tained in         it,
                  and            as
                            the data are few from which the value                                            of
 hydrogen has been determined, we cannot regard the mere coinci
 dence referred              satisfactorily proving the constancy
                            to   as                                            the                 in

the length of a paper will allow, the bearings of this theory, and
hope to show that it is adequate to account      all,   nearly                               for          or                    all,

 necessarily follow the formation of thick deposits would throw
 it into anticlinal ridges. The same would occur with incoherent
 rocks when they were covered up with limestone—with this dif
 ference, however, that the amount of lateral pressure developed
would be limited by the weight of the superincumbent deposits.

for each foot, no land would rise from this cause above the sea
level; for as the temperature would then increase as fast as the
deposition, as soon as the latter stopped the former would stop
also. This, according to Sir W. Thomson's calculations (“On
the Secular Cooling of the Earth,” Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin. 1862),
would have happened about 11,500,000 years after the cooling
of the crust, or some 88,500,000 years ago; and from that time
to the present, elevations must have been on an increasing scale.
     If
      also the interior heat travels outward at from 13 to “linch
per year, it would take from 46,200 to 60,000 years to advance
500 feet, which is equal to an increase of temperature of 10° F.
Now from the Table we find that an increase of temperature of
10°F. implies an elevation of 1140 feet if the heated area was
100 miles in diameter, or of 1900 feet if its diameter was 2000
miles; so that in the first case an elevation of 1140 feet would
have taken place in from 46,200 to 60,000 years, or at the rate
of from 1-9 to 2:44 feet per century, while in the latter case the
elevation would have been 1900 feet in the same time, or at the
rate of from 3:17 to 4:11 feet per century.       We may therefore
conclude that elevation from this cause        proceeds  at a rate of
from 2 to 4 feet per century.
   Professor Geikie and Mr. Croll have shown that subaérial
denudation is a very slow process, requiring from 700 to
12,000 years to remove a foot in thickness, so that at pre
sent it will hardly affect the elevation; but as the earth cools,
the radiation and conduction outwards will be slower, and
consequently elevation will be slower also; and a time will
come when it will not exceed the rate of denudation, and when
consequently no land can be formed, and the earth will again
relapse into a quiescent globe surrounded by water*.           If we
take the least estimate of denudation, or 1 foot in 12,000 years,
as that which will be nearest to the truth when the land is
nearly      all
            flat,  follows that the elevation,
                       it                            just keeps pace

district (Trans. Geol. Soc. Ser. 2, vol. vii.), Mr. W. Hopkins
showed that if a district is elevated by the upward pressure of an
underlying fluid mass, tension will be produced in the rocks,
which will cause the formation of two systems of fissures—one
parallel to the major axis of the area undergoing elevation, the
other at right angles to        periphery; andits    takes the Wealden           he

is   readily explained                  by
                                 supposing that the cold              the upper          of

 may account for the Himalaya being higher than the Alps, with
 out having       suppose that the nummulitic formation was thicker

410        Captain F. W. Hutton on the Phenomena of the
movements of the surface can be accounted for.     For example,
the Gulf-stream carrying a high temperature into northern lati
tudes may be the cause of the recent elevation of Sweden, while
the cold arctic current sweeping down through lavis's Straits
may be the cause of the depression of Greenland%; for on a
spherical surface contraction would cause depression by decrea
sing the lateral thrust and throwing more weight on to the un
derlying superheated rocks. Again,       explained  Mr. Croll,      if,   as                    of by
the earth should enter upon          cold period,  a    land          higher    all             a
mean temperature than 32° would have              tendency       sink, while
                                                                          a                     to

part  of  North Wales    during the   glacial period,  and       subsequent                 its

effect this.   South Sweden was also depressed when the cold
was most severe, and has since been raised more than 200 feet.
 I    will now proceed              to

        Elevation and Subsidence                            of the Surface of the Earth.                                 411
on, and the contraction of the rocks from this cause would more
than counterbalance the relief of pressure, and subsidence in
stead of elevation would be the result. Where deposition was
going on, the isogeothermals would be rising; but as deposition
is more rapid than the outward conduction of heat, the under
lying rocks would not be able to uplift the incumbent mass,
which being loose sand and mud would render no assistance, and
the area would sink. The underlying rocks, therefore, as well
as the lower parts of the new formation, would be undergoing
compression from forced subsidence, and at the same time ex
pansion from an increase of heat, and foldings and contortions
would be the consequence.
      If,
      now, we assume, what the facts tend       show, that subsi                         to
 dence equals deposition, we can calculate the amount       com                                                 of
pression the underlying rocks will undergo from subsidence, and
the amount      their expansion from the increase

commencing before the old ones had terminated.    The two great
motive powers, alteration     volume and increase  in    weight,                             of
would also sometimes combine, and     other times interfere with  at
one another like cross waves          the surface   onthe sea, and would     of
thus give rise     the  great

 I    will now shortly consider from the stand-point given              this                       by

 by pressure from below, those with their points turned upwards
will      be   driven upwards.
      Cleavage.—Mr.              Sharpe has remarked (Quart. Journ. Geol.
Soc. vol.        iii.   p.   104) that “there are reasons for thinking that
 *   Coral islands would not cause elevation,                           as   they are not connected
with one another.

      Elevation and Subsidence of                    the Surface             of the Earth.                413
pressure could not have been the sole agent in the operation; for
the cleavage did not take place on the first upheaval of the dis
trict, when, the crust not having yet given way, the pressure
might be supposed the greatest, but only after the beds had
assumed their present position and the various anticlinal axes
had been formed.” The Herschel-Babbage theory, however,
entirely gets over this difficulty; for the pressure would not be
so great during the upheaval caused by limestone, as afterwards
when the refrigeration and contraction consequent on denudation
had come into play; for the extra weight thus thrown on to the
underlying superheated rocks would give rise to an upward
pressure which would force dykes into the overlying beds, and
give rise to a cleavage that would either obliterate former ones,
or intensify them where the planes of the two coincided.
   Conclusion.—If the surface of the earth were level and the sea
spread evenly over            it,

         in                                            N.W. and                              in

directions, and the first deposits, and consequently the strike                                                of
the first-elevated rocks, would have these directions also.    The

the present time, but getting more and more irregular; and                                                     I
need hardly say how well this agrees with the observed facts
both of the present disposition of mountain-chains, and the strike
of the oldset known Laurentian rocks.
    Summary.—Mountain-chains may be divided into two classes—
 the one characterized by folds and contortions associated with
 metamorphic    rocks (such as the Alps), the other by slightly
inclined beds associated with volcanic rocks (such as the Andes).
The former class of mountains are owing to heavy masses of clay
                                       i.
and sand having caused subsidence and contortion, and then
 having been subsequently elevated by the superposition of a thick
 bed of limestone.    The         class are owing to the depressions
caused    by deposition  necessitating   an equal uprising in other
 places. Many intermediate varieties also occur, which are owing
partly to one cause and partly to the other.           Such is a sketch
of the   Herschel-Babbage   theory;    to elaborate it in detail would
require a far greater knowledge of the geology of the world than
I  possess. But although it may be shown that it is not in itself
sufficient to account for               all
                              observed phenomena, yet         hope that

if we except a slight variation due to the different proportion of
the space occupied by the insulating material according to the
size of the wire.
    Inlooking into this subject a short time since, I found two
other relations regarding electromagnet spirals or coils, equally
simple in their nature to that we have noticed, but not subject
to a similar anomaly.                   I
                           believe these relations are new ; and
they are certainly interesting, if not of any very great practical
value.
   For the sake of clearness and brevity, it will be advisable to
                                                                                                        it of.

418   M. F. Zöllner                 on the Spectroscopic Reversion-Telescope.
which underlies this instrument, viz. the principle of the reter
sion of spectra, to general use in the determination of the posi
tions of the limes in spectral analysis,                    I
                                              have striven to remove
the circumstances which permit to the reversion-spectroscope,
constructed three years since”, only a limited applicability.
The principal of these circumstances were the following:—first,
 that it was absolutely necessary to employ prisms with direct
vision; and secondly, that the relative displacement of the two
 spectra could only be effected by means of the displacement of
 the halves of the object-glass of the telescope.       In both these
 ways was the applicability of the principle confined to a certain
 very limited portion of the spectrum.       The generally immove
 able attachment of the   illuminating    object (the slit) to the ob
 serving-telescope, however, has enabled us to effect the reversal
 of either the entire or divided spectrum simply by means of a
 reversing-prism with total reflection.      By this the relative dis
 placement of the two spectra is at the same time connected with
 the variations of the angle of the plane of reflection to the optic
 axis of the collimator; so that the mobility of the two halves of the
 objective parallel to the plane of division is no longer necessary.
 The alterations of angle of the face of the total-reflection prism
 can be effected in two ways—either by micrometric motion of
 the prism alone, or by moving the observing-telescope in combi
 nation with the prism.      It would in general be advantageous to
 combine the two    motions,—the    first, micrometric, for differential
 determinations, the second for determinations of position of                                        all
the lines   of   the spectrum with the aid                 of   an   index and        a   graduated
arc.                                                  -
   The reflecting prism can have two different positions     the                                in

        M. F. Zöllner          on the Spectroscopic                 Reversion-Telescope.              419
them appear distinctly side by side like a vernier and scale. For
this purpose we have only to move the arms of the objective
more or less from one another, and not, as before, to shift them
micrometrically parallel to the plane of division after the manner
of the heliometer.
   The reflection-prism is placed in the receiver E, and is move
able in front of the halves of the objective by means of the screw
F. The screw G permits the telescope to be moved round the
axis K, and thereby effects, as remarked above, the relative dis
placement of the two spectra.      The magnitude of this angular
motion can be read off on a   graduated    arc H with the aid of the
lens L.
   At I the rays from the system of prisms enter the telescope.
By means of the screw-thread M the instrument can be com
bined with any spectral apparatus; and for the purpose of ad
justing the refracting edges of the dispersing and reflecting
prism (E), it can be turned upon        longitudinal axis   its
                                                              means                             by
of the annular appendage                     I.
  The Merz spectroscope contains two direct-vision prism-systems,
which can        used either singly
                    be                       combined.     As

                       1st.      Case      of the Compounds of Silver.
   Silver is the basis of the most important photographic sensi
tive substances.    Its iodide, bromide, and chloride, darkening
with rapidity under the influence of the more refrangible rays,
have mainly been the cause of the misconception above alluded
to respecting the tripartite constitution of the spectrum.  It is
necessary, therefore, to determine what are really the habitudes
of these substances.
    (1) If a spectrum be received on iodide of silver, formed on
the metallic tablet of the Daguerreotype, and carefully screened
from    allaccess      extraneous light, both before and during the
                            of
exposure,         developing with mercury vapour
                  on                                             impression            an                       is
evolved       in      all
                   the more refrangible regions.           This stain corre
sponds       character and position
             in                             the blackening effect which,
under like circumstances, would             found          be to
                                                         any common sen       on
sitive silver paper.           this which has given rise
                                   It   is                          the opinion             to
that the so-called actinic        rays  exist  only       the   upper    part in                                of
the   spectrum.             If,

frangible regions.          has    point

                             speak of them as single lines, they
are in reality groups, or perhaps bands.
   The general appearance of the photograph at once suggests
that the less refrangible rays can arrest the action of the day
light, and protect the silver iodide from change. A close exa
mination shows that there are three points, the extreme red,
the centre of the yellow, and the extreme violet, which appa
rently can hold the daylight in check.     There are also two in
tervening ones, in which the actions conspire.       The point of
maximum      protection corresponds   to the  point  of maximum
action referred to above in paragraph (1).

     not necessary that the less and more refrangible rays should

    is
    acting simultaneously. An interval may elapse, and they may
act successively.   Hence the effect      not due    the contempo

                     2nd. Case           of   Bitumens and Resins.
   These substances are of special interest in the history of pho
tography, since, in the hands of Niepce, they were probably the
first on which impressions in the camera were obtained and
fixed.   Their use has been abandoned in consequence, as it
seems to me, of an incorrect opinion of their want of sensitive
ness.    Properly used they are scarcely inferior to chloride of
silver.
    The theory of their use is very simple. Alcohol, ether, and
various volatile oils respectively dissolve certain portions of these
substances.     If such a solution be spread in a thin film upon
glass, as in the collodion operation, and parts of the surface be
then exposed to light, the portions so exposed become insoluble
in the same menstruum ; they may therefore be developed by
its use. Practically, care has to be taken to moderate the sol
vent action, and to check it at the proper time.      The former is
accomplished by dilution with some other appropriate liquid;
the latter, by the affusion of a stream of water.
    The substance          I
                       have used is West-Indian bitumen dissolved
in  benzine,  and  developed  by a mixture of benzine and alcohol.
    The bitumen solution    being  poured on a glass plate in a dark
room, and drained off as in the operation of collodion, leaves a
film sufficiently thin to be iridescent.      This is exposed to the
spectrum for five minutes, and then developed.
    The beginning of the impression is below the line A,          ter              its
mination beyond                H.

incorrectly been referred to the green parts of plants.                  Plants
which have been caused to germinate and grow to a certain
stage in darkness are etiolated; yet these, when brought into
the sunlight, decompose carbonic acid, and then turn green. The
chlorophyl thus produced is the effect of the decomposition,
not   its   cause.    Facts derived from the visible absorptive action
of   chlorophyl        donot necessarily apply          the decomposition

  The production and destruction of vegetable colours by the
agencyof light has, of course, long been a matter of common
observation. Little, however, has been done in the special ex
amination of the facts, and that little, for the most part, by
Herschel.
   We have only to examine his memoir in the Philosophical
Transactions (Part II. 1842) to be satisfied that nearly every
radiation can produce effects. Thus the yellow stain imparted
by the Corchorus japonica to paper is whitened by the green,
blue, indigo, and violet rays. The rose-red of the Ten-weeks
            is,                                                   by
Stock      in like manner, changed      the yellow, orange, and
red. The rich blue tint                          of

establish the   principle  that every  part    the spectrum   displays of
activity, some vegetable colours being affected      some, others                 by                         by
other rays.                is,
                     however, desirable that the general principle
                      It
at which Herschel arrived, viz. that the luminous rays are chiefly
effective, should            be
                       more closely examined.       Some important
physiological explanations turn         that principle.      on
                                                          These so
called luminous rays are such       can impress the retina, which,
                                                        as
like organic colours,       carbon compound. There are strong
                                      is     a
reasons for  inferring  that carbon    affected mainly     rays the
                                                             is                                   by
wave-lengths          of
                  which are between those       the extreme red and      of
extreme  violet, the maximum     being     the yellow.            in
  It       is,
         however,         former experimenter, Grothuss, that we
                                 of to
                                         a
owe the discovery      the law under which these decompositions
of    the colours      of    flowers               take place.         This law        in       repeated    in
stances was verified                     by   Herschel, and more recently                          by   myself.
It  may      thus expressed:—“The rays which are effective
                 be                                                                                          in
the destruction       any given vegetable colour, are those which
                           of
 by their union  produce      tint complementary

accomplished,      sufficient
                       is         prove that chemical effects are not

until the other portions are perfectly bleached.
   “In Sir J. Herschel’s experiments there remained a salmon
colour after the discharge of the green.   This is not seen when
chlorophyl is used, and is due to a colouring-matter in the leaf,
soluble in water, but not soluble in ether.”
    I have quoted these results in detail, because they illus
trate in a striking manner the law that vegetable colours are de
stroyed by rays complementary to those that have produced them,
and furnish proof that rays of every refrangibility may be che
mically active.
  At this point I abstain from adding other instances showing
that chemical changes are brought about in every part of the
spectrum. The list of cases here presented might be indefinitely
extended if these did not suffice.     But how is it possible to
restrict the chemical force of the spectrum to the region of the
more refrangible rays, in face of the fact that compounds of
silver, such as the iodide, which have been heretofore mainly
relied upon to support that view, and in fact originated                    are                  it,

 These actions are not limited           decomposition; they extend
                                                       to
combination. Every ray            the spectrum brings

     The conclusion        which these facts point
                                   to                        then, that          is,

                 restrict the chemical force         the   spectrumof       the

                                                   to                       not                        is

 mislead.
    Whilst thus we find that chemical action may take place
 throughout the entire length   the spectrum, the remarks that
                                                   of
 have been made       the previous memoir (Phil. Mag. August

430                 Dr.   J. W.       Draper on the Distribution of
1872), respecting the difference of calorific distribution in
dispersion  and diffraction, apply likewise to the chemical force.
To be satisfied of this, it is only necessary to compare photogra
phic impressions given by a prism and by a grating.
    I published engravings of such diffraction-photographs in
1844. They are referred to in the Philosophical Magazine
(June 1845).      As they were obtained on silver plates made
sensitive by iodine, bromine, and chlorine, they do not extend
to the line F.
    Ihad found that certain practical advantages arise from the
use of a reflected instead of a transmitted spectrum.       The ruled
glass was therefore silvered upon                     its
                                       ruled face with the amalgam,
copying the surface perfectly. Of the series          spectra,    used      of                 I

which change silver iodide.

     It happened that in 1842 obtained two very fine specimens
                                        I
 of the latter spectra: one of these sent to Sir      J. Herschel; the
other is still in   my  possession.
    In the Philosophical Magazine (February 1843) Herschel
gave a detailed description of these spectrum-impressions.          He
was    disposed   to refer the  appearance    they present to the  phe
 nomena of their films, but at the same time pointed out the
difficulties in the way of that explanation.
    He also sent me three proofs he had obtained on ordinary
sensitive paper, darkened by exposure to light, then washed
with a solution of iodide of potassium, and placed in the spec
trum.      He described them as follows:—
    (1) “Blackened paper, from which excess of nitrate of silver
has not been abstracted, under the influence of an iodic salt.
Produced by a November sun. N.B. View it also transpa
 rently against the light.”
    (2) “Blackened paper, under the influence of an iodic salt,
when no excess of nitrate of silver exists in the paper.”
    (3) “Action of spectrum under iodic influence when very
little nitrate of silver remains in excess in the paper. To be
viewed also transparently.”
    These paper photographs       I still preserve. They are as per
fect as when first made. The different coloured spaces of the
spectrum are marked upon them with pencil. The appearances
they respectively present are as follows:–
    (1) is bleached by the more refrangible rays, and blackened
deeply from the yellow to the ultra-red.
     (2) is bleached from the ultra-invisible red to the ultra-violet.
 A maximum occurs abruptly about the blue.
     (3) has the same upper spectrum as the others, a bleached
dot in the centre of the yellow, and a darkened space in the
extreme red.       The action has reached from the ultra-red to the
ultra-violet.
    In Herschel’s opinion, these effects in the less refrangible
region are connected with the drying of the paper.           It is well
known that paper in a damp condition is more sensitive than
such as is dry.
    But obviously this condition does not obtain in the case of
the Daguerreotype operation, which is essentially a dry process.
    In 1846 MM. Foucault and Fizeau, having repeated the ex
periment originally made by me, presented a communication to
the French Academy of Sciences, to the effect that when a silver
tablet which has been sensitized by exposure to iodine and bro
mine, and then impressed by light, is exposed to the spectrum,

    might
    It                 be      supposed          that this instantaneous expansion                                is
due   to   a    heat-disturbance,                 arising from the absorption     rays                  of

                           Chemical Force in the Spectrum.                                             44.1
that are not engaged in producing the chemical effect.         But
this  interpretation seems to be    incompatible with the instan
taneously following contraction. Though it is admissible that
heat should be instantaneously disengaged by the preliminary
actinization, it is difficult to conceive how it can so instanta
neously disappear.
   When the radiation is withdrawn and the hydrochloric acid
absorbed, there is no after-combining.      The action is perfectly
definite. For a given amount of chemical action an equivalent
quantity of the radiation is absorbed.
   The instances I have cited in this discussion of the mode of
action of radiations are one of decomposition in the case of
silver iodide, and one of combination in the case of hydrochloric
acid.     I
         might have introduced another, the dissociation of ferric
oxalate, which             I
                 have closely studied; but it would have made
the memoir of undue length. From the facts herein considered,
the following deductions may be drawn

    3rd. If the substance is decomposable, those portions of
 the radiation presented to it which are of a complementary tint
will be extinguished. The force thus disappearing will not
 be expended in establishing vibrations in the arresting parti
cles, but in breaking down the union of those which have ar
rested them from associated particles.             No vibrations, there
fore, are originated, no heat is produced, there is no lateral con
duction.
    In actinic decompositions the effects may be conveniently
divided into two phases:—1st, physical; 2nd, chemical.
    The physical phase precedes the chemical.              It consists in a
preliminary disturbance of the group of molecules about to be
decomposed.       Up to a certain point the dislocation taking place
may be retraced or reduced, and things brought back to their
original condition.      But that point once gained,         decomposition
                                                      -

     Imay perhaps illustrate this by a familiar example.                If a

conceive that the laws           absorption and radiation might not

                                 GENERAL CoNCLUsions.
   The facts presented          the former and the present memoir
                                       in
suggest the    following   conclusions:–
   1st. That the concentration                       of
                                         heat heretofore observed                                   in
the  less-refrangible    portion      the prismatic spectrum, arises
                                                of
from the    special action    the  prism,

in   adiffraction-spectrum.
   2nd. From the long-observed and unquestionable fact that
there       is the prismatic spectrum
                 in                        gradual diminution
                                                          a        the                         in

                                                                                 to
                                                                                 a

in the violet, coupled with the fact now presented by me, that
the heat of the upper half of the spectrum is equal to that of
the lower half, it follows that the true distribution of heat
throughout the spaces of the spectrum                               is   equal.        In con
sequence          of the equal velocity of ether-waves, they will, on com
plete extinction by         surface, generate equal quantities
                           a receiving
of heat, no matter what their length may be, provided that
their extinction take place without producing any chemical
effect.
   3rd. That it is incorrect to restrict to the upper portion of
the spectrum the property of producing chemical changes.
Such changes may be produced by waves of any refrangibility.
   4th. That every chemical effect observed in the spectrum is
in consequence of the absorption of specific radiations, the ab
sorbed or acting radiation being determined by the properties
of the substance undergoing change.
   5th. That the figure so generally employed in works on
actino-chemistry to indicate the distribution of heat, light, and
actinism in the spectrum, serves only to mislead.         Its heat
curve is determined by the action of the prism, not by the pro
perties of calorific radiations;      actinic curve does not repre
                                           its

     By referring to the analyses of muscular tissue, it will be seen
that there is a marked difference between the composition of flesh
and that of pulmonary tissue, the mature tissue of the lungs
containing less albumen and much more phosphoric acid than
the mature muscular tissue.               The effete material of the lungs is
very different from that of muscles, the proportion of albumi
noid material and potash it contains being much smaller, and
that of the phosphoric acid is about ten times less.
     In order to establish clearly the difference existing between
 the composition of muscle and lung, I have constructed the fol
lowing Table, which shows the mean results of the analyses, in
 such a way that a mere glance is required to form an idea of the
 relative composition of these two different tissues.

      The most interesting fact brought out in this inquiry refers to
  the proportion found to exist between the phosphoric acid and
  potash effete in muscles and pulmonary tissue—as, while in
  the former their proportion is precisely that of pyrophosphate
  of potash, no such result is obtained in the case of the lungs,
  where the proportions of these substances exhibit no chemical
 relation.
      This circumstance would appear at first sight to clash with my
  theory that phosphoric acid and potash must be transformed into
  crystalloid chemical compounds, with a view to their elimination
  by a physical process of diffusion; but a close consideration of
  the circumstances bearing on the case will show that the pre
  sent discrepancy is very satisfactorily accounted for.                 I explained,
  in a communication to the ‘Lancet' for            February       2, 1867,   how the
  evolution of carbonic acid from the lungs during respiration was
  due to the diffusion of the gas from the blood through the moist
  substance of the pulmonary vesicles, the same theory being given

 446               Dr. W. Marcet on the Nutrition of
  subsequently by Bert (Leçons sur la Physiologie comparée de la
 Respiration, par Paul Bert, 1870).       By passing through the sub
 stance of the  lung-tissue,  carbonic acid must combine with what
 ever free potash and soda it may contain, and consequently
 transform most of the potash into crystalloid carbonate of potash;
 the potash is therefore removed as phosphate and carbonate, but
 mostly as carbonate; while in the case of muscular tissue, the
 potash is entirely eliminated as phosphate.
     Now, does the colloid condition of phosphoric acid and potash
 found in animal tissues exist in soil, or only in plants f This
 is a very interesting question, open to investigation. One thing
 is certain—that the liquid excreta of animals and other liquid
 manures are, as a rule, crystalloids.      Plants take up the material
they require in quantities which have no relation with equivalent
proportions, thereby forming colloids; thus, if soil should con
 tain phosphate of soda and soluble potash salts, plants will take
 up phosphoric acid and potash in quantities utterly at variance
 with their equivalent weights, leaving behind nearly the whole of
the soda as carbonate and chloride.         But I have also reason to
 believe that  crystalloid mixtures are  transformed,   to some extent,
into colloids in the earth.
                  On the Colloid Condition of Plants.
    As a rule, the mineral constituents of plants are very much
 the same as those of animal tissues; they mostly consist of
phosphoric acid, potash, and magnesia, and are very poor in
chloride of sodium.          Now phosphoric acid and potash are
found in a   great  measure in the colloid state in vegetable as well as
in animal tissues. The vegetables I have examined are wheat
or wheaten flour, potato, and rice, selecting those mostly used
as food for man.        It is remarkable that, although the total
amount of phosphoric acid and potash they contain varies,
still we find, after dialyzing for twenty-four hours a mixture
of these materials with water, the same or nearly the same
relation to exist between the colloid and total phosphoric acid
and the colloid and total potash respectively in each of them.
The analysis was conducted in the following way.                   100
grammes, say, of wheaten flour, were mixed with enough dis
tilled water for the whole to be nearly liquid; and this was
placed in a dialyzer which was floated for twenty-four hours over
a bulk of water equal to eight or ten times that of the contents
of the dialyzer. After that lapse of time the volumes of the con
tents of the dialyzer and of the solution outside were determined.
The material in the dialyzer was then dried and incinerated, and
the ash was analyzed for the determination          of the phosphoric
acid and potash.       On the other hand, a certain quantity of the

                              Muscular and Pulmonary Tissues.                                                      447
     flour was carefully incinerated, and the phosphoric acid and
     potash were determined in the ash. A correction had to be
     introduced in the analysis by diffusion, owing to the colloid
      mass still holding a proportion of diffusible phosphoric acid and
     potash, depending on the relation existing between the volumes of
     fluid in and out of the dialyzer. Thus, if the volume of the
     outside solution was eight times that of the contents of the dia
     lyzer, one eighth of the phosphoric acid found outside the dia
     lyzer would have to be subtracted from the phosphoric acid found
     in the dialyzer in order to obtain the correct proportion of col
     loid phosphoric acid. The following Table shows the result of
     these analyses:–

On the Constitution and Nutrition  of Muscular Tissue in Phthisis.
     The state of emaciation to which the human body is so fre
quently reduced in consumption is a certain indication that in
that disease the formation of muscular tissue is deficient; and
it occurred to me that the nature of the change the nutrition
of flesh undergoes in consumption, and the cause of this pheno
menon, might be determined by an inquiry similar to that which
had been instituted with regard to the nutrition of muscular tissue
in health.     Of         all

454               Dr. W. Marcet on the Nutrition of
while there is an increase of material to be eliminated, appa
rently from a deficient action of that process which under normal
circumstances causes its removal.
    2nd. That the state of semifluidity in which tubercular lungs
are usually found after death, is attended with but a trifling      in
crease in the quantity of water beyond the proportion lungs
contain in health—water in the normal tissue amounting to
 79°1 per cent., and in the diseased to a mean of 82.5 per cent.
 At first sight this softening appears to be unacountable; but on
 a closer consideration the fact admits of an explanation.           It
 may be conceived that in the earlier stage of phthisis the
 adenoid (tubercular) cells are held together by a colloid attrac
tion, but that after a time, and under certain influences which
lower the vital power, this colloid attraction becomes lessened
and softening takes place.
    3rd. The relative proportions of effete phosphoric acid and
potash in the three analyses are very remarkable, as they are
found to be quite different from what they are in health.       In the
normal condition, pulmonary tissue contains effete phosphoric acid
and potash in the proportion of 11:32 to 88.68, there being a great
deal more potash than is necessary for the formation of a pyro
phosphate; and      I  explained how the removal of the potash could
be satisfactorily accounted for, by assuming that it was trans
formed into a carbonate by the carbonic acid formed during the
process of respiration.       Now as respiration cannot possibly take
place in tuberculosis where the pulmonary structure is altered, if
my view is correct we shall expect to find in the effete material of
tubercular lungs the proportion between the phosphoric acid and
potash materially changed; indeed, as these substances must be
removed by a process of physical diffusion, we shall conclude that
their relative proportions must be such as to form a crystalloid
body. The mean relation obtained was,

   I have   therefore to point out the singular fact that consolidated
and   softening   lungs in phthisis undergo a process of nutrition
which appears to be closely allied to that of muscular tissue.

nary tissue there is every reason to believe that the potash is
eliminated in a very great measure as a crystalloid carbonate, due
to the action of the carbonic acid emitted from the blood during its
circulation through the lungs. The effete material in muscles
contains phosphoric acid and potash in the proportion of 43 to 57,
and in lungs in the proportion of 11:32 to 88.68.

proportions of colloid phosphoric acid and colloid potash, which
exist in the three kinds of vegetables very nearly in the ratio of
one part of total phosphoric acid to 0:55 part of colloid phos
phoric acid, and one part of total potash to 0:24 part of colloid
potash—thus establishing the remarkable fact that, at       events                                       all

pulmonary tissue, there being a mean of 4:28 of fat in 200
grammes of healthy lungs, and 391 in a similar weight of the

matter from the lungs apparently contains, proportionally to                                                    its

The heated body is no longer a thermometer, but a platinum
wire traversed by an electric current; it does not gradually cool,
but, on the contrary, remains at a constant temperature and
emits an invariable quantity of heat.          Of this the gas takes a
portion, is heated, and                its

and h vary at the same time.      They both vary equally if we
change the initial pressure H. We may make abstraction of the
current (which is here only a means for producing the heat), and
say that r"—r is a function of H and of h which it is the question
to determine.
   For this purpose several series of observations were made
under different initial pressures H (for example 814 millims.,
788 millims., ... 73.9 millims.); and in each case the number
of elements of the pile was varied from 5 to 20, which gave as
many pairs of values of h and r"—r as there were observations.
Taking one of these series (for example, that upon hydrogen
under the pressure of 788.4 millims.), and constructing the
series of points which have for abscissae log h, and for ordinates
log (r'—r), the tracing shows immediately that         these points                         all
arrange themselves        very  regular straight
                                       in   a    line which makes

as part of a communication made to the Royal Society of Edin

of Solar Temperature.” An abstract of Dr. Weber’s excellent
paper appeared in the ‘Chemical Journal’ for the month of July;

temperatures.
   Andrews showed many years ago that,           the case    metal         in                     ofa
forming two oxides       the same physical condition, the number
                                  in
of heat-units generated       passing from the metal
                                            in             the first                          to
oxide was   nearly identical with those obtained    the combustion                 in
of the first oxide itself;     other words, the thermal energy
                                            in                                                              is

                      Carbon at     High Temperatures.                  463
proportional to the number of oxygen atoms combined.                    The
two metals experimented on by Andrews were copper and tin;
but recently Thomson has shown the same law is applicable to
the oxides of nitrogen, and even to the oxides of manganese.
The numbers obtained, starting from the first oxide in the latter
series, diminish by a constant quantity.
     The author has communicated             some preliminary experiments
to the British Association which induce him to             believe the same
law is applicable in the negative direction, viz.          to the oxides of
ehlorine.
     We are therefore justified in concluding that the two oxides
of   carbon ought either to have the same thermal value, or the
 first  one may evolve 15,000 or 16,000 units more per oxygen
 atom than the second.         Taking into consideration the general
 chemical     analogies  existing   between the oxides of tin and the
 oxides of carbon, we may in the first instance suppose the
 thermal value identical. It is to be observed that the fact of
 carbonic oxide being an incondensible gas, and carbonic acid a
 condensible one, does not interfere with the applicability of An
 drews's law, as the total latent heat of vaporization of each sub
 stance would be nearly identical.
     This is confirmed by noting that the following total latent
 heats of elements and compounds do not differ much, although
 their physical properties are very different:—
                    CO°, solid       .   .    .    .  6100
                    SO°, liquid      .   .    .    .  5600
                    N*O, liquid      .   .     .   .  4400
                    CS”     .   .    .   .    .    .  6500
                   Br   .   .   .    .   .    .    .  4000
                   I    .   .   .    .   .    .    .  5500
                    H in Pd     .    .   .     .   .  4200
      As  a fair mean we may accept 4000 units as the absorption
  value   per atom for real latent heat of vaporization; and as the
  latent heat of fluidity in the case of non-metallic bodies is very
  small, we may suppose it included in the above value. Taking
  now the thermal values of the oxides of carbon, we have
                       C, O*      .    .   .     = 96,000
                       CO, O      .    .   .     =68,000
  therefore            C, O       .    .   .     =28,000
   The difference, therefore, between CO,            O-C, O = 40,000 units,
   which must be regarded as the total number of heat-units required
   to raise 12 grammes of carbon into the gaseous state. If we de
   duct from this number 4000 units for liquefication and evapori

zation, we have 36,000 units left to be expended in raising                                                              the

    The mean specific heat of gas-carbon                   between 1040° C. and
20° C. may be taken as 0.32.
    In order to try and find the specific heat of carbon at the highest
temperature we can in any way define with accuracy, a series of
tentative experiments were made with different forms of crucible
to ascertain the shape best adapted for observation with the oxy
hydrogen blowpipe. After a number of trials, a cubical block of
lime, 2 inches in the side, pierced with two channels one fourth
of an inch wide at right angles to each other through the middle
of the mass, was found the most convenient form of apparatus.
The directions of the channels were inclined so as to meet in the
centre of the cube; and in general only one of them passed com
pletely through the mass. The carbon was placed at the junc
ture of the two channels; and two powerful oxyhydrogen blow
pipes had the apices of their cones meeting at this point. After
the interior was at a white heat, the carbon was inserted and kept
as long as possible.             The mass of lime was then lifted and the
piece of carbon dropped into the calorimeter.
    Bunsen's elegant experiments on the temperature of combus
tion of hydrogen and oxygen under a pressure of ten atmospheres
 define the limit as 2800° C.; but in the ordinary oxyhydrogen
 flame the temperature does not reach 2500°C., according to the
 observations of Deville and Debray.
     On several occasions platinum was fused in the lime cube and
 thrown into the calorimeter.               From several concordant observa
 tions the temperature in no case was found to exceed 2100°C.*
    * By transferring fused platinum the following results were obtained:—
 675 grims. gave in one experiment 697 grin. units, and 67 grims, of metal
 gave in a second observation 672 grm. units.             The latent heat of platinum
 was taken as 12 grm. units, and the mean specific heat as 0.042.

..., 21%    Calculating from the highest result obtained at a temperature
         of 2000°C., the mean specific heat of carbon is about 0:42.
         The true specific heat at 2000° must be at least 0:5; so that at
         this temperature carbon would agree with the law of Dulong
         and Petit.      In general the rate at which the specific heat varies
         in the case of the metals may be represented by a straight line;
         and the increment seems to be directly related to the rate of
         variation of the coefficient of expansion.              Now in the case of
         diamond, graphite, and gas-carbon              #,      are as the numbers
         4:32:3:03:33, according to Fizeau;                 and as he has further
         shown      that diamond has a minimum volume at -42°3 C.,
         and that below this temperature it expands as the temperature
         falls, we may anticipate some marked alteration in the specific
         heat at very low temperatures, which Dr. Weber proposes to in
         vestigate.     Of the three varieties of carbon, graphite is certainly
         the most stable at very high temperatures.                 Gas-retort carbon,
         after being used as poles in a powerful electric arc, is in part
         transformed into graphite; and the diamond exposed to the tem
         perature of the voltaic arc passes also into graphite.                   Unless
         graphite or carbon can pass into the form of diamond under cer
         tain conditions of pressure at comparatively low temperatures,
         or is of vegetable origin, it is difficult to conceive how diamond
         could occur if this earth ever had a temperature as high as
         that of the voltaic arc.        Starting from absolute zero, carbon as
         graphite most probably increases regularly in specific heat,
         whereas diamond probably diminishes until we reach —42°3C.,
         and then increases regularly until it exceeds that of graphite,
         which it continues to do until they agree at very high tempera
         tures.      The excess of heat taken in by the diamond accumulates

could define the point where the change referred to takes place,
we   might, by keeping carbon near this temperature, change it
partially into diamond. But                                  all
                                     these questions must remain

mechanism which            he points out as giving rise to volcanic action.
The     theory   of mountain-elevation proposed by C. Prévost was the
only true one,—that which ascribes this to tangential pressures pro
pagated through a solid crust of sufficient thickness to transmit them,
those pressures being produced by the relative rate of contraction of
the nucleus and of the crust: the former being at the higher
temperature, and having a higher coefficient of contraction for equal
loss of heat, tends to shrink away from beneath the crust, leaving the
latter partially unsupported. This, which during a much more
rapid rate of cooling from higher temperature of the whole globe
and from a thinner crust gave rise in former epochs to mountain
elevation, in the present state of things gives rise to volcanic heat.
 By the application of a theorem of Lagrange, the author proves that
the earth's solid crust, however great may be                  thickness, and even         its
if       materials far more cohesive and rigid than those

of sodium, an increment occurs in the volume of the gas. Thus in
two experiments the increment in the volume of the gas, as estimated
from the difference of the volumes in the pipette and the aspirator,
was 1-93, 1.99, the “titre” of the gas (as just explained) being taken
as   l; and the ratio of the sum of the oxygen lost by the binoxide of
sodium (as estimated by titration of the solution of binoxide of sodium
before and after the experiment with permanganic acid) and the
titre of the gas to the titre of the gas was in the same experiments
 2:06, 2:17.    In two other experiments this same ratio was 2:00,
 2:08,-the reaction being analogous to the decomposition of binoxide
 of sodium by ferrocyanide of potassium, and of binoxide of hydrogen
 by permanganic acid, previously investigated by the author.
    Section     III.
                 comprises an account of the action of the electrized gas
 upon a solution of hydriodic acid, strongly alkaline hyposulphite of
soda, polysulphide of sodium, and other substances.
    In the case of the passage of the gas through a solution of hydriodic
acid, the oxidation effected (after a certain degree of concentration
of the acid has been attained) is exactly twice the oxidation effected
by the same gas in a solution of the neutral iodide of potassium.
The mean of 33 such experiments gave l'99 as the amount of oxygen
employed in the oxidation of the hydriodic acid as compared with the
“titre’ of the gas. The individual experiments exhibit no inconsi
derable differences; but the probable error of the result, as estimated
by the method of least squares, is 0.02; that is to say, from these expe
riments alone, without introducing any hypothetical considerations
whatever, it is an equal chance that the true value of the ratio sought
lies between the values 2:01 and 1.97. The value indicated by che
mical theory is 2, with which theory, therefore, the experiments
agree.
     The action of the gas upon          a strongly alkaline solution of hypo
sulphite of         soda is precisely of the same character.    The volume of
gas was measured before and after the experiment; and a contraction
was found to occur equal in amount to the “titre” of the gas. The
mean of twenty-two experiments gave 1:03 as the amount of this
contraction.     The peculiar oxidizing properties of the ozone are
entirely destroyed by           passage through the solution; and
                                its                                                      it   is

2-02 as the value of this contraction; and the mean of 10 experi

ran.” Communicated by the Rt. Hon. the Earl Granville, Secretary
of State for Foreign Affairs.
   This letter described the effects of some severe earthquake shocks
experienced at Khabooshan in North-Western Khorassan.                 On the
23rd December, 1871, an earthquake occurred which destroyed half
the town of Khabooshan, and buried about 2000 of its inhabitants
in the ruins. On the 6th January, 1872, another severe shock de
stroyed the remainder of the town, and killed about 4000 people.
Four forts near the town were so completely buried that not a trace
of them can be seen. It was estimated that 30,000 lives were lost
in Khabooshan, Bojnoord, and the surrounding villages by the effects
of these earthquakes.
   2. “Notes on the Geology of the Colony of Queensland.” By
R. Daintree, Esq., F.G.S.
   The author stated that ALLuv1AL Deposits are very scanty in
Queensland, except on the northern shores of Carpentaria and near
the mouths of the larger rivers. The fossil remains of extinct
Mammalia (Diprotodon, Macropus, Thylacoleo, Nototherium, &c.)
are found in old brecciated alluvia, representing beds of old water
courses, through which modern creeks have cut their channels.
With these mammalia are found shells of existing species.
   Of CAINozoic deposits the most important is called the “Desert
Sandstone” by the author; it consists of horizontal beds of coarse
grit and conglomerate, nowhere exceeding 400 feet in thickness,
forming a sandy barren soil by their disintegration. The only fossils
found in it are rolled fragments of coniferous wood; and its strati
graphical position is determined solely by its resting unconformably
upon beds containing apparently Cretaceous fossils. The author
considered that this deposit formerly covered nearly the whole of
Australia.
   Beds containing Mesozoic forms of fossils, and referred by the
author to the Cretaceous series, occur upon the Upper Flinders.
At Marathon these deposits consist of a fine-grained yellow sand
stone, and below this a series of sandstones and argillaceous lime
stones, containing four species of Inoceramus, with a species of
Ichthyosaurus and two of Plesiosaurus.        At Hughenden station, near
Mount   Walker,  there is a series of calcareo-argillaceous  beds, probably
inferior to those of Marathon,     and  containing   two species of Ammo
nites, with Avicula gryphaeoides, a Pecten, &c. At Hughenden
cattle-station, twenty miles further up the river, numerous Belem
nites are found loose upon the surface. These Mesozoic rocks also
extend down the Thompson River and its tributaries.             The author
referred to the fossils described by Mr. Charles Moore as probably
Oolitic, and stated that it is more than probable that Oolitic and

Mr. R.      Daintree on the Geology of the Colony of Queensland.          475
Cretaceous rocks extend throughout the whole of Central Queens
land, and thence to Western Australia.            On the eastern side of the
dividing range a small patch of ferruginous grit containing Panopaea
plicata, occurs near Pelican Creek; and from Gordon Downs species
of Panopaea, Pholadomya, and Cucullaea have been obtained. These
 beds probably represent a lower horizon than those on the Flinders
 River; and a large portion of the colony east of the dividing range
 is covered by freshwater deposits, containing plant-remains (in
 cluding Toeniopteris), and in their upper part a fauna apparently
 intermediate between the Gordon-Downs and Flinders-River series.
 In these deposits, on the Condamine, Brisbane, and Mary rivers,
 numerous Coal-seams exist. The author supposes that, contem
 poraneously with the deposition of a series of marine beds to the
  west of the dividing range, during the Oolitic and part of the
  Cretaceous period, a vast lacustrine deposit was accumulated over a
  large area to the eastward of the range, to which the sea subse
  quently obtained access.
       Among the PALEozoic deposits, the author distinguished Car
  boniferous and Devonian rocks. The Carboniferous series was said
   to be represented in northern Queensland by an extensive Coal
   field. The upper portion of the series (grits, sandstones, and shales)
   contains chiefly fossil plants, the most abundant being a Glossopteris.
   The lower strata (generally argillaceous limestone) contain Pro
   ducti, Spiriferae, &c. of true Carboniferous type, intermixed with
   scanty and imperfect remains of the above-mentioned plants.               A
    set of fossils from the head of the Don River were said to agree
   with those found in the Hunter-River series of New South Wales.
       Devonian rocks extend from 18° S. lat. to the southern boundary of
    Queensland and for 200 miles inland.         They consist of slates, sand
    stones, and Coral-limestones.       The  upper  portion of this series con
    tains an abundance of fossil       plants, the deposits containing which,
    at Mount   Wyatt,   are interstratified with beds   containing  Spiriferae;
    and other fossils of Devonian      type  occur in beds reached by shafts
    sunk   through  these strata.    In the limestone of the lower portion
    of the series corals are   very  numerous.     On the Broken River this
    formation may be best studied. Gold is found in many parts of the
    Devonian district; and the author entered in considerable detail into
    its mode of occurrence there.
        METAMoRPHIc Rocks were described by the author as occurring in
    various localities.    At the Cloncurry, Cape-River, Gilbert, Peak
    Downs, Black–Snake, Kilkwan, and Goaroomjain Diggings these are
     mica- and hornblende-schists, whilst at the Ravenswood Diggings
     the rock is a granite with triclinic felspar. The latter, which con
     tains more or less hornblende, the author regarded as of metamor
     phic origin. The author noticed the connexion between the presence
     of certain trappean rocks in these metamorphic areas and in the De
     vonian area and the production of auriferous and cupriferous lodes.
        True Granites crop out along the eastern coast of Queensland; and
     these vary much, passing into porphyry and quartz-porphyry ; but
     monoclinic felspar always predominates in them.

  The intrusive TRAPPEAN rocks, which are regarded as influencing
the production of auriferous veinstones in the Devonian and meta
morphic rocks, are noticed at considerable length by the author, and
consist of pyritous porphyrites and porphyries, pyritous diorites and
diabases, chrome-iron serpentines and pyritous felsites; the author
considers that this order probably indicates the succession of these
rocks in time. The veinstones he thinks were probably deposits of
mineral matter from the hydrothermal action which preceded, ac
companied, and continued long after the cooling of the traps them
selves.
   The volcanic Rocks, in the author's opinion, have played a most
important part in determining the elevation and present physical
outline of North-eastern Queensland; they follow the line of greatest
elevation on the main watershed at altitudes of from 1500 to 2000
feet above the sea-level.    The general arrangement of the other
rocks referred to is epitomized by the author as follows:—
   “With the   exception  of the M*Kinlay ranges, a line drawn par
allel with the eastern coast at a distance of 250 miles would include
all the Palaeozoic, metamorphic, granitic, Trappean, and volcanic
rocks represented in the colony, both coal-groups lying within the
Saine area.             .
   “The Mesozoic and Cainozoic systems occupy the surface-area to
the westward.
   “The descent going eastward is first locally a thin capping of
‘Desert Sandstone, next Carboniferous, then Devonian and possibly
Silurian, with patches of metamorphic and granitic rocks interspersed.
   “The chief granitic mass extends from Broad Sound to Cape York,
with an occasional capping of ‘Desert Sandstone.’”
   The paper contained numerous analyses of the various rocks; and
the fossils have been worked out by Messrs. Etheridge and Carruthers,
whose lists and descriptions of them are appended to the paper.

that the duration of collision increases with the mass of the striking
body and almost proportionally to that mass.
   2. Influence of the height of fall of the striking body.—The experi
ments were made with balls of steel, and showed that, when the height
of fall is increased, the duration of the collision is diminished.
   3. Influence of the radius of curvature of the striking body.—Four
cylinders, let fall from the same height upon the plane, were of the
same dimensions and the same mass; but their lower extremities
were spherical caps of different radii; and it was demonstrated that
the duration of collision diminishes when the radius of curvature of the
striking body increases.
   4. Influence of the length of the striking body.—With cylinders of
the same weight, terminated by identical spherical caps, but of dif
ferent lengths, the author found that the duration of collision augments
with the length of the striking body.
   5. Collision between two identical balls.-Here the author distin
guishes two cases:–that in which the ball struck is suspended
freely; and that in which it is fixed to the vertical face, on this
occasion, of the steel cylinder.
   Calling a the duration of the impact of the first ball against the
steel cylinder, b the duration of the impact of the second ball against
the other when it rests against the cylinder, and c the duration of
the impact of the second ball against the first freely suspended, we
have                         b = 3a = 4c.
   6. Collision between bodies of different dimensions suspended freely.
—Of    two balls of different dimensions, the author caused now the
small ball to strike against the large one originally motionless, then
the large one against the small—or, again, a ball against the large
cylinder freely suspended, then the cylinder against the ball; and
he ascertained that, in the collision of two elastic bodies, it is immate
rial for the duration of the contact whether it is the larger or the
smaller of the two which strikes the other.
   7. Numerical valuation of the duration of collision.—The duration
of the collision of two elastic bodies is always very short. To give
an idea of   it,

      SPECTRUM of THE AURORA.  BY Edward                     I.   Holden,

any     magnitude were evident; but a radiated structure was manifest.
     The spectroscope (pocket, by Hawkins and Wales) was first turned
on the full moon, and an idea of the length of the spectrum obtained;
then with a wide slit it was turned on the aurora, and the following
sketch made, which was carefully verified, so that it represents
 exactly what I saw.

      The length M N is what I conceived to be the length of the spec
 trum given by my instrument under usual conditions.                     The violet
 (extreme) rays seemed cut off; and I saw, 1st, a broad and bright red
 band (R), 2nd, a black space equal in width to it (B), 3rd, a green
 and bright band (G) nearly as wide, then a faint spectrum of diffused
 light, and a bright line in the blue (1), then a bright line more re
  frangible but whose colour could not be definitely seen (2). The re
  lative distances for my instrument are kept in the drawing.                I then
  opened Angström's “Spectre Normal,” and saw that he gave the auroral
  line as in the yellow.         I observed this green line again, and cannot
  persuade myself that it was yellow. The black space I am sure of; and
  it was also seen plainly by an inexperienced person into whose hands
  I   put the instrument.        The slit was then narrowed and turned on
  the moon, and adjusted to give the Fraunhofer lines most clearly.
  The aurora by this time was fainter, and I can only be sure of a
  bright line (green) with a suspicion of my former blue line. Opening
  the slit again, the red band of the diffused-light spectrum was close
   against the green bright line. The aurora then faded.                 I mention
   this black space, as it is not what I expected to see from my reading
  of Ångström and Winlock.-Silliman's American Journal, Nov.                  1872.

   of  magnesium    has been considerable till this     morning,     but with very
   pronounced maxima and minima.              It would be   impossible    for me at
   present to make a complete report, which would require much time;
   I shall confine myself to the truly extraordinary last period, that from
   the 25th to the 30th of July. The following are the numbers of
   degrees which express the distances, referred to the margin, of the
   points where the magnesium was visible:—

    We have therefore four days on which the phenomenon was com
 plete; for only two positions of the spectroscope are wanting. As
 1  remarked in the preceding note, the magnesium-lines      appeared
 brighter and broader in the regions where the flames of the chromo
 sphere were more pronounced and brilliant; but I must now say that
 the chromosphere is rather composed not of flames, but of an extraor
 dinary number of slender threads which resemble very fine hair.    In
 the vicinity of the north pole the chromosphere continues to be much
 more elevated than at the south pole.
    Here is another observation which agrees with the great abun
 dance of magnesium, and which I had the opportunity of making
 only yesterday :-When observing the lines b, I can see at the same
 time a portion of the spectrum beyond the line E. After exploring
 about one third of the margin, I perceived the reversal, in two suc
 cessive positions, of Kirchhoff's line 1474; I then recommenced the
                                               round the margin
                                                                                         In of I all
 tour, and found the line 1474 reversed                               the                                                                                 in
 chromosphere, like the magnesium; and         verified the same pheno
 menon again today: therefore the line        the corona can be distin
 guished everywhere        full sunshine.    in the preceding months                                                                                           I
 had observed this line  many   times, but only     the special examina
                                                                                                        or in

     The relative intensity      the line 1474 agrees generally with that

LIX.    On the Heat-conducting      Power of Iron and German Silver.
                   By H. Weber of Brunswick+.
                             [With   a Plate.]
      WITH the exception of the insufficient experiments of Péclet,
 W W
           a determination of the heat-conducting power of differ
ent metals was first accomplished not long since, namely by F.
Neumann, Angström,         and Forbes.       The values found by them
exhibit not inconsiderable    divergencies     from one another, which
cannot be referred    only  to the difference of the sorts of metal
employed.      It appears that they are much rather to be in great
part attributed to the fact that the phenomena, from the obser
vation of which the conducting-power was deduced, were very
complicated, whence great difficulties arose.        Besides, it can be
proved that the theory made use of for the calculation of the
observations, strictly taken, has only an approximative           value."
Indeed neither Fourier's nor Poisson’s theory takes account of
the heat expended for the expansion, and of the alterations of
the specific heat and density with the temperature.           Moreover
the assumption which forms the basis of Fourier's whole theory
has been called in question—viz. that the quantity of heat passing
in the unit of time through a plate which is in a stationary con
dition is proportional solely to the difference of temperatures of the
boundary surfaces; probably it is dependent also upon the abso
lute temperature of the plate.       Lastly, almost greater objections
can be raised against the employment of Newton's law of cooling.
Nevertheless the results derived from accurately conducted ob
servations might still possess an approximative value for many
important purposes, in particular for many problems most inti
mately connected with the mechanical theory of heat; for, to
obtain only a nearer insight into the phenomena of heat, such
approximative results are often quite indispensable.

   Hence, in the determination of heat-conducting power, atten
tion must be directed especially to the simplicity of the pheno
mena from the observation of which it is to be deduced.     Now
this simplicity appears to have been attained in a far    higher
degree by a method which F. Neumann has given in his Lec
tures than by any other hitherto employed, even in a higher
degree than by the one made use of by Angström (described in
Pogg. Ann. vol. cxiv. p. 513), to which Neumann’s stands in
the closest relation.
    The following observations, made according to this method
with the greatest care possible, for an exact determination both of
the internal and the eaternal conducting-power of iron and German
silver, have fully established the superiority here ascribed to                                        it.

  If in  the expression for War, we suppose 6=T, while for Weat,
it is supposed =0, the two expressions will be equal to one an
other. It is the same when 6=T in the expression for

while 6=0 in that for Van ; and     hence, in fact, the final state
of the bar in one period is the initial state of the following”.
   It followsfrom the above expressions that the temperature in
the middle of the bar remains constant during each period, and
preserves the same value in the even and the odd periods.  That
is to say, for       a     =    ; we obtain               from the equations (2), for                           each

pipes k a scoop-like piece of sheet brass was soldered for the pur
pose of diverting the entering water to the end-surface of the
bar.   During the experiments the ends k were connected with
the pipes 8, and the ends A with pipes which carried off the steam
or water, by means of caoutchouc tubing.
   It follows from the theory above given that the most favour
able circumstances for the determination of K occur when the
ends M and N of the rod have simultaneously different tempe
ratures—M being heated and N cooled during the first period,
M cooled and N heated during the following period, or vice versd.
   In order to regulate with facility the supply of the water and
steam according to this arrangement, the levers which turned
the plugs of the watercocks C and D, on the one hand, and
those of the steamcocks A and B, on the other, were connected
by a bar; so that by the motion of the two bars the four plugs
could be put into their right positions. All the cocks were pro
vided with stops, and consequently could only turn within their
normal positions. With such an arrangement, it is easy to see
how the four cocks could be regulated at a distance.        It was
only necessary to fasten cords to the ends of the connecting bars,
two of which were stretched by weights, whereby the plugs took
one of their normal positions; and when the cords at the other
ends were pulled, the plugs were turned so as to take their
second position.     In order to give the cocks a firm support,
each two of them (A and D, and C and B) were let into a piece
of wood, by which     radiation all

                the one hand, steam would have been condensed,

488         M. H. Weber                  on the Heat-conducting                    Power
points.   In the places H and I, at the distances +l and #1 from
the end of the bar, two German-silver wires were soldered to the
iron bar, two iron wires to the German-silver one; and their
ends, at about 6 inches from the bar, were soldered to two copper
wires which led to the same galvanometer as the wires before
mentioned. In front of the galvanometer was a regulator such
that now the conduction to the middle of the bar, and now the
conduction to the places H and                         I
                                       could be connected with the
galvanometer.    Each of the thermo-currents circulating in the
two conductions could be passed in opposite directions through
the galvanometer; and, finally, it was also possible to shut off
the galvanometer and to determine the stationary position of the
needle at any moment.       If the conduction to H and I was con
nected with the galvanometer,    the intensity of the thermo-current
circulating in this circuit was evidently proportional to the dif
ference between the temperatures of H and I. The bar and the
cocks were in a room by themselves, the galvanometer and the
two steam-boilers were in two adjoining rooms.          The pipes for
steam and water were carried       through   the  dividing wall, and
wrapped tightly round with strips of cloth and tow.           In this
manner any considerable alteration of temperature of the air
surrounding the bar during the experiments was avoided.
                  The Galvanometer and                        its    Employment.

sensitiveness+.            The length           of   the needle was 100                millims.; and
the multiplier had             a    resistance    of  0-59064x lolo millimetres
                                                                      second

temperature       of               C.
                          When the galvanometer was shut off,
                          10°
the arresting-power was      great that the needle returned from

deflections     12°            to       rest after two oscillations.
Hence the     logarithmic decrement      could not        determined                   be
immediately from the diminution         the arc      oscillation, but             of

known resistances were inserted. For            the following value    it
was   found:—
                                            X   = 4.2458.

The quantity a had been determined after the method given by
Poggendorff".     As the above galvanometer (constructed by
myself) had perfectly regular coils, and care had been taken to

A motion of the needle then commenced, variable with the time 8.
The forces on which this motion depends are (1) the horizontal
component of the earth's magnetism, (2) the deadening force,
(3) the force exerted by the thermo-current upon the needle.

third force, we must consider that the intensity of the thermo
current is a quantity which varies with the time, whereby an
induction of the current upon itself is occasioned, and the con
sequence is a diminution of the intensity.        For, let i be the in

   From this it follows that the intensity i actually present in

C and C'   here denote two integration constants.  From this we
perceive that the motion of the needle is composed of two mo

that of the surrounding air was not perfectly constant, as it
should have been according to the theory, but that variations

theory with what takes place in reality, or in the place where the
middle wires were soldered to the rod not coinciding exactly

IN that Decker’s work left no doubt “that         to him must be
assigned the credit of having been the first foreigner who pub
lished Briggian logarithms, an honour which has always been
hitherto assigned to Vlacq.”    This sentence requires some mo
dification, or at        all

were regarded than the eagerness with which the Rabdologia was welcomed.

my former paper, 1820 is a misprint for 1620.        With reference
to the remark of Norwood about Vlacq’s work, quoted in the
note on p. 301, I may add that                        I
                                      have since seen the first edi

in question occurs in the “advertisement to the Reader.”      It has
occurred to me that Norwood’s remark was intended to apply
rather to the prefixed Trigonometry &c. than to the Tables; and
if this is the case, there is some justification for                               it.

   The nitrates to which this particular method of determining
chemical activity applies must, as necessary conditions, be capable
of perfect desiccation and actually amenable to the influence of
the oxychloride. It was also advisable to exclude the nitrates
derived from ammonia, amines, and amides, inasmuch as the
employment of these would have rendered indispensable a pre
liminary inquiry into the phosphamides—bodies whose formulae
are for the most part at present unknown, but which would
almost certainly occur, and have to be quantitatively determined
in a mixture already sufficiently complex.            Omitting baric
nitrate, upon which, when it is dry, phosphoric oxychloride is
without action, there appears, then, reason to believe that a can
 be satisfactorily valued in eight instances only.
    Apparatus.-The preparation of a supply of air free from
 every trace of moisture is a well-known difficulty which has
 seldom been very satisfactorily overcome.        For the purpose of
 these experiments an apparatus was eventually constructed
 which was found to answer every requirement. Seven glass
 vessels were filled to about one third of their capacity with pumice
 free from chlorine and supersaturated with               vitriol, and            oil   of
 were connected with caoutchouc tubing both          each other and          to

  I  now proceed to the description of individual reactions.
                                     Argentic Nitrate.
   The ordinary commercial salt not unfrequently contains
copper and some sulphate derived from the incompletely puri
fied hydric nitrate employed in                 its
                                     preparation.   The salt actually
used  in these experiments was made                     by
                                              precipitating  argentic
chloride from the commercial nitrate, washing repeatedly with
hot aqueous sodic acetate, and reducing the chloride           fusion       by
with  a mixture          of
                    sodic carbonate and chloride.       The silver so
obtained was dissolved      specially prepared commercial hydric
                                         in
nitrate containing but little sulphate; and the solution, after
evaporation      dryness, was fused and crystallized from alcohol.
In  this way    all to
                   the ferric nitrate was decomposed and removed
simultaneously with the argentic sulphate.            Desiccation   and
crystallization from water completed the purifying process.
    This nitrate,        as
                       was the case with each      its successors, was

                                    to                  cool over oil of
vitriol. When brought into contact with the oxychloride, there
was   a slight increase       temperature; and chemical action was

      Between 100° and 110° the latter distilled over almost entirely.
      If the temperature were raised much beyond this point, it was
      noticed that, at some part of the intervall 18°–125°, a little orange
      coloured gas would be eliminated.      The bare occurrence of this
      secondary reaction could not always be avoided.            short time                              A

                                      Plumbic Nitrate.
     A specimen of plumbic nitrate obtained by three crystalliza
 tions of a commercial sample (the mother-liquor being rejected
 at each operation) was found to be sufficiently pure. By evapo
 ration with hydric sulphate it appeared to contain 62-61 per cent.
lead, theory requiring 62-55 per cent.     On account of the tena
city with which this salt retains a small percentage of water,
even at 100°, it was powdered finely and heated in an air-bath
to 180°-185° during an interval varying from eighteen to forty
two hours. The reaction-tube generally received                supply                   its                  of
nitrate    atthe latter  temperature,   after which     was closed im          it

true, under the experimental conditions, the residue would con
tain no chlorine, it would be neutral to wet litmus, and, in any
case, would weigh less than the original nitrate (for a total
attack, 0.8534 of the nitrate).                   The above results, however,
agree with neither of these suppositions.
                                    Thallous Nitrate.
   The. thallous nitrate employed was free from sulphate and
thallic salt; 1.2045 grim. of it yielded 1-1358 grim. sulphate
 =94:30 per cent. (theoretically 94.72 per cent.). For experi
ment it was dried for several hours at 156° and cooled in the
desiccator.
    Phosphoric oxychloride hardly acted on thallous nitrate in the
cold; but at 45°         a yellow coloration was observed, which became
red at    71°–75°,         with turbidity.           At 75°–80° the maximum
change occurred, and a gas, having the unmistakable colour of
nitric peroxide, was given off freely.                Soon afterwards the reac
tion ceased. It was             noticed,    however,    that on raising the tem
perature to     116°-118°5,            a very small    quantity    of a greenish gas
was evolved, apparently chlorine.                     Each operation occupied
rather more than an hour. The residue had a very pale yellow
tint with a white border, and on the addition of water disengaged
heat.    Its aqueous solution gave a brown precipitate with am
monia. The course of analysis differed in no respect from that
pursued in the       case     of the lead salt.

   The        of the above percentages over the proper amount
          excess
is doubtless owing to the whole of the chlorine found having
been calculated as dichloride, whereas, on account of the slight

   When water was added to the residue, the evolution of heat was
very decided (being much greater than in the case of the three

                                    Potassic Nitrate.
    The starting-point in the preparation of this nitrate was hy
dropotassic tartrate.             The tartrate, after two crystallizations, was
dried, ignited, and extracted with dilute aqueous hydric chloride
 (during which process some hydric sulphide was disengaged).
On evaporation of the solution and addition of more hydric chlo
ride, potassic chloride was deposited; and this salt, after wash
ing with concentrated aqueous hydric chloride, was dried, and
subsequently evaporated with hydric nitrate that had been dis
tilled below the boiling-point.                     When the preparation       was
attempted by directly treating the ignited tartrate with hydric
nitrate, the product contained sulphate.                  The sample referred to
below contained an infinitesimal trace of                chloride,  but was other
wise pure; on evaporation with aqueous hydric chloride it yielded
 73-70 per cent, potassic chloride, 73.75 per cent. being the
number required by theory. The nitrate was dried for several
hours at a minimum temperature of 160°.
    Phosphoric oxychloride gave rise to immediate action. At
40°-54° the mass in the reaction-tube became flesh-coloured and
viscid, apparently giving off chlorine and nitric peroxide as the
temperature increased.                 At about 92° the liquid state was re
stored, and perfect decoloration took place at 102°.                   These phe
nomena are       remarkably          similar to those observed with the sodium
salt.    The mean duration of an experiment was nearly an hour
and a half.

otherwise proceeding as in the case of potassic nitrate. In order
to ascertain          its

85 per cent. of plumbic nitrate usually escapes the reaction un
injured, prevents moreover the useful employment of that com
pound.    Argentic nitrate was therefore selected.
   30 grims. of argentic nitrate and 23 cubic centims, oxychloride
were placed in a bulb, which communicated by means of an
elongated neck with three U-tubes.         The first of these was of
small size and immersed in cold     water;   the second was larger,
and covered with ice and  salt;  the last and remotest was plunged
in a mixture of ice and hydrous calcic chloride, the temperature
of which   was –35°.     The interior of this apparatus had been
carefully dried. The bulb was placed in a water-bath, the heat
of which was raised gradually. On observing the phenomena
presented during the reaction, it was found that they sensibly
agreed with what have already been recorded in this paper.       A
very little oxychloride escaped from the bulb-apparatus, and was
retained by the first two U-tubes.     In the third U-tube about
1-5 cubic centim. of a tawny distillate had collected;      vapour             its

 stantly unlike in their power of producing a residue in which
 chlorine and that oxide are relatively retained.   The numbers to
 which a corresponds are ratios; and the formal process whereby
 they are obtained may therefore be termed “ the method of
 ratios.”   It must be distinctly understood that a is a ratio and
 not an absolute quantity; it may be compared to interest, while
 the nitrate corresponds to a stock from which interest has been
 derived.    The dynamical use that can be made of a nitrate is re
 presented by the symbol a. The data from which a has been
 deduced (namely, certain weights of argentic chloride and mag
 mesic pyrophosphate)    are, if singly considered, new with each
 experiment; they depend on time, rate of heating, the state of
 division of the nitrate, and on the incidence of other and even
 minuter conditions. But assuming the results to have been
 brought about under a law of chemical action, the value of a
 must be independent of those circumstances, which could only
 pari passu affect the primitive numerator and denominator; it
 is cssentially related only to the actual occurrence of the reac
 tion. This is very well shown in the case of baric nitrate, from
 which neither chloride nor phosphate was obtained, and hence
 a =0, in accordance with which result it is found that no other
 substance was formed; in other words, no reaction occurred.

 weight) of a nitrate, and             Q= 3.

Tl” (NO”)* cannot be admitted into the series X, because it con

into account one half of Tl” (NO”)*, the actual symbolic value, it
becomes necessary to represent the double energy of thallous
nitrate by doubling the experimental value of a, which then
becomes 876.     This argument is justified by the natural posi

proportioned to symbolic value.     It is further sufficiently appa
 rent that (excepting rubidic nitrate) a and X increase and dimi
nish in the same general order.
    Assuming the correctness of this law, and a possible small
interference with it for each nitrate, the occurrence of somewhat
wide variations from the mean value of a in the case of plumbic
and argentic nitrates, while in the case of nitrates of lower sym
bolic value that variation is very small, meets with an evident
and satisfactory explanation.
    (4) The quotients Q represent the weights of nitrates which
correspond to the unit of elective attraction. They are therefore
strictly equivalent numbers in the legitimate sense of that term.
Within the limit of experimental error they constitute an incom
plete arithmetical series, the most probable value of whose first
term, as determined by the method of least squares, is 6:258; so
that Q=m6'258, m being integral. Such a series is already known
to chemistry. The following remarks”, containing the first an
nouncement of         its
                      existence, are evidently applicable       my own                       to

              a
better seen by twilight or gaslight than in full daylight. The
phenomenon, however, is by no means so well observed by this
method as by means of a board and shutter, owing probably
to the illumination of the retina not being sufficiently instan
taneous.
   Professor Young, in explanation of the phenomenon noticed
by him, suggests the idea that a nerve-current from the eye to
the brain may, on reaching the brain, suffer partial reflection
back to the eye, and thence again to the brain, and thus give
rise to a second sensation.        It being now, however, ascer.
tained that the colour of the recurrent image is entirely different
from the colour of the light which produces        this explanation                    it,

   In conclusion would remark upon the apparent analogy
between the phenomenon of recurrent vision and that of in
duced currents in electricity.  A nerve-current in one kind of
nerves  appears  to induce nerve-currents in the other kinds in a
manner analogous to that by which a current of electricity in one
conducting wire induces currents in parallel conducting wires.

the cells there must be other balls, of invariable volume, as fric
tion rollers. These would rotate freely; but their centres of
gravity, in insulating media, would merely be displaced by
clastic yielding of the cell-wall; in conducting media, on the
contrary, at every displacement they must suffer a resistance
similar to friction in a viscous liquid. The transference of motion
between these balls would be effected only through the adhesion
of their surfaces to one another. Displacement of the last
mentioned balls gives dielectric polarization of the medium;
streaming of the same, an electric current; rotation of the
elastic balls corresponds to the magnetizing of the medium, the
axis of rotation being the direction of the magnetic force.
   Now, although the idea of such a molecular structure of the
space-filling aether may be repugnant to our imagination as too
artificial, yet the hypothesis of Maxwell appears to me very im
portant on this account—because it proves that there is nothing
in electrodynamic phenomena to compel us to attribute them to
an entirely anomalous sort of natural forces, to forces depending
not merely on the situation of the masses in question, but also
on their motion. Indeed, out of the assumption of those reac
tions of the volume-elements of the aether upon each other
which Mr. Maxwell has assumed, a complete and mathematically
very elegant theory of       all
                          electric phenomena (magnetic, electro
dynamic, and induction) can      developed; and the same theory
                                        be
also gives   an   account   of   the phenomena             of   light.
   On the other hand, M. Weber's theory derives the explana
tion  of electrodynamic    actions from distant forces          peculiar       of  a
kind, acting between the points        the electrical masses, and de

    Under these circumstances, however, the values of the forces
must necessarily contain second differential quotients of the co
ordinates, because the sum of the force-components correspond
 ing to the individual points and axes of coordinates, each mul
tiplied by the corresponding component of the velocity, must be
equal to the differential quotient of the potential energy, taken
according to the time; and the latter, under the condition pre
supposed, necessarily contains also the second differential quo
tients of the coordinates according to the time.
    In relation to complete cyclical processes, M. W. Weberº has
proved that his assumption concerning the value of the electric
forces admits no production of work without a corresponding
expenditure of forces capable of producing                                          it.

as much ; so that we can make                             it   as great as we please,      in spite
of continually increasing distance of the acting mass.                                     We have
here, therefore, by no means to do with actions at molecular
distances, but with distant actions of the Weberian forces.
                         I
   The case previously indicated, in which the mass a attains
infinite velocity, rests on the fact that this must always happen
as often as, under the action of an accelerating force, it arrives
at any place where the coefficient (u-pe) representing the mass
becomes =0, because the mass zero receives infinite acceleration
from a finite force.     Besides, in the present memoir, I have
shown that neither is it necessarily at molecular distances that
this takes place, nor does it require an infinite initial velocity, if
only sufficiently large electrical masses are chosen, and if upon
the whole path of the two masses an exterior force acts which
impels them towards each other and is powerful enough to over
come their electrostatic repulsion.
   The objections raised by W. Weber against one of the physi
cally impossible consequences which, in my earlier memoir, are
deduced from his theory are thus removed.
   In his most recent electrodynamic researches, M. C. Neu
mann has expressed his concurrence in Weber's objections, and,
for his own part, has endeavoured to remove from the theory
the deficiencies pointed out by me, in that he has introduced
an alteration into Weber’s expression for very small distances.
From what has just been said it is evident that such an altera
tion cannot obviate the physical impossibilities mentioned.
   Also, for electric currents, no introduction of molecular pro
cesses, motions, or forces can get rid of the unstable equili
brium, because when the dimensions are increased n-fold and the
electric densities unchanged the work-equivalent of the mole
cular processes increases only as           but that           n°,
                                                           the potentials     of
                   n°,
               according       whether they proceed from surfaces

    spaces;       that the latter,

tricity, always obtain the preponderance with             sufficient aug.     a
mentation. When everywhere equal quanta                      positive and      of
negative electricity move         opposite directions, the quantities
                                              in
p,  vanish, but the electrodynamic potential (–Q) may become
less than zero.    That such distribution        aelectric densities andof
currents may occur has been shown            my earlier memoir, quite
                                                                 in

nitrogen gives only one spectrum; (2) that this is the line-spec
trum; (3) that the fluted spectrum of the first order is due to oxides
of nitrogen, formed under the influence of the electric spark.
    2. First experiment.—The first experiment which I made with
respect to the spectrum of nitrogen, was a repetition of an experi
ment of Secchi, who found that in different sections of the same
tube three different spectra of nitrogen might be obtained. A
vacuum-tube was made exactly according to Secchi's description,
filled with nitrogen and exhausted. To my astonishment the tube
showed, even in            its
                         widest parts, only     spectrum    a lines.   No accu    of
rate measurements were taken             the time, but the spectrum was
                                                  at                                                             no
doubt that       of
                  the second order described
                                                                   by
                                                      Plücker. Suddenly, and
while was looking through the spectroscope, the spectrum changed,
      I
and the well-known fluted bands appeared. The first spectrum
could now easily             be
                           obtained               by
                                           introducing       Leyden jar      a the                         in
circuit. The spark very soon ceased              pass, and  to  was then found    it
that the tube was leaking.
   3.    The behaviour            of
                             this tube       once suggested the idea that the

presence     of air was necessary for the formation             the fluted spec       of
trum.       It   well known that the oxides

passing the electric spark through air, and the resemblance which
this spectrum bears           the spectra                   of                        of

   As the measurements were taken merely for the sake of reference,
they do not lay claim to great accuracy.
   The true spectrum of nitrogen is easily recognized by a very bright
green line followed at a small distance towards the more refrangible
parts by a green band; it also contains some violet bands, which are
not shaded. The position of the principal lines was read off; their
wave-lengths, as determined by Dr. Marshall Watts from the measure

   5. Description of apparatus.-The tubes generally used had two
  ockets, A and B, into which small pieces of metallic sodium were
introduced by means of the tubes C and D. The tube C was con
nected with the receiver containing the nitrogen, whilst the tube D
was connected with the air-pump.        The nitrogen was generally pre
pared by the combustion of phosphorus in air.          After a few hours'
standing, when            all
                    the phosphoric acid formed had been absorbed, the
gas became quite clear and was ready for use. This mode                pre           of

found sufficient.   Other modes       preparing the nitrogen were tried,

had been exhausted, the communication with the receiver containing
the nitrogen was opened, and the gas was allowed           pass through    to             it
for some time while the pump was being worked. The tubing con
necting the tube with the receiver was then clamped air-tight, and
the tube was exhausted.

    The sodium was next heated until it presented a clean metallic
surface. The light which the tube now emitted was bluish white, and
much fainter than before; and the whole appearance of the spectrum
had changed to that of the second order with                characteristic                      its

trum became      brighter,   but remained the same      character.    New               in
nitrogen was then led into the tube, and after exhaustion the old fluted
spectrum again appeared; this was, however,            once changed into               at
                        by

   The principal object of the author was to draw attention to the
fact of the occurrence of numerous sea-shells in a lower boulder

and composition       any clay    as   met with along the shores

pressibility of the unit of volume have hitherto been but little
studied.    It is true, however, that Wertheim has demonstrated, or
at least has shown it to be very probable, that for homogeneous
bodies the coefficients of cubic extension or compression are the
same as those of linear extension or compression. He has, moreover,
shown that this opinion was confirmed by M. Regnault's experiments
on the compressibility of copper, of brass, and of glass.
   Probability is also in favour of the accuracy of Wertheim's law.
For if the two coefficients of extensibility, linear and cubic, were not
the same, this ought also to be the case with the two coefficients of
elasticity; and it would follow that the velocity of propagation of
sound is not the same in a rod and a ball, both of the same substance
and perfectly homogeneous in          directions.           all

    Consequently the quantity of heat employed in the dilatation of
the iron is to the total quantity absorbed as 4.81 to 49.140, or as 0.98
to 10000.
    If we have merely to determine this ratio, the knowledge of which
is sufficient for the solution of various questions of theoretical physics,
it is not necessary to have more ample data respecting the coefficient
of extensibility a, because this vanishes, being a factor common to
both the numerator and denominator of that ratio.

     The numbers under A give the quantity of heat become latent,
  expressed in ten-thousandths of the total heat absorbed. This por
  tion is only a very small aliquot part of the total heat absorbed—and
  that not only for solid bodies, but also for water.              We can thus ex
  plain to ourselves why all endeavours to raise the temperature of a
  solid body by compression have hitherto been vain. We also under
   stand why the latent heat of extension exerts so little influence on the
  specific heat of the atoms of solid bodies.—Bibliothèque Universelle,

  EXPERIMENTS             ON COLLISION      WITH BALLS OF DIFFERENT METALS.

  have investigated the conditions of collision in one and the same
  substance placed in different conditions.              The substance employed
  was steel as hard as glass, which is elastic to the highest degree.                I

    In the present note I communicate the results I have obtained for
collision with balls of different metals.
    The method of experimenting was the same as that which I
described in my previous memoir. The weight of each of the balls
was the same ; and they fell from the same height upon the flat and
well-polished face, as hard as glass, of a solid cylinder of steel. The
balls not      all
